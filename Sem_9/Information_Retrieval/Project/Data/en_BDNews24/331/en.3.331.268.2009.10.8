 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has ordered the government to stop illegal filling of the Turag and Buriganga rivers skirting capital Dhaka. It also instructed the government to submit a report on the sites of the rivers where illegal occupation and land filling were ongoing. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority chairman, director general of the Deaprtment of Environment, Dhaka district's deputy commissioner and Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner are to submit the report by seven days. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Siddiqui gave the orders on Thursday in response to the petition filed by the Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights and environmental organisation. The court has set next hearing for Oct 26. The petition filed on Tuesday by advocate Monjil Morshed sough court orders on the government and action against the perpetrators. The writ petition mentioned the May 24 High Court order on the government to take effective measures against erection of temporary or permanent installation on the Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Balu and Turag rivers surrounding Dhaka. But, the petition said, land filling is still going on at Turag River despite the order, referring to a newspaper report on the issue. Morshed told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that the High Court had ordered the government and its agencies to stop land filling in rivers around Dhaka, but they did not and so, the Turag is being land filled because of the inaction. The court on June 25 ordered the government to accurately demarcate Dhaka's river system within four months to protect the boundaries of the city's major rivers. It ordered the work to start no later than July 1. It had directed the deputy commissioners of Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Munshiganj to demarcate the river boundaries, to prevent encroachment, after carrying out Cadestral Surveys. The court also ordered the environment secretary to declare the four rivers 'ecologically critical zones'. On June 05, youths from different non-governmental institutions formed a human chain in front of the National Press Club demanding steps to free the rivers, especially Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag and Balu, of encroachment and pollution. The programme was arranged by Green Voice, a youth forum working on environmental issues The BIWTA launched a drive from June 03-07 to remove illegal structures encroaching on the banks of the river Turag. The High Court on May 24 ordered the government to take effective measures against erection of any installationtemporary or permanenton the banks of the Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Balu and Turag rivers. The court also prohibited encroachment and land filling of all sorts on these rivers surrounding Dhaka.
