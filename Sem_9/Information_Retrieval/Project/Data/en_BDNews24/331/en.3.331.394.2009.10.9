 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP has expressed strong reservations about the amendment to pubic procurement law, as it believes the changes will open the floodgates to corruption and partisanship in government procurement. BNP leader Osman Faruk convened a news conference at BNP chairperson's political office in Gulshan on Friday to say that the change was an irrational and ill-motivated effort on the part of the government. "Through the proposed amendments nothing will be achieved but misuse of government fund, uncertainty of qualitative standard in development projects, lack of transparency and good governance." "The government has brought these amendments to create loopholes to loot people's properties," Faruk, a former education minister in the 2001-06 BNP government, said. The BNP leader asked the parliament and the relevant parliamentary standing committee to revoke the amendments. The cabinet on Monday approved a number of amendments of Public Procurement Act-2006, introduced by the BNP-led government to ensure transparency in the public sector. For jobs up to Tk 2 crore, contracts will be awarded through lottery without any insistence on pre-qualification, which, many fear, would offer outlets to ruling party adherents. "The Act plays a crucial role in good governance," Faruk said. "The amendment regarding 'inexperienced' contractors to award public work orders worth up to Tk 2 crore will allow any inexperienced, new companies and those backed by the ruling party to get work order. "By amending the Act's provision of 'less than five percent price proposal than the estimated price will not be acceptable' the government will be deprived of getting the most convenient services at the lowest price." Thanks to the amendment of selecting contractors through lottery, many unqualified contractors will get jobs, Faruk said. "We have come to know the development partners have already opposed the 'irrational' amendments. "The nation wants the government to be firm on this issue for the sake of good governance and welfare of the country," the BNP leader said. Faruk said the government was not concentrating on resolving the crucial problems like price hike of essential commodities, sluggish economy, power outage and deterioration of law and order. Another BNP leader M K Anwar said due to the amendment the administration will have to be loyal to a particular party. "There won't be any accountability in the submission of tender up to Tk 2 crore." He alleged tender terrorism and extortions are raging across the country, because of which the government is not being able to implement Annual Development Programme. "The GDP growth and export also decreased and there is no investment. The foreign exchange earnings by the readymade garment industries have also slipped. "All these things are making a negative impact on the economy," Anwar said. b
