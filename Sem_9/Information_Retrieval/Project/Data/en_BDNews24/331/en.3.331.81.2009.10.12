 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)The Rapid Action Battalion on Sunday recovered 10 Arges grenades, similar to those used in Aug 21, 2004 attack on an Awami League rally, and arrested three people from Sherpur. These Austria-made grenades are not similar to the looted ones from the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters, Abul Kalam Azad, who directs the Legal and Media Wing of the elite force, said on Monday. The arrestees are Rafiqul Islam, 36, Pangbhang Sarma, 37, and Nitin Sarma, 36, Azad added at a news conference at the Uttara headquarters. Azad said a joint team of RAB-1 and RAB-12 at 11:30pm arrested Islam on a tip-off at Panbor village of Jhinaigati Upazila and found the grenades at his home. On information gleaned from him, the rest were arrested at Chhoto Gazni. He said the assassins used this type of Arges grenades to attack the AL meeting at Bangabandhu Avenue in 2004. The arrestees were produced before the media, but RAB did not allow the reporters to quiz them. bdnews2
