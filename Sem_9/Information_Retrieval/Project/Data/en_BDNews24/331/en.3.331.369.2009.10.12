 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The managing director of Rid Pharmaceuticals surrendered to a Dhaka court on Monday, facing charges of producing a toxic paracetamol syrup that led to the deaths of at least 25 children. Metropolitan sessions judge A N M Bashirullah fixed Oct 19 for a bail hearing after Mizanur Rahman turned himself in the case, accusing Rid Pharma manufacturing and marketing adulterated drugs, filed under the Drug Control Act. The petition said Mizanur and his wife Sheuly Rahman, who is also a director of the compnay, on Aug 18, sought anticipatory bail from a High Court bench before surrender. The HC granted Sheuly a six-month bail and ordered Mizanur Rahman to surrender before the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. The HC in its order directed police not to arrest the Rid Pharma top executive within the period. The metropolitan sessions judge was given the authority to consider his bail. The Directorate of Drug Administration on Aug 10 filed the case against five officials of Rid Pharma for manufacturing substandard paracetamol syrup that was found to contain a toxic ingredient after the deaths of at least 25 children from renal failure. The court issued arrest warrants the next day. On July 21, the Drug Administration ordered Rid Pharma to halt manufacture and marketing of all its products, including the paracetamol preparation. On July 29, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque announced that tests had confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical diethylene glycol in spurious paracetamol syrup produced by Rid Pharmaceutical Company that was suspected of killing at least 25 children across the country. Diethylene glycol, normally used in the textile and leather dying industries, was allegedly used in the preparation as a cheap but deadly substitute for propylene glycol. Rid Pharma initially denied producing the paracetamol syrup linked to children's deaths, as reported in media. Officials of the drug company were quoted in the press as saying Rid Pharma "does not produce paracetamol syrup, but only suspension".
