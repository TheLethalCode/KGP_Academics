 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has sent Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, joint secretary general of main opposition BNP, into jail on surrender in a case related to amassing illegal wealth. Metropolitan senior special judge A N M Bashirullah made the order on Monday after the case documents were sent from the Third Special Judge's Court on hearing the bail petition. The judge in his ruling said: "The High Court bench of justices Mohammed Abdul Wahab Miah and Mohammed Abdur Razzak ordered him to appear before the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court within eight weeks. "The defendant surrendered to the court a day after the deadline. The trial court has rejected his bail petition for disobeying the High Court order," the judge said. Special public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal, opposing the bail petition, said: "Goyeshwar not only accumulated illegal wealth but also concealed the information. "We have evidence in charge sheet how he had acquired the wealth," he said. The BNP leader earlier turned himself in at Third Special Judge's Court and appealed for bail. Judge Mozammel Hossain on hearing the bail petition did not give any order. Special public prosecutor Abdus Salam Khan said in the first bail appeal hearing that Goyeshwar did not obey the High Court order and failed to show up before the court. Nitai Chandra Roy, counsel for the BNP leader, refuted the statement, saying the defence did not dishonour the High Court order. The judge said after the hearing that the High Court ordered Goyeshwar to surrender before the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court within eight weeks. The Anticorruption Commission had filed the case with Ramna Police Station on Jan 5 on charges of accumulating illegal wealth worth Tk 2.68 crore and hiding the information to the graft watchdog. Goyeshwar surrendered before the High Court on March 9 and sought anticipatory bail. The court granted him bail until the submission of the charge sheet which was pressed on July 5. On Aug 16, the High Court ordered the BNP leader to show up before the Special Judge's Court within eight weeks after the defence appealed for bail extension. bdnews2
