<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Chandpur police took self-confessed serial killer Rasu Khan into remand on Tuesday for two more days of questioning, after his admission last week that he had murdered 11 women over the past two years. Police produced the 40 year-old Rasu before the court of senior judicial magistrate Mohammad Amirul Islam requesting seven days' remand. Subinspector of Faridganj police Mir Kashem, the investigating officer in the case, told bdnews24.com that police requested the remand in connection with the murder of a garment factory worker from Tongi in Feb 2009. Rasu, who had no lawyer to represent him, said in court, "I've told the truth." "Please don't send me into remand," he asked the judge. Kashem said Rasu will be produced in court again on Wednesday after questioning. "We'll request remand again showing him arrested in another murder case," said the investigating officer. Rasu, originally detained by police for theft more than a month ago, last week confessed to killing 11 women in two years in Faridganj, Chandpur. Police told bdnews24.com Rasu was arrested in Tongi on Sep 3 for stealing fans from a mosque in Faridganj. He was later linked through mobile phone records to the murder of a woman in Chandpur Sadar, and taken into remand for questioning in the case on Oct 8. Being linked to the murder, Rasu last Saturday admitted that he used to contact women by phone, take them for outings to Chandpur, and then tortured and killed them before dumping the bodies in water, said police. He also told of his macabre goal to kill over 100 women, saying he was thwarted in his first love as a youth. Rasu told police he had killed six women in Faridganj, four at Chandpur Sadar and one in the Haimchar area. He said his first murder victim was his brother-in-law's wife, whom he killed in early 2007, and that he had killed 10 more women, aged 15-35, up to August this year. Faridganj police chief Ranjit Chandra Palit said Rasu was remarkably unruffled during his confession. "He did not seem at all crazy or unbalanced," said Palit. bdnew
