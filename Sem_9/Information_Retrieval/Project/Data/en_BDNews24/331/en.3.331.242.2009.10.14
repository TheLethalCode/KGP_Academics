<TEXT>
 Kushtia, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)--Another alleged underground operative was killed on Tuesday in a so-called gunfight with law-enforcers in Kushtia, the sixth death in a week. A day before, an alleged extremist, Ajbahar alias Bahar, died at Kumarkhali Upazila in a gun battle with the police. As many as 27 people have died in last two months in extrajudicial killing with the police and Rapid Action Battalion. 'Farid', 42, son of Razzak Mondol from Ajail of Khoksha Upazila, was the regional leader of banned Gono Mukti Fauj, assistant superintendent of police (ASP) at Kushtia Sadar Circle CA Halim said. A team of RAB-12, Kushtia unit and another of Khuksha Police Station raided a brick kiln owned by one Duru Miah at Shomspur at around 10:30pm where a group of criminals were meeting, he said. The criminals fired at them and the gun fight ensued, Halim said. The extremists later escaped the scene. Farid was caught in the crossfire and died on the spot, he said. Police recovered a home-made pistol, four rounds of bullet, four bombs, two machetes and other home-made arms, he also said. The body would be sent to Kushtia General Hospital for autopsy on Wednesday, he further said. He was an absconding accused who faced 10 years jail in a case filed with Pangsha Police Station in Rajbari and faced seven cases, including four killing cases. The number of people killed in such encounters appears to be on the rise despite criticisms from human-rights organisations, who have expressed concern over extrajudicial killings. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. Home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Huq Tuku, however, have claimed that no extra-judicial killings were taking place. They said that law enforcers only resort to firing in self defence when they come under attack. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called crossfire or encounters should not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in or out of custody. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February this year that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated.
