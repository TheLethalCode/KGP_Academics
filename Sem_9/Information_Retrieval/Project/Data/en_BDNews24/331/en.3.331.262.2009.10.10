<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court will soon have an independent secretariat for judicial affairs, the law minister said on Saturday. "There should be an independent secretariat to fully implement the process of separation of the judiciary from the executive," Shafique Ahmed told reporters. "A separate secretariat under the Supreme Court will be formed soon," the law minister said. The necessary steps will be taken in consultation with the chief justice, Shafique said. Referring to the upcoming trial of war criminals, the minister said a well secured dock room was being set up. He said the public works ministry had been sent a letter on the matter. Shafique was speaking to media after the inauguration of a training programme at the Judicial Administration Training Institute in Dhaka. A total of 22 joint judges and sessions judges are participating in the 91st judicial administration training course that will continue through Oct 29. "Three judges have to share a court room due to crisis of space. We have lack of sufficient logistic support," said Shafique. He conceded that justice seekers have to face troubles for such poor arrangements. He said the government is introducing an Alternative Dispute Resolution system to resolve minor criminal and civil cases so that people get quick justice. The law commission has been given a directive to reform existing laws to this end, said the minister. Shafique said the government is also considering rise in salaries and allowances to attract the meritorious students in law profession. "The cabinet has already discussed the issue. The matter is under the consideration of the finance ministry." Replying to a question, he said: "A number of judges are going into retirement. We are appointing 291 new judges, who passed the last BCS, to fill the gap." Shafique said some 200 computers had been supplied to trial courts in Dhaka after the separation of judiciary from the executive. He said arrangements were being made to digitise all courts across the country. The institute's director, justice Md Hamidul Haque, also spoke at the opening programme, among others. bdne
