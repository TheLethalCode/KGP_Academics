 BEIJING, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The China Open men's final between Serbian Novak Djokovic and Croatian Marin Cilic was interrupted by rain at the Olympic tennis centre on Sunday. The match was all square at 2-2 in the first set when a light drizzle made the hard court too slippery for play to continue. Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova meets Pole Agnieszka Radwanska in the women's final of the $6.6 million tournament later on Sunday with a scheduled start time of 1100 GMT.
