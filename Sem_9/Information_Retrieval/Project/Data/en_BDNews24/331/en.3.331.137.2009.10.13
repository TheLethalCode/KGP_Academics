 Saiful Alam Babu bdnews24.com Panchagarh correspondent Panchgar, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)--A member of Indian Border Security Force is being tried under BSF court martial on charge of killing three Bangladeshi nationals including a child in a random shootout. This is the first ever case in which a BSF member is being tried on charge of killing innocent Bangladeshis along the border, sources at BDR said. Some Bangladeshi witnesses are testifying to the killings by BSF for the first time, the sources said. On Nov 16, 2008, RP Singh, a drunk BSF member of Nayabari camp under 10 BSF battalion fired haphazardly onto people after entering into Mayna village of Shalbahar Union, close to Tetulia border. Majeda Begum, 25, wife of one Shahidul, her eight-month old baby Mamun and another villager Mostafa died on the spot in the firing while Shahidul received bullet injury. Later, the villagers captured RP Singh in an injured condition and handed him over to BDR who returned him to BSF through a sector commander level flag meeting. At the flag meeting, BDR demanded a fair trial of the killer and compensation for the victims. Following the demand, the trial for Singh has now begun under Indian court martial. Sources at BDR said that as part of the trial, on request of the BSF authorities, Dr Bahauddin of Panchgar Sadar Hospital who conducted the postmortem of the victims and another doctor of Rangpur Medical College who treated Singh have testified to Fultali BSF camp, near the zero point of Banglaband in Tetulia on Monday noon. The panel of judges in court martial includes a brigadier general, three officers of the rank of colonel and a lawyer. Acting commander of Panchagar 25 BDR battalion major Mozaffar Rahman escorted the physicians inside Indian terrotory where officiating commandant of 23 BSF battalion RK Shahi welcomed them to their camp. Earlier, BDR members, police, injured Shahidul and other eye witnesses testified before the court martial during last four days. They all demanded exemplary punishment of Singh in the interest of maintaining peaceful co-existence along the border. Major Mozaffar Rahman confirmed the trial of Singh under court martial. He said, "Necessary evidence of causalities has been produced on request from BSF and some witnesses also recorded their statement." "We demanded financial compensation for the families of the victims," he said Laboni, 15, daughter of slain Mostafa, said, "We demand death penalty to the killer of my father." She also complained that nobody came to inquire about them since the killing and they had not received any financial help from any quarter. A crippled Shahidul, 35, said, "I have lost my wife and my baby for the drunken BSF member." "I demand exemplary punishment of the killer," he said He received some financial support for medical treatment from BDR, but nobody inquired about him after BDR mutiny in Dhaka last February, he alleged. bdn
