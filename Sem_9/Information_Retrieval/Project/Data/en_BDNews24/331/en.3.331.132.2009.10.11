<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Students of some colleges took to the streets in front of Dhaka College on Sunday to register their protest against a government decision, halting traffic movement on the busy Mirpur Road. The demonstrations created heavy traffic gridlocks on main city streets as traffic movement on adjoining Shahbagh, Elephant Road, Science Laboratory and Dhanmondi roads was suspended for around two and a half hours. Students of Dhaka College, Titumir College, Suhrawardy College, Kabi Nazrul College and Mirpur Bangla College converged in front of Dhaka College road at around 11:30am. They said the recent gazette notification issued by the education ministry reversed a previous decision of grading system. The demonstrators were successful candidates of SSC and HSC between 2001 and 2004. They said the gazette changed the equalisation of grading system and division system of their time. The students engaged in clashes with police, throwing brickbats, forcing the law enforcers to fire tear gas. The demonstrators also damaged a number of vehicles at around 1:30pm and took shelter inside Dhaka College premises when chased by police. The traffic on the road resumed after 2pm. Dhaka Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Atiqul Islam told bdnews24.com the traffic was halted as the students demonstrated on the Mirpur road. The situation came under control without any baton charge by the police, Islam claimed. The GPA system was introduced in 2001. GPA-2 was set equal to second division (45 percent marks) and GPA-3 equal to first division (60 percent marks). But the government gazette published on June 2 said the below GPA-3 would be estimated as third division and below GPA-4 as second division for the students who passed SSC and HSC examinations after 2004. For students who passed SSC and HSC between 2001 and 2003, below GPA-2.5 would be counted as third division and less than 3.5 as second division. It means students whose GPA was earlier counted as second division would now be counted as third division after the publication of the new gazzette. Students said they had talked with the education minister and top ministry officials about the issue but no solution came out. They demanded withdrawal of the June 2 gazette. The demonstrators announced that they would besiege education ministry on Oct 14 to press their demands. They would also stage demonstrations at their respective institutions, they said. Akram Hossain, a student of Mirpur Bangla College, said he got admitted to Bachelor degree course with honours after he had got GPA-2, which meant second division. But according to the gazette he now has a third division. "I don't have the scope to sit for SSC again," he said. Abdul Jaabbar Akash, a student of Dhaka College, said he would not be able to apply for job anywhere if the new rule was upheld. He would now be treated as third division holder (GPA-2), Akash said. Dhaka College principal Sirajuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The demands of the students are rational. There are some discrepancies in the evaluation of grading." bdne
