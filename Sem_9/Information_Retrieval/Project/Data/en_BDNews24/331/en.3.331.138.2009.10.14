<TITLE> Why is Pakistan aiming at South Waziristan? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Pakistan, Oct 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani aircraft bombed Taliban fighters in their South Waziristan bastion on Wednesday as more soldiers and tanks moved in for an expected offensive against the militant hub. The government in June ordered the army to launch an offensive in South Waziristan. Since then the military has been conducting air and artillery strikes to soften up the militants' defences. The government says the assault is imminent but it will be up to the army to decide when to send in ground troops. Here are some questions and answers on South Waziristan: WHY IS THE ARMY PREPARING AN OFFENSIVE? South Waziristan is the main stronghold of the Tehrik-e-Taliban, or Taliban Movement of Pakistan, an alliance of more than a dozen militant groups that is fighting the government and wants to impose hardline Islamist rule. The Pakistani Taliban have been responsible for a wave of violence across the country since mid-2007, when the army crushed an Islamist movement linked with South Waziristan based at Islamabad's Red Mosque. As well as numerous suicide bomb attacks against military, government and foreign targets, the Pakistani Taliban were accused of killing former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in late 2007. Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud was killed by a missile fired by a U.S. drone aircraft on Aug. 5 and replaced by Hakimullah Mehsud who has vowed to exact revenge. Pakistani Taliban fighters virtually took over control of the Swat valley, northwest of Islamabad, beginning in 2007 and a push out of the valley towards Islamabad spread fear early this year. The army responded with an offensive that has largely cleared militants out of the valley. The army has now set its sights on South Waziristan in the hope of rooting out the most potent domestic threat to the state. WHO IS THERE? South Waziristan has a 6,620 square km (2,550 square miles). The army says about 10,000 hardcore fighters are in South Waziristan, although some analysts estimate more. Most are members of the region's ethnic Pashtun tribes who have battled intruders for centuries. Foreign militants, including about 1,000 Uzbeks, some al Qaeda Arabs and even a handful of militants from Western countries are also there. Militant factions from other parts of Pakistan, in particular the south of Punjab province, are also based with the Taliban in South Waziristan. Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistani border though analysts doubt he would be in an area the army is about to attack. WHAT ARE THE RISKS? A ground offensive in South Waziristan could be the army's toughest test since the militants turned on the state. The army first launched a brief offensives there in 2004, suffering heavy casualties before striking a peace pact. The army has seldom, if ever, ventured into much of the semi-autonomous region of arid mountains and dried-up creeks and will be taking on fighters who have had years to prepare defences. The Pashtun tribes in the region have long been hostile to outside intervention and many people, particularly those belonging to the Mehsud tribe, support the Taliban. So the army could get bogged down in an area in which it has little experience and which is inhabited by a hostile population. Another risk for the army is that militant factions in North Waziristan might come to the help of their South Waziristan comrades while cells of militants in towns and cities could try to divert attention with attacks like the weekend raid on the army's headquarters in Rawalpi
