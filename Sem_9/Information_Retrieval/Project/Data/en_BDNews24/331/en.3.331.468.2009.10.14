 Dhaka,Oct13(bdnews24.com)The government has approved huge hikes to the rather meagre monthly stipends for poor students at secondary level, in some cases quadrupling them, and bringing male students under the stipend programme too. An ECNEC meeting held Tuesday. chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, gave the green signal to the Tk 687.93 crore project. Planning secretary Habibullah Majumdar briefed the press on the project after the meeting. According to the approved project, the monthly stipend for a student of class six will rise fourfold to Tk 100 from Tk 25 and for a student of class seven it will jump to Tk 100 from Tk 30. For students of class nine and ten it will more than double to Tk 150 from Tk 60. On top of that students of class ten will receive Tk 750 towards registration fees for SSC examinations, up from Tk 550. The project titled 'Secondary Eudcation Stipend Project' will be implemented in 305 upzilas in 56 districts. Fully funded by the government, the project beginning this year is expected to expire by June 2012. It will also award stipends to poor male students as well as female students. The background of the project stated that the current 'Secondary Education Stipend Project' has been approved as a continuation of the previous Tk 420.87 crore 'Secondary Female Student Stipend Project-Phase II' that ran from July 2005 to June 2009 with the mission of expanding female education. The current project has been approved in line with the aims of the previous one, but including poor male students too, the planning secretary said. The stipend will be earmarked for those students whose guardians own land less than 50 decimal or an annual income below Tk 30,000. Wards of insolvent freedom fighters, and of crippled, dumb, blind, parents and orphan students will also be entitled to the stipend. It will also cover all handicapped students. To enjoy the stipend, however, the students will have to ensure 75 percent class attendance along with scoring minimum 33 percent in the annual exams for students of six and seven and 40 percent for class eight and nine. On top of that the intended students will have to remain unmarried until SSC or equivalent exams. The concept paper of the project mentioned that the project aims at increasing the number of students at secondary level in addition to enhancing quality of education. It also aims at preventing students from getting married until they pass the SSC or equivalent exams with the mission of checking population growth. The planning secretary said, "The prime minister has also directed education ministry to launch 'a permanent stipend programme' by coordinating all existing stipend projects." Apart from the project just approved, the 'Secondary Education Sector Development Project', jointly financed by ADB and the government, is still providing stipend in 53 upazilas. Alongside, the 'Secondary Education Quality and Enhancement Project', supported by Word Bank, is operating in 121 upazilas.

It also okayed three infrastructure projects including Tk 211 crore for Pirojpur-Gopalganj road development, Tk 298 crore for construction of Dapdapia bridge on Barisal-Patiakhali road, Tk 48 crore for Rajbari town protection dam. bd
