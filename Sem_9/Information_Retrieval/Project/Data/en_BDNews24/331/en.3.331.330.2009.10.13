 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)BNP's national council will be held in December, with tried and tested party leaders and workers being "rightly rewarded" there, party chairperson Khaleda Zia said on Monday. "BNP's council will be held in December. Associate bodies will also be organised afresh after restructuring the party thoroughly," Khaleda told leaders of one of the associate bodies Jatiyatabadi Swechchasebak Dal who called on her at her Gulshan office. "Those who are dedicated and tested will be amply rewarded," she said. She urged all the party faithful to show their loyalty not by word but by organisational work. The party will not welcome those who want to serve self-interests, she said. Criticising the government, the opposition chief said, "They could not fulfil their electoral pledges. Rather, they are working against the interest of the country." She claimed that the people had lost their confidence in the Awami League government. Many people, the former prime minister, said are being made jobless though the government spoke of creating employment. "The administration is being politicised in a bid to revive one-party rule, BAKSAL," Kahleda said She called on party leaders and supporters to accurately portray "the grim picture of the government's misrule" to the people. "Law and order in the country is out of control. Extortion, violence and occupation are rampant everywhere." "The government has failed to ensure security for the people. It is very much after serving its own interests," she said BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, among others, spoke at the meeting. b
