 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has given former shipping adviser M A Matin until Nov 4 to submit his reply in a bid to fight a Tk 25 crore compensation suit. First joint district sessions judge K M Imrul Quayes set the date after Matin on Wednesday filed a petition seeking more time for the reply. Abdus Sattar, the lawyer for Matin, filed the petition. "Since it is a political harassment case we will fight. So we need time to submit reply," Sattar told reporters after filing the petition. Sattar would also submit reply for another defendant, ex-shipping secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain. Motahar Hossain is currently a member of Privatisation Commission. Chittagong port berth operator Everest Enterprise on Aug 24 said it would seek compensation in the court from Matin over alleged irregularities in the allocation of a container handling contract at Chittagong Container Terminal in January. It filed the lawsuit on Sep 1. Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, maintained that he did nothing wrong. A parliamentary investigation committee said the former shipping secretary Hossain and senior assistant shipping secretary Sharif Mohammad Masud, allegedly involved in the deal, had confessed at a meeting that Matin had forced them to award the contract to Eshaq Brothers in violation of government guidelines. And the officials of the CPA submitted papers which proved Matin's direct involvement in awarding the work, according to the parliamentary probe. Eshaq Brothers on Monday asked for Tk 25 crore in damages for the cancelled contract with Chittagong Port Authority. In a letter, it also threatened the CPA with legal actions if the money is not paid by 15 days. The CPA last Thursday cancelled the contract eight months into the signing of the deal following the recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry. The day before, the cabinet committee on economic affairs approved the recommendation of the standing committee to let Saif Power Tech to handle CCT until Nov 10. "Former adviser M A Matin had direct role in awarding the work to the company in violation of the government guidelines," Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry, had said. The chairman said the tender was not invited properly in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. In addition, false certificate was given in favour of Eshaq Brothers, a "novice" company. He said the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. Matin was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. The standing committee found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Ishaq Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning and the same was sent to CPA for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the CPA awarded the work to Ishaq Brothers at 9pm when the new government was taking oath at the Bangabhaban. b
