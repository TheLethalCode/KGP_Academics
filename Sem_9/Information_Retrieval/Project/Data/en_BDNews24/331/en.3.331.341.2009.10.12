 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court resumed hearing on Bangabandhu murder appeals for the sixth day on Monday. The hearing started at 9:42am with barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts retired major Bazlul Huda and retired lt col A K M Mohiuddin, reading out from the paperbook containing the ruling by Justice A B M Khairul Haque. The five-judge bench of the Appellate Division led by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam heard on the fifth day's hearing that the conspiracy to kill president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had been initiated in Comilla, finalised in Dhaka Cantonment and culminated in the formation of Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed's cabinet. After Sunday's hearing, chief state counsel Anisul Haque told reporters, "Justice A B M Khairul Haque, examining the witnesses' evidence and lawyers' deliberations, found that the conspiracy had begun at former president Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed's Daudkandi home and Comilla BARD (Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development)." "The case details said the killing plans were made at a meeting by retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Mahbubul Alam Chashi, which led to the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975," the counsel said. "Justice Haque found that the killing was accomplished after a massively planned conspiracy, which began on March 1975, though some of the plotters were not directly involved with the killing." Anisul told reporters that in the High Court verdict Justice Haque had presented the arguments of all sides. He had also presented several examples of cases of some countries stating some sections of the law. "In his deliberations, the then chief counsel Sirajul Huq had stated that Ziaur Rahman was appointed the deputy chief of army staff. The convicted army personnel had met several times with Mustaque at BARD and plotted the conspiracy, which was finalised at Balurghat in Dhaka Cantonment." Anisul said the conspiracy that began in March 1975 culminated in the formation of Mustaque's cabinet. Barrister Mamun said, "Citing then army chief (K M) Shafiullah in his ruling, Justice Khairul Haque said Shafiullah was appointed as army chief on April 7, 1972. But Ziaur Rahman was one step senior to him and so he was disappointed." Moreover, some unpleasant incidents took place at that time in the name of arms recovery. Rakkhibahini was formed to assist the police, though a vested group made propaganda that it would replace the army, he said. Barrister Mamun said, "Col (Abu) Taher lost one of his legs in the independence war, but he was kept in the army considering him as a freedom fighter. Col Taher went to general Shafiullah's office to meet him in the beginning of 1974 and told him to leave the position of the army chief to Ziaur Rahman." Earlier, the apex court on the fourth day of hearing heard an allegation that Ziaur Rahman was probably involved in the Aug 15 incident. Death convict retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin had made the inference in his confessional statement in 1996 that Zia had a hand in the events since he did not take punitive measures against Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Farukur Rahman and Shahriar Rashid who had been involved in the bloody coup in which Mujib was killed. The statement which Mohiuddin (artillery) gave on Nov 27 that year before the then additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Habibur Rahman was delivered before the five-judge Appellate Division bench now hearing the appeals of the five convicts for a reversal of their death sentences. Mohiuddin in his statement had also said that discontent was brewing in the army at that time and a rebellion was in the offing. Faruk and Shahriar had been keeping in contact with then army chief of staff Ziaur Rahman to tackle the situation, but Zia expressed his inability to do anything. The freshly formed bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members.
