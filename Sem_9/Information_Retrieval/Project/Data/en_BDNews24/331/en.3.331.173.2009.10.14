 DES MOINES, Iowa, Oct 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world has made little progress in reducing hunger since 1990, a new report said on Wednesday, pointing to 29 countries with alarming levels of malnutrition, mainly in Africa and South Asia. Those countries also are most vulnerable to the impact of historically high food and energy prices, as well as economic recession -- factors that the International Food Policy Research Institute said are not yet captured in the data used to compile its annual hunger index.
