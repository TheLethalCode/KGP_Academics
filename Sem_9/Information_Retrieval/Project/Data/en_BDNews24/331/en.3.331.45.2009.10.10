 Khagrachhari, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)The United People's Democratic Front has been imposing an indefinite general strike from Saturday morning in Lakkhichhari Upazila of Khagrachhari hill district, in protest at not being able to hold a funeral procession for one of their leaders the day before. A UPDF statement issued Saturday demanded removal and punishment of army officer Lt Col Sharif Ahmed and Lakkhichhari Upazila Police chief Farid Ahmed after they had stopped the front from holding the funeral procession on Friday. The statement said the general strike was called to press the demand and in protest against a newly emerged local group, the 'Mukhosh Bahini' (Masked Army), which the UPDF says was responsible for the killing of one of their leaders Ruikhoi Marma on Oct 2. UPDF leader Ujjal Smriti Chakma told bdnews24.com they also demanded action against the Chittagong Hill Tracts National Forum. The Front claims the Forum is an army-backed organisation that harbours the 'masked criminals' who had again attacked UPDF members on Friday without any provocation. On Saturday, UPDF picketers dismantled the wooden base of Bilachhari bridge in the afternoon, halting road communications. The UPDF has called three programmes in all in a bid "to stop army torture of unarmed mass people". Under the programmes school and college students will wear black badges from Oct 11 to 13, a protest on Oct 12 will be staged in every thana and,roads will be blocked in every upazila of Khagrachhari on Oct 14. bdnews24
