 Feni, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested an alleged Harkatul Jihad militant in Feni on Monday, accused of an attempt on the life of prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2001. Abu Obaida, aka Harun, 36, is accused in the attempted murder case for a bomb attack at prime minister Sheikh Hasina's election campaign meeting in Sylhet on Sep 26, 2001. Mohammed Nizamuddin, officer in charge of Shonagazi Police Station, told bdnews24.com, "Harun was apprehended around 4pm from the Bhuiyabazar area of Char Chandiya union in Shonagazi Upazila." Police investigation revealed that the banned militant outfit Harkatul Jihad-Al-Islami was manufacturing bombs to attack the meeting and kill Awami League chief Hasina. But an accidental explosion killed two militants and wounded Harun and associate Masud Ahmed Shakil aka Sumon, who were both arrested at the time. Harun was treated for his injuries in police custody for four months. Later during the tenure of the BNP-Jamaat coalition government, Harun got bail. He went to Kuwait and stayed there for two years. On his return he went into hiding at Shonagazi. Arrest warrant for Harun was issued by Sylhet District Sessions Judge's Court in 2006. Harun was a student of Al Jama'atul Islamia Madrasa in Patia, Chittagong. It is rumoured that he went for militant training in Afghanistan and participated in the war there. He was known as "JMB (Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh)" in his area. Maj Gen Ehteshamul Huq, the military secretary to the president, was linked on Sunday by Prothom Alo newspaper to militants Harun and others who had been charged with launching the attack. The general has been transferred to the army's Rangpur-based division as its general officer commanding (GOC) immediately after the media report. bdnews24.c
