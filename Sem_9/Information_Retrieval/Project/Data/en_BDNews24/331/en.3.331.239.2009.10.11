 Chittagong, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Police have arrested a close associate of the son of Chittagong-3 MP A B M Abul Kashem Master on charges of assaulting four journalists earlier in the week during an alleged bid to illegally occupy four shipyards in Sitakunda. Mahmudul Hasan Manna, the associate of S M Al-Mamun, was arrested after the MP had assured authorities of all help to catch him. Kashem's sons SM Al-Mamun and SM Al-Noman along with their supporters on Wednesday reportedly stormed the shipyards and hung up a signboard of Unique Enterprise, a firm owned by Mamun. Sitakunda police chief Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com they had arrested Manna in the port city's Garibullah Shah Shrine area on Saturday night. As the four journalists went to the spot to report on the incident they were allegedly attacked by Mamun's gang led by Manna. The MP apologised on Saturday afternoon for the 'unfortunate' incident. Staff reporter Pranab Paul and photographer Rashed Mahmud of Bangla-language daily Prothom Alo, Samakal's Sitakunda correspondent Mohammad Sekandar and another local journalist Forkan Abu were assaulted by the gang. In the case filed by Mamun Abdullah, reporter-in-charge at the Alo's Chittagong office, 20 people including the two sons of the MP were made accused. b
