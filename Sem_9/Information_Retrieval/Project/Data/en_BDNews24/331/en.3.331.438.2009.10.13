 Dhaka, Oct 13(bdnews24.com)The government will build 139 new godowns in the northern Rajshahi region to maintain adequate food grain reserves. Of them, 81 will have capacity for 1000 tonnes of food grains and 58 will be able to store 500 tonnes. In all, they will provide storage capacity for 110,000 tonnes of grains at an estimated cost of Tk 241 crore. The project was approved on Tuesday at an ECNEC meeting chaired by the prime minister, planning secretary Habibullah Majumder said at a short press briefing afterwards. "The project is intended to enhance food security, encourage farmers to produce more and meet any crisis situation by procuring additional food," he said. About 70 percent of food grains are procured from northern farmers, mill owners and others. But a significant proportion of farm output is spoilt for lack of proper storage facilities. The government has also faced trouble procuring targeted stocks this year for the storage crisis. These 139 new godowns will be built by 2011 in 76 upazilas of the 15 districts in Rajshahi division. The highest number, 40, will be built in Bogra district with a capacity to preserve 35,000 tonnes of rice. Another 22 godowns will be built at Dinajpur, 12 at Thakurgaon, 5 at Panchgarh, 2 in Nilphamari, 7 in Lalmonirhat, 5 at Kurigram, 7 at Rangpur, 5 at Gaibandha, 5 at Joypurhat, 6 at Naogaon, 6 at Sirajganj, 9 at Pabna, 4 at Rajshahi and 4 at Natore. bd
