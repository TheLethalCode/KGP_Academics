<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, headed by ASM Abdur Rab, extended support to the government's Bay exploration deals with two foreign companies, but was not all praise for the government on Saturday. Rab said the government has let down the people as land grabbing, terrorism and partisanship is rampant up and down the country. Rab, speaking at a press conference at Isha Kha hotel on Saturday, congratulated the prime minister's firm stance to overcome all barriers in retrieving resources from the sea. "We appreciate the positive words about extraction of mineral resources. The prime minister spoke for the people. We think the government will take a decision on gas export by protecting national interest." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday told parliament that the government will do whatever is needed "in spite of obstructions". She said many were being obstructive as certain quarters "do not want that electricity production be raised and the country developed". Rab said on Saturday, "India's construction of the Tipaikukh Dam, demarcation of sea boundaries with India and Myanmar and our link to the Asian highway are now critical issues in our foreign policy." He suggested formation of a sub-regional economic forum with the neighbouring countries. But, evaluating the ten-month performance of the government, Rab said, "The government has not taken enough steps towards fulfilling its 23-point election manifesto yet." "In the last 10 months the grand alliance government has frustrated the people." "Already grabbing, terrorism and partisanship is consuming everything. Like past governments that failed, nothing exceptional is seen in case of this government." If the government looks to be failing in its pledges, then we will take various steps and finally go for a movement against the government." Asked when such a movement might be launched, Rab said, "We have not made any decision for a major movement against the grand alliance yet. The time has not come to say that this government has failed." "If they fail, we will stage human chains, hunger strikes and, if necessary, we will launch a stronger movement." JSD's general secretary Abdul Malek Ratan, referring to recent calls from various quarters to abolish the caretaker government system, said, "We are also demanding actions to clarify the caretaker government system that makes it transparent and answerable to people rather than removing it completely." bdnew
