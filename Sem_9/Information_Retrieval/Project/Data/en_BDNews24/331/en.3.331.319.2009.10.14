 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)The current judicial system stands in the way of efforts to wipe out corruption, the chief of Anticorruption Commission said on Wednesday. "It won't be possible to remove corruption if the judicial system is not reformed in line with the reality," ACC chairman Golam Rahman told reporters. "If the judges are not tough against the corrupt people they would continue to commit more corruption under the umbrella of law." He alleged that the government was clipping the wings of the ACC, reducing some of its powers, in phases. "After making the Anticorruption Commission a 'tiger without teeth', the process is underway to cut the nails from its claws," he said. The incumbent government formed a committee in March to reform the laws governing the graft watchdog. The amended recommendations were sent to the ACC recently. "It is not possible to prevent high-level corruption without a strong political will," the ACC chairman said. He mentioned the problem of manpower shortage in the commission. Rahman said the commission will protest if any law is made to thwart its independence. "I believe the democratic government will not make any such law that will curb the independence of the watchdog body." Replying to a query, the chairman said he knew nothing about the notice served on the daily Prothom Alo owner Latifur Rahman seeking his wealth statement. The commission would investigate the allegations against former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain with importance if it is asked to do so, Rahman said. On his three-month experience as the ACC chairman, Rahman said: "Like the movie "Hirak Rajar Deshe' of Satyajit Roy I also want to say 'Since there is no end of knowledge, it is futile to try to know'." "The quest for knowledge remains unfulfilled for all human beings." Rahman said several thousand cases initiated by the former Bureau of Anticorruption and the present ACC still remained pending for investigation and trial. Investigation of several thousand allegations are still under process, he added. Rahman joined the ACC in June this year. The government appointed him after his predecessor Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury resigned. bdne
