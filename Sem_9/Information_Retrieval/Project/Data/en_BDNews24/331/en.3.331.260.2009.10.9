<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)--Two suspected outlaws were killed in so-called shootout with law enforcers in Kushtia and Khulna early on Friday. The number of people killed in so-called encounters are on the rise despite the criticisms of the human-rights organisations. Three people were killed in last three days in Kushtia and two people in Khulna in the last two days. Kushtia Sadar Circle assistant superintendent of police C A Halim said 36-year old Amirul Islam aka Amir Khan was a leader of the military branch of extremist Gano Bahini (Lal) party. On a tip-off that the extremists were gathering at Bittipara village of Sadar upazila the police team went there at around 5am and locked in a gunfight with the criminals, he said. Amir died at one stage of the gun battle. His body was sent to Kushtia General Hospital morgue for autopsy. There are 12 cases including eight murder cases against Amir, the ASP said. In Khulna, Dumuria police chief Md Fauzul Kabir told bdnews24.com Nirapad Bairagi was an operative of extremist New Biplobi Communist Party. A police team launched a drive at Ranai village at around 2:30am being tipped off that a group of extremists were holding a secret meeting there, he said. Sensing the presence of law enforcers the criminals fired shots on them and the police retaliated. The criminals fled the scene at one stage leaving Bairagi wounded. Bairagi was taken to Dumuria upazila health centre where the duty doctors declared him dead, Kabir said. Bairagi faced six cases including two murder cases, he added. The human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. A total of 97 people died in "shootouts" and in custody of law-enforcing agencies until Sep 30 from Jan 1 this year, said independent human-rights watchdog Odhikar last week. Home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Huq Tuku, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. They said RAB and police only fire when under attack, in self defence. State minister for home has trashed the human-rights organisations' allegations. "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting a raid to apprehend terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two odd deaths occur unavoidably." The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. bdn
