 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)About 8, 500 posts are lying vacant under different departments of the shipping and inland water transport ministry. The ministry has a total of 23,246 approved posts, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan told reporters on Sunday. "The work of the ministry is seriously hampered with around one-third of the total lying unfilled," he said. He said the government intended to fill up half of the empty positions this year. The recruitment process for filling them will begin in next two to three months, said Khan. He was speaking to media after an inter-ministerial meeting on water transport during the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha holidays. He said 44 ferries would be employed for the extra holiday crowd with the same efficiency as witnessed during the recent Eid-ul-Fitr period. The minister also said no vessel would run without fitness certificates and instruction has been issued to examine fitness certificates of all riverine transports. The ministry will also go for close monitoring and tough action, Khan added. Asked about "exorbitant fare hikes" for river passengers during Eid holidays, he said discussions were held with owners in this regard. The minister said they promised to charge normal fares and lawenforcing agencies would also work to stop black marketing of tickets. b
