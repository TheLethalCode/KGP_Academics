 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Swine flu prevalence in the country has declined with the summer heat receding, an official of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said Sunday. "We are now seeing less numbers of patients infected by the HINI virus, as the temperature is dropping with the winter coming in," said Mostak Ahmed, scientific officer of the IEDCR. He expressed his hope that fewer people will be infected by the pandemic flu in coming days. "We've diagnosed only 34 patients across the country in the last week, giving a total of 680 (officially confirmed cases) since the first person was diagnosed on June 18," he said. We're expecting that the swine flu vaccine will be available by next January from the World Health Organisation free of cost. According to government tally, three people have died from the flu strain in Bangladesh. The new H1N1 strain of flu, declared a global pandemic in June, could eventually infect one third of the world's population, or 2 billion people, according to the World Health Organization. bdnew
