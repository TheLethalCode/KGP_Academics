<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct (bdnews24.com)State minister for Chittagong Hill Tracts affairs Dipankar Talukder on Monday said army pullout from the CHT is a continuous process and it would not give way to renewed unrest in the region. He said the pullout has been taking place since 1997 since a peace accord was signed to bring stability to the long-troubled region. Army pullout continued even during the tenure of the BNP-Jamaat led alliance government. But now some people are protesting the withdrawal illogically, he claimed. Talukder made the comments to a visiting three-member European Union (EU) delegation comprising human-rights envoys Arjan Hamburger from Norway, Gnter Nooke from Germany and Arnold de Fine Skibsted from Denmark, Zulfikar Haider, public relation officer of the ministry said. The visiting envoys raised the issues related to human rights, formation of land commission, holding elections of the regional and district council of CHT, strengthening those institutions and on the complaints raised due to "the biggest withdrawal" of makeshift camps. The junior minister assured them that the human rights situation had been very satisfactory in the CHT region. He said there has been peace among the people, both hills people and Bangalee settlers in the CHT region, since the peace agreement was signed. The government has formed a land commission which has already started to functioning. Talukder said the government organisations would be transferred to the jurisdiction of the local and district administrations to strengthen those bodies. Some 22 of the 33 organisations have already been transferred, while five are underway. The government will give full support if the election commission initiates for conducting elections in the region, he added. b
