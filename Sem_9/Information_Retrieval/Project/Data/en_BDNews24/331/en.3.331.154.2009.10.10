 Kushtia, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  A suspected extremist was killed in an encounter with police at Mirpur Upazila in Kushtia on Saturday. Mirpur police chief Sheikh Anwar Hossain said 45-year old Manju Mandal of Char Mandalpara village in Sadarpur union, was a top leader of the extremist Biplobi Communist Party of the Kushtia region and a wanted criminal. Acting on a tip-off that a suspect group were gathering beside a graveyard at Barbaria village of the upazila, police went to the spot at around 4:30am and became involved in a shootout with the gang, Hossain said. At one stage Majnu was shot and killed on the spot and his criminal associates fled, said the police chief. He said police recovered one firearm and four rounds of bullet from the scene. Majnu faced two murder cases and one case under the arms act, the police official said. The body was sent to Kushtia General Hospital for post mortem. Four suspects have died in similar shootouts with law enforcers in Kushtia in the last four days. The number of people killed in such encounters appears to be on the rise despite criticisms of human-rights organisations, who have expressed concern over extra judicial killings. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. A total of 97 people have died in "crossfire/encounter/shootout" or in custody of law-enforcing agencies between Jan 1-Sep 30 this year, said independent human-rights watchdog Odhikar last week. Home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Huq Tuku, however, have claimed that no extra-judicial killings were taking place. They have said that law enforcers were only firing when under attack, in self defence. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called crossfire or encounters should not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in or out of custody. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February this year that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. bdn
