 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Three suspected criminals were killed in shootouts with RAB and police in Kushtia, Bagerhat and Khulna early on Thursday. Police said Kushtia's Sakmal Hossain was an extremist, and Bagerhat's Alam Khan and Khulna's Delwar Hossain Apu were criminals. bdnews24.com Kushtia correspondent said 37-year old Sakmal was killed in a gunfight with RAB and police at Bhadalia village of sadar upazila. Kushtia sadar police chief AKM Faruk said Sakmal, of Baria village of the sadar upazila, was a regional leader of outlawed extremist group Gano Muktifouj party. Another extremist from the same area, Sunnat Ali, was killed in a gunfight a day ago. As many as 23 people were killed in gun battle with law enforcers in Kushtia in last one and a half months. Faruk said a joint team of RAB-police went to Bhadalia village on a tip-off that the extremists were gathering there. The criminals and the law enforcers were locked in a shootout and at one stage Sakmal died on the spot, he said. One firearm and five rounds of bullet were recovered from the scene, police said. Sakmal faced six cases including four murder cases, they said. bdnews24.com Bagerhat correspondent said 35-year old Alam, Jubo League president of Teleganti union, was killed in another gunfight with police in Doibagyahati Union under Morelganj upazila. Morelganj police chief Ershadul Kabir Chowdhury said they had recovered one local-made pipe gun and a huge cache of ammunition from the spot. Alam Khan, an enlisted criminal, faced at least 10 cases including murder and extortion, police said. In another gunfight with police in Khulna, 28-year old Delwar, a resident of Rajapur village in Rupsa upazila, was killed. Rupsa police chief Subhash Chandra Biswas said the gunfight took place at Sreephaltala ground in Rupsa. There were six cases, including three murder cases, against Delwar, Khulna police super Md Shamsuddin told bdnews24.com. The human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. A total of 97 people died in "shootouts" and in custody of law-enforcing agencies until Sept 30 from Jan 1 this year, said independent human-rights watchdog Odhikar last week. Home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Huq Tuku, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. They said RAB and police only fire in self defence when they come under attack. State minister for home has dismissed the human-rights organisations' allegations. "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting a raid to apprehend terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two odd deaths occur unavoidably." The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' extra-judicial killings. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have repeatedly expressed concern over the rising trend of extra-judicial killings in the country. In may, HRW in a one of its reports suggested such 'elite' security forces like Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) should be disbanded. bd
