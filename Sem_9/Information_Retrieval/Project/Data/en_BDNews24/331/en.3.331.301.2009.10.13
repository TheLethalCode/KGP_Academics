 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government is being forced to move towards more costly alternatives to gas for power production, the state minister for power warned on Tuesday. "We are being forced to install coal, diesel and furnace oil-dependent power plants due to the gas crisis. So, power generation will become more costly per unit," Mohammad Enamul Haque said. "Gas was also subsidised to a great extent for power production. So, costs will increase to in generating power with diesel and other alternatives." Haque said the government was also considering re-usable energies such as solar. "But the problem is that many for whom solar power or other similar systems would make sense, in rural areas for example, cannot afford the cost of such systems." He was speaking as chief guest at a workshop on "Power Sector Development and Mass Media at the Power Development Board offices in the city. The state minister also vented anger over city dwellers who take for granted the relatively inexpensive piped gas supply direct to homes, wasting gas by leaving burners on, while rural populations who have less income than city dwellers are forced to use expensive cylinder gas. But, he added optimistically, "The power crisis will be resolved considerably after all projects set in motion by the government so far come to fruition." PDB chairman ASM Alamgir Kabir, presiding over the workshop, pointed out that short, mid and long-term plans have been taken up to tide the country over the power crisis by 2014. "As part of this, coal, diesel and furnace oil have also been prioritised as well as gas", he added. Kabir said the cost over the next five years would be around $10 billion to realise the government's power plans, which aim to add an extra 3547MW to the national grid, beginning with significant rise in production next year. At present, the country produces 4300MW power against a maximum 5500MW demand, which is expected to rise dramatically in coming years as power consumption spreads and population increases. bd
