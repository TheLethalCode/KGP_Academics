<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Amid huge table-thumping, parliament on Tuesday passed a bill in about five minutes on lifetime security for the surviving family members of independence architect Sheikh Mujubur Rahman, which includes prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and their children. State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku proposed adoption of the bill at around 5:15pm. It was passed by voice at around 5:20pm after adoption as Tuku urged the House to clear the bill. Hasina, also leader of the parliament, was present during the passage . Home minister Sahara Khatun tabled the Father of the Nation Family Members Security Bill 2009 in parliament on Oct 5, and the House sent it to the standing committee for further scrutiny. The standing committee on Oct 11 okayed its recommendations in 10 minutes. The law will stipulate the government to provide them with protection by Special Security Force and accommodation wherever they want. Rehana along with her children live in London. The Awami League government has said the law is needed as Hasina, Rehana and their family members face threats to their security. The main opposition BNP, now boycotting parliament, has termed the bill "unprecedented" anywhere in the world. Hasina's father and Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his immediate family were assassinated in a military putsch on Aug 15, 1975. The previous Awami League administration passed a similar bill in June 2001 giving Hasina and her sister special security. The subsequent BNP government coming to power in Oct 2001 repealed the bill in December of that year. bdnew
