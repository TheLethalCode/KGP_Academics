<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Oct 10 (bdneews24.com)  Authorities imposed a Section 144 ban on public gatherings at Kapasia Upazila in Gazipur on Saturday, as main opposition party BNP and pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League called meetings on the day at the same spot. The clampdown was imposed at 10am as tensions mounted among local BNP and BCL leaders over the two meetings, Kapasia Police Station chief Khandaker Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com. All types of meetings, rallies and processions were forbidden at the crossing near Targaon Hospital from 2pm to 7pm, once the Section 144 was imposed, he said. Extra police were deployed there, Rahman said. Newly-formed BNP Kapasia Upazila unit called a meeting at the crossing for 4pm on Saturday. ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to the BNP chairperson and Gazipur district BNP convenor, was supposed to attend as chief guest. BCL called a meeting at the same place for 3pm, to protest the killing BCL leader Mozammel Haque. Upazila chairman Motahar Hossain Mollah was supposed to attend there. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Gazi Saifuzzaman said BNP had given notice of their meeting on Oct 7. However, he said BCL not give notice earlier. Kapasia police chief Mizanur Rahman said BCL informed him of their meeting only on Friday at 5:30pm, at the same place, and he later informed UNO Saifuzzaman of the matter. BNP's Gazipur chapter condemned the Section 144. In a press release, Gazipur district BNP office coordinator Mazharul Alam said their democratic rights had been trampled by the ban. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Hannan Shah said, "BNP called an organisational meeting after writing for permission of authorities." "But, BCL has been campaigning against us since Friday evening by calling a meeting at the same place to foil ours gathering with the assistance of authorities." Kapasia Upazila Awami League president Ajgar Rashid Khan said, "It was unknown to me that BNP called their meeting at the place. It could have been solved between both groups if I knew that earlier." bdn
