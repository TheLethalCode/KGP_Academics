<TITLE> Businesses want PSI system to remain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)--Calls for retaining pre-shipment inspection (PSI) of imports by private agencies, until the country's customs department is efficient enough to conduct such valuations, came from the business community on Sunday, despite the finance minister's criticism of the "ad-hoc system". The country's PSI system was set up as an interim measure nearly a decade ago, in 2000, to ensure government revenue from duties imposed on imports. The National Board of Revenue held a seminar Sunday to hear suggestions from stake holders on whether or not to continue the system, and what should replace it, as the contract between the government and PSI agencies expires on Dec 31. After that the government has to appoint new agencies or leave the job to the customs department. Finance minister AMA Muhith, while launching Sunday's discussion, said he thought the PSI system running for the last ten years was not beneficiary at all. "The tenure for the system was never fixed; it was extended on an ad-hoc basis which definitely created problems," Muhith said. He also blamed a zoning policy regarding PSI companies for removing the element of competition. "There has been no audit of the system, which is a failure of the NBR," he said. In the face of alleged irregularities against almost all the PSI companies, authorities had initiated the long-pending task of appointing international auditors to scrutinise their works. This is required under rules framed by the government. But no auditor has been appointed to date. The initiative was abandoned in mid-course by the past caretaker government. But, Muhith said, it would not be easy to replace the system as the customs department was still not efficient enough to handle the job. The NBR has always maintained that PSI was a temporary measure and the system would be replaced after equipping the customs department to take over the responsibilities. Meanwhile, the business community has called for keeping the system in place on the same grounds. "Since our customs department is not properly equipped it would be not wise to eliminate the system," said Abdul Haque, a director of FBBCI, the country's apex trade body. But he said that many important regulations of the PSI guideline were still not implemented. "Also the central and local monitoring committees are not active." Touching on the present PSI scenario, Haque said that cases of under invoicing and misdeclarations were also on the rise. The PSI system was first introduced on a voluntary basis in 1992, but was made mandatory in 2000 on pressure from the international community. Upon its original expiry in 2003, NBR did not hand the job back to the customs department for reason of inadequacy and inefficiency of the department to handle the work. The NBR went for a six-month extension of the PSI agencies' contracts disregarding the rule of extending them by international tender. Cyclic extensions of six-monthly instalments followed one another, for a period of two years till 2005, when the NBR went for a new tender, promising it would be the last term of the PSI system. But, it again went for a tender to appoint the current PSI agencies whose contracts will expire again at the end of 2009.
