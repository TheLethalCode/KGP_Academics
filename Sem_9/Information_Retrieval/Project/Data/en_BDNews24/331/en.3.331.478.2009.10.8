 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Subscription of Grameenphone's initial public offering (IPO) closed on Thursday, apparently hugely oversubscribed as long queues of aspirants were seen at the banks, even on the last day. Grameenphone is looking to raise Tk 486 crore by floating over 69 million ordinary shares, making it the largest-ever IPO in Bangladesh's capital market. Subscriptions for the long-awaited IPO opened on Sunday and created a rush of investors which led banks to open extra desks to facilitate the huge submissions. Though the subscription closed on Thursday for locals, non-resident Bangladeshis can submit their applications until October 18. Officials related to the process, however, failed to provide figures of subscription. "We can't say how much, but it has been over subscribed several times," Silmat Chisti, head of the issue manager company, Citigroup Global Markets Bangladesh Private Limited, told bdnews24.com on Thursday. IPO applications have been collected at 503 branches of 15 selected banks and the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, a huge number of BO (beneficiary owner's) account has been opened since reports of GP's IPO finalisation came in the media. According to estimations from brokerage house officials, some 1,50,000 new BO accounts -- a tenth of the total number in the country -- had been opened in the past three months. Around 28,000 new BO accounts were opened alone on Sunday, the opening day of GP subscription, according to figures obtained from the Central Depository Bangladesh Ltd (CDBL), the authority that maintains BO account details. Due to the huge pressure, the CDBL had to extend its working hours to 7pm upon request from brokerage houses from Sunday. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug 20 cleared the country's largest mobile-phone operator to float 69,439,400 ordinary shares of Tk 10 each, in addition to a Tk 60 premium per share, The pre-IPO or private placement of Tk 486.07 crore was completed in Dec last year.
