 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Development Bank is extending $744 million in loans to Bangladesh 'to help the government overcome the impact of global economic crisis and implement public policy reforms,'. ADB's board of directors on Tuesday approved a loan of $500 million under the countercyclical support facility (CSF) that would support the government's effort to mitigate the worst effect of global economic downturn in short term and continue development programmes, an ADB press release says. The bank also approved three other loans of $244 million in total under the public expenditure support facility (PESF). These loans would support the government's measure to introduce economic and social policy reforms essential for achieving higher and more inclusive long term growth as well as strengthening social safety net programmes. Director general of ADB's South Asia department Kunio Senga said, "The CSF loan will provide crucial support to the government as it acts to stimulate Bangladesh's economic recovery and push ahead with its social safety net programmes to cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable while maintaining macroeconomic stability." "The PSEF is equally vital to help the government deliver key public policy reforms to improve service delivery, enhance the efficiency of social safety net programmes, especially for the poorest and the most vulnerable, including women, promote public-private partnerships and improve the investment climate, and strengthen management of scarce public resources," Kunio added. The loans follow a visit to Bangladesh in July by ADB president Haruhiko Kuroda, where he offered to provide additional ADB assistance. This CSF approval for Bangladesh brings total CSF loans to $2.5. Previous CSF loans have been approved for the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Viet Nam and Indonesia. The CSF loan has a five year repayment term, with a three year grace period, and will cost around 200 basis points over ADB's financial cost, pricing that reflects spreads prior to the onset of global economic crisis.
