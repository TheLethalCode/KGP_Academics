 Rajshahi, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)A Rajshahi court on Saturday gave police seven days to grill seven suspected operatives of banned Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh, including its Rajshahi division chief, arrested earlier in the week. Rajshahi metropolitan magistrate BM Tariqul Kabir ordered remand of the seven on request of Boalia model police station sub-inspector Hafizur Rahman, also investigation officer in a case accusing the detained men of militant activities. The counter-militancy cell of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Special Branch, with the help of local police, launched joint drives in the Rajshahi metropolitan area, Naogaon and Natore on Wednesday and Thursday, which netted the seven militants. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Sarder Nurul Amin, at a news conference on Friday, said the arrestees included JMB Rajshahi divisional commander Ashraf Haider alias Abdur Razzak and Naogaon district JMB chief Hafez Abdur Rahim, Natore district JMB chief Shahab Uddin, along with four other JMB operatives. Amin said they were planning to carry out destructive activities. He said the drives against the JMB men were carried out after a successful drive in July and August against the recently emerged militant outfit, 'Islam o Muslim', in Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj, despite the fact that JMB had been running their activities more carefully and changed strategy after arrests of 'Islam o Muslim' activists. The seven men were being grilled under police custody, RMP East Zone deputy commissioner Sajjadur Rahman said. Boalia model police chief Jashim Uddin said a case was underway. The banned JMB has traditionally been most active in Rajshahi since its formation by notorious militant Shaikh Abdur Rahman . JMB created headlines nationally and internationally after carrying out the serial countrywide bombings in 2005. Kingpins Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Siddiqur Rahman, alias 'Bangla Bhai', were eventually arrested and executed during the immediate past caretaker government regime. bdn
