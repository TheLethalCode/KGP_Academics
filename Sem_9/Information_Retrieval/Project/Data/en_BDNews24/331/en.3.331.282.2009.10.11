 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Sunday acquitted former communications minister Anwar Hassain Manju in a case on charges of possessing liquor illegally. Metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashirullah made the order on an appeal by the chairman of the Jatiya Party (Manju). Manju had filed the appeal on June 28 on his return home from abroad after the national elections. "The ruling was expected since it was a harassment case," Manju told reporters after the ruling. The former communications minister was sentenced to five years in jail in the case in his absence on June 26, 2007 during the regime of the caretaker government. On March 8 that year, the joint forces seized 21 bottles of foreign liquor during a raid at Manju's Dhanmondi home. Later, Dhanmondi sub-inspector Mostak Hossain filed a case against Manju under the Narcotics Control Act.
