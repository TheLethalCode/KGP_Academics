<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Tuesday directed the government and the jail authorities to question former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu at the jail gate in the murder case regarding the grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. The bench of justice Syed Md Dastagir Hossain and Justice Roisuddin also asked the authorities to make arrangements for his treatment. Additional attorney general A K M Zahirul Haque told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the HC had ordered to grill Pintu at the jail gate and make arrangement for his treatment. Dhaka's Third Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Sunday gave the CID police another three days to question Pintu. Advocate Khandaker Mahbub Hosain, lawyer for Pintu, said in the hearing his client was tortured during remand. The CID police tried to realise confessional statement by torturing him, Mahbub alleged. "The remand will come to an end on Wednesday. He might be taken into remand again. "That's why I have appealed for questioning him at the jail gate," the lawyer said. Pintu was arrested on Jan 17, 2008 in the case. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the killing and explosives cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. b
