 Chittagong, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Member of parliament for Chittagong-3 ABM Abul Kashem Master apologised on Saturday for an incident involving an assault on four journalists earlier in the week, during an alleged bid to illgally occupy four shipyards in Sitakunda. The journalists were injured when the MP's sons SM Al-Mamun and SM Al-Noman, aided by their bodyguard and a gang, reportedly stormed the shipyards and hung up a signboard of Unique Enterprise, a firm owned by Mamun. Staff reporter Pranab Paul and photographer Rashed Mahmud of leading Bangla-language daily Prothom Alo, Samakal's Sitakunda correspondent Mohammad Sekandar and another local journalist Forkan Abu were assaulted by the gang as they tried to report on the incident. Kashem told bdnews24.com on Saturday, "I have apologised to them for the unfortunate incident." Also speaking to bdnews24.com, Mamun Abdullah, reporter-in-charge at the Alo's Chittagong office, quoted the MP as saying: "I am sorry for the incident. I am unconditionally apologising." Abdullah said Kashem visited the newspaper's office Saturday afternoon, and also assured all help to authorities to catch Mahmudul Hasan Manna, his sons' bodyguard, who the four journalists say led the shipyard grabbing bid and the assault on them as the MP's sons looked on. Chittagong Press Club president Abu Sufiyan and Prothom Alo's residential editor Abul Momen and others were also present at the Alo's office during Kashem's visit and statements. Prothom Alo photographer Rashid Mahmud filed a case with Sitakunda police on Thursday, accusing 20 people including Kashem's sons Mamun and Noman and bodyguard Manna of assault, death threats and damage to equipment. The MP also assured a meeting on Friday to hand over the grabbed shipyards to the owners concerned. Sirajuddaula, owner of Pakija Yard, told bdnews24.com, "The MP assured us of handing back the land after gauging it by surveyor." The state minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku on Thursday also vowed action against Abul Kashem's sons and said: "Legal action is being taken against those responsible for this unwarranted incident." "Nobody will be spared," the minister told reporters at the Secretariat. Referring to the land grabbing, he said, "This evil culture has not developed overnight. But we want to get rid of this legacy." bdnews
