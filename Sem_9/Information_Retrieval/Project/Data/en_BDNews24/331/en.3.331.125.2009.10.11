 Dhaka, bdnews24.com--Maj Gen Ehteshamul Huq, the military secretary to the president, has been transferred to the army's Rangpur-based division as its general officer commanding, a highly-placed government official said Sunday night. The general was linked Sunday by Prothom Alo newspaper to militants who had been charged with launching an attack on Sheikh Hasina on Sep 26, 2001 during the election campaign. The official, who declined to be identified in this report, insisted the transfer had nothing to do with the media report. The official said Huq had already been transferred from the president's office and that the prime minister, also the defence minister, had already given the go-ahead to the two-star general moving to the 66 Division in northern Bangladesh. "Maj Gen Huq's transfer has nothing to do with the latest media report," the official said, and added the general, then a lieutenant colonel, had been investigated and cleared by the army after the alleged militants mentioned him during an interrogation. A Bangabhaban official told bdnews24.com that the Rangpur GOC, Maj Gen Abul Kalam M Humayun Kabir, would replace Huq as MSP.
