 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Myanmar is not mobilising troops in the border as reported by some Bangladeshi media, foreign minister Dipu Moni said on Sunday. She also said the military-ruled reclusive country is not violating international laws in erecting barbed-wire fence along Bangladesh border, as well. "Myanmar is constructing fence in their territory conforming to international laws," Moni told reporters at the foreign ministry. "As they are constructing (fence) in their areas, we have nothing to say (about it)," said the minister. The minister's statement came days after the media reported heavy presence of troops along Bangladesh-Myanmar border in Cox's Bazaar district. She also rejected the media reports that Myanmar was mobilising troops in the border. "I had talks with our ambassador, an army officer, in Myanmar and he told me that it was a routine practice, not a military build-up," said Moni. Foreign secretary Mohamed Miajrul Quayes, she said, called the Myanmar ambassador in Dhaka and the envoy said the same. The minister said her ministry had no information on whether Myanmar's border guards were trying to push Rohingya refugees across the border. She will meet with her Myanmar counterpart in Colombo on Oct 15 on the sidelines of Asian Cooperation Dialogue and discuss bilateral relations.
