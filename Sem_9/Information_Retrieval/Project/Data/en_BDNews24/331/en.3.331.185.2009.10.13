<TEXT>
 London, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)In a tribute to the man who founded the first curry house in Britain 200 years ago, London-based Curry Life Magazine launched a very special Taste of Britain Curry Fest at a glittering ceremony in the city on Tuesday. Sake Dean Mahomed established the Hindustani Coffee House in George Street, central London, in 1809. Now, two centuries later, curry restaurants, the majority of which are Bangladeshi run, are a fixture on the British high street. Hundreds of guests, including restaurateurs, curry connoisseurs, chefs, critics or simply lovers of good food, were treated to a superb banquet, music and dancing as a precursor to the Taste of Britain Curry Fest to be held at Sheraton Dhaka Hotel, Bangladesh from October 26-28. To mark the 200 glorious years of the curry business, the Curry Life Magazine organised the celebration dinner and as well as an awards ceremony for chefs. Jim Fitzpatrick MP, the British Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, prominent Asian MP Keith Vaz, His Excellency Dr Sayeedur Rahman Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh, Keith Best, Chief Executive of Immigration Advisory Service (IAS), and Robert Evans, former MEP for London, led the celebrations. Curry Life also gave recognition to British Bangladeshis, who made outstanding contributions for the development of the curry industry in Britain. Syed Belal Ahmed, Editor of Curry Life Magazine, said: "The Curry Business pioneer Sake Dean Mahomed passed away without the recognition he deserved." "He was an extraordinary man who spiced up the life of an entire nation." "And here we are 200 years later, curry is widely recognised as 'Britain's National Dish' and 23 million of us enjoy the spicy creations every year. It's something he could never have hoped in his wildest dreams." "In today's Britain, there has been a tremendous growth of the multi-billion pound 'curry industry' which has restaurants and takeaways in every major British city and town," said Ahmed. As part of the celebrations, Curry Life Magazine and Sheraton Dhaka Hotel have joined forces to give diners at Dhaka a true taste of British Curry by organising Taste of Britain Curry Fest in Bangladesh later this month, he added.
