 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)The government has approved manpower export to Iraq, on a trial basis, for the first time after the Iraq war began in 2003. The decision came close on the heels of last week's appointment of the first Bangladesh ambassador to Iraq in more than six years. Overseas labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com on Sunday, "We've permitted 50 workers to go to Iraq on a trial basis and have asked the recruiting agencies to scrutinise another 1,200 applications." They will be able to leave for jobs there in two to three months if the Iraqi government approves visas, he said. "Iraq could be a significant labour market for us. They have a huge oil industry, though they faced losses in the sector due to the war. They also need many workers for development activities now," he said. "There is a potential demand for two to three lakh Bangladeshi workers in construction, cleaning and other service sectors," the minister said. However, recruiting agencies say Bangladesh is losing opportunities for legitimate manpower export to the Middle Eastern country due to the delays in re-establishing a mission there and the growing numbers of illegal workers entering Iraq. President of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA), Golam Mostafa, told bdnews24.com, "Iraq was a huge potential market. But now the scope is reduced because the government was very late in opening an embassy there." "Moreover, possibility of entering the market legitimately is decreasing due to illegal workers going there." He asked the government to take immediate steps against those involved in trafficking of illegal workers. The Bangladesh mission in Iraq closed when the US and allies launched war. Bangladesh has halted manpower export to the country since then. The government appointed a new ambassador to Iraq on Oct 7 to reopen the mission. A government delegation visited Iraq earlier this year to assess the security issues. They returned with a positive recommendation for resuming manpower exports, saying the war-torn country needs a huge workforce for reconstruction efforts. The delegation also reported that the rate of violence had decreased significantly. Asked about the delay in re-opening the Bangladesh mission in Iraq, the minister told bdnews24.com, "We're late, but working and looking ahead." Regarding the downward trend of manpower export this year, Hossain said, "We sent a huge number of workers to Malaysia in 2007 and 2008, which cannot give a real picture of the manpower export to that country this year. But it's ahead of 2006." According to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), manpower export in 2007 totalled 832,609 workers and 875,055 in 2008, while in 2006 the number was just 381,516. Of the total 686,334 Bangladeshis working in Malaysia in 2008, over 400,000 went there during 2007 and 2008 alone. The minister said, "We've already sent 381,000 workers to various countries this year and are expecting the number to cross 500,000 this year." Some 45,000 workers came back home this year after successfully completing their job durations, Hossain added.
