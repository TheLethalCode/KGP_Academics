<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has ordered Amanullah Aman, a former BNP state minister currently behind bars, to be quizzed within 10 days at the jail gate in an attempted murder case. The order was given by additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Ehsanul Haque, according to a previous High Court order submitted by Aman's lawyers during a remand hearing. Haque however refused Aman bail. The case involving an armed attack on businessman Osman Gani was filed by Gani's brother, Abdul Mannaf, with Mohammadpur police in the capital on May 31 this year. One of the accused gunmen in the case, Ataur Rahman, in a confessional statement said he and others had followed Aman's orders and shot Gani. Aman was arrested at Zia International Airport as he returned from treatment abroad on Sep 30. Detective Branch police produced him in court requesting 10 days to question him in custody. Metropolitan magistrate Farhana Ferdous postponed the remand decision until Oct 8. Aman did not appear in court on Oct 8, but his lawyers Sanaullah Miah and Mohsin Miah told the magistrate that the High Court had ordered police to question him at the jail gate. The lawyers were told to submit the high court order at the next hearing on Oct 12 (Monday), which they did. Gani, a BNP functionary and a businessman from Aman's parliamentary constituency Keraniganj area, told bdnews24.com, "I sought nomination from BNP for Keraniganj constituency, but failed. Later, Aman pressed me to work for the BNP candidate. I didn't do so and Aman sent terrorists to kill me on May 29." The case details, seen by bdnews24.com senior legal affairs correspondent, say Gani and his friend Abdus Sobhan were in a car at Mohammadpur in the capital on May 29 when gunmen stopped the car near Salimullah Road and opened fire. Gani, it was alleged, took five bullets in his body. The detectives had arrested five suspects named Sohel Rana, Alamgir Hossain, Ebadul Islam Badol, G M Morshed Tutul and Ataur Rahman. Asaduzzaman, additional deputy commissioner of DB police, said all five named Aman. b
