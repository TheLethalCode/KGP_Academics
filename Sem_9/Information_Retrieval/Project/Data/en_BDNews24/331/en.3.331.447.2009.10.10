<TITLE> DAB to 'boycott' BMA polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP-backed Doctors Association of Bangladesh announced on Saturday it would boycott elections to the Bangladesh Medical Association as their demand for withdrawal of a supplementary list of candidates had not been met. The DAB also demanded the resignation of the BMA election commissioners. The BMA polls are due on Nov 5. The posts for election include 40 of the executive committee and 287 councillors. Speaking to bdnews24.com, DAB panel candidate for BMA president, Dr AKM Azizul Haque, said, "We are boycotting the elections as it is not possible to hold a fair election under this commission. They have published a supplementary list for the second time beyond rules." "We are demanding the resignation of the election officials," said Haque, who is also president of DAB, which has had majority control of the association since the BNP was in power. DAB set 48 hours last Tuesday demanding the withdrawal of a supplementary list of BMA election candidates that was published later that night following publication of a list of candidates earlier in the day. BMA election commission secretary Lutfur Rahman said a "clerical mistake" during the process of withdrawal of nominations had led to names of 102 valid candidates being omitted in the first list. Haque said Saturday, "We can say that our boycott of the election has effectively already started as the list did not change within 48 hours." DAB swept the BMA elections during the BNP-led four-party alliance government, in power between 2001-2006. At that time BNP allied with Jamaat-e-Islami-backed doctors. The Jamaat-e-Islami-backed doctors are going to run separately in the BMA elections this time under the banner of the National Doctors Forum. Reacting to DAB's decision, Prof Sharfuddin Ahmed, a Swadhinata Chikitsak Parisad candidate for BMA secretary general, said, "It is just their pretext. Because they will not be able to go to voters with their performance during their last tenure." "They cannot withdraw themselves even after they want as the time for withdrawal of candidates is already past." bdnews24
