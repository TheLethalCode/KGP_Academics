 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui has challenged the speaker's authority to give ruling on issues not raised by MP in parliament. "The speaker is the servant of the House, not the master," the minister said in parliament on Monday. Siddiqui's comments came a day after speaker Abdul Hamid expressed his anger over the absence of ministers in the front row. Hamid also said the MPs had turned the parliament floor into a "fish market" as they make noise while the House is in business. "I have gone through Kaul (N M Kaul's book on parliamentary practices) and it says the speaker is the servant of the House, not master," said Siddiqui, who spoke under Rule 300 of the Rules of Procedure which is used for making statement on issues of public importance. "He can only issue rulings when an MP raises a point of order. He cannot give suo moto ruling," the ruling Awami League MP said after the scheduled question-answer session. Siddiqui said Hamid's comment only strengthened the anti-democratic forces and those who tried to make parliamentary democracy "dysfunctional and stigmatised". Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali was presiding over the House when Siddiqui criticised Hamid. "As the speaker and the deputy speaker have responsibility of their own, the ministers have theirs. "The ministers are bound to attend parliament when the MPs make questions on their ministries," said Siddiqui. "The speaker, who is a part of the House, termed parliament a fish market. "If this is a fish market, who are the wholesellers?" he said. Ali said the speaker would certainly make his statement on the minister's comment. Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar told bdnews24.com: "The speaker is the guardian, not servant of the House." Now an MP of main opposition BNP that is boycotting the House, Sircar said the speaker can issue ruling on his own as per the Rules of Procedure. "Rule 316 of the Rules of Procedure has given the speaker sweeping power to run the House." "The Speaker has rightly issued ruling on Sunday." Former whip Rezaul Bari Dina termed the minister's comment a "direct threat" to the neutrality of the speaker. The ex-BNP MP told bdnews24.com, "The minister cannot challenge the speaker's authority. "This is a direct interference into the neutrality of the speaker," he said. Rule 14 of the Rules of Procedure says the speaker is in charge of maintaining discipline in the house and can even call sergeant-at-arms to maintain discipline. bdnews24.
