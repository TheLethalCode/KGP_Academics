 WARSAW, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish President Lech Kaczynski signed the European Union's reform treaty into law on Saturday, leaving the Czech Republic as the only country still to ratify the document. Kaczynski, a eurosceptical conservative, signed the Lisbon Treaty at a ceremony in the presidential palace attended by senior EU officials, including the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. Before signing, Kaczynski stressed that the EU remained a union of sovereign nation states and said it must remain open to new members, including countries in the Balkans and Georgia.
