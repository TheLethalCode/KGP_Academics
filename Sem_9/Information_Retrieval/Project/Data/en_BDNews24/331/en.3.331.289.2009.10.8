<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will be begin their defence of the Ashes in Brisbane in November next year in the first Test of a five-match series, the England and Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia said on Wednesday. The series kicks off at The Gabba from November 25 to 29 followed by Tests in Adelaide and Perth. The traditional Boxing Day Test at Melbourne is next, with Sydney's New Year's Test completing the series. The schedule for the one-day series will be released separately at a later date. England will play three first-class matches before the first Test and a further game between the second and third Tests. "The recent Ashes series between the two sides was the sporting highlight of the summer and has really whetted the appetite of all cricket supporters as England seek to retain the Ashes next winter," ECB chief executive David Collier said in a statement. "It promises to be a great contest and I am sure many thousands of England cricket fans will be eager to purchase tickets when they go on sale and get behind the team in Australia." Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland said: "Australian cricket fans always love an Ashes series and demand for tickets is going to be strong, so it is important to put the dates in diaries now. "I know we have only just finished an Ashes series in England but I also know that the Aussie players and Australian cricket in general are already thinking about the series down under which starts in just over 12 months."
