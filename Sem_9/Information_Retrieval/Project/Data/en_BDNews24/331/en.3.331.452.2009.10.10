<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign minister Dipu Moni has said that settling the maritime boundary disputes with India and Myanmar is critical for Bangladesh's progress. She told reporters in Chandpur on Saturday, "Progress according to our development plans and ensuring best use of our limited resources absolutely requires retrieval of mineral resources from the sea." "It is critical that we settle sea boundary disputes with India and Myanmar." Dipu Moni was speaking just days after announcing that Bangladesh will refer the disputes for compulsory arbitration before a UN tribunal as Myanmar and India have "unfairly" cut off Bangladesh's sea blocks. "We have already given official notifications to the ambassadors [of India and Myanmar] on starting the arbitration process," she said. The foreign minister had told a press briefing last Thursday that the government had opted for compulsory arbitration as Bangladesh had failed to resolve the disputes with the two neighbouring countries in the past 35 years. She said, as per UN practice, a decision, which would be final under international law, was likely to come in four to five years from initiating the arbitration process. The demarcation would establish Dhaka's right to extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal. Dipu Moni, however, added that Dhaka would continue talks with the two neighbours in addition to arbitration. The foreign minister disclosed the arbitration decision a day after prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament that her government would extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal. The government has recently awarded the three offshore blocks to two foreign companies for oil and exploration, with a provision that no exploration can take place in any disputed waters of the blocks. The government endorsed proposals in August on leasing out blocks 5, 10 and 11 to US-based ConocoPhillips and Irish company Tullow Oil. But India has since raised questions over blocks deep sea blocks 5 and 10 and Myanmar has disputed shallow sea block 11 on the grounds of their sea boundary being breached. Dipu Moni was speaking to reporters in Chandpur on Saturday after distributing cheques amongst Shechhashebi Mohila Samiti members under a programme organised by the Women Affairs Directorate. During the programme, held at the conference room of the district administrator, she said, "The government is carrying out all possible activities for women's development. Prime minister Sheik Hasina realises that keeping in step with world developments is not possible by leaving women behind." "About 19 percent of MPs are women this term, for the first time in Bangladesh, a big step ahead." Secretary general of the Women Affairs Directorate Roushan Ara Begum spoke as special guest at the programme. chaired by district administrator Bishwas Muhammed Azim Uddin. Cheques worth Tk 734,780 were handed out to 41 voluntary organisations. bdn
