 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Wednesday cancelled bails for two accused in another case regarding the grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. Fazila Begum of the Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court revoked the bail for Arif Hossain Sumon and Munshi Mohibullah in the murder case on a government petition. The First Metropolitan Special Tribunal on Sept 9 cancelled bails for the two accused in the explosives case. The government earlier petitioned two Dhaka courts against the bail granted in two separate cases. Sumon and Mohibullah secured bail on Aug 12 from speedy trial tribunal judge Mohammed Masder Hossain. On Aug 3, the Speedy Trial Tribunal had ordered further investigation into the grenade attack on a petition by state prosecutors. The court also asked the inspector general of police to submit the investigation report within two months. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as the new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including BNP leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, his brother and alleged grenade supplier, Maolana Tajuddin, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Of them, 13 including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars, while the remaining are on the run. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the two cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. b
