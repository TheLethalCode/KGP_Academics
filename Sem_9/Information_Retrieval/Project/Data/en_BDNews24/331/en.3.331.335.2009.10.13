 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank has directed all banks concerned to submit contact details of their farm loan receivers, in a bid to allow the central bank to monitor loan disbursement direct and to ensure farmers are securing them smoothly. The Bangladesh Bank deputy governor Nazrul Huda told bdnews24.com on Monday, "The initiative will enable the central bank to get direct information from the farmers if they are getting loans properly or are facing any hassles." The central bank has sent a circular to the chief executives of Bangladesh Agri Bank, Rajshahi Agricultural Development Bank, Bangladesh Rural Development Board, and private and foreign owned banks. The circular has asked the bank authorities to include farmers' mobile numbers in their files. If a loan taker does not have a number of their own, the circular asked banks to include an on-request number. The government has set a target of disbursing agro loans of Tk 11,512 crore in the current 2009-10 fiscal year, after making farm loans mandatory for all banks last year. Four nationalised banks and two specialised ones, Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, have been targeted to disburse Tk 8,453 crore alone. The country's 29 private banks have been a Tk 2,594 crore target and 10 foreign banks have been set to disburse Tk 465 crore. "With the mobile phone numbers of the farmers, we will be able to know if the policy is being complied with properly," Huda said. The central bank governor Atiur Rahman, on July 14, spelled out the agriculture loan distribution target and policy for the current fiscal, with a vow to curb widespread allegations of irregularities in disbursing the loans. According to central bank figures, over Tk 1,271 crore of agro loans has been disbursed in the first two months (July-August) of the current fiscal, some Tk 300 crore up from the previous fiscal's corresponding period. In 2008-09, agro loan distribution target was Tk 9,389 crore. bdn
