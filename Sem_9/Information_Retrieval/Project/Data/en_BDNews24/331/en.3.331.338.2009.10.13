<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani court quashed on Monday two cases against an Islamist militant leader whom India accuses of masterminding last year's Mumbai attacks, but he remains under virtual house-arrest. The court ruling is likely to anger India, which says the militant leader, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, was the mastermind behind last November's assault on Mumbai in which 166 people were killed. Pakistani police last month lodged two complaints against Saeed for delivering a speech on jihad, or Muslim holy war, and appealing for funds for his charity, the Jammat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Saeed had lodged an appeal against the cases and a two-member bench of the court decided in his favour. "The petition has been accepted and the cases are quashed," the court in the eastern city of Lahore said in an order. Saeed's lawyer argued that his JuD charity was not banned and therefore Saeed should be allowed to make speeches and collect funds. Reacting to the verdict, India said the cases quashed were not related to the Mumbai attack and that it expected Pakistan to act against Saeed. "We are still insisting that Hafiz Saeed was the brain behind Mumbai blast and the government of Pakistan must conduct an investigation and bring those responsible for the Mumbai attack to justice," Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna told the Times Now television station. India wants Pakistan to prosecute Saeed, founder of the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group, before it resumes a peace process put on hold after the Mumbai attack. Pakistan says Saeed was being investigated and he would be arrested if solid evidence against him was found. Pakistan has acknowledged that the Mumbai attack was plotted and partly launched from its soil and has put on trial seven suspects. Pakistan detained Saeed in December, after a UN Security Council resolution put him and his charity on a list of people and organisations supporting al Qaeda. But a court released him in June on grounds of insufficient evidence, prompting the government to appeal to the Supreme Court for his re-arrest. That case is pending while Saeed remains under virtual house arrest after Pakistani authorities curbed his movements last month, citing security reasons. A spokesman for Saeed said policemen were still deployed outside his home in Lah
