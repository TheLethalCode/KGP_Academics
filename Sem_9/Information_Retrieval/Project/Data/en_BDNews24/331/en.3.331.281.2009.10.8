 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition party BNP has given its endorsement to the proposed agreement with foreign companies on exploration of gas in three Bay blocks, a day after the prime minister vowed to go ahead with the exploration. But the party demanded that the conditions of the deal be made public. "We are not against gas extraction. Initiatives must be taken to use the extracted gas to develop the country," secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Thursday. "But the public need to be informed beforehand under which conditions the foreign companies are being allowed to extract gas, what are the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement. "The people have the right to know if those conditions safeguard the national interest," he told reporters at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday told parliament that her government was determined to extract oil and gas from the sea at any rate even though some groups are opposed to the move. Clarifying the stance of his party, Delwar said, "We agree with the prime minister's statement. Gas has to be extracted. BNP is not against this." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had said in the weekly question-answer session: "We will definitely extract gas whatever the difficulties." "We will do whatever is required for the development of the country," she said. Delwar asked the government to ensure transparency. "Our national resources should be utilised for national development.The extracted gas has to be used to strengthen the foundation." The government in August approved the proposal to award ConocoPhilips and Tullow Oil plc contracts to explore oil and gas in three blocks in the Bay. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. State-owned exploration authority Petrobangla chairman Moktadir Ali said last week that Conoco is expected to sign deal in the first week and Tullow in the second week of the current month. The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources and Power and Port--a pressure group of left-leaning professionals and politicians-- is protesting against the deals which it claims would allow the two foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of gas extracted. The government has said the committee is confusing the public on the issue with such false information. Not against Asian Highway either The BNP secretary-general took a question on the Bangladesh's move to join proposed Asian Highway Network. "BNP does not oppose the Asian Highway. It was our government that proposed the construction of this international road to ESCAP. "But the current government is awarding corridor to India by linking one end of India to the other in the name of Asian Highway. This is not acceptable. The current unrest in the northeastern Indian states may spill over through 'the corridor' to Bangladesh, he observed. "We don't want that, so the people are against the corridor. Replying to a question, he said BNP favours the route through Chittagong, Myanmar and Thailand to be connected to the highway. The parliamentary standing committee on communications on Sep 2 recommended choosing Benapole-Dhaka-Tamabil or Banglabandha-Hatikumrul-Dhaka-Tamabil routes for the Asian highway The ruling Awami League and the BNP are sharply divided over the selection of the routes of the Asian highway which will ultimately connect Asia with Europe. The AL says the highway should come from India and re-enter into India's northeastern states bordering Bangladesh. But the BNP said the highway must enter Myanmar via Bangladesh with the ultimate target of reaching China through the former Burma. The BNP and its allies say, if the highway passes from and back through India instead of Myanmar, it will make Bangladesh too dependent on India with regard to the international road network. The opposition says the government wants to give India transit facilities, a very politically sensitive issue in Bangladesh, in the name of the Asian highway. Joint secretaries general Mirza Abbas and Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, organising secretary Mohammad Shahjahan were also present among others at the press briefing. bd
