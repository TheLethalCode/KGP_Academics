<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)No local government elections will be possible before March even though parliament has passed laws on city corporation, municipality and union council elections, an election commissioner has said. Muhammed Sohul Hussain told reporters on Monday at his office that the Election Commission was yet to receive copies of the laws. Last Tuesday, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters that they were considering holding Dhaka City Corporation elections at the end of January or early February. "After receiving copies of the laws it would take until February to finalise voter lists, formulate policies and complete all other related works," Sohul said. "So the local government polls will kick off with Dhaka City Corporation election in the first week of March," the commissioner said. The EC will then hold Chittagong City Corporation, municipality and union council elections respectively, he added. Parliament passed The Local Government (City Corporation) Bill 2009 last Monday. The DCC ran its term in May 2007, while the CCC's will expire in May 2010. More that 300 municipalities and most of the 4,500 union councils across the country have already expired. bdn
