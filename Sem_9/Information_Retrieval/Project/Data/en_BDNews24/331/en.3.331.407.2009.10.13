<TEXT>
 KABUL, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai's main election challenger on Monday opened the door to working with his rival in a unity government, softening his opposition to future collaboration with the incumbent. Abdullah Abdullah, 49, who served as Karzai's foreign minister from 2001 to 2006, told Reuters that when the result of the Aug. 20 vote was finally known it was possible to "talk about different scenarios". "At this stage my whole focus will be on the (electoral) process, yes, to get it right and get it on track so the outcome will be acceptable to the people of Afghanistan," said Abdullah. "Post announcement (of the result) there will be a new environment." Abdullah has in the past ruled out returning to a Karzai government, but in the interview he suggested his stance could soften after the election result is announced. Asked if he still ruled it out, he replied: "At the moment that is my position." When asked if that position could change, he responded: "Take it as it is, but different ideas and different scenarios could be talked about in their context rather than the context of today's situation where we have to focus on the (election) process." Hundreds of ballot boxes are still being checked for cheating, nearly two months after Afghans trudged to the polls. The vote was widely condemned as highly fraudulent and state bodies systematically acted to favour Karzai, says Abdullah. Rows have erupted over how the fraud can be corrected. Abdullah said he was satisfied with the election watchdog's procedures and remained convinced it would declare sufficient votes invalid to require a run-off round between him and Karzai. "It looks like it will be impossible for him to win (in the first round)," said Abdullah, an urbane, fluent English-speaking eye doctor. "Fraud will not be ignored." Karzai won a preliminary 54.6 percent of the vote, to Abdullah's 27.8 percent. Around 1 million of the 5.66 million votes cast would have to be found fraudulent to push Karzai below the 50 percent level needed to trigger a second round. AGENDA OF CHANGE The fraud and protracted election has damaged Karzai's standing and delayed decisions by Washington on adding more U.S. forces to the 100,000-strong international force battling a Taliban insurgency stronger than ever after eight years of war. Abdullah said a unity government could reclaim some of the legitimacy lost to fraud and misrule under Karzai, giving Western powers the "credible" partner they need to justify the money and troops they have sent to stabilise Afghanistan. Setting out his conditions for cooperation, Abdullah said he wanted a government formed that would have "an agenda of change", be staffed on the basis of competence rather than personal loyalty and have a clear vision for the country. In the fierce pre-vote battle for allegiances, Karzai secured the backing of ethnic chiefs and ex-warlords, some with notorious human rights records. Abdullah said Karzai had effectively offered government posts in return for votes, which would frustrate the government's Western backers who want competent technocrats rather than corrupt loyalists in senior positions. "It's a clear cut deal -- ministries, authorities in exchange for votes, regardless of the issues of good governance, competence and effectiveness," said Abdullah. "The first victim of such tactical deals will be good governan
