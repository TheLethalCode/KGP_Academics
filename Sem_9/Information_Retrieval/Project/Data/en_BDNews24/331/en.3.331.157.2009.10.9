 OSLO, Oct 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai is among favourites to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday from a record field including a Chinese dissident and an Afghan human rights activist, Norway's NRK television said. The prize, widely viewed as the world's top accolade, will be announced in Oslo at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) at the Nobel Institute by Thorbjorn Jagland, a former Norwegian Prime Minister who heads the five-member committee. "Will the peace prize go to Tsvangirai?" public broadcaster NRK asked in a headline over a story about the prize on Thursday evening with a large picture of the prime minister on its website.

It might be a bad time to give the prize to a dissident when the United States wanted closer ties with China. COLOMBIA From Colombia, peace broker Piedad Cordoba is also among tips but NRK noted that she had been criticised for close ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. French Colombian activist and former hostage Ingrid Betancourt, freed last year after more than five years in captivity, was also among favourites. And NRK said that Afghan rights activist Sima Samar and Jordanian interfaith dialogue advocate Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad were among the final names considered. NRK did not mention any other candidates -- including US President Barack Obama who is also among the bookmakers' front-runners. Norwegian independent TV2 said that Obama could be a strong candidate.
