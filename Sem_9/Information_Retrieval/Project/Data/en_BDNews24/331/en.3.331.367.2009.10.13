 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday stayed the sentence awarded to former state minister for civil aviation Mir Nasiruddin in a case for amassing illegal wealth. The bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir Hossain and Md Raisuddin made the order on a petition filed by the BNP leader. Barrister Mir Helaluddin, son of Mir Nasir told reporters after the ruling that the sentence would be halted until the resolution of the appeal. A special court in Dhaka on July 4, 2007 sentenced the former state minister to 13 years in jail. Nasir later filed an appeal against the verdict. The Anti-Corruption Commission had filed the case with Gulshan Police Station on March 6, 2007. Nasir was arrested on Feb 3, 2007 and got bail in the case last year. bdnews
