<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Demand for around 200 megawatt power has dropped after the government put the clock back one hour in June, the state minister for power said on Thursday. "Load-shedding has eased to some extent compared with the past days," Enamul Haque said in parliament, replying to a written query from MP Nilufar Chowdhury Moni. Power systems loss is down to 15 percent, he also said, replying to a supplementary query from another MP. The junior minister had said on Oct 3 that his government had no plans to change Daylight Saving Time at the moment as "power is being saved ." "[We] have been reaping benefits from it. [I] don't see anything bad here," he said. "There is no need to confuse people with [the changed] timetable." He said it was just a matter of getting habituated to the DST. "It will continue, as we now have been accustomed to [Daylight Saving Time], until we feel otherwise." After a cabinet decision on June 1, the country clocked in DST an hour ahead to 12 midnight at 11pm on June 19 in a bid to save power. The government had then said it would continue until further announcement, but later it said that the measure would be withdrawn from Oct 1 ahead of winter. In another query from MP Nasimul Alam Chowdhury for Comilla-8, the state minister said that Power Development Board has cut off 3,628 illegal connections across the country from July 1 to 15. bd
