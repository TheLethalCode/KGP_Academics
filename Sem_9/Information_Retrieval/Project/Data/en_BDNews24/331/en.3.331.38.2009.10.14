 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said that discussing report of investigation about former speaker, deputy speaker and chief whip was unprecedented. He made the comment on Wednesday in an initial reaction to the decision of parliament on Tuesday to seek action against Delwar, former chief whip, former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui for "corruption, abuse of office and public money. "There are no precedent of discussions taking place in parliament after submission of report or any mention of anything of this sort in the constitution," Delwar said at the BNP office in Naya Paltan. "The government is using the parliament to carry out 'evil activities'. They are manufacturing charges and giving them the parliament's seal and sending them to the Anticorruption Commission. "They are trying to hamper legal judgement in this manner. Speaker Abdul Hamid Tuesday refused to allow MPs to vote on a proposal to strip Sircar of his membership on corruption charges that a parliamentary probe found true. But the House unanimously passed a set of resolutions which included referring the charges against Sircar, now a BNP MP, to the Anticorruption Commission for further action. Delwar also dismissed the investigation committee formed against them in the parliament as illegal, unconstitutional and politically motivated. On March 19, Speaker Hamid formed an 11-member probe-body to investigate the validity of charges of corruption, misuse of authority and public funds against three. The probe committee submitted its report on July 9. The 784-paged report had attached evidences of the charges of corruption, misuse of power and embezzling government funds brought against the three. Party vice president MK Anwar said, "The corruption investigation report of more than seven hundred pages has no evidence on the charges brought. They could not show a single case where something beyond the law took place." Joint secretary Mirza Abbas and others were present during the media briefing.
