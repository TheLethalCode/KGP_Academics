 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh should not be worried about the recent activities of neighbouring Myanmar along the frontiers, the state minister for home said on Wednesday. "There is nothing to panic about Myanmar. But there should be some cautions," Shamsul Haq Tuku said while exchanging views with journalists at his office. The government is vigilant and alert to tackle any situation, he said. The state minister referred to the erection of barbed-wire fence and mobilisation of troops along the border within the Myanmar territory. "The duty of the government is to safeguard sovereignty and law and order of the country. It is working with caution to tackle the situation by observing the overall condition," Tuku said. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said on Sunday Myanmar was constructing fence inside their territory conforming to international laws. She also rejected the media reports of heavy mobilisation of troops along Bangladesh-Myanmar border across Cox's Bazaar district. Asked whether there is any quarter inside the government linked to the militants, Tuku said: "The government will take stern action against anybody found having any link with militancy." "The government is determined to root out militancy. It will continue with its efforts," he said. Curbing and uprooting of militancy is an ongoing process, the junior minister said. "The law enforcers are taking necessary steps from their own position," he said. A motivation committee was formed in April after the government came to office in January to create public awareness against militancy. The committee has conducted a number of campaigns to create public awareness. bdnew
