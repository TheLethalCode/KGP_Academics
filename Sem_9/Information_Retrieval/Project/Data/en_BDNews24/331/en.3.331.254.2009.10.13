<TITLE> Maoists hit poll booth in India state elections </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Local elections were held in three states on Tuesday with some Maoist violence aimed at disrupting a vote seen as a key test of the ruling Congress party's popularity since its landslide national win in May. The polls in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh could also help dictate the pace and scope of reform measures such as disinvestment in state-run firms and reviving economic growth. Analysts say a good performance in the state polls could convince Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the government can tackle key reforms and a new tax code without any electoral cost. Maoists and police exchanged fire near a polling booth in the forested, rebel stronghold of Gadchiroli in Maharashtra where they killed 17 police last week. Navy, air force and paramilitary forces guarded the financial hub of Mumbai, which was attacked by Islamist gunmen last year, killing 166 people. "Polling is going on peacefully all over the state except for this one incident," A.N. Roy, a top police officer overseeing election security in Maharashtra told NDTV news channel, referring to the Maoist attack. Singh has called the Maoists one of the gravest threats to India's security and last week chaired a meeting of the cabinet to plan a big strike. A weak and divided Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition Hindu nationalist party, may help the Congress retain most of the 90 seats in Haryana and 60 seats in Arunachal Pradesh. But in prosperous Maharashtra, where the Congress and its Nationalist Congress Party ally are battling a combination of the BJP and the hardline Hindu party Shiv Sena for 288 seats, an anti-incumbency sentiment may make the race tougher. The breakaway faction of Shiv Sena, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, could also split the vote, perhaps leading to a hung assembly and delaying projects such as plans to upgrade Mumbai's crumbling infrastructure. "For the two national parties, the Congress and the BJP, the Maharashtra vote is not just the first big contest after the (national) election. It could impact their national strategies significantly," the Indian Express daily said in an editorial. Counting of the electronic vote is scheduled for Oct. 22.
