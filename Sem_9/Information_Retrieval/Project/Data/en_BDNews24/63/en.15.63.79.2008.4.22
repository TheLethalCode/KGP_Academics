<TITLE> Marijuana loses ground to silkworms in the Philippines </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KAPANGAN, Philippines, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of white mulberry trees have started to cover mountain slopes deep in the northern Philippines' Cordillera region, changing not just the landscape but also making over the image of a poor farming town. Up until a few years ago, the upland villages of Kapangan, a town of 18,000 people in Benguet province, were known as one of the country's largest cultivation areas for marijuana. "We've started something to erase that tag," Roberto Canuto, Kapangan's mayor told Reuters. "We're determined to be known as something else, perhaps the silk capital of the country." Canuto said some farmers started growing mulberry trees, the main food of silk-producing worms from China and Japan, after sericulture was introduced in nine of Kapangan's 15 villages in late 2004. "We're expanding the mulberry plantation to accommodate more farmers willing to go into silkworm operations," he said. Many farmers became interested in the silk industry after trials produced about 25 kilos of raw silk that sold for $50 per kilogram early this year. "This could be the perfect alternative to marijuana ... This could give us extra cash without taking any risks," said Wilbur Teofilo, a leader of a farmers' cooperative in Kapangan that is upgrading 11 "rearing houses" and building nine more to raise raw silk production to 250 kilos every two months this year. Fe Donato, an official from the Fibre Industry Development Authority, said the silkworm project could produce as much as 2,000 kilos of raw silk every year once operations expand in two years time. This could bring in an extra 4 million pesos ($95,690) for the farmers. Most farmers will not admit to having cultivated marijuana before getting into sericulture. But growing the illegal plant was cheap and profitable and relatively easy work. In its 2008 International Narcotics Control Strategy report, the United States' State Department said marijuana had regained popularity in the Philippines and the drug was also being exported to Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. The report, citing data from the Philippines' Dangerous Drug Board (DDB), had identified at least 60 cultivation sites in the country's northern mountain regions and on the troubled southern islands of Mindanao, Jolo, Basilan and Tawi-tawi. In an earlier interview with Reuters, DDB chairman Anselmo Avenido said about 20 new cultivation sites had been discovered since the start of the year even though security forces uprooted 2.5 million plants in 2007. Avenido said the presence of Maoist-led guerrillas and Muslim militants around most of the cultivation sites had complicated the government's efforts to eradicate marijuana sites. Intelligence reports said about 17 percent of proceeds from production bases were used to fund activities of communist New People's Army (NPA) rebels, including buying weapons and training and feeding more than 5,000 cadres. TUBER, FLOWERS AND WORMS Avenido said reducing drug supply was only one part of the government's efforts to overcome the problem. His office was also pushing for programmes to cut demand, raise awareness, cooperate with counterparts abroad and offer alternative livelihood. Dionisio Santiago, head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, said it was studying how Thailand had wiped out its poppy fields by offering farmers viable alternatives. "We've been doing lots of experiments but our initial tests met some problems," Santiago said, adding that the planting of a medicinal tuber, known as "yacon", did not take off due to a lack of commercial demand. Although there were still some farmers planting the tubers, others had gone into cut flowers, Santiagp said. Anti-narcotics agencies have pledged to invest more in the sericulture project if silk-making succeeds in cutting marijuana supply. Teofilo said farmers in his village were willing to give the silkworm project a try because raw silk production could also be a profitable business. "What's important for us was to find new ways to improve our finances through honest means," he said. ($1=41.80 Philippine Pes
