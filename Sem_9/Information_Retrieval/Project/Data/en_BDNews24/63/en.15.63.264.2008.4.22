 London, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stock markets felt the pinch of banking stress on Tuesday as Royal Bank of Scotland unveiled a hefty rights issue, while inflation pressures stayed on the boil as oil prices neared record highs. The euro remained below last week's record highs versus the dollar, with investors focused on further fallout from the global credit crunch after property lender Dusseldorfer Hypothekenbank was taken over by the German banking association. RBS announced a record 12 billion pound rights issue to cover a potential 5.9 billion pound writedown on the value of toxic assets and help to rebuild a stretched balance sheet. Although the rights issue was broadly in line with expectations, RBS shares shed 2 percent in early trade, while the FTSEurofirst 300 Index of leading shares fell 0.4 percent before paring losses as resource stocks rose. "Coming in at 12 billion pounds, accompanied by a dividend cut and an interim dividend in shares, this (RBS rights issue) is definitely at the top end of consensus, but is not really a surprise," said Stephen Surpless, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "As this could be the first in a string of capital raising moves by European banks, attention could turn to the next likely candidate." Europe followed Asia's lead after Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.1 percent, weighed by autos and falling financial stocks on worries about the U.S. banking sector. World stocks on a MSCI measure were down 0.18 percent at 383.25. Investors hoping for a glimmer of recovery were mostly under-whelmed by a Bank of England plan announced on Monday to help ease UK mortgage market strains. Softer than expected results from Bank of America Corp, the biggest U.S. retail bank, also added to jitters. These shattered a tentatively positive outlook on the credit crisis after stronger U.S. bank earnings last week. "The whole stock market is twitchy, the financials in particular, because of the uncertainties going forward of how the economy and bad debts are going to go," said Peter Vann, head of investment research at Constellation Capital Management. Earnings focus is seen turning to non-financials in the U.S., with results due later from Yahoo, AT&T and Dupont. OIL UP, EURO FALLS Inflationary pressures from food and energy costs are set to stay in focus, with crude oil prices close to record highs near $118 a barrel. Oil traders concentrated on geopolitical risks after pipeline attacks in OPEC member Nigeria last week at a time of robust Chinese crude demand. U.S. light crude for May delivery stood at 117.50 a barrel, after prices set a historic high at $117.83 on Monday. The euro stayed below last week's record high near $1.60 as concerns about the European banking sector weighed on the currency despite more hawkish rhetoric from European Central Bank policymakers. Germany's BdB banking association has taken control of Duesseldorfer Hypothekenbank and plans to sell it after the property lender ran into problems linked to the financial crisis. The euro fell a quarter percent to $1.5867 before paring the losses. It was steady at 164.14 yen. "I'm a bit surprised the (euro's) fall wasn't deeper... and now people will be hunting round for other institutions in a similar predicament (which if they come to light) would lead to a more significant correction for the euro," said Adam Myers, market strategist at Credit Suisse. Falls in the euro have been limited by a view that interest rate differentials are set to move further in its favour. The market expects the Federal Reserve to lower US rates further from the current 2.25 percent at a policy meeting on April 29-30. Fresh impetus for such expectations -- which could drag the dollar lower -- could come from US housing data at 1400 GMT with the annual rate of existing home sales seen easing to 4.92 million uni
