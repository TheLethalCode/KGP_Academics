 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi arrives in Dhaka Thursday on a two-day visit, a foreign ministry official said. The ministry confirmed that foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury would receive his Chinese counterpart at Zia International Airport at 3.40pm. The adviser will hold bilateral talks with Jiechi at state guesthouse Padma Thursday, according to the foreign ministry. The Chinese foreign minister will leave for his next destination Pakistan on Friday. Analysts say the Chinese foreign minister's visit to regional countries was aimed at mobilising support in its favour on the Tibet issue and uninterrupted holding of the Olympic Games in Beijing in August.

Some countries have been threatening China of boycotting the inaugural function of the Beijing Olympic. Bangladesh in a statement termed the political unrest an "internal affairs" of China. bdn
