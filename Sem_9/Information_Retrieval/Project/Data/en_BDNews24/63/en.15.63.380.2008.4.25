 Jerusalem, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Palestinian gunman killed two Israeli security guards at an industrial zone on the West Bank boundary on Friday, Israeli military officials said. They said searches were under way for the assailant in an around the Netzanei Oz industrial zone, across the boundary from the Palestinian-ruled town of Tulkarm. "A Palestinian shot dead two guards at the security-check area at the entrance to the industrial zone," a military spokeswoman said. "We are treating this as a terrorist attack. It may have come from the outside, but there are also hundreds of Palestinians who work at Netzanei Oz." There was no immediate claim of responsibility from any armed Palestinian factions.
