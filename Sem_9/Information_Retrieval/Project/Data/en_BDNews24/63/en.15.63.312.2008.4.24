 WASHINGTON, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Wednesday squashed speculation that he might agree to stay on as Pentagon chief under the next president's administration. "The circumstances under which I would do that are inconceivable to me," Gates told reporters. Speculation had circulated in Washington and at the Pentagon that Sen.

Gates did not comment on that speculation, but said he only planned to stay in his job through January 2009, when President George W Bush leaves office
