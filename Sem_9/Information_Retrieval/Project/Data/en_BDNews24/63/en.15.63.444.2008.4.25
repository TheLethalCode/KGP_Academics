<TITLE> Demand for war-crimes trial is 'unjust pressure' on govt: Nizami </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)Matiur Rahman Nizami, chief of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, said Friday that demand for the trial of "war criminals" was meant only to put "unjust pressure" on the government. "Demand for the war crimes trials is a settled issue," said Nizami, speaking at the conference of the party's district chiefs at its central office in Moghbazar. "A quarter is mounting unjust pressure on the government about a settled issue such as this," he said. Alluding to the Awami League, the Jamaat chief said: "They went to power twice in the past but did not think it proper to take up the settled issue." "The government will have to understand why they are making noises and creating pressure over the issue now." Another top Jamaat leader, assistant secretary general Muhammad Qamaruzzman, had earlier stirred a wave of protests by saying: "There is no war criminal in the country." Many Jamaat leaders including Nizami and Qamaruzzaman run up against the allegations of directly opposing the Liberation War. The Jamaat chief said that holding any election other than the national election bypassing the constitution was out of the present caretaker government's jurisdiction. "Sixteen months into the rule of the caretaker government, it seems that there is no alternative to an elected government to run the country properly." Nizami demanded acceptance of the recommendations of the committee to review the national women's development policy. He also demanded that the government annul what he said were the anti-Islam parts of the policy. bdnews24
