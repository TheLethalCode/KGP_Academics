 PARIS, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks slipped in early trade on Tuesday, adding to the previous session's drop as a massive rights issue from Royal Bank of Scotland weighed on the banking sector. But the drop was limited by rallying energy and mining shares, gaining ground as commodity prices remained near historical highs. Rio Tinto gained 2 percent and BP rose 1 percent. At 0834 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.3 percent at 1,307.49 points. RBS announced a record 12 billion pound ($24 billion) rights issue to cover a potential 5.9 billion pound writedown on the value of shaky assets and help rebuild a stretched balance sheet. RBS will offer 11 new shares for every 18 existing shares at 200 pence per share in the rights issue, Europe's biggest ever, representing a 46 percent discount to Monday's closing price. Its shares were down 5 percent at 353.75 pence. The theoretical ex-rights price for the shares is 307p, according to Reuters calculations. "Overshadowing what was going to be a busy day of earnings in the U.S. and Europe is the RBS rights issue. Coming in at 12 billion pounds, accompanied by a dividend cut and an interim dividend in shares, this is definitely at the top end of consensus, but is not really a surprise," said Stephen Surpless, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in London. "As this could be the first in a string of capital raising moves by European banks, attention could turn to the next likely candidate." The DJ Stoxx European bank index was down 1.2 percent, with the UK lenders among the most hit. Barclays was down 4.4 percent and HBOS down 5.5 percent. The RBS rights issue shifted focus from potential writedowns linked to the U.S. housing slump to the need for European banks to raise funds. Another lender ran into problems linked to the financial market crisis on Tuesday, with Germany's BdB banking association taking control of German property lender Duesseldorfer Hypothekenbank BdB said late on Monday that it plans to sell it after the lender ran into problems linked to the financial market crisis. Duesseldorfer Hypothekenbank said it was not facing problems that could threaten its existence. French car maker Renault fell 2.1 percent after posting first-quarter sales that missed analysts' forecasts. Air France-KLM was up 1.7 percent after it formally withdrew its bid for Alitalia, sharply reducing the chances that Europe's biggest airline can be persuaded to buy the Italian flag carrier. Alitalia stock was suspended. On the macroeconomic front, investors will focus on monthly US home sales, due at 1400 GMT, for insight on the outlook for the troubled housing sector. "We saw a surprising rise in US existing home sales last month but we suspect that this is a spike within a downtrend, not the sign of a recovery," Bear Stearns analysts wrote in a note. Investors will keep an eye on a flurry of updates from US companies such as AT&T, Lockheed Martin, McDonald's and Yahoo!. Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.07 perce
