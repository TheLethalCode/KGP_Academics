 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)A prolonged lack of rain is having an adverse effect in the northwestern region with the soil in the districts fast losing the minimum required humidity to sustain life and vegetation. SAARC Meteorological Research Centre director Dr Samarendra Karmakar told bdnews24.com Thursday: "Absence of rain and seasonal heat has caused the northern districts to lose soil humidity and assume a semi-arid character." The annual average rainfall in the southern coasts is about three times higher than in the north, 4,200 mm and 1,400 mm respectively. Since April 19, a moderate heat wave has been active in the southwestern region, causing the temperature in Jessore to shoot up to 30.4 degrees Celsius, which might also affect the middle and northern areas in 2 or 3 more days should the heat wave continue, said Ayesha Akhtar, forecast officer of the Cyclone Forecasting Centre of the Meteorological Department. Karmakar said: "After 2/3 days, the atmosphere may turn a bit restive with the air currents getting activated while tornadoes may also occur." The highest temperature recorded was 45.1 degrees Celsius in 1972 in Rajshahi. Rajshahi maintains the trend and its temperature through the past week was 36 degrees Celsius or above, meteorologists said. Temperature in Rajshahi was recorded at 38.8 degrees Celsius on Friday. The highest temperature in Ishwardi this year was 40.4 degrees Celsius. IUCN country representative Dr Ainun Nishat said that due to climate change, the country was likely to experience recurrent floods and droughts, which would adversely affect the economy. "To address such catastrophes, concerned quarters will have to go for creating or recreating befitting ecosystems, so that they may absorb the shocks and sustain productivity," he said. The chairman of Dhaka University's Soil, Water and Environment Department, Dr Imamul Huq, told bdnews24.com, "We'll have to expand greening our environment so that rainfall increases." "Simultaneously, cropping systems have to be changed to adapt to the drought conditions, which will help the locals stick to their traditional occupation and not turn nomadic." Dr Karmakar said that the periods Apr-May and Nov-Jan tended to be drought periods in Bangladesh that may not be affecting its agriculture adversely. "It might rain soon after April 27," he said. Dr Shahidul Islam of the Department of Agricultural Extension, said, "Well, it would have saved the country a lot of electricity used for operating the irrigation pumps, if it had rained some." Calling the rain forecast 'good news,' he expressed hope that the boro harvesting would pass off without any adversity. bdnews
