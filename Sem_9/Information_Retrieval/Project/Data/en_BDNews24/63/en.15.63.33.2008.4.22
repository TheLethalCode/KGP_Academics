 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)The Rapid Action Battalion Tuesday arrested DESA executive engineer Shamsul Alam Bhuiyan for taking bribe from a utility client. The RAB-10 control room duty officer, Corporal Anwar Hossain, told bdnews24.com that a RAB team had arrested Bhuiyan in a raid on the Kajla power distribution office in Demra. The RAB officer said Abida Sultana Mitu, a Demra resident, filed an application with the office on March 22 to take a power connection to her house. Mitu met the executive engineer after the power connection was not given as promised. Bhuiyan demanded Tk 22,000 from her in return for a quick connection, the RAB officer said. Mitu gave Bhuiyan Tk 10,000, but the connection was not given to her house. Mitu again met Bhuiyan and he demanded the remaining Tk 12,000, prompting her to inform the RAB about the matter, Hossain said. Mitu assured the engineer of giving the rest of the amount on Tuesday and tipped off RAB officials on her move. The RAB members raided the power distribution office when Mitu was giving the money to Bhuiyan. bdnew
