<TITLE> Fixed prices weigh on rod market </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)Prices of mild-steel rod and plates, fixed by the government, threaten to stifle the $1.5 billion market, an industry leader said Tuesday. Zafar Alam, former president of the Bangladesh Ship Breakers Association, told bdnews24.com that a scrap ship was priced at $500 per tonne a year ago on the international marketa rate that now stands at $760. But the government repriced plates at Tk 52,000, 40-grade MS rod at Tk 60,000 and 60-grade MS rod at Tk 62,000 per tonne, apparently without taking into account fluctuating prices on the world market. Those who had bought scrap ships before the government fixed the prices could supply plates at reset prices, but the buyers of scraps at the current rate will not be able to do so, Zafar added. "It isn't possible to sell plates at prices lower than the purchase prices," he added, referring to eroding profit margins for businessmen. "Many ship breakers decided not to import any scrap ship. It will adversely affect the supply of raw materials to the rod manufacturing factory," Zafar warned. Leaders of the associations of ship-breakers, steel millers and re-rolling mills owners had wanted the prices of plates to be fixed at Tk 56,000, 40-grade rod at Tk 64,000 and 60-grade rod at Tk 70,000 per tonne. Zafar claimed the market would regain pace if prices were fixed as recommended. The ship-breaking sector accounted for 90 percent of rod output in the country five years ago, but the intake came down to 40 percent as imports of scrap ships slowed. The government Tuesday formed a committee to find out the reason for a hike in the prices of MS rod. Housing and public works secretary MSM Rashidul Hye heads the seven-member committee. Bangladesh has demand for 2.5 million tonnes of MS rod a year. More than 80 percent of mostly non-graded or low quality rods are supplied by the country's re-rolling mills. The $1.5 billion market is growing at a double-digit rate. bdnew
