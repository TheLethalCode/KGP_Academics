 Hong Kong, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Tuesday as investors flinched at yet more bad news from the banking sector and an oil price creeping towards a record $118 a barrel. Investors hoping for a glimmer of recovery took solace from a supportive plan from the Bank of England on Monday but that optimism was shredded by bleak results from Bank of America Corp , the biggest U.S. retail bank, and likely capital raising by British banks, led by Royal Bank of Scotland Bank of America missed market forecasts with a 77 percent drop in quarterly profit and said the effects of the housing slump may take the rest of 2008 to work out U.S. regional bank National City Corp, which posted a quarterly loss, slashed its dividend and said it was raising $7 billion in capital Asian banking shares such as National Australia Bank Ltd fell, 1.5 percent by 0133 GMT, dragging Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index down 0.8 percent after it rose more than 3 percent to a two-week closing high on Monday. "The whole stock market is twitchy, the financials in particular, because of the uncertainties going forward of how the economy and bad debts are going to go," said Peter Vann, head of investment research at Constellation Capital Management. "Some of the U.S. banks are definitely going to have some large losses or a considerable reduction in profits because of all the riskier activities." Japan's Nikkei average fell 1.1 percent, led by blue chips such as Honda Motor Co Ltd and Canon Inc as investors locked in profits after a five-day winning streak. Top broker Nomura Holdings Inc fell 3.8 percent on news of an insider-trading probe MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was 0.4 percent lower. There was no let up for fuel-dependent producers as oil prices stayed close to a record high of $117.83 a barrel, hit on Monday after rebel attacks cut Nigerian supplies and a Scottish refinery strike threatened North Sea crude production. U.S. light crude held steady at around $117.48 a barrel and London Brent crude was at $114.50. In Seoul, shares in some Samsung Group units fell after chairman Lee Kun-hee, indicted last week for tax evasion, said he was quitting his post at South Korea's largest conglomerate. In a major reshuffle, Samsung is to dismantle its powerful strategic planning office, which critics say is an opaque organisation wielding influence across dozens of affiliates, including Samsung Electronics, a world leader in computer memory chips. MORE BAD BANK NEWS More bad news from banks could be on the way, with Britain's RBS set to announce Europe's biggest-ever rights issue and over $10 billion of losses on investments, which could see other British banks follow suit. As pressure grows on the world's largest lenders to shore up balance sheets battered by the credit crunch, Britain's second-biggest bank will seek to raise up to 12 billion pounds ($24 billion), people familiar with the matter have said. The Bank of England unveiled a plan on Monday to swap banks' risky mortgage assets for at least 50 billion pounds ($99 billion) of government debt. The stock market's weakness and worries about the banks' health added to the appeal of Japanese government bonds. June 10-year futures were up 0.07 point at 138.11. "These developments show it is still too early to remove credit market concerns, and offer opportunities for investors to buy on dips," said Mari Iwashita, a senior market economist at Daiwa Securities SMBC. But bond investors took a cautious approach, mindful that the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates again at its meeting next week while monthly jobs data, also due next week, may underscore the weakness in the U.S. economy. "Not many investors have the strength to take huge risks by betting on a direction, so their cautious stance keeps trading in ranges, especially before the Fed and the jobs data," he said. The dollar weakened after the Bank of America result and remained depressed in Asian trade, trading at 102.83 yen having fallen from a seven-week peak of 104.66 yen last week. The euro also gained after European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher said there was no reason for pessimism on eurozone growth, suggesting the ECB would keep rates at a six-year high of 4 percent for a while. "Investors feel more comfortable picking up the euro thanks to its yield advantage over the dollar," said Hiroshi Yoshida, a forex trader at Shinkin Central Bank. "It's only a matter of time before the euro hits the key $1.6 level as investors believe there are fewer risks in buying the euro." The euro was steady from Monday's late U.S. level at $1.5918 not far from last week's record high of $1.5985.
