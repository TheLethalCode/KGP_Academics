 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)A faction of Islami Oikya Jote, led by Fazlul Haque Amini, demanded freedom for former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, in talks with caretaker government advisers Monday. Leaders of the Islamist party in pre-dialogue talks with four advisers also demanded immediate implementation of the recommendations by a committee formed to review the government's women development policy. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman represented the government in the meeting at state guesthouse Meghna. Ten leaders of the outfit were present at the talks. Amini told reporters: "We want a free and peaceful election. An election date has to be announced soon. Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia have to be released." During the talks, Amini said, his party demanded an end to the state of emergency and an immediate publication of the electoral roll. Adviser Hassan Ariff said: "Oikya Jote leaders have given their opinion on qualitative changes expected in politics and the polls." The Islamist outfit asked the government to put up billboards for a countdown to the election in an attempt to dispel people's doubt about the polls promised by the year-end. Before the Oikya Jote meeting, a group of Islami Shashantantro Andolon met the advisers. bdnew
