 RAIPUR, India, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 300 heavily-armed Maoists raided a plant of a major steel company in central India, burning around 53 trucks and three heavy machines, police said on Friday. The attack on Essar Steel's plant highlighted the strength of the Maoist rebels in the forested state of Chhattisgarh, where many mining companies operate. Police said rebels overpowered a few employees working in the plant during the night shift and then sprayed diesel on vehicles and set ablaze at least 53 trucks.
