<TEXT>
 Paris, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Clint Eastwood and Woody Allen will be among American directors showing their work at this year's Cannes film festival, where the latest Indiana Jones adventure will also premiere, organisers said on Wednesday. Eastwood will be showing his film "Changeling" in the main competition while Allen will show "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" in a special showing out of competition. The 61st edition of the world's biggest film festival is expected to attract what festival chief Thierry Fremaux called "a magnificent red carpet", as Steven Spielberg presents "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" in a special showing. U.S. director Steven Soderbergh will show his feature "Che", a four-hour epic on the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara. The festival runs from 14-25 May.
