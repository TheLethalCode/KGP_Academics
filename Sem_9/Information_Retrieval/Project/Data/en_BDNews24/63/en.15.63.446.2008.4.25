<TITLE> Corruption in education triggers corruption in other sectors: Akbar Ali </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)Corruption in the education sector fuels corruption in other sectors, said Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan Friday. In his speech to a roundtable on education organised by Grameen Nagorik Federation and Special News Network at the National Press club, Khan said it might be possible to rid all other sectors of corruption in a matter of years, but the nation has to bear the burden of a corrupt education sector for generations to come. "It won't be possible to end corruption in education by punishing the guilty alone. Profiteering has to be removed from the sector and moral values restored," Khan said. "The government will have to realise income tax from the sector and all that's required to discourage and stop commercialisation of education. No businesses should be permitted to operate educational institutions," Khan said. "We are a small country having no other resources but humans and there's no other alternative to educating people if we must develop them," Khan said. "Now corruption poses a serious threat to developing our human resources, as corrupt practices are ruining people's faculty of differentiating good from bad," he said. Khan proposed a plan to 'rate' private educational institutions as per quality of education they provide. Dr Shamsher Ali, vice-chancellor of South East University, proposed forming a 'teacher recruitment commission'. In his speech as special guest, he said: "This recruitment commission will publish a national teachers' qualifications chart, based on which eligible teachers will be recruited for schools, colleges and universities." Ali also proposed building 'knowledge networks' to spread IT-related education and information economically to the grassroots people. Professor Sakhawat Ali Khan said: "National development will remain a far cry until we get meritorious students." He proposed equalising private and public universities' faculty and staff salaries and allowances. bdnew
