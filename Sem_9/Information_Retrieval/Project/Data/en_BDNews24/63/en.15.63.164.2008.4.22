 ACCRA, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on all of Africa's leaders on Tuesday to acknowledge he won last month's disputed election, and promised an "honourable exit" for President Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai, who insists he won the March 29 presidential poll in Zimbabwe, was intensifying his public lobbying for Africa and the rest of the world to intervene more forcefully to resolve the post-election crisis in the southern African state. His Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party says Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, is attempting to cling to power by delaying declaring the results. Speaking on the sidelines of a U.N. trade and development conference in Ghana, Tsvangirai repeated accusations that Mugabe's government had launched a post-poll security crackdown against opposition supporters, killing between 10 and 15, arresting hundreds and driving thousands from their homes. "Zimbabwe as I speak is burning. President Mugabe and his band of criminals have unleashed violence on the people as a punishment for choosing to vote for change," he told a news conference in Accra. Zimbabwe's government denies launching a crackdown. International pressure has been building for Mugabe to announce the poll outcome, but Tsvangirai said more was needed. "Our reputation as a continent may suffer serious disrepute if we ... allow Robert Mugabe to undermine the results of the democratic election by refusing to transfer power knowing he has lost the popular support of the people," he said. "We are calling ... on every head of state in Africa to stand in defence of the people of Zimbabwe," he added. But he also had conciliatory words for the veteran Zimbabwean president. "Robert Mugabe is a liberation hero on our continent and he must be convinced to make a graceful exit. In fact, we have no intention of violating his rights. We believe the time has come for him to have an honourable exit," Tsvangirai said. BAN URGES "PEACE IN ZIMBABWE" During his visit to Ghana, the Zimbabwean opposition leader met United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Ghanaian President John Kufuor. He appealed to them and African leaders to intervene in his country's post-election crisis. Both meetings were "very productive and very sympathetic", Tsvangirai said. Visiting Liberia on Tuesday, U.N. chief Ban repeated a call for Zimbabwe's authorities to release the poll results. "At the same time, I commend and appreciate the role of the leaders of the SADC (Southern African Development Community) and other African leaders to facilitate the process before it develops into further conflict," Ban said. "We want to see peace, stability and democratic institutions established as soon as possible in Zimbabwe," he added. Jacob Zuma, leader of South Africa's ruling ANC, has taken the strongest African stand on the issue. He told Reuters in Berlin on Tuesday that African leaders should send a mission to Zimbabwe to end the delay in issuing election results, which he called unacceptable. "At this point in time ... I imagine that the leaders in Africa should really move in to unlock this logjam," he said. There has also been a delay to a partial recount of votes from a parallel parliamentary election in Zimbabwe, in which Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority for the first time. The recount could overturn the MDC victory in that poll. Tsvangirai said he would not participate in any second round run-off vote with Mugabe simply because the president did not accept his defeat in the March 29 first round of the poll. "We won that election and all that we are saying is that Mugabe must respect the will of the people," he said.
