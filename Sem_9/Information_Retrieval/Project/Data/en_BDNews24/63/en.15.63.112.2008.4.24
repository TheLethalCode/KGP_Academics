 HAMBURG, Germany, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of workers descended on Volkswagen AG's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday to protest against what they call Porsche AG's bid to undermine labour influence at Europe's biggest carmaker. Volkswagen's senior labour leader, Bernd Osterloh, has waged a public battle with Porsche Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking after the manager said in September he would not tolerate any "sacred cows" at VW, famous for its close ties to labour. VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn reaffirmed to shareholders that he was pleased Porsche was poised to gain majority control at VW, but acknowledged "there are still some hurdles to be crossed until we can join forces". Porsche, already VW's biggest shareholder, is also set to do battle with the state of Lower Saxony at the meeting over a controversial statute that allows the state to block key decisions. Both are proposing rival motions to alter the Articles of Association at Volkswagen to reflect a ruling handed down by Europe's highest court last year striking down parts of a law that Brussels said hindered the free flow of capital. Lower Saxony wants to maintain an 80 percent threshold for key VW shareholder decisions that at most German companies require only 75 percent. That would effectively keep its 20 percent stake a blocking minority. It can count on support from the over 80,000 voters that comprise the VW workforce in Lower Saxony, whose labour leaders are among the most vocal opponents of Porsche's plans to boost its 31 percent stake in Europe's biggest carmaker to a majority. The Stuttgart-based sports car maker wants to get rid of the 80 percent threshold as it poses a near insurmountable obstacle to gaining full control of Volkswagen. The showdown is largely symbolic, however, since both sides openly expect to fail in their endeavours due to fierce opposition from the other. LOSS OF FACE Should Berlin's shaky grand coalition between the conservatives and Social Democrats agree on a proposal for a new, EU-compatible Volkswagen Law, then Lower Saxony's blocking minority becomes cemented in German legislation regardless of the outcome of Thursday's shareholder vote. Porsche has sounded out whether Lower Saxony might be interested in selling some of its VW shares, but that is unlikely, given the strategic value Lower Saxony puts on protecting jobs in the state. Lower Saxony premier Christian Wulff refrained on Wednesday from putting his proposal to a vote during a meeting of the Volkswagen supervisory board in the hope that it would then recommend the motion to shareholders at the AGM. Knowing full well that Lower Saxony's two votes along with the entire support from labour representatives on the board would have given him a sure majority, the premier did not want Porsche to lose face unnecessarily, a person who had knowledge of the meeting said. "No one wanted an additional escalation," the source said
