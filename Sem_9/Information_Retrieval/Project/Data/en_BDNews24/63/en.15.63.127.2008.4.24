<TITLE> SCBA seeks right to bail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Bar Association has demanded an end to the emergency powers rules that revoke the High Court's jurisdiction to grant bail. The demand came from an urgent meeting of the association Thursday. Lawyers at the meeting said every citizen of the country has the right to seek bail. Revoking the right would destroy the spirit of justice in society. They said the emergency powers rules that curtail the right to bail went against the Supreme Court's inherent jurisdiction to grant bail. The SCBA leaders said the government's move to impose restrictions on the right to bail in absence of the parliament is a move against the freedom of judiciary. It hampered the rule of law, the lawyers said. Barrister Amir-Ul-Islam, barrister Rafiq-ul Huq, SCBA secretary Aminuddin were present at the meeting. bdnews
