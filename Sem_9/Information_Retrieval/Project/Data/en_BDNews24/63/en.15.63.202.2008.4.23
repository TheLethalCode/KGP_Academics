<TEXT>
 Paris, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks pared early gains and turned negative around midday on Wednesday, as falling banking shares overshadowed buoyant commodity-related sectors. At 1103 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent at 1,297.79 points. Banks, still under pressure following a massive rights issue unveiled by Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday, were the top losers, with RBS down 6.4 percent, Banco Santander down 2.5 percent and UBS down 4.3 percent. Adding to the gloom, U.S. bond insurer Ambac Financial Group Inc. posted a first-quarter loss after losses of $1.73 billion on its exposure to credit derivatives, bringing its net loss per share to $11.69, compared with Reuters estimates for a per-share loss of $1.82 in the first quarter. "It's having a ripple effect on the rset of the sector," said one London-based trader. "People are more immune to writedown news but certainy headlines like these don't help." "It's nervousness ahead of Credit Suisse tomorrow, and Credit Suisse is down 3 percent. UBS, although that went ex-dividend today, is down 4 percent."
