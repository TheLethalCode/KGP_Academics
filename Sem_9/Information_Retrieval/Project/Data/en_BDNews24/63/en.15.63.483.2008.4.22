 KUWAIT, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki rebuked neighbouring states on Tuesday for not doing enough to strengthen ties with Baghdad, write off Iraq's debts or stop militants entering the war-torn country. Maliki, speaking at a meeting in Kuwait of foreign ministers from the region and Western powers, did not name any countries but his remarks appeared aimed at Sunni Arab states that have only low-level ties with his Shia-led government. He said Iraq was now a vastly different country from that under former leader Saddam Hussein, who ruled with an iron fist for decades until his ouster in 2003 by US-led forces. "Iraq today is different from the previous Iraq which assaulted its neighbours. Iraq ... is ready to play a constructive role in security and stability in the region," Maliki said at the start of the meeting. He rattled off a list of grievances his government had with neighbouring states. "It's difficult for us to explain why diplomatic ties have not been resumed with Iraq. Many other foreign countries have kept diplomatic missions in Baghdad regardless of security considerations," Maliki said. No ambassador from a Sunni Arab nation has been stationed permanently in Baghdad since Egypt's envoy was kidnapped and killed shortly after arriving in 2005. Visits by top officials from Arab states, which have been reluctant to extend full legitimacy to Iraq's U.S.-backed government, are also rare. By comparison, Iraq has growing ties with non-Arab Iran. Promises have been made by Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to open up embassies in Baghdad and the US hope is that if Riyadh announces firm plans and dates then others will follow. The Kuwait meeting is a follow-on from gatherings of Iraq's neighbours as well as permanent members of the UN Security Council that were held in Turkey and Egypt last year. Maliki said Iraq had made great strides since then. RICE SEEKS DEBT RELIEF U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is at the meeting, has said she would push hard for Arab neighbours to "meet their obligations" and step up financial and diplomatic support that has not been forthcoming since the 2003 invasion. About $66.5 billion of Iraq's foreign debt has been forgiven, according to State Department estimates. Of the estimated $56 billion to $80 billion debt that remains, more than half is owed to Gulf countries, the department said. Maliki said Iraq was still waiting for relief of the remaining debts as well as a reduction in compensation it owes because of Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. "The cancelling of debts and the suspension of compensation that Iraq pays would present a positive message to Iraq's people that there is a real wish to help them overcome crises and speed up reconstruction," Maliki said. Maliki also urged neighbouring countries to make more effort to prevent militants crossing into Iraq. Iraq's recent attempts to crush Shi'ite militias will also be a central topic at the meeting and Maliki is expected to urge Arab countries to back those efforts. A draft of a statement to be issued on Tuesday at the meeting said participants "welcome the Iraqi government's commitment to disarm and dismantle all militias and illegally armed groups, enforcing the rule of law, and ensuring the state's monopoly on armed forces." The statement, obtained by Reuters, also urged the "maintaining or opening of diplomatic missions in Iraq". After several hours of talks with Arab ministers in Bahrain on Monday, Rice got a lukewarm response to her appeal for embassies to open but she told reporters the process was moving forward and Iraq was gaining acceptance in the region. The two previous meetings of Iraq's neighbours in Egypt and Turkey last year were dominated by tensions between the United States and Iran, which Washington accuses of stirring up violence in Iraq. Tehran denies the charges. At a group photo at the meeting's start, Rice was in the front row, four places away from Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki. US officials said they did not intera
