 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)Prisons authorities will take action against visitors if they violate prison rules by airing politically-motivated comments of detainees, an official said Wednesday. "The situation has come to such a point that it compels prison authorities to take measures," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters as he left Square Hospital after visiting detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "As per the prison rules relatives and lawyers are allowed to meet with the detainees. But they do not have right to pass on any political statements," Siddiqui said. Asked about a public statement made Tuesday by a lawyer of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia, he said: "Some action will come into effect from yesterday's incident." "If any allegation against any visitor is proved he or she will not be allowed to meet the detainee for three months." After visiting detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in special jail, her lawyer Masud Ahmed told reporters that Khaleda would fight a legal battle if the Election Commission sent an invitation for electoral reform dialogue to BNP's reformist faction. Masud said Khaleda also requested the EC to send an invitation to the BNP secretary general nominated by her, Khandaker Delwar Hossain. The DIG prisons said: "Many visitors take permission from court. We will request the court to caution them to not pass on any political statements." On whether acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, nominated by the party's standing committee, would be allowed to meet the chairperson, Siddiqui said: "We have not received any letter yet. We will take a decision after getting the letter." Asked about Sheikh Hasina's physical condition, the DIG prisons said: "Hasina's pressure is under control and she is doing fine. She will be taken to the court tomorrow if remains well." bdnews24.com
