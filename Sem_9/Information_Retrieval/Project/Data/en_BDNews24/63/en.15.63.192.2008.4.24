<TITLE> Italy`s right bids to conquer Rome in mayor runoff </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's right will conquer Rome for the first time since World War Two if it wins this weekend's runoff vote for mayor of the capital, in a contest that has been dominated by fears about crime and immigration. Victory in Rome would be an unexpected boon for conservative leader Silvio Berlusconi, whose centre right overwhelmingly won last week's national election and already rules the financial capital in the north, Milan. Still reeling from defeat in the national vote, the centre left cannot afford to lose Rome, a city of 2.5 million people it has run for most of the past 30 years, and continuously since 1993. "A victory for the right would be mortifying," said outgoing centre-left foreign minister Massimo D'Alema. With its wealth of archaeological treasures, Renaissance art, churches and palazzi, Rome is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, attracting millions of tourists every year. But residents and visitors alike complain about its snarling traffic, poor public transport, pot-holed and dirty streets, high housing costs, neglected suburbs and immigrant slums mushrooming on the outskirts. In recent months, a string of crimes blamed on immigrants has also pushed perceived insecurity to the top of the political agenda in a city long regarded as one of the safest in Europe. The fact that the contest to become Rome's mayor is going to a runoff on Sunday and Monday is already an embarrassment for the centre left. In the last 2006 ballot, its candidate Walter Veltroni was re-elected outright with nearly 62 percent of votes. Veltroni resigned this year to challenge Berlusconi for the premiership. LAW AND ORDER This time, the centre left's Francesco Rutelli only won 46 percent of the vote in the first round -- short of the absolute majority needed to avoid a run-off. His rival Gianni Alemanno from the post-fascist National Alliance party -- one of Berlusconi's main allies -- took around 40 percent. If Alemanno won, he would be the first rightwinger in charge of Rome since it was run by the fascist party in 1943. The widely reported rape on Friday of a student from Lesotho on the outskirts of the city, for which a Romanian immigrant has been arrested, has inflamed the last days of campaigning. The 50-year-old Alemanno promises to reinforce law and order and crack down on immigrants. His party has tried to ditch its fascist roots and become a mainstream conservative force. But Alemanno has come under attack for wearing a Celtic cross around his neck -- a cross surrounded by a ring which is a symbol of the extreme right in Italy, where a 1993 law compared it to the Nazi swastika. Rutelli, 53, has proposed giving women anti-rape bracelets to alert police in case of danger -- dismissed by his rival as an "electronic burqa". Rutelli ran Rome between 1993 and 2001 before he too lost to Berlusconi in a national election. He was culture minister in the outgoing government led by Romano Prodi and is credited with bringing back to Rome dozens of art works which Italy says were illegally smuggled out of the country and ended up in US museums
