 HONG KONG, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese share prices leapt and the dollar enjoyed a modest rebound on Thursday, giving Asian stocks a brief lift ahead of a slew of company earnings reports. The firmer dollar helped depress prices for dollar-quoted commodities such as gold and oil, but was not able to hold back the surging price of rice, an Asian staple at risk of running low and fuelling inflation. The early Chinese boost came from a two-thirds cut in share trading tax, seen as a government attempt to halt a sharp slide on the Shanghai Composite Index which had plummeted more than 50 percent since last October. The boon for short-term traders boosted the index by 9.3 percent by 0650 GMT, but some warned of celebrating too early. "Today's market is full of pent-up exuberance. But eventually it's fundamentals, not government policies, that decide share prices," said Chen Ge, manager at Fullgoal Fund Management. "So before we see signs of an improving economy, I don't think the rally will become another bull run. Further sharp rises will be capped by the growing willingness of institutional shareholders to take profits." Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 1.6 percent, not enough to keep pace with the galloping Shanghai market. The gap between Shanghai and Hong Kong valuations, which had been shrinking fast, widened 3.5 percent. Shanghai's surge also briefly added some optimism to Japan's Nikkei average, but nervousness as big Japanese companies report their earnings pushed it to close down 0.3 percent, while Asian shares outside Japan were up 0.4 percent. European shares are expected to fall in an earnings-packed day, with June Euro Stoxx50 futures and June DAX futures both down 0.4 percent. EARNINGS DELUGE European bellwethers AstraZeneca, Bayer, Peugeot and Fiat deliver results on Thursday, yet the focus in early trade at least will likely centre on Credit Suisse, which reported 5.3 billion Swiss francs ($5.26 billion) of credit-related writedowns in the first quarter, causing a bigger-than-expected loss. JFE Holdings Inc, the world's third-largest steelmaker, broke the ice on Japan's earnings season with a 2.1 percent drop in profit and said it was not yet ready to give a forecast for the year as it was still in talks to raise prices. JFE's shares fell 2.6 percent. Like steel companies, which face an uphill struggle to pass on a two-thirds rise in iron ore prices and even bigger hike in coal costs, oil refiners are under pressure from crude prices. Australian refiner Caltex Australia Ltd fell 7 percent after saying it could cut output if margins fell below the cost of running its plants. But shares in suppliers of oil and metals such as BHP Billiton also slipped as the resurgent dollar pulled back prices for metals and oil, pulling the resource-rich Sydney market down 1.2 percent. US crude oil fell 25 cents to $118.05 a barrel, while gold which has this year broadly mirrored the Nikkei's reaction to movements in the dollar-yen rate, sat just $4 above the $900 an ounce mark, well shy of a $1,000 peak hit last month. The dollar traded at 103.64 yen by 0605 GMT while the euro held around $1.586 after Wednesday's sharp drop as investors kept watch for German corporate sentiment data that could throw light on the prospects for the euro zone economy. June 10-year futures tumbled 0.77 points to 137.05, equalling this year's lowest closing yield. WILD RICE The latest commodity to race to a record was rice, the world's second-biggest food grain crop, which has hit successive peaks due to worries about supply shortages that have led to political unrest and export restrictions. Chicago Board of Trade July rough rice futures surged to a record $25.070 per hundredweight after Brazil suspended rice exports to safeguard domestic supplies and keep prices stable, following similar moves by India and Vietnam. Spot CBOT rice prices are up about 80 percent so far this year. In the latest sign that fears of a rice shortage are rippling around the world, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Sam's Club warehouse said on Wednesday it was limiting sales of several types of rice
