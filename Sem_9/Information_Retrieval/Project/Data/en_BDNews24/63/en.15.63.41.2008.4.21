 LONDON, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal on Monday secured part of its global coal needs with the purchase of a stake in Coal of Africa. Analysts said the deal could lead to a further acquisition. ArcelorMittal's deal chimes with a global trend for steel producers to secures raw materials in a tight supply market and for smaller miners to obtain funding amid dislocated capital markets. ArcelorMittal agreed to buy the 16 percent stake at 111 pence a share, a 20 percent discount to Coal's Friday closing price, Coal said in a statement earlier on Monday. The discount is "insignificant" given the roughly $750 million in revenues Coal will get under the off-take agreement with ArcelorMittal, Seymour Pierce analyst Charles Kernot said. Following the deal, Coal will get 66.7 million pounds ($132.7 million), while ArcelorMittal gets a minimum 2.5 million tonnes of coking coal annually, plus an option to double the volume. Coking coal is used as a raw material to produce steel. Coking coal prices have been set at $300 per tonne, Coal of Africa said in April, more than twice the year-ago price. ArcelorMittal, which accounts for about a tenth of world steel output, may as early as next year boost its stake in Coal of Africa, Seymour's Kernot said. "Mittal have been moving to secure more control over their material supplies, and while a 16 percent stake and one board member gives some influence, they may look towards a larger shareholding, to secure greater control," Seymour's Kernot said. "A local supplier would be a key advantage for Mittal, they'd be able to buy more cheaply and not have to bear transport costs from (other coal miners in) Australia." Officials at ArcelorMittal could not immediately be reached for comment. Coal demand is likely to stay strong, Kernot said, adding that Coal of Africa could seek more funds in further capital raising exercises between 2009 and 2012. China burns 2.4 billion tonnes of coal every year, compared with 1 billion in the United States, 800 million in India and 60 million in Britain. Coal of Africa shares fell 6 percent to 131 pence per share at 0957 GMT, valuing the entire company at 402 million pounds ($799.5 million). "A large stake like that would normally go at a discount and I wouldn't read too much into that," said Ambrian analyst Julian Emery. "Big picture, Coal of Africa has been a target, and has been in the market from that point of view. Mittal adds credibility, a big company with financial backin
