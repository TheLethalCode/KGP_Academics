<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka's Hatton National Bank will expand its venture into Bangladesh as it is struggling to grow at home with Asia's second-highest interest rates on lending, Bloomberg reported Thursday. The bank, which is the second-biggest privately owned lender by assets in Sri Lanka, also targeted India and the Middle East for growth, the agency said, quoting the bank's chief executive officer Rajendra Theagarajah as saying. The move came as the bank wants to lift overseas contributions to as much as 30 percent of net income in five years from about 10 percent, it said. Hatton and larger rival Commercial Bank of Ceylon are tapping more business overseas as interest rates at a five-year high, and escalating violence between government forces and Tamil separatists curbs demand for loans. In January, the bank said it signed a memorandum of understanding with India's City Union Bank for an investment banking joint venture. Hatton National's net income rose to 3.15 billion rupees ($29.2 million), or 13.38 rupees a share, in the year ended Dec. 31, from 2.24 billion rupees, or 9.51 rupees, a year earlier, as it charged customers higher interest rates for loans. Commercial Bank opened an eighth branch in Bangladesh last year. bd
