 BARCELONA, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson praised Cristiano Ronaldo's performance in the 0-0 draw with Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday despite his failure to convert an early penalty. "Cristiano Ronaldo was a bit unlucky with the penalty," said the Scot. "Maybe it came too early in the first minute of the match. He leant back a little bit ... disappointing. Nevertheless, he was fantastic tonight." The Portugal winger sent his spot kick high and wide at the Nou Camp after which Barca dominated without managing to take advantage. Ferguson said United have a strong chance of winning the return on Tuesday to reach next month's final. "With our record at Old Trafford, with the crowd behind us then I think we have a good chance of going through," he told a news conference. Ferguson was particularly pleased his side kept a clean sheet given that influential centre back Nemanja Vidic had to pull out of the game because of a stomach infection. "I think it was professional. We sealed off the areas teams don't normally do against Barcelona. PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE "They didn't make a lot of chances, although they had a lot of play on the edge of our box. Our defending was very good. In that respect it was a professional performance. "But we should have done better with our possession. We gave the ball away too easily I felt," added Ferguson. "But in the context of a first leg semi-final, going to Old Trafford, it gives us a marvellous chance. "We want to impose ourselves much better... next week, I think we'll do that. They had a lot of possession with an extra man in midfield. Tonight I think we had the answers to that." Barca striker Samuel Eto'o said his team were disappointed at failing to press home their advantage but he was confident they would be able to get an away goal at Old Trafford. "It was a shame not to score at home but we are capable of scoring at any ground and we can do it in Manchester too," the Cameroon international told reporters. Coach Frank Rijkaard agreed and said the tie remained delicately poised. "It was an evenly balanced game," said the Dutchman. "The team played well and didn't give them too many chances. We wanted a win but on the other hand the tie is still open and they know we are capable of scoring a goal away from home." "In terms of football it wasn't our best game but the team played well and the fans responded to that. It isn't a good result but it is going to be hard for them
