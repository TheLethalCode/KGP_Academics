<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Tuesday the Chief Election Commissioner has no mandate to talk about unification of his party. In a news briefing at his NAM flat residence, Delwar said: "Who is he to talk about the unification? The party is run by its constitution. It will not see rules imposed from outside. The people will not accept that." He said he would accept an invitation from the Election Commission for electoral reform dialogue, if the commission made an independent decision. "If the commission can independently take the decision, I will accept the invitation as secretary general of the mainstream BNP," he said. Delwar, a former chief whip, criticised the government for its "failure to tackle the famine-like situation" in the country. He also asked the party to stand by the people who are struggling to make their three meals. He announced a three-day programme from Apr 28, asking party workers to give one day's food to destitute people. Replying to a query, he said intelligence officials are mounting pressure on BNP leaders. "A certain quarter is threatening our party activists, it is completely unexpected. It's not right to display illegal influence," he said. Delwar said the party would soon declare a protest plan to realise freedom for detained party chief Khaleda Zia. bdnew
