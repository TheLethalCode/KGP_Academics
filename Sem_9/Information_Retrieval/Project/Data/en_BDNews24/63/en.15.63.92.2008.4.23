 London, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gem Diamonds posted full-year core earnings just ahead of forecasts on Wednesday, as prices for top-end diamonds rose and it expanded production, and gave an upbeat outlook. Gem, which floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 2007, operates mines in southern and central Africa, Indonesia and Australia. The company said it was expanding three producing mines and its outlook was extremely positive. Shares in Gem Diamonds, which have fallen around 9 percent in the past year, jumped 8 percent in early trade but gave back gains to trade flat at 957.5 pence at 0929 GMT. "Material developments across a wide range of assets are happening fast not only adding to near term earnings and cashflow but increasing option value aggressively," analysts at Cazenove said in a note. "Yet this has not filtered through in any way to the share price ... (leaving) the stock trading on amongst the cheapest multiples of any of the diamond juniors," they added. Gem Diamonds posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $74 million compared with an average forecast from analysts of $70 million provided by the company. Full-year revenue was $153 million. The firm also posted first-quarter revenue of $56.1 million. Development projects throughout Africa provided an opportunity to more than double the current production levels, the company said. "These strong financial results demonstrate the merit of the company's strategy to focus on the top end of the diamond market -- a sector that continues to show remarkable price increases," Chief Executive Clifford Elphick said in a statement. The firm, which last year sold one of the largest rough diamonds ever found for $10.4 million, has a specific focus on higher-value diamonds, which it says will deliver superior long-term returns. Elphick said the market for large, high-quality diamonds was very strong, driven by dwindling stockpiles and demand from China, Russia and the Middle East. "Whilst the current U.S. economic climate presents a challenge, opportunities abound throughout the diamond value chain to deliver returns to our shareholders," said Elphick, who founded Gem Diamonds in July 2005 and was formerly the right-hand man of South African diamond magnate Harry Oppenheimer. The company said it had used the $636 million raised through its initial public offering on the acquisition of projects in Australia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia.
