 TEHRAN, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has hanged five convicted murderers but five others supposed to be executed at the same time were pardoned by the victims' families "in the last seconds of their lives", a government daily said on Thursday. The ten men were taken to the gallows in Tehran's Evin prison on Wednesday morning, but five of them were returned to their cells after the families of those they killed agreed to accept "blood money" to spare their lives, the Iran daily said. Under Iran's Islamic law, sharia, a victim's relatives may pardon the murderer in return for financial compensation. "Ten people who were supposed to be hanged were taken to the gallows in Tehran Evin's prison yesterday morning when five of them were hanged and the other five were saved," Iran said. "The five other convicts, in the last seconds of their lives, managed to receive a pardon and time to pay blood money and were taken back to prison from the gallows," it said, without giving details on how much money they will have to pay to the families. Murder, adultery, rape, armed robbery, apostasy and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Iran's sharia, practised since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Those hanged on Wednesday included a 33-year-old who shot two boys to death, a 25-year-old who knifed and killed another man in a fight over a mobile phone card and another man in his 20s who robbed and murdered a 80-year-old woman, Iran said. European governments and Western rights groups have criticised Iran for an increasing number of hangings since authorities launched a clampdown on "immoral behaviour" in July. Amnesty International last week listed the Islamic state as the world's second most prolific executioner in 2007, after China. It said in a report Iran had executed at least 317 people last year compared with at least 470 in China. Iran rejects accusations it is violating human rights and accuses the West of double standards and hypocrisy. Asked about the Amnesty figure, a judiciary spokesman said he did not know the exact numbers of executions but that it was "not high.
