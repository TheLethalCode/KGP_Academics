 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Thursday deferred the hearing into the barge-mounted power plant graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina until April 30. Cherie Blair, wife of former British prime minister Tony Blair, observed the hearing at the special judge's court-1, sited on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Judge Md Firoz Alam made the postponement order after hearing for a fifth day an appeal, filed by Hasina urging the court to acquit her of charges. Hasina was taken back to Square Hospital from the court at 12:40pm. An ailing Hasina was taken to court Thursday to face charges in the case involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. Hasina was brought to court from hospital at 9:50am to attend the hearing on her appeal submitted for acquitting her of the charges. Hasina was admitted to Square Hospital on April 19 with physical complaints of hypertension and earache. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people, including Hasina. The antigraft body accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Other accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews24
