 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Progressive Democratic Party said the caretaker government was giving too much priority to two major political parties that were responsible for the pre-1/11 situation in the country. It also said in a pre-dialogue meeting with the government Thursday that the state of emergency should be relaxed but not lifted prior to the national election. The meeting, part of ongoing talks between the government and political parties to prepare for forthcoming formal dialogue, was held at state guesthouse Meghna. "The elections should be held amid the state of emergency, otherwise a chaotic situation might may result in violence during the election," PDP convener Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi told reporters after the meeting. "However, we think the emergency should be relaxed four months ahead of the polls," he said. PDP said the election should be held by December and recommended holding of all local government elections ahead of the national polls. The party raised a number of proposals including curbing prices of essentials, concluding the trials of those detained on corruption charges before the election. The five caretaker government advisers who attended the meeting were communications adviser Ghulam Quader, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. PDP was represented by Quarishi, former lawmaker Tazul Islam Chowdhury, Nur Mohammad Khan, Quamrunnahar Jafor, Golam Sarwar Milon, Rafiqul Hossain and Riazul Islam. Nur Mohammad Khan told bdnews24.com after the meeting: "We have had a successful dialogue." Bikalpadhara Bangladesh and Liberal Democratic Party are scheduled to sit with the advisers separately later in the day. bdnew
