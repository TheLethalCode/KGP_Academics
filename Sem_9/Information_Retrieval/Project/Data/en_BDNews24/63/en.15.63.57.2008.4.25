 LONDON, April 25 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - News in brief prior to this weekend's Premier League matches: Frank Lampard is expected to miss Chelsea's potential title decider against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday following the death of his mother Pat, 58, from pneumonia on Thursday. He did not play against Wigan Athletic and Everton last week while she was ill but did play against Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday when she appeared to be making a recovery. He has been given compassionate leave by Chelsea, who said in a statement: "The club will be offering all the support it can to Frank and his family at this time."

Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen, who has missed the last nine matches with a back injury, will again be missing when his relegation-threatened side visit Tottenham Hotspur, but he has been told he may not need surgery to solve the problem. Ali Al-Habsi will continue to deputise for him at White Hart Lane. Fulham, who will almost certainly be relegated if they lose at Manchester City, are hoping for a second successive away win following their victory at Reading two weeks ago, their first away from home since October 2006.
