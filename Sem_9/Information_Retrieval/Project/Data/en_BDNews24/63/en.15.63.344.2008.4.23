<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com) - The chaos-filled first semifinal of the Club Cup Hockey between archrivals Abahani Limited and Mohammedan SC ended in an incomplete 1-1 result following a demand of goal cancellation in the eleventh hour of the game Wednesday. Masum restored the margin for holders Mohammedan three minutes from time after Rocky put Abahani ahead in the 34th minute at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. "The remainder of the game will be held later as umpire Golam Kibria has declined to conduct the match citing insecurity," said umpire Latifur Rahman after the final whistle. "We will decide the matter in an emergency meeting after getting report from umpires," said tournament committee general secretary Iftesham Sultan, who failed to let reporters know whether the second semifinal between Usha KC and Sonali Bank would take place Thursday. The play remained stopped for nearly 30 minutes after Mohammedan's equaliser as Abahani players demanded its cancellation. According to Abahani players, Mohammedan's Masum did not score as the ball found the back of the Abahani net kissing their fellow defender Khokon's stick, which is not treated as a goal in hockey. In the match, it seemed that the players from both sides were more interested in disputing the umpires' decisions whenever against them rather than concentrating on a planned and fair game. However, many blamed the umpires for poor refereeing. The game remained stop for five minutes in the first half when Abahani players demanded a penalty corner from umpire Golam Kibria, who however, was later able to resume the game. Afterwards, Kibria took no action despite being kicked by Mohammedan's skipper Prince and other players, who protested his decision on a penalty corner in favour of Abahani. Mohammedan players once again surrounded umpire Kibria following a decision against them, and some players pushed him before police intervened to stop them. Kibria warned Prince with a green card though the former national striker deserved a yellow card, and he ultimately lost control over the players. "We have no good umpires except these two," said Iftesham Sultan when his attention was drawn to poor refereeing.
