<TITLE> China recalls days of poems and promise with Dalai Lama </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Communist Party casts the Dalai Lama as a murderous foe in a struggle over Tibet, but once courted him as a key ally in controlling the region, China's latest official history of the region details. The Dalai Lama, then a young Buddhist monk stirred by the modernising hopes of Tibet's new Communist occupants, in turn responded with gushing praise of the revolutionary Mao Zedong. "Only limitless blessing could create such a leader like the sun radiating across the land. His writings are as precious as pearls." Thus the Dalai wrote in a poem after meeting Mao in Beijing in 1955, according to "A History of the Liberation of Tibet", published last month. China has used tens of thousands of troops and a barrage of patriotic propaganda to combat a wave of unrest in Tibetan areas since March. But for decades, the government has also treated history as a battlefield in which calls for Tibetan independence and criticisms of Chinese rule must also be demolished. Written by a team of dozens over eight years and overseen by senior officials, China's latest official history of Tibet from 1949 to 1965 is intended as a 564-page blow in that battle. "Like other regions, Tibet could be liberated and developed only in the family of the motherland and by taking the socialist road," the authors conclude. But the book's account of the courtship between China and the Dalai Lama that collapsed in 1959, leading him into exile, underscores the complexity of the hopes and miscalculations that shaped ties between China and the Dalai Lama's exiled movement. China now dismisses him as a mere monk with no right to shape Tibet's political future. Yet in the 1950s the central government honoured the Dalai Lama with high political titles and vowed not to press major change in Tibet without his nod. And while the Dalai Lama has a global reputation as an opponent of Chinese policy, he once denounced separatist forces, first journeyed to India at the behest of Mao and later fled there with Mao's knowledge, according to the new history. BUDDHISM AND COMMUNISM "Both sides misunderstood what the other wanted," said Wang Lixiong, a Beijing-based author who has long studied Tibet's modern history and supports regional self-rule. "Mao never imagined that the Dalai would become such a powerful and troublesome figure when he went into exile ... The Dalai thought he could find a way to bring Buddhism and communism into harmony for Tibet." In past decades, Tibet's historic ties to China and whether they amounted to Chinese sovereignty have been bitterly contested by advocates and foes of regional self-determination. But when the People's Liberation Army marched into Lhasa in 1951, the Dalai Lama saw some hope for cooperating with China's new Communist rulers and pulling the long-isolated mountain region out of poverty. The two sides signed a "17-point agreement" intended to serve as a framework for relations that promised the region religious freedom and respect for the Dalai's powers. Mao and his lieutenant, Zhou Enlai, also wooed the Dalai Lama and Zhou's counterpart, the Panchen Lama, with respectful receptions in Beijing. "Today, the Tibetan side spins that the Dalai Lama was playing Mao," said Tsering Shakya, an historian of Tibet at the the University of British Columbia in Canada. "But I think he thought it was very possible to work with Mao. He was an impressionable young guy in his twenties." In 1956, as Tibetans became restive at the accelerating Communist revolution spilling into their areas, Mao agreed to hold off reforms in Tibet for at least six years, and then let the Dalai Lama and local leaders decide whether to proceed. Not that the Dalai was firmly set against the Party's socialist economic plans. "The Dalai even wanted to join the Party at one stage, because he was so struck by how much more advanced the inland was," said Wang, using the term many Tibetans use to refer to Han Chinese-dominated lowland China. "He thought Buddhism and Marxism had a lot in common and he's said similar things since." In 1959, as Mao plunged China into a radical Great Leap Forward, growing unrest in the ethnic Tibetan regions of provinces next to Tibet spead across the region. In Lhasa, forces opposed to Chinese rule gathered strength, and as open fighting broke out the Dalai Lama fled into exile in March, leaving the homeland he says he still wants to return to as a highly autonomous region of China. The new official history says he fled with the knowledge of Mao, who apparently hoped that he would contritely return one day or dwindle into obscurity "I'm not sure that Mao knew that the Dalai would escape," said Tsering, the historian. "But Mao was very paternalistic. He thought he knew Tibet better than the Tibetans
