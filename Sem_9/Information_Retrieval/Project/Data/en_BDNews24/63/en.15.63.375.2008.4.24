<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnewsw24.com)Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Thursday that the next budget would have no scope for people to whiten illegal or black money. However, the provision for a maximum of a 250 percent fine for legalising legally earned but undeclared income would be lowered as much as possible, the adviser said, speaking as chief guest at the National Board of Revenue consultative committee's meeting at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. NBR and FBCCI co-organised the meeting ahead of the budget for fiscal 2008-09. "There will surely be a tax break for development of industries in the country. However, this time re-evaluation will be made in giving the facility," he said. "It won't be a wholesale facility. It is being considered how the tax break will be given. Necessary steps will be taken to avoid the misuse of the facility. Bangladesh Better Business Forum has recommended a 10-year tax break for fresh industrial investment. Mirza Aziz said an announcement would come in the next budget after considering the overall situation. Azizul Islam said: "This is for the first time that pre-budget meetings are being held in divisional cities. The opinions or recommendations received are being considered with emphasis." The adviser said steps would be taken in the new budget to keep the prices of essentials at a tolerable level. "The government will put the highest emphasis on agriculture to intensify food security by increasing local output. At the same time, scope for social security net will be expanded substantially. Mirza Aziz said: "Banks have already started the process of lowering the interest rate on loans. A positive result will be available in three months." In the new budget, necessary steps will be taken to solve the power and gas crises. NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid presided over the meeting, also attended by FBCCI president Annisul Huq, BGMEA president Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers Association president Fazlul Hoque and Bangladesh Textile Mills Owners Association president Abdul Hai Sarkar. bdnews
