<TITLE> Cameroon, Gabon take steps to fight food cost shock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Tansa Musa YAOUNDE, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon launched an emergency plan to raise food production on Friday and neighbouring Gabon suspended import taxes on foodstuffs as West African states rushed to counter price surges that have triggered protests. The two oil producers were the latest countries in the world's poorest continent to introduce measures to offset soaring global prices for foodstuffs and fuel which aid experts say threaten to push 100 million people worldwide into hunger. Anger over the cost of living helped trigger riots in Cameroon in late February in which demonstrators took to the streets to protest against a move by President Paul Biya to extend his 25-year rule over central Africa's biggest economy. Dozens of people were killed and Biya this month signed into law the constitutional change approved by parliament that allows the president, one of Africa's longest serving leaders, to be re-elected for a third term in 2011. Cameroon's Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni said a special fund was being set up to finance development of domestic farming and fisheries, and he called on his country's people to consume more locally-produced products instead of imports. "The government will strive to turn the prevailing crisis into an opportunity to profoundly transform our agriculture, which should meet domestic demands and become a real exporter of foodstuffs," the prime minister said in a statement released after a cabinet meeting. The plan, whose overall cost was not specified, foresaw subsidies to help young farmers start up production. It offered assistance to buy fertilisers, pesticides and equipment and also set up regional pools of farm machinery for their use. In neighbouring Gabon, the government suspended for six months duties and taxes on imported foodstuffs, including VAT paid on cooking oil, fish, milk and flour. It also imposed percentage limits on price margins charged by rice importers and reduced diesel rates by 37 percent for the fisheries sector. NEGLECTED AGRIGULTURE Developments in markets and demand and supply patterns, policy shifts and erratic weather caused by climate change have combined to double prices of cereals since last year, creating what U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon calls "a real global crisis". The economic measures taken by Gabon followed similar steps taken in recent weeks by Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea. Mauritania on Thursday announced the final part of a $160 million emergency programme to combat the rising prices, boost rice and cereal production and cut its dependency on exports. Senegal and Liberia have also started schemes to revive their country's flagging farming sectors which have stagnated and declined during decades of neglect and underinvestment. After years in which development and investment priorities were focused on other areas like infrastructure, international development bodies and humanitarian agencies are now calling for a massive boost to farming programmes to stave off hunger. Cameroon's government also announced measures to revitalise the fisheries industry, which despite the country's 350 km (220 miles) of coastline, has been hit by lack of financing, high costs, depletion of fish stocks and pirate attacks. The government would provide micro-credits to allow fishermen to buy boats and outboard motor
