<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)Visiting Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi Thursday urged the world "not to politicise" the Beijing Olympics games. Jiechi termed the March uprising in Tibet "criminal violence" and pointed fingers at the Dalai Lama's group for the incident which had claimed the lives of 20 people. "We are here to uphold the spirit of the Olympics. The Olympics games should not be politicised," Jiechi told reporters after a meeting with his Bangladesh counterpart Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at state guesthouse Padma. "The Olympics games in Beijing are not just a Chinese thing. This should be the pride of the people of Asia and the world," he said. Jiechi came to Dhaka Thursday on a two-day visit to Bangladesh as part of his regional tour. He thanked Bangladesh for extending "unflinching support" to "One China Policy". Bangladesh had earlier termed the unrest in Tibet "an internal affair of China" and reiterated its "One China Policy". "What happened in Lhasa recently was a case of criminal violence. There was burning, killing, looting which resulted in the death of innocent people," said Jiechi. "And this violence was instigated by the Dalai (Lama) group and it was the work of the separatist forces at home and abroad." He brushed aside the allegation of human rights abuses in Tibet. "The question is not the question of human rights or the religious freedom or nationality problem," he said. "The problem between us and the Dalai (Lama) group is a question of whether one seeks  China's territorial integrity and sovereignty or whether one is trying to split the country," Jiechi said. In addition to the international issues, the two leaders discussed bilateral trade and other issues of cooperation between the two countries. The officials of Bangladesh's Economic Relations Division and the Chinese government singed an exchange of note on the construction of "Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Centre" in Dhaka at a cost of Tk 189 million ($30 million). He invited chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and the foreign adviser to visit China at an opportune time this year. The Chinese minister assured Bangladesh of providing assistance to recoup the losses from last year's twin back-to-back floods and cyclone Sidr. Jiechi is scheduled to leave Dhaka Friday for Pakistan. bdn
