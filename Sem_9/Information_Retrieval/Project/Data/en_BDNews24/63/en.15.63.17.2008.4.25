 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)The government plans to offer dialup internet to eight lakh digital telephone subscribers of BTTB without connection charges, an official said Friday. The subscribers will have to pay only charges for internet use. The telecoms ministry also finalised a proposal to cut call charges to compete with private telephone operators, said telecoms secretary Iqbal Mahmood. "We are planning to offer dialup internet connections for all digital telephone subscribers," Mahmood told bdnews24.com. "What subscribers will have to do is apply to any local exchange which will give the phone owner a PIN," said another telecoms ministry official. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board now charges Tk 300 for an internet connection and Tk 0.40 per minute for peak-hour use (for 14 hours from 10.00am) and Tk 0.20 in off-peak hour on browsing. The BTTB charges Tk 1,000 for unlimited internet use a month. "The charge will be reduced," Mahmood said. According to an estimate by the telecoms ministry, over 20,000 BTTB subscribers use dialup internet. The ministry also prepared a proposal to offer broadband internet connections to 20,000 subscribers in Dhaka city. The service will be provided through asymmetric digital subscriber line technology. A subscriber will be required to have a modem costing up to Tk 5,000. bdnews
