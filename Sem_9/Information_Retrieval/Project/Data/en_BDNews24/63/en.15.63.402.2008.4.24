<TITLE> Govt doubles CNG prices </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government has hiked the prices of CNG to Tk 16.75 from Tk 8.50 per cubic metre, ending a four-year-old rate, a senior energy official said Thursday. The decision will be effective from Friday, energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com. "The prices of CNG have been increased to cut huge losses incurred by Petrobangla," the government said in a statement. The losses stemmed from the rising prices of energy on the world market and a huge gap between the gas purchase rate and sales prices of liquid energy. The government will not allow CNG-run buses and trucks to hike fares, but the communications ministry will reset the fares of CNG-run taxicabs and autorickshaws. "To encourage more CNG stations to come to the market, a decision has been taken to give station owners 75 paisa per cubic metre from the increased price," the government said. "At the same time it has been made mandatory for each CNG station to set up a generator in eight months to cut the sufferings of customers." On June 13, 2005, the prices of per cubic metre CNG were fixed at Tk 8.50 against the octane prices of Tk 35 per litre, which were 25 percent of Octane prices. Octane is now priced at Tk 67 per litre. About 130,000 vehicles, out of about a million, have been made compatible with the CNG-run system, especially in Dhaka, Comilla and Chittagong cities where CNG refuelling stations are available. About 12,000 autorickshaws run on CNG. Compressed natural gas was introduced in Bangladesh in 1985 under state-owned RPGCL when its prices were Tk 7.45 per unit, but its use had been limited to Dhaka. In 1985, octane was priced at about Tk 10 per litre. In the wake of the rising prices of liquid petroleum fuel on the international and domestic markets, the government had encouraged people to convert their vehicles to the CNG system. The use of CNG as motor fuel gathered steam in 2000 after the government encouraged the private sector to engage in CNG business by installing conversion plants and refuelling stations. Because of low prices, compared to diesel, petrol or octane, CNG became a popular fuel for motor vehicles of the middle class. CNG costs almost a fourth of the liquid petroleum price. bdn
