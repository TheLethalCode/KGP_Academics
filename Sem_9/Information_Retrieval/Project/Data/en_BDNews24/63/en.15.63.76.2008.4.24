<TITLE> Georgia sets first execution after US court ruling </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Atlanta/Dallas , April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia has scheduled a May execution for a convicted killer who will likely be the first US convict put to death since the Supreme Court last week ended a de facto moratorium on capital punishment. Executions are also scheduled in Virginia and Texas -- the two US states that carry out the death penalty most frequently -- in late May, June and July, signaling a desire by legal authorities to quickly resume a punishment that is still enforced in only a handful of the world's democracies. The US Supreme Court on April 16 rejected a challenge to the lethal three-drug cocktail used in most US executions, which opponents had claimed inflicted unnecessary pain. A nationwide moratorium had been in effect since just after the court said on Sept. 25 last year that it would hear the appeal by two death row inmates in Kentucky, raising hopes among opponents that it could prove to be the death knell of capital punishment in America. One convicted murderer was executed in Texas a few hours after the court said it would hear the case but no execution has been carried out since then in the United States. The moratorium now looks to be over. A court in Georgia's Berrien County filed an order to execute William Earl Lynd during the week that starts at noon on May 6, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker said in a statement this week. The Department of Corrections will set a date and time during that week for the death of Lynd, who murdered his girlfriend and another woman 10 years ago. In Virginia, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert McDonnell confirmed the state has the following execution dates -- May 27 for Kevin Green, June 10 for Percy Walton, and July 24 for Edward Nathaniel Bell. Those dates had been scheduled before the Supreme Court's ruling. After the ruling, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine announced he was lifting the state's moratorium he had imposed. "In light of the Supreme Court ruling, executions will move forward according to the procedures that were in place prior to the Court's agreement to hear (the case) last September," his office said in a statement. And in Texas, the country's top death penalty state, the attorney general's office confirmed on Wednesday that an execution date of June 17 was set last week for Charles Dean Hood. He was convicted almost two decades ago of double homicide. The next person executed in America will be the 1,100th put to death since the Supreme Court lifted a temporary ban on the practice in 1976. Since that time Texas has led the way with 405 executions followed by Virginia with 98. Last year 42 people were executed in America, the lowest number since 1994 when 31 were put to death. But the number would almost certainly have been considerably higher in 2007 if it had not been for the Supreme Court case. "I think it will be slow at first but then the pace of executions will probably pick up later this year," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center
