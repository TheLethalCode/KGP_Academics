 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  The acting secretary general of the BNP reformist faction, Hafizuddin Ahmed, said Thursday he hoped to take the leaders of a united BNP to electoral reforms dialogue with the Election Commission. "A united BNP will participate in dialogue on April 27. We have contacted the other faction," Hafizuddin told party leaders and activists at his Banani home. "The BNP is still under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." Several hundred leaders and activists led by BNP's Demra unit president and former ward commissioner Nabiullah Nabi congratulated Hafizuddin on getting the Election Commission's invitation to dialogue. The BNP leader said his party would place recommendations to the commission of holding a proper election free of 'muscular power and black money'. On the rejection of a letter seeking permission from jail authorities to meet with the chairperson, Hafizuddin said: "Saifur Rahman and I will reapply to the prison authorities." Explaining the need for reforms in the party, he said: "We need to establish democracy in the party. Our leader will bring necessary reforms after she is released." "People have elected the BNP of Ziaur Rahman as the party works for them relentlessly," he said. The party strayed away from the ideals of the late president Ziaur Rahman because of a number of leaders in its last regime, Hafizuddin said. "The image of the party was tarnished as we went far away from the ideal that the party is more important than an individual." He asked the party members to bring changes to the system. bdnew
