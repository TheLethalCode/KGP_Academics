<TITLE> Shire's Vyvanse forecast disappoints, shares fall </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Shire Plc said on Friday that 2008 sales of its biggest drug hope, Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were likely to be at the lower end of its forecasts, hitting its shares. Shares in Britain's third-biggest drugmaker fell more than 5 percent, even as it met forecasts with a 5 percent rise in first-quarter underlying earnings and said its full-year revenue expectations for the whole company were unchanged. Vyvanse is key to Shire's future as it is hoping to switch patients to it from its current ADHD best-seller, Adderall XR, which could face generic competition from April 2009. Some analysts have been disappointed by Vyvanse's growth since its launch in July 2007, but Shire got a lift on Wednesday when US regulators approved it as a treatment for adults. "Based on existing prescription trends and the recently received approval for the adult indication, we expect Vyvanse sales to be at the lower end of the previously stated range of $350 to $400 million," Shire said in a statement. Analysts said the edging down of guidance was all the more surprising because of the earlier-than-expected approval to treat adults, and suggested Vyvanse was struggling to take patients from Adderall XR, which continues to grow strongly. SHOOT FIRST, ASK LATER "It's only a modest downgrade ... but they've got a history of guiding conservatively and then beating that guidance," said Panmure analyst Savvas Neophytou. "In this market you shoot first and ask questions later." Shire Chief Executive Matthew Emmens told Reuters that Vyvanse, which has 6.9 percent of the U.S. ADHD market, was tracking towards analysts' 2008 consensus sales forecast of $356 million and could do better. He was confident the drug would continue to take market share from Adderall XR, even though it has not had a huge impact despite being around 30 percent cheaper and Shire ending its promotion of the older drug. "Would we like it faster? Absolutely," he said in a telephone interview. "Adderall XR is a good drug, but Vyvanse is a better one." Chief Financial Officer Angus Russell said the US ADHD market was growing around 6-7 percent and expected this to accelerate after Shire started promoting Vyvanse to adults -- the fastest-growing part of the market. First-quarter earnings per American depositary share before one-off items came in at 74 cents, in line with forecasts, while revenue was up 33 percent to $702 million, beating the average forecast of $695 million in a Reuters poll of eight analysts. Vyvanse sales totalled $54.4 million, while Adderall XR sales rose 5 percent to $261.5 million, beating analysts' average estimate of $255 million. Price rises more than offset the dip in Adderall XR's market share to 23.7 percent from 26.3 percent the same time last year. Shire reiterated that it expected 2008 revenue to grow by a mid- to high-teens percentage, driven by a string of new drugs such as Lialda for ulcerative colitis and Elaprase for Hunter syndrome, a rare inherited disorder. At 1120 GMT, Shire's shares were down 4.7 percent at 936 pence, handing back most of this week's gains and valuing the firm at 5.3 billion pounds ($10.5 billion
