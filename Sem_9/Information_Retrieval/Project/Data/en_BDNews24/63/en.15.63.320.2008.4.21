<TITLE> Oil producers, customers yet to agree price too high </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Record oil has added to economic pain and in some ways made it even more difficult to increase supplies, but producers stopped short of saying prices were too high at talks with their customers on Monday. Energy producers and consumers are in broad agreement there is enough oil on the market in the immediate term and OPEC ministers have said they will not boost output right now. They also agreed the weak dollar had helped to drive oil prices, which hit a record well above $117 a barrel on Monday. But while the consumers are certain this is too high, some producer countries have said the strength is only nominal, given the weakness of the dollar. "When I spoke from the podium I asked the ministers, 'Do you agree with me that current prices are too high' -- totally quiet," said Nobuo Tanaka, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which represents consumer nations. "When I asked the question, 'Are there any ministers who don't agree' -- total silence." At first, rising oil prices had a limited impact on the world's economy, but they have begun to bite. "It's dampening growth -- that's for sure, but of course it is benefiting exporters," said John Lipsky, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on his arrival in Rome for the producer-consumer talks. He said oil prices, which he expected to stay strong, had focused attention on the need to invest to bring on long term supplies. LACK OF SUPPLY RESPONSE So far, high oil prices have not translated into extra supplies and oil producers have complained a rally across commodities and a shortage of qualified staff have increased the difficulty of new exploration and production projects. "Some projects -- we see it worldwide -- are delayed because they are not economical, even with this price we see today," said Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah. "No, I'm not enjoying the high price. I'm enjoying the challenge of the business." In a sustained bull-run, U.S. crude has risen from less than $20 a barrel at the start of 2002 to its record of $117.60 hit on Monday. Prices have been driven by strong demand, especially from Asia, and a chronic lack of investment in oil infrastructure. Since a financial crisis began around August last year, triggered by U.S. bad debt and a collapsing housing market, the weakness of the U.S. dollar has added to the strength of some dollar-denominated commodities, which investors view as an inflation hedge. Expensive oil did not cause but has added to the economic problems. In the United States, gasoline prices of more than $3 a gallon have eroded demand and consumer spending, but those suffering most are the poor nations, said Fatih Birol, the IEA's chief economist. "Of course there is an impact on the economy ... The greatest impact is on poor, oil importing countries," he said, citing oil importers in Africa. He added the impact on the poorest was among the themes of the International Energy Forum talks, which continue until Tuesday. The forum, which meets every two years, brings together some 60 energy ministers, as well as top executives of the oil industry, but is often dismissed as a talking sh
