 ANKARA, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Monday he had sent a letter to Yerevan calling for dialogue with Armenia and saying Turkey wanted to normalise ties between the two countries. Ankara has no diplomatic relations with Armenia and keeps its land border closed in protest at the situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which broke away from Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union fell apart. It is run by ethnic Armenian separatists but is not recognised by any state. "Turkey desires to normalise its relations with Armenia. Turkey is keeping channels of dialogue open with the new Armenian government," Babacan told a news conference. Armenia and Turkey are also at loggerheads over Ankara's rejection of Armenian claims, backed by many Western historians, that massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One amounted to genocide. Ankara says large numbers of both Christian Armenians and Muslims Turks were killed during the violent break-up of the Ottoman Empire. Turkish President Abdullah Gul congratulated Armenian President Serzh Sarksyan on his election win in February and said he hoped for an improvement in relations. The tiny ex-Soviet republic of Armenia is sandwiched between Turkey and Azerbaijan in a region that is emerging as an important transit route for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to world markets, though Armenia has no pipeline of its own. Turkey was among the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union but has no diplomatic ties due to Armenia's occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a slice of Azeri territory populated by ethnic Armenia
