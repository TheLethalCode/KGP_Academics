 SOFIA, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgaria's soccer federation has suspended six referees for making significant mistakes in recent premier league and Bulgarian Cup matches. Angel Bekyarov, who was temporarily removed from officials list for errors and poor fitness in October 2006, was one of three referees banned until the end of the season. Bekyarov was suspended after making mistakes during Litex Lovech's 1-1 draw at Beroe Stara Zagora on Sunday and during Cherno More Varna's 3-1 win at Kaliakra Kavarna in the Cup semi-final four days earlier. Trendafil Dumbalakov, Bekyarov's assistant at one of the games, was also banned until the end of the season while another assistant, Nikolay Angelov, has been suspended for five matches. Kaliakra has threatened to boycott the Cup unless the officials are heavily punished. Litex also reacted angrily and called for Bekyarov to be given a life ban. "Through these punishments the (federation's) referee commission is showing that it will not tolerate officials who do not apply the rules," the commission said. Bekyarov could not escape the punishment despite agreeing to have a lie-detector test. He was accused publicly by several Litex players of favouring Beroe in the league game last weekend. Another linesman, Georgi Kovachev, has been banned for the rest of the season for making bad decisions. Asen Nikolov was handed a three-match ban and Martin Bogdev was banned for two matches. Referee suspensions are not uncommon in Bulgaria, where two officials were given life bans last seaso
