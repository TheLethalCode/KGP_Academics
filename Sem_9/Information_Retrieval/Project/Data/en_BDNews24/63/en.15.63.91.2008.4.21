 ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopia broke diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing the Gulf Arab state of supporting terrorism in Somalia and Ethiopia and spreading instability in the Horn of Africa. "Whether in Somalia and in other parts of the Horn of Africa -- including within Ethiopia -- Qatar has been one of the most important supporters of terrorism and extremism in our sub-region," Ethiopia's government said in an email statement. A U.S. ally and the biggest military power in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia said it had long observed Qatar's "hostile behaviour", had raised the issue directly on various occasions, and had been patient before taking Monday's measure.

"Qatar has left no stone unturned to cause harm to Ethiopia's national security. All those who are prepared to foment instability in Ethiopia and undermine the country's security have been given support and encouragement by Qatar. "This has gone beyond Qatar's strong ties with Eritrea. It has indeed provided direct and indirect assistance to terrorist organisations in Somalia and other areas." Ethiopia's support for Somalia's Western-backed interim government has been a major source of contention in the region, and brought calls for jihad from some radical groups. Bilateral trade is a negligible $6 million annually, according to Ethiopian officials. - Additional re
