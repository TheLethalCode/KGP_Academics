 STRASBOURG, France, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Parliament called on Thursday for broader sanctions to prevent Myanmar's military rulers trading with European banks and urged the EU to campaign for a worldwide arms embargo. EU governments tightened long-standing sanctions on Myanmar after a bloody crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks in September. They have said the steps could be toughened if there is no progress on rights. Existing steps targeting 1,207 firms, visa bans and asset freezes are expected to be rolled over for another year when EU ministers meet on Tuesday. A resolution passed by the European Parliament in Strasbourg called for a broadening of the steps to restrict access to international banking services by firms and individuals owned or linked to the military. The resolution was passed by 551 to seven, with eight abstentions, an official of the parliament said. It also urged EU states to consider a complete ban on new investment, a ban on the provision of insurance services and an embargo on trade in key commodities that provide significant revenue to the ruling junta. The parliament also called on the European Union to campaign for a worldwide arms embargo on Myanmar. It noted the EU embargo was ineffective because the Myanmar military purchases supplies from China, Russia and India. EU ministers have been considering more stringent banking sanctions which groups like Human Rights Watch say should be coordinated with steps the United States has imposed. U.S. sanctions have the capacity to refuse access to U.S. financial institutions to any financial institution that services Myanmar's junta. Human Rights Watch says it is important to prevent circumvention via European banks. Myanmar's junta is widely believed to use Singapore as its main offshore banking centre and the United States has called on the city state to sever financial links with the generals. Thursday's resolution repeated a call for the release of more than 1,800 political prisoners, including Nobel Prize-winning dissident Aung San Suu Kyi and called on the junta to account for all casualties and missing from the crackdown. The parliament called on Myanmar's junta to end restrictions on free debate over a constitutional referendum due to be held next month and agree to the presence of international observers for that vote.
