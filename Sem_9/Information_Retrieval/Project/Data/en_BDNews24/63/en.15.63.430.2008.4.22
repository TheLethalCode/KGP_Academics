 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)  A councilor lodged an appeal with the election commission demanding cancellation of the candidatures of Kazi Salahuddin, Ahsrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu and Golam Rabbani Helal for hiding relevant information on nominations for the upcoming Bangladesh Football Federation election. Councilor Shamsul Haq from the Chittagong Football Association Monday appealed in writing that the above trio had hidden relevant information in part of nine and 10 sections on the nomination papers. According to nine and 10 sections, it is asked whether the candidate was earlier found guilty of criminal offences, and whether candidates were earlier convicted under the criminal code. Salahuddin is a president candidate while Chunnu and Helal vice president and member candidates respectively in the upcoming BFF election scheduled for April 28. Though the trio filled up the sections that they had not been found guilty or convicted under the criminal code, the complainant Tuesday in support of his appeal submitted two news clippings published in the Daily Ittefaq and the Dainik Bangla on September 23, 1982. The stories read that a court had convicted Helal and Anwar Hossain for one month, and Salahuddin and Chunnu for six months, and fined them Tk 1000 each for beating an assistant referee during the match against Mohammedan SC on September 21, 1982, during military rule. Four Abahani players were arrested for the incident and found guilty in a one-day trial under martial law the next day. All four footballers, however, came out of prison after 17 days following Presidential clemency. "Whether punishment under military rule could be taken into cognizance as punishment under penal code, was the question Salauddin posed. He was surprised over the allegation as it came after 26 years. "I don't believe any Bangali from Bangladesh can raise this matter after 26 years as the whole nation knows the fact behind that incident," said Salahuddin. Chunni and Helal, denying they were convicted of criminal offences, said that it was just 'dirty play' ahead of the BFF election, and that no one should stoop so low in the interest of the election. The final list of candidates is scheduled to be announced Thursday. Withdrawal of candidature is Wednesday. Chief election commissioner Mesbah Uddin told bdnews24.com that the matter would be heard Wednesday in presence of both complainant and defendants.
