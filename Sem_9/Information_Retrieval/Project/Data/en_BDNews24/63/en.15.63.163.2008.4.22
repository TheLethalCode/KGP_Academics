 NEW DELHI, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian hockey plunged into a fresh crisis on Tuesday after a television programme made allegations of corruption against a top official from the national governing body. Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K.Jothikumaran, however, told Reuters he rejected the claims of corruption made on the popular Hindi language Aaj Tak channel. The programme, broadcast on Monday and coming just a month after the men's team failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time, used undercover reporters to film a discussion with Jothikumaran about organising a proposed tournament. The reporters, posing as businessmen, requested that an unnamed player be selected in the national squad and television footage showed Jothikumaran accepting large amounts of money. It also broadcast a telephone conversation purportedly between Jothikumaran and its reporter where he promised all efforts would be made to select the player of their choice. The meeting was held earlier this month, the television channel said. Jothikumaran said the allegations were false. "It is a totally concocted (story)," he told Reuters. "They said they wanted to hold a big international tournament and were trying to help and gave me seed money to run the office," he said, adding that a formal statement would be issued later on Tuesday. The IHF has been under media and public pressure since the men's national team, eight-time former champions, failed to qualify for Beijing. The organisation has also been criticised for refusing to give Australian consultant Ric Charlesworth more autonomy in overseeing the national teams, while hockey's world governing body has warned that it could lose the right to host the 2010 World Cup unless urgent steps were taken to step up preparation
