 LONDON, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc nudged up its forecast for 2008 earnings on Thursday following a solid first quarter, helped by strong sales of schizophrenia drug Seroquel. Increases of 10 percent in revenues and 19 percent in "core" earnings per share (EPS) were helped by a weak dollar and came despite slowing demand for ulcer pill Nexium, which left the overall sales figure short of expectations. For the full year, the Anglo-Swedish group said it now expected core EPS of between $4.45 and $4.75, against $4.40-4.70 anticipated previously. Reported operating profit in the quarter rose 4 percent to $2.26 billion on sales of $7.68 billion, equivalent to core EPS of $1.28. Analysts' median forecasts were for sales of $7.83 billion and core earnings of $1.22 in a Reuters poll. "Core" earnings exclude restructuring costs and charges related to last year's acquisition of MedImmune. At 1010 GMT, AstraZeneca shares were down 1.7 percent at 2,095 pence. Global drugmakers have reported mixed results, reflecting rising generic competition, pricing pressure and product setbacks. AstraZeneca itself has had a torrid time in the past two years following the failure of key experimental medicines in late-stage development and the poorly received acquisition of MedImmune last year. But its fortunes have recently improved, with a settlement of a U.S. patent dispute over Nexium with Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd last week and recent surprisingly good clinical trial results for Crestor. The Ranbaxy deal removes the immediate threat of generic Nexium, although ongoing litigation with other companies means cheap copies of the drug might still enter the U.S. market before the 2014 date agreed with the Indian group. AstraZeneca also faces a continuing legal fight over its patents on Seroquel. Its shares have fallen nearly 40 percent since October 2006 but have rallied 19 percent since hitting a 10-year low in mid-March. The stock trades on around 9.2 times forecast 2009 earnings, a discount to British rival GlaxoSmithKline Plc on 10.8 times, according to Reuters data
