 STRASBOURG, France, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission will give a further 117.25 million euros ($185.6 million) in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world's most vulnerable people, it said on Tuesday. "The rise in basic food prices is a worldwide humanitarian disaster in the making," EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Louis Michel told the European Parliament. "Ongoing humanitarian food programmes are under enormous pressure with less food available for people already on the brink of starvation," he told the EU assembly in Strasbourg.
