 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com) - Candidates still in the executive committee of the Bangladesh Football Federation, will not be eligible to vote in the upcoming BFF election April 28. The BFF executive committee Thursday sat a meeting following a letter of the Asian Football Confederation, which has snatched voting power right of the BFF members. "The AFC Wednesday instructed us that the BFF officials, candidates for the upcoming poll, will have no voting right, and they have to choose other persons from their respective organisations or clubs to cast their votes," said BFF media manager Ahmed Syed Al Fattah after the meeting. The BFF constitution has also cut the voting right of those BFF officials contesting the poll. Some 13 members of the committee on April 12 tendered their resignations to president SA Sultan, but the BFF boss sought the AFC clearance whether the resignations would be accepted as the AFC had earlier told the BFF members not to resign before the election. Following Sultan's clearance plea, the AFC cut down voting rights of those officials. The BFF officials, contesting the election, are Monir Ahmed (senior vice president), Abdur Rahim (vice president), Manzoor Hossain Malu (vice president), Golam Rasul Mollah (vice president), Sirajul Islam Bacchu, M Mozzammel Haq Mukta, Azfar-uz-zaman Suhrab, Golam Rabbani Helal, Amirul Islam Babu, Asaduzzaman Khasru, Dewan Arshad Ali and Alhaj Mokbul Hossain (members). bdn
