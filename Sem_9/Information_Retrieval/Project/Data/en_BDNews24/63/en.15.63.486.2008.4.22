 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)The government Tuesday accepted a Tk 2,000 crore proposal to shore up Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company (BAPEX). The approval came from a meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his office. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, the CA's special assistant in charge of the industry ministry Mahbub Jamil and special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources Prof M Tamim also attended the meeting. After the meeting, Prof Tamim told bdnews24.com that the government had accepted the proposal to make BAPEX, a company of Petrobangla, stronger and agreed in principle to take the proposal ahead. "BAPEX has so far been neglected. I hope BAPEX will become an organisation of international standards." In no country did a state-run firm conduct exploration and production unilaterally, Tamin said. "There was the need for international organisations, but the local organistion must be made stronger," he said. A proposal had been sent to the Chief Adviser's Office from the Energy Division in March to strengthen BAPEX, which emerged as a company in 1989. Initially, BAPEX was given permission to carry out only exploration activities. In 2000, the government authorised the company to carry out both exploration and production activities. Part of the proposal emphasised increasing the prices of gas extracted by BAPEX and creating an opportunity for quick purchase by relaxing government policy. Energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin hoped that BAPEX would become a self-sustaining firm in seven years. "We want to make BAPEX self-reliant in explorations of oil, gas and extraction," he said. bdnews
