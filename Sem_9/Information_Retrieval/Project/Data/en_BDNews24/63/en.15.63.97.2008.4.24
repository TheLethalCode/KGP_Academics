<TITLE> Bangladesh must not take Myanmar route: Cherie Blair </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)Barrister Cherie Blair said Thursday the people of Bangladesh would not want to see former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fall in a situation similar to Myanmar's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi languishing in jail for years. Blair, wife of former British prime minister Tony Blair, also said the detained Awami League president should be released and allowed to go to the US to take emergency medical treatment. Bangladesh's international reputation "was being hampered" as the government had not let Hasina get emergency treatment abroad, she said. "In Burma (now Myanmar), there is another woman leader of (a) political party is being detained. And I would not like to think Bangladesh was going along that route," Blair, a lawyer, told reporters after observing the trial of Hasina at the special judge's court-1 in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. "I am sure that the government and the people of Bangladesh seem to be upholding human rights and the rule of law," she said. "I am sure they wouldn't want to see Sheikh Hasina brought to such a situation that her right to life is being undermined by such inhuman and degrading treatment." Blair said Myanmar, Bangladesh's Southeast Asian neighbour, was not known as the supporter of the rule of law. In Myanmar, the military junta has been ruling the country since 1962 with iron hand. The rulers have not handed over power to the National League for Democracy, which won a landslide victory in the 1990 elections. Its leader Aung San Suu Kyi is under house arrest for years. "It seems to me  that her (Hasina's) health is not good. She is suffering both physically and mentally by her detention," Blair said. "I would hope even now they (people) would see that it is the best interest to release her so that she can go to America and undertake emergency treatment which she needs and deserves." "A petition was filed on her behalf that she needs urgent medical treatment. And lack of response to that request, I think, is damaging Bangladesh's international reputation." Earlier, Blair reached the makeshift court at 11.15am and stayed until the end of the day's hearing. She spoke to Hasina. bdn
