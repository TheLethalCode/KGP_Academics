 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)British barrister Cherie Blair QC was present at the Supreme Court Wednesday to observe appeal proceedings involving a graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The wife of former British PM Tony Blair arrived in Bangladesh Tuesday on a three-day visit at the invitation of barrister Ajmalul Hossain QC. Barrister Ajmalul told bdnews24.com: "Cherie Blair was my colleague. She came to Bangladesh on a personal invitation. Her visit does not have any relation with the political case." Blair came to the Supreme Court around 9.15 am to witness a hearing on the government appeal against a High Court verdict that scrapped the case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury against Hasina. She is scheduled to meet with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury later in the day. Barrister Ajmalul has arranged a dinner party at the Hotel Sheraton Wednesday night in honour of Cherie Blair's visit. The wife of the former British premiere will visit a hospital and a Brac project during her tour. bdnews24
