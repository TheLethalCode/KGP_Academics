 HONG KONG, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top official in Hong Kong on Tuesday expressed concern about new pre-Olympics visa curbs on foreigners entering mainland China from Hong Kong, which have sparked widespread criticism from businessmen. Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, enjoys a high degree of autonomy and serves as a major gateway to the mainland. Visas are normally obtained quickly for businessmen.

China, whose Communist government values stability above all else, is taking no chances with the August Olympics and has been carrying out regular security and anti-terror drills. The journey of the Olympic torch around the world has been disrupted by protests, largely over Chinese rule in Tibet, where a wave of anti-government unrest erupted in March. Over the weekend, protests broke out in several Chinese cities, demanding a boycott of French goods and targeted French supermarket chain Carrefour, as Chinese vented indignation towards recent anti-China demonstrations in Paris. Seaton said he wasn't overly concerned. "As long as those protests ... stay peaceful, then it seems to me that that those protests won't pose any problems," he sa
