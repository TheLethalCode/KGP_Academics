<TITLE> Oil, Bank of America earnings dent rebound </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Record high oil prices and falling profits at Bank of America Corp. dented improving investor sentiment on Monday, extending losses on European bourses and setting Wall Street up for a poor start. The dollar also fell against major currencies, a reversal of recent gains. Crude oil hit a record $117.40 a barrel, building inflation worries, while the No. 2 U.S. bank said first-quarter profit fell, hurt by write-downs and rising credit losses. Net income for the bank fell to $1.21 billion from $5.26 billion a year earlier, reminding investors of the toll from the credit crisis. Globally, equities were trading at their highest since mid-January, boosted at the end of last week by US earnings resilience from internet leader Google and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and fewer-than expected writedowns from banking giant Citigroup. But the oil-Bank of America combo turned sentiment on the day. The FTSEurofirst 300 index extended losses to trade down 1.2 percent, taking back a good portion of Friday's more than 2 percent rise. Hopes that the worst of the credit crisis is behind has boosted some investors' sentiment, however. World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.6 percent on the day at levels not seen since January 15. It has risen more than 4 percent since its close last Monday. Its emerging market stock counterpart was up 0.9 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark rose 1.6 percent to a nearly two-month closing high of 13,696.55, a gain of 220.10 points. The broader TOPIX closed up 2.1 percent at 1,331.51. DOLLAR SLIPS The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies with nerves about inflation pressures from the high oil price outweighing the positive spin of the previous week. "Markets were hoping to come in today with a slightly more optimistic outlook for credit and risk appetite, but there's residual nervousness with oil prices continuing to squeeze up," Rabobank markets strategist Jeremy Stretch said. The dollar was down 0.4 percent against a basket of six major currencies. Against the yen it also fell 0.4 percent to 103.24 yen, having earlier closed in on 7-week highs hit last week. The euro gained 0.6 percent to 1.5903, rising towards last week's record high of $1.5983. Euro zone government bond prices rose after a sharp decline last week. The two-year Schatz yield was down 2 basis points at 3.787 percent while the 10-year Bund yield slipped 4 basis points to 4.103 percent. Improving sentiment for riskier assets is adding pressure to the safe-haven government debt mark
