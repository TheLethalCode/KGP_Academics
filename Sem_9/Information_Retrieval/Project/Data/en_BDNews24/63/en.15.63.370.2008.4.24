 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com) - President contender Kazi Salahuddin Thursday alleged that high ups in the Bangladesh Olympic Association were interfering in the upcoming Bangladesh Football Federation election to influence the polling. "To influence the election, the general secretary and the chief executive officer of the Bangladesh Olympic Association have been directly interfering and threatening the councilors almost everyday in the name of administration that is condemnable," read Salahuddin from a written paper at a press conference Thursday. He also hoped that both officials would refrain from such activities in the interest of a neutral BOA. The former national striker also sought the intervention of the National Sports Council chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed to thwart the efforts of what he called the evil force trying to disrupt the BFF election. Salahuddin also alleged that some footballers and organisers were engaged in propaganda against him to tarnish his image so that he could not participate in the election properly. Salahuddin also introduced his panel in the conference. "In the quest of giving a rhythmic and modern touch to football, I am going to contest the election as a president candidate under the banner of 'Like-minded alliance panel," said the country's living-legend footballer. Asked how he would take football ahead with the people who failed to live up to football in the last five years, Salahuddin said, "The amended BFF constitution has inspired me to contest for president, who will enjoy vast power in leading the committee." Salahuddin said that he would not contest again if he failed to serve the purpose of football after being elected president. On the other hand, the combined panel, led by Amin Ahmed Chowdhury, expressed its dissatisfaction over the rejection of cancellation appeal of candidatures of Salahuddin, Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu and Golam Rabbani Helal. "We are not satisfied by the way the election commissioner handled the matter," president candidate Major General (retd) Amin Ahmed Chowdhury said at a press conference at the Sonali Otit Club Thursday. Shamsul Haq Chowdhury, councillor from the Chittagong Football Association Monday, lodged an appeal with the election commission demanding the cancellation of the three candidates for providing wrong information in their nominations, but the BFF election commission Wednesday rejected the appeal citing that the appeal had been not submitted in time. Ahmed urged the chief election commissioner to play an impartial role in the election. Replying to a query, Ahmed said that they would not seek legal steps as they did not like to get court help especially in a sports matter. "Why did the commission arrange the hearing, if the complainant did not file the allegation in time," questioned lawyer Riazul Kaiser. He also said that the election commission did not hear from them during the hearing, and that that was why they called a press conference. Apart from Ahmed and Kaiser, Dewan Arefin Tutul, Zakaria Pintu, barrister Omar Sadat and Shamsul Haq Chowdhury were among others present.
