<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com) - Abahani Limited and Sonali Bank moved into the final of the Club Hockey tournament beating their respective rivals Thursday at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. Abahani defeated their archrival Mohammedan SC 5-4 in tiebreaker after regulation time of the first semifinal ended in a 1-1 draw. Sonali Bank thrashed star-studded Usha Krira Chakra 2-1 in the second semifinal. The first semifinal rolled into a tiebreaker after remaining two minutes of the chaos- filled Wednesday's game ended in a draw as both the sides took the field accepting yesterday's 1-1 margin. Mamunur Rahman Chayan, Mosharraf Hossain Kuti, Moududur Rahman Shuvo, Musa Mia and Rasel Mahmud Jimy converted to ensure Abahani's final berth. Abahani goalkeeper Jahid Hossain stopped the fifth hit, taken by Jahid Bin Talib, jumping his right side while Mohammedan's Kamruzzaman Rana, Irfanul Haq, Syed Al Masum and Abdus Sajjad John found the target. In the second semifinal, Rimon Kumar capitalising on an Iqbal Nader push hit the board to put Sonali Bank ahead in the fourth minute. But the lead was short-lived for the bankers as Imran Ahmed Sohel restored the margin for Usha taking a fierce hit from Rahul Kanti Roy. After the equaliser, Sonali Bank's players surrounded the umpire with a demand for cancellation of the goal, but the umpire was determined, and the play resumed after an eight-minute break. Asaduzzaman Chandan scored the match-decider in the 20th minute from a penalty corner with a superb combination of Ashraful Islam Shishu, Biplob and Enamul Kabir. After the breather, Usha pressed hard on the bankers' defence, but they could hardly make any room for scoring as the performance of Usha was not up to the mark, compared with their performance against Abahani KC in their group last match.
