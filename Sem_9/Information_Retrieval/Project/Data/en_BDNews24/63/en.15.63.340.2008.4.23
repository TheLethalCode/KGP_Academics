<TITLE> China says Hu's Japan visit won't resolve gas row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's ambassador to Japan has played down expectations that a row over natural gas resources in the East China Sea can be settled during a May visit by President Hu Jintao, the Foreign Ministry reported on Wednesday. A dozen rounds of official-level talks between the Asian giants have failed to yield a resolution over how to use the resources in parts of the sea over which both sides claim economic rights. "Of course we hope the problem can be resolved at an early date," Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in an interview with Japan's Fuji TV reprinted on the Web site of the Chinese Foreign Ministry (www.fmprc.gov.cn). "But the East China Sea question is very complicated and there are many technical questions to be resolved so it would be inadvisable to directly connect it with the leadership visit." "Otherwise, not only will it interfere with the visit, it will not be helpful to resolving the problem," Cui said. Earlier, Cui had said China hoped the issue could be settled in time for Hu's trip, which is expected in early May and which will be the first by a Chinese head of state to Japan in 10 years. It follows reciprocal visits by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda in the past year, as ties warm between the former wartime foes despite the outstanding gas issue. Japan's World War Two invasion of China has shadowed relations and, as China has grown into the world's fourth-largest economy, the two have become strategic competitors for influence in the region. But leaders of both countries have indicated they are keen to keep ties on a more even keel after they reached a crisis point three years ago when anti-Japanese protests erupted across China.
