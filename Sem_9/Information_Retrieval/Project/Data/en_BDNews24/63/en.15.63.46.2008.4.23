<TEXT>
 Hydrabad, April 23 (bdnews24.com) - A typically explosive innings from Sehwag, who blasted 10 fours and 6 sixes in a 41-ball unbeaten 94 sealed a thumping 9-wicket win against the Deccan Chargers. Sehwag became the first Indian to receive the Man of the Match award in the IPL. The Delhi openers Sehwag and Gambhir came out to bat with the knowledge that they didn't have to do anything spectacular to overtake the modest Deccan Chargers total. Gambhir was dismissed by Vaas in the fourth over when he flashed hard at a rising delivery to give keeper Gilchrist an easy catch. The in-form Shikhar Dhawan then came to the crease and went about his business in a calm and collected fashion taking the singles and twos. His partner,though, sent the Hyderabad bowlers on a serious leather hunt with powerful shots all around the ground. Sehwag was given a reprieve on 63 when Gilchrist missed a simple stumping chance off Ojha and the ball went on to hit the helmet placed behind him. Gilchrist wasn't at his best , earlier in the over, he failed to latch onto two wide deliveries. Hyderabad captain VVS Laxman tried his best to control the Delhi Dasher by ringing in the bowling changes but Sehwag was particularly severe on Aussie Andrew Symonds when he hit the helpless bowler for a record breaking 30 runs in the 13th over to all but finish the match. Earlier, a brilliant 66 off 36 balls from Rohit Sharma lifted Deccan Chargers to a respectable total of 142. Sharma smashed 6 fours and 4 sixes on a relatively flat track where his more illustrious team mates failed to prosper. With the likes of Gilchrist, Symonds and Afridi in their ranks, the Deccan Chargers will be disappointed with their second straight loss while their star players will be required to justify their high price with some performances to help their team be a force to reckon with in the IP
