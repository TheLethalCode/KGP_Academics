 Paris, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Friday, gaining ground for a third straight session as Ericsson jumped more than 20 percent after it pleased investors with better-than-expected results. Strong results also boosted shares of Volvo, up 5.5 percent. At 0706 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.7 percent at 1,325.30 points. "The reporting season is in focus and all in all the tone is positive," said Achim Matzke, European stock indexes analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "Since the start of April we've had a recovery movement after the bear market in the first quarter and this recovery should continue, although the momentum is not very high."
