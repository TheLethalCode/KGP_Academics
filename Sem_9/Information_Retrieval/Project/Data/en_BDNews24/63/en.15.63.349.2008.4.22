<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's sports minister urged national hockey chiefs to quit on Tuesday, a day after a television programme made allegations of corruption against the federation secretary. Indian hockey was plunged into crisis after the popular Hindi language Aaj Tak channel made the allegations against K.Jothikumaran in a programme broadcast on Monday. Jothikumaran told Reuters the allegations were false and he would "keep away" until an investigation was conducted. However, sports minister Manohar Singh Gill said he wanted him to resign and also urged Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president Kanwar Pal Singh Gill to step down. "The incident seen on television last night was most unfortunate for our hockey, and distressed every Indian," the minister said in a statement. The IHF has been under media and public pressure since the men's national team, eight-time former Olympic champions, failed to qualify for the Beijing Games at last month's qualifier in Chile. The hockey chiefs have held their posts since 1994. "Since yesterday, I have agonised long over the IHF," the minister said. "Its recent disaster in Chile is still fresh in every Indian's mind. "Now, trust and faith in fair selection is shaken. I believe, in the totality of the situation, the IHF president must also introspect and review his position. "In full consideration of the situation facing Indian hockey, and the national need, I urge him to consider withdrawing from his current responsibility. "It is time to let other Indians make an attempt to lift our hockey." The channel which broadcast the programme on Monday used undercover reporters to film a discussion with Jothikumaran about organising a proposed tournament. The reporters, posing as businessmen, requested that an unnamed player be selected in the national squad and television footage showed Jothikumaran accepting large amounts of cash. It also broadcast a telephone conversation purportedly between Jothikumaran and its reporter where he promised all efforts would be made to select the player of their choice. The issue was raised in the nation's parliament. The scandal could scupper Indian hopes of staging the 2010 hockey World Cup. The international federation has already warned it would take the event away unless India stepped up preparation
