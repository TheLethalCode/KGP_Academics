 BRUSSELS, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union condemned on Wednesday the arrest and jailing of Belarussian opposition activist Andrei Kim and called for his immediate release. Kim was sentenced on Tuesday to 1-1/2 years in jail after being convicted of attacking a policeman at a protest by small entrepreneurs in January. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, condemned the arrest and sentencing of Kim and seven others, calling the actions politically motivated. "They stand in direct contradiction with the fundamental values of freedom of expression and assembly that form an essential part of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law," she said in a statement. "I call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested while demonstrating peacefully, as well as all other political prisoners." The seven other activists from the entrepreneur movement were given suspended sentences of up to two years. Two were fined. Western countries accuse Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko of flouting freedom of speech and assembly and hounding the small liberal and nationalist opposition. He has nevertheless tried to improve ties with the West, particularly the 27-nation EU, since quarrelling with his traditional ally Russia last year over energy supplies. EU ambassadors have welcomed earlier releases of jailed activists and have said a parliamentary election due in September could help consolidate ties
