<TITLE> UK housebuilder shares plunge on Persimmon warning </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's housing market has deteriorated rapidly in the past few weeks, since a key survey found house prices fell 2.5 percent in March, as buyers struggle to get mortgages, housebuilder Persimmon Plc said. Britain's biggest housebuilder by market value and No.3 by homes built, said on Thursday its sales so far in 2008 were down 24 percent year on year to 1.37 billion pounds ($2.72 billion), as the credit crisis bit deeper. At 0900 GMT, Persimmon shares were down 8.1 percent at a 3-1/2 year low of 597.5 pence as analysts cut profit forecasts. Other housebuilder shares followed suit. Barratt Developments was down 11 percent to a six-year low, Taylor Wimpey was off 8.3 percent to an eight-year low and Bovis Homes slid 4.7 percent to a four-year low. Persimmon said March visitor numbers were encouraging but "over the last three weeks the unprecedented tightening in the mortgage market has caused a further deterioration of the housing market, leading to lower sales volumes and increased cancellation rates. "As a result, an increase in discounting, marketing costs and incentives are being utilised to compete for the reduced level of demand. This is having a negative impact on margins." The timing given by Persimmon ties in with a report this month from Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, that house prices fell 2.5 percent in March. Britain's housing market, which enjoyed a boom stretching back to the mid-1990s that saw many valuations more than treble in price, had been slowing before the global credit crisis began last summer and housebuilders' share prices have slumped. GOVERNMENT IN ACTION Unlike a previous housing downturn which began in the late 1980s, British interest rates are relatively low and employment is historically high. But the credit crisis has hit consumer sentiment and led to the withdrawal of many mortgage offers. Indicators have shown house prices falling for several months, leading the government to urge mortgage lenders to pass on Bank of England interest rate cuts in full to borrowers. This week, the BoE said it would issue an unlimited amount of Treasury bills in exchange for mortgage-backed securities to boost funds available for mortgage lenders. An indicator the housing market's woes have not hit the wider economy came with a statement from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday that underlying retail sales growth remains robust. Sales in the first quarter of 2008 were some 5.6 percent higher year on year. Persimmon said the government should "urgently consider additional action to benefit first-time buyers by increasing the threshold for stamp duty". It added: "Further reductions in interest rates would also be helpful in supporting sentiment." Landsbanki analyst Simon Brown said Persimmon was a top performer in the sector and better placed than many of its peers, but there was little "specific action the group can achieve internally" to improve the situation. "Change would have to be from an improved outlook for mortgage lending ... the risk is on the downside although we consider the trough in mortgage lending will pass at the end of June," he said. Brown, who rates Persimmon a "buy" with an 830p target, cut his forecast for the company's 2008 pretax profit by 40 percent to 265 million pounds
