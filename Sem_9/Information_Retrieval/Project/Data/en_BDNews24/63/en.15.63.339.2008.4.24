 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government's planned flexible school calendar for rural areas, in view of academic obstacles such as agricultural work and natural disasters, is expected to go a long way to overcoming exclusion of rural children in education, adviser Rasheda K Choudhury said Thursday. In rural areas, children help in the homestead year-round and are especially busy during harvest times, while natural disasters such as floods and cyclones cause closure of schools, the primary and mass education adviser pointed out. "The flexible calendar will be prepared in consideration of such realities," Rasheda said, adding that concerned authorities had already been instructed in this regard. Speaking at a roundtable on "Ending Exclusion in Education" at the Jatiya Press Club, the adviser blamed the exclusion of poor children from schools on attitudes of people working for expansion of education. "We have to change our attitude towards poor children. We have to treat all children equally." Rasheda said political commitment is vital to reach the goal of 'education for all' in the country. She stressed local level planning in addition to macro level policies to bring all children to school. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) organised Thursday's discussion to mark Global Action Week 2008. Muhammad Samad, lecturer at Dhaka University's Institute of Social Welfare and Research, presented the keynote paper. According to the figures Samad presented, 20 percent of children do not have access to any educational institution in Bangladesh, 30 percent drop out before completing grade five and one out of three who complete five years of primary schooling still remain non-literate or semi-literate. Poor and disadvantaged children including street children, indigenous children and children of sex workers are the immediate victims of exclusion, Samad said. He suggested formulation and implementation of a comprehensive and inclusive national education policy. Former education minister Osman Farruk asked the government to take initiatives to make primary schools attractive to children. He laid emphasis on developing infrastructure of schools, ensuring quality education and providing children with necessary materials. bd
