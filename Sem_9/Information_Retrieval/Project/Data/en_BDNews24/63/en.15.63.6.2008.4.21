 MADRID, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain has sent a naval frigate to waters off Somalia, where pirates seized a Spanish tuna fishing boat with 26 people on board on Sunday, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the crew seemed to be unhurt. On Monday national radio quoted the captain of the boat as saying everybody on board was well.

"The vessel reportedly suffered minor damage to the hull close to the stern, resulting in a minor spill of fuel oil."
