 LONDON, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard described the last week as the hardest of his life after his mother was rushed to hospital with a serious illness. Lampard returned to action for the first time since the news against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final first leg on Tuesday when Chelsea snatched a 1-1 draw at Anfield. The England international said any thoughts of a Champions League final had been put firmly to the back of his mind while his mother Pat battled with pneumonia. "This time last week was very bleak," Lampard, who missed the Premier League games against Wigan Athletic and Everton, told the Chelsea Web site (www.chelseafc.com) on Wednesday. "I won't go into details but we were getting a very bleak outlook. That was the hardest moment for me in my life." His mother's condition improved enough for Lampard to play against Liverpool, although he said he had resigned himself to missing the match. "Three days ago I wasn't playing in my mind. But we got some decent news on Saturday afternoon and my head came round a little bit then. I made a decision to go in training on Sunday to see how I felt," the 29-year-old said. "The manager and the club have been fantastic and have not put any pressure on me whatsoever. I felt I could come and play and in a way the training and the playing has helped to take my mind off things, whereas last week I was in a bad situation." Lampard was at fault for Liverpool's goal when he got caught in possession just outside his own area. He said the past week had taken its toll. "I have been in better shape for games both mentally and physically but it has been a very difficult week," he said. Lampard is hopeful of playing in Chelsea's must-win Premier League match against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. They trail United by three points with three games remainin
