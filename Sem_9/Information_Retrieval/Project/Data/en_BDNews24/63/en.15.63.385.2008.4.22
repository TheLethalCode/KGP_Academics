 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)--The government has decided against further wheat imports for the time being, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said on Tuesday after a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase. The finance adviser told reporters that the decision was taken when the purchase committee rejected a proposal for import of 43,000 metric tonnes of wheat. The food directorate had proposed to import the amount through private dealers by tender. "The government has decided not to import wheat for now for two reasons," said Mirza Aziz, who heads the purchase committee. "The first is there is adequate wheat in the country at present. The country this time had a bumper crop of wheat." "The second reason is the price of wheat in the international market is now showing a downward trend. It has been forecast that the wheat price will fall further." Mirza Aziz said taking these points into consideration the decision for suspending wheat imports was taken. The purchase committee did approve a Tk 139.57 crore proposal from the Japanese Marubeni Corporation for repair of 2 units at Karnaphuli hydropower station, the adviser said. The Karnaphuli hydropower plant was established in 1988. Marubeni Corporation was involved in its set up. The units 4 and 5 of the plant, once repaired, will have a generating capacity of 50 and 100 megawatts respectively. bdnews
