 BEIJING, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China said on Tuesday a shipment of weapons bound for Zimbabwe may head back after the vessel was unable to unload, but defended the cargo as "perfectly normal trade". Zambia's president urged regional states on Monday to bar the An Yue Jiang from entering their waters, saying the weapons could deepen Zimbabwe's election crisis. The ship already failed to unload its cargo in South Africa, and Mozambique and Angola have denied it access to their ports. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said the contract for the shipment was signed last year and was "unrelated to recent developments" in Zimbabwe. Jiang said the arms shipment was "perfectly normal trade in military goods between China and Zimbabwe", but because it was impossible for Zimbabwe to receive the goods, the company involved is now considering shipping the cargo back.

The 300,000-strong South African Transport and Allied Workers Union refused to unload the weapons because of concerns Mugabe's government might use them against opponents in the post-election stalemate. The ship left South Africa on Friday. Mozambique said on Saturday the vessel would not be allowed into its waters. Angola said on Monday the ship was not welcome there either. "This ship has not sought a request to enter Angolan territorial waters and it's not authorised to enter Angolan ports," Filomeno Mendonca, director of the Institute of Angolan Ports, told Luanda Radio LAC, a private Angolan radio station. China is trying to prevent the controversy from fuelling criticism over its human rights record and rule in Tibet ahead of hosting the Olympics in August.
