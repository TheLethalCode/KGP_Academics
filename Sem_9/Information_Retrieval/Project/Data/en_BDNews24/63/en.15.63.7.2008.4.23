<TITLE> Kenyans queue in last minute frenzy for Safaricom </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Naivasha, Kenya, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Just hours before east Africa's biggest IPO closed on Wednesday, Kenyans -- including many who lost everything in post-election violence -- thronged brokerage houses to buy Safaricom shares. The government is selling a 25 percent stake in the mobile phone operator, one of Kenya's most profitable firms, and expects proceeds of at least 50 billion shillings ($812 million). The offer is seen as an important gauge of investor confidence in the country after President Mwai Kibaki's disputed December re-election triggered ethnic clashes that killed at least 1,200 people and left 350,000 homeless. "I never thought that I would invest in anything after seeing my life savings reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes," said James Waiganjo, 68, whose house was burnt by marauding gangs who also killed his son in the violence. At a price of 5 shillings each for the 10 billion shares offered, the firm's minimum market value will hit $3.3 billion. Foreign investors will pay a slight premium for the company in which Britain's Vodafone holds a 40 percent stake. Now living in a tent in a football stadium, Waiganjo sold his plot of land at a throwaway price to raise the minimum 10,000 shillings ($162) to take part in the offer which analysts expect be oversubscribed by about 200 percent. Most small investors, like Waijango, hope Safaricom's share price will soar when the company lists in June, as has happened with other major flotations in Kenya. But analysts say Safaricom's debut is not expected to reach the heights of past issues such as utility KenGen whose price quadrupled on the first day of trade in May 2006. "Doubling in share price means the value goes from $3.3 billion to $6.6 billion, that is too rich a valuation. We are going to get 50-60 percent (increase in price)," said Aly-Khan Satchu, a Nairobi stock analyst and former investment banker. ENTREPRENEURS Domestic workers, security guards and students are among those queuing with businessmen for Safaricom stock. And many retail investors, especially those who have borrowed to buy the low-priced IPO shares, will sell them quickly, analysts say. "We have a shareholder revolution going on here," Satchu said. "People at the bottom are putting in their savings. They are like entrepreneurs and have got a taste of risking capital." Since mobile telephony is booming in Africa, foreign investors are looking for a piece of the pie. Satchu said 39 Africa-dedicated funds set up in 2007 may be looking to invest in Safaricom. Kenya's mobile penetration is about 33 percent and Safaricom has some 80 percent of those subscribers. It has launched popular products such as MPesa, a money transfer system, and top-up cards for as low as 20 shillings ($0.33). But analysts expect growing competition coupled with the government's policy to curb calling rates will soon cap Safaricom's exponential growth in revenues. It made 17.2 billion shillings in the year that ended March 2007. Safaricom's closest challenger in Kenya has until now been Celtel but France Telecom, which owns 51 percent of Telkom Kenya, and Johannesburg-based Econet Wireless International both have licences to roll out networks. Christopher Hartland-Peel, head of Africa equities research at emerging markets broker Exotix, said that although Safaricom was well managed and the share price attractive, the prospectus did not mention any plans to enter regional markets and the scope to grow subscribers past 9.5 million in Kenya was narrow. "The people who want mobile telephones already have them," he said.
