<TITLE> Judges issue won't break Pakistan coalition: Sharif </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of Pakistan's ruling coalition vowed on Tuesday to honour a commitment to reinstate judges dismissed by President Pervez Musharraf and said any differences over the issue would not break their alliance. "The desire of those who think this coalition should break up will go unfulfilled," former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said as he stood alongside Pakistan People's Party leader Asif Ali Zardari at a joint news conference in Islamabad. Neither Sharif or Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, hold any government office, but they lead the two largest parties in a coalition that took power in March. They formed a post-election alliance after defeating Musharraf's political allies in a Feb. 18 vote. Zardari, whose PPP leads the government, signed an accord with Sharif last month committing to the reinstatement of around 60 judges dismissed by Musharraf after imposing emergency rule in November. Restored judges could revive challenges to Musharraf's re-election by the last parliament while still army chief. Having removed Musharraf's parliamentary support they now aim to amend the constitution to strip him of presidential powers to dismiss the government, but Sharif and Zardari differ over how fast to move. "I say that it should be done immediately, he says show a bit of patience. Let's see what happens," said Sharif, the prime minister General Musharraf overthrew in a 1999 coup. The PPP, however, is wary of forcing a confrontation with Musharraf that could destabilise its young government, which is facing huge economic challenges and fighting Islamist militancy. "I am saying that it should be done when we can do it," Zardari quipped. REPORTS OF DEADLOCK Western allies are keen to see a smooth transition of political power in nuclear-armed Pakistan. They fear any instability could cause the country's leaders to lose focus in the war against al Qaeda militants. Newspapers on Tuesday were full of reports that talks between Zardari and Sharif were deadlocked as the PPP was reluctant to restore Iftikhar Chaudhry as Supreme Court Chief Justice, and some reports suggested Sharif's aides could resign from cabinet. Chaudhry's defiance of Musharraf made him a cause celebre, but while the PPP leadership has stood up for the independence of the judiciary it has reservations about some individual judges, including Chaudhry, according to party sources. But Sharif and Zardari sought to play down any differences that remained over the issue. "The coalition partners hereby declare that there is complete harmony on issues, including the issue of restoration of deposed judges," said a joint statement issued after they met. Sharif said the coalition planned to pass a resolution in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, seeking the restoration of the judges soon. Under the accord, the new government is supposed to pass a resolution within 30 days of its formation, which would mean by the end of April. Analysts say the PPP is worried that some judges could take up challenges to a pardon Musharraf granted in October that wiped out corruption cases against Bhutto and Zardari, among others.
