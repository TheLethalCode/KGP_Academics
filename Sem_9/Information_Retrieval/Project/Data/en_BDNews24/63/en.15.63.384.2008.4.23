 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com) - The Pakistan Academy team clinched the Grameenphone tri-nation Academy Cup title with a hard fought 39-run win against their Bangladesh counterparts at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Wednesday. Bangladesh ended up at 237 all out in 46.3 overs after Pakistan racked up a challenging total of 276 for six. Opener Shamsur Rahman (37) and one-down Farhad Hossain (26) contributed a fine 57 runs for the second wicket after opener Imrul Kayes fell on five. Yasir broke the stand having Shamsur caught behind the wicket, and Bangladesh slipped to 95 for four before middle orders Mehrab Hossain (22), Nasir Hossain (52) and Mushfiqur Rahim (56) steadied the innings. Nasir and Mushfiq took the side to 217 for six from 124 for five, before Nasir was run out for a fine 52 off 67 balls featuring two fours and one six. After his departure, Bangladesh needed 60 runs in 7.2 overs but the last four wickets toppled for just 17 runs, leaving them 39 runs short of the target. Earlier, opener Khurram Manzoor hammered 107 and one-down Khalid Latif struck 81 to power Pakistan to 276 for six in 50 overs. Raheel Majeed (43) and Ahmed Shehzad (31) were other notable scorers for the visitors. bd
