 LONDON, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil dipped below $116 a barrel on Friday as a stronger dollar offset concerns over supply disruptions in Nigeria and the North Sea. US crude futures fell 55 cents to $115.51 a barrel by 0920 GMT, adding to a loss of $2.24 a barrel on Thursday. London Brent crude dropped 58 cents to $113.76 a barrel.
