<TITLE> Sidebottom reflects on memorable year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 25 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Somewhat to his bemusement, Ryan Sidebottom found himself this week sitting in a dusty toolshed explaining how his new-found celebrity status as England's paramount bowler has changed his life. Not to any great extent, it would appear, as Sidebottom reflected on a year during which he has emerged from the international wilderness to lead his country's attack. "I'm still a home bird," he told reporters. "I like to go and watch rugby league. I spend time at home with the two cats. "People in general have been nice. They come up to me and say 'well done, keep going'. That has been really satisfying." Until his recall to the national colours last year, Sidebottom appeared destined to become part of the answer to a sports quiz question. His father Arnie played one test against Australia in 1985 and Ryan had similarly resigned himself to a life on the county circuit after failing to take a wicket in his only test against Pakistan in 2001. To his frustration, Sidebottom's brand of medium-fast left-arm swing was out of fashion as then England coach Duncan Fletcher searched for tall, young fast bowlers banging the ball hard into the pitch regularly in excess of 140 kph. Sidebottom, at around 130 kph, was considered too slow. In fact, as he showed in the series against New Zealand this year, Sidebottom can be deceptively quick, and at times he came close to the 140 mark. LONG HAIR "I have always been able to bowl a little bit quicker but in county cricket you are bowling day in and day out and the body just won't last," he said after launching an npower artificial practice area in the Yorkshire city of Sheffield. "I was disappointed when I was bowling well for Notts (Nottinghamshire) and nobody came to see me. "Duncan didn't come down to see what I was capable of. That's the way it goes. He's been a good coach and he's done well for England. I can bowl a little bit quicker and maybe I can surprise myself." To the casual sports watcher, Sidebottom is the bowler with the long, ginger, curly hair worn in a style rarely seen outside heavy metal bands. Cricket fans relish his ability to move the ball late in the air and England supporters applaud the extra dimension he brings to an attack which has faltered since the heady Ashes triumph of 2005. The figures are compelling. In 12 tests since his recall against West Indies last year Sidebottom has taken 53 wickets. In three tests against New Zealand his tally was 24 and he was essentially the difference between the sides as England recovered from one down to win 2-1. "I have worked hard on my swing bowling," Sidebottom said. "I think swing bowling in general is coming back into cricket. "There was an era when there was swing bowling and then it went to 90 miles (140 kms) an hour. I think swing bowling has come back into it. I have always worked on that side of my game because balls are swinging in general." CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM Sidebottom's emergence, and the return of Andy Flintoff to first-class cricket after a fourth ankle operation, have generated guarded optimism among England supporters with home series against New Zealand and South Africa and a tour of West Indies in sight before they challenge Australia for the Ashes next year. "There are good bowlers, great bowlers who have done well for England," Sidebottom said. "They have won the Ashes, they will be looking to take wickets, they will be knocking on the door, come selection day. I need to be ready and taking wickets." Six years on the county circuit have kept the likeable Sidebottom firmly grounded and the family experience makes him fully aware of the fleeting glory of sporting fame. "I'm still learning to play test cricket and it's hard work and it's tiring," he said. "Twelve months ago if someone was to say: 'You are going to play for England again' I suppose I would have laughed. All the talk was about every other bowler in county cricket but myself. "At the time I thought I was bowling well and I'm excited every time I play. My aim is to take wickets and I am enjoying every minute of it, interviews, people asking me to do things. "I couldn't be happier and I would like it to continu
