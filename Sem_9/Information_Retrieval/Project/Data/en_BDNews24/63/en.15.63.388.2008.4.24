<TITLE> Japan, Russia talks to focus on G8, economic ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo , April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan and Russia will likely focus on economic ties and the coming Group of Eight summit while keeping a decades-old dispute over tiny islands on the back burner at a bilateral leaders' summit in Moscow this week. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda will discuss the feud, which has blocked the signing of a peace treaty ending World War Two, when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin and President-elect Dmitry Medvedev on Saturday, a Japanese official said. But with Fukuda's domestic clout waning in the face of a divided parliament and Russian nationalism on the rise, chances of progress are remote, diplomatic analysts said. The dispute over the islands, known as the Southern Kuriles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, has overshadowed Russian-Japanese relations for more than 60 years. The Soviet Union seized the islands after declaring war on Japan just a week before the Japanese surrendered in August 1945. Neither side accepts the other's claim of sovereignty over the sparsely populated islands, the closest of which is just 15 km (9 miles) from Hokkaido. Fukuda's popularity has fallen below the critical 30 percent level due to doubts about his leadership as he struggles to pass legislation through a divided parliament, where the opposition bloc controls the upper house and can delay bills. The Moscow trip is one in a string of diplomatic events the Japanese leader hopes could help bolster his flagging popularity. He received South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Tokyo earlier this week and will welcome Chinese President Hu Jintao in May. "Public support for the Fukuda cabinet has been stuck on a low track. So he is desperate to do do whatever he can to jack up his support ratings," said Terumasa Nakanishi, a professor of international politics at Kyoto University. CLIMATE CHANGE, ECONOMIC TIES But a worsening standoff with opposition parties in parliament has forced Fukuda to cancel a visit to Britain, France and Germany to meet his counterparts before hosting the July 7-9 G8 summit. The clash could come to a head next week, when the ruling bloc is expected to use its two-thirds majority in the lower house to revive a controversial gasoline tax that expired on March 31 after the upper house declined to vote on an extension. Japanese officials said Fukuda's talks in Moscow would focus on efforts to make the G8 summit a success, including steps towards a new post-2012 framework to fight climate change. Japan, the world's fifth-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has become a major emissions credit buyer and has said it intends to meet its Kyoto Protocol obligations by buying around 100 million tonnes of credits to be delivered between 2008 and 2012. These could come from private clean-energy projects in developing countries, or from countries like Russia that, under the Kyoto protocol, have a surplus of governmental carbon credits, called AAUs. The summit coincides with efforts by Japan and Russia to expand economic ties. Russia is keen for funds to develop its Far Eastern regions while Japan is eager to tap Russia's booming oil industry to reduce its reliance on the Middle East for its energy needs. Trade between Russia and Japan has risen fivefold since 2002. Major investors include carmaker Toyota Motor Corp , which last year opened its first plant in Russia. "Japanese companies including Toyota have started to secure foundations in Russia. Economic relations between Japan and Russia will become firmer and firmer," Nakanishi said. "The momentum for solid economic ties, that has been brewing in the past 10 years or so, will never stop waning.
