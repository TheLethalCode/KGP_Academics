 April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr pulled back from confrontation with the government on Friday, asking his followers to continue to observe a shaky ceasefire and not to battle government troops. Following are some key details on Sadr: Sadr, in his 30s, led two uprisings against US forces in 2004 and the Pentagon once called his Mehdi Army militia the biggest threat to Iraq's security. US officials and Sunni Arab leaders in the past have accused the militia of sectarian killings, though Sadr condemns violence against fellow Iraqis and has called on his followers to make peace with Sunnis. Sadr's movement ventured into national politics in 2005, and he was instrumental in appointing Nuri al-Maliki, a fellow Shia, as prime minister in 2006. But Sadr pulled his movement out of the government in April 2007 when Maliki refused to set a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. Sadr took his movement out of the ruling Shia Alliance in September 2007. His group had held a quarter of the seats in the alliance. A fervent nationalist, Sadr has attracted a zealous following among the young and dispossessed, many of whose lives were upended by UN sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime in the 1990s. Sadr derives much of his authority from his family. His father, respected Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, was killed in 1999 for defying Saddam. Sadr rarely appeared in public in 2007 and US officials say he spent most of the year in neighbouring Iran. He has been taking advanced Islamic studies to earn credentials that would allow him to issue religious edicts. This would also enhance his prestige among majority Shia at a time when his movement is engaged in a bitter power struggle with another Shia faction, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, for influence in the oil-producing south. Senior figures in the Shia clerical establishment have often dismissed Sadr as an upstart who has little scholarly achievement. Sadr ordered the Mehdi Army to freeze its activities for six months in late August 2007 after gunbattles among rival Shia factions killed dozens of people in the holy city of Kerbala. He undertook the move to weed out rogue elements of his militia. The US military says the ceasefire helped bring violence down in the latter part of 2007. Sadr extended the ceasefire at the end of February for six months. Late last month Iraqi security forces launched a crackdown on militias, including the Mehdi Army, in the southern oil city of Basra. Clashes quickly spread to Baghdad. Sadr warned of "open war" last Saturday unless Maliki ordered a halt to the crackdown, but on Friday said his threat was only directed at US force
