 Dhaka, April 23(bdnews24.com)British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury expressed the UK's hope Wednesday that the Election Commission would announce an election date and that the emergency would be lifted before the election. He told reporters after a meeting with adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman: "People will be secure in their minds about the election when the date is announced. They will be confident of it." When asked about doubt in the minds of people on whether the election would be held according to the roadmap, Chowdhury said: "The government has pledged both nationally and internationally to hold the election in time. We are also hopeful". "In our opinion announcement of the election date will be helpful to remove all doubt." "But that is not our decision to make," the high commissioner said. Regarding polls amid a state of emergency Chowdhury stated: "Our stand is clear. We are optimistic that emergency will be lifted". People should have all freedom to prepare for the election so that they can enjoy it fully, he said, adding that in Bangladesh election is a joyous occasion for which people want freedom. "We hope such a climate will be created. We all want such a climate to prevail." "I feel it is possible to withdraw emergency before the election," said the British envoy. Replying to a question on what would happen if the emergency were not withdrawn, he said: "The emergency should at least be relaxed at all levels so that it is possible to hold free, fair and acceptable election. But, law and order also has to be maintained so that the people feel the electoral process is secure." "Sixty million voters have been enlisted by now. We hope this programme will be over by June, July. Institutional reform is going on. We also acknowledge the programme for political reforms". On pre-dialogue talks between the government and political parties, he said: "I am not the proper person to comment on it. But I want good to come out of it. Out of this, a commitment will come from the political parties". When Anwar Choudhury took up his post as British High Commissioner in Dhaka, Khaleda Zia was prime minister and Sheikh Hasina was opposition leader. As his tenure comes to en end, both leaders are now in jail. When reporters asked him to comment in this regard, Anwar said: "It is sorrowful. But I have hope the matter will be resolved in the right way ." bdnews24.
