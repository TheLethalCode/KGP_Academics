 LONDON, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some of Britain's largest insurance companies are taking weeks to pay out pension money -- and the industry body has quietly ditched rules designed to protect savers from delays. Insurers are taking an average of 20 working days to release savers' pension money, according to a survey by annuities firm Partnership Assurance, with many household names taking five weeks or more. The lengthy turnaround times are netting insurers vast sums of money and come despite the Association of British Insurers (ABI) previously stipulating that it was good practice to transfer pension funds within 10 working days of receiving all documentation. Nigel Callaghan, a pensions analyst at independent financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "If they (insurers) can keep hold of billions of pounds for 20 or 25 working days, then how much money do they make? "All too often, consumers are being left high and dry as they are made to wait weeks or months before their annuity is set up, simply due the commercial cynicism of too many pension companies." Household name insurers are among the worst offenders, according to the Partnership Assurance data, which covers the past three years and looks at more than 6,000 cases. Axa took an average 28 days to release funds in the past year, Aegon, which owns Scottish Equitable, took 26 days, and Legal & General 25 days. Other big insurers have a better track record: Norwich Union took 14 days, a figure that has remained static since 2006, while Standard Life has improved its pay-out times to 10 days in 2008 from 15 in both 2007 and 2006. But Callaghan fears the situation could be set to worsen after the ABI replaced the 10-day rule with new guidelines that say insurance firms must pay out savings by the retirement date specified on pension documents -- usually on the 60th or 65th birthday. If a firm misses the "selected retirement date", it should explain why and consider paying missed interest if it decides there has been a significant delay. "The retirement boat is sinking, and the ABI isn't so much rearranging deckchairs, as banging away at the hull with an axe in the belief that it will let the water out," said Callaghan. "There's no reason why their members can't settle transactions within five days; the unit trust industry can do it, so why not the insurers?" However, the trade body says the new rule is not watered down -- but, rather, is "more stringent and gives customers more certainty about when their payments should start". Jon French, a spokesman for the ABI, continued: "There was a wide consultation on the new guidance with ABI member companies, and all relevant members have been informed of the changes. "The industry is taking concrete steps to significantly improve transfer times, and all other aspects of the customer experience of arranging an annuity.
