 LONDON, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil climbed towards $117 on Friday as concerns over supply disruptions in Nigeria and the North Sea offset a stronger dollar. US crude futures rose 76 cents to $116.82 a barrel by 1030 GMT, after falling $2.24 the previous session. London Brent crude traded $1.06 higher at $115.40 a barrel.

Before news of the Nigerian attack, oil had traded more than a dollar lower on the strength of the dollar.

Gold, copper and other dollar-denominated commodities also came under pressure on the stronger currency. "The rest of the commodity spectrum is suffering from the dollar rebound and the risk remains for some macro de-investments in commodities," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. The fall in the value of the dollar against other major currencies had helped drive buying across commodities as investors view dollar assets as relatively cheap. Prices have weakened about 4 percent from Tuesday's record-high of $119.90 a barrel as the US dollar rebounded from record lo
