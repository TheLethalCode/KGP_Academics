<TITLE> Croat PM vows to make public servants efficient </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia is committed to transforming its bloated and slow public administration ahead of accession to the European Union, for the benefit of Croats and foreign investors, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Friday. Administrative reform is a key requirement for membership of the EU, which Zagreb hopes to join by 2011. "We have to make our administration more efficient, not for the sake of EU accession but for our own benefit," Sanader told a local conference, promising to cut costs and professionalise Croatia's bureaucracy to discourage graft. "We will provide our citizens with an easier life, create a better business environment and improve the competitiveness of our economy in the EU," he added. Foreign and local investors have often complained of slow procedures and too much red tape and corruption, which Sanader said his government would make a strong effort to change. "We want to make investors confident when coming to Croatia and remove the feeling of our citizens that they are helpless when having to deal with public servants," Sanader said. Sanader, who won a second term in office last November, said civil servants needed educating in how to deal with the public and should be rewarded in line with their achievements at work. The public administration should be decentralised with unnecessary jobs outsourced. "We have already engaged in that process and it is a crucial part of our strategy during the (government's) four-year mandate," he added. Other hurdles on Croatia's path to EU membership include the reform of its slow and inefficient judicial system, overhaul of loss-making industries -- notably shipbuilding -- and the reduction of high state subsidies. Many local and foreign analysts believe the administrative and judicial reforms will be the toughest to achieve. "The government's plan is ambitious which is good. But the task is very demanding within the set time-framework, and no one at the moment can be confident that everything will go on as scheduled," a Zagreb-based EU diplomat told Reuters
