 PARIS, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A year after his comprehensive election victory, Nicolas Sarkozy will try to revive his stumbling presidency in a prime time television appearance scheduled for later on Thursday. A potent mix of economic difficulties and personal problems has combined to push Sarkozy's poll ratings to record lows for a president just 12 months into his term. One survey published in Paris Match magazine on Thursday showed 72 percent of people were unhappy with his performance, 65 percent thought he hadn't kept campaign promises and just 17 percent thought he was better than his predecessors. Looking to reclaim the initiative, Sarkozy has organised a 90-minute interview to be shown on France's two leading television stations from 8.15 p.m. (1815 GMT). "Sarkozy has to reassure the French tonight and restore his credibility that has been eroded these past months," said Stephane Zumsteeg, a director of IPSOS pollsters. "He needs to show that his willingness to reform remains intact. The French want change, they want reform," he told France Info radio on Thursday. Leaving nothing to chance, Sarkozy's team have brought in special advisers to design the set for the interview in the presidential palace, doing away with the usual gilded chairs and replacing them with modernist furniture and subtle lighting. But image makeovers alone won't solve his problems. ECONOMIC PRESSURES Perhaps Sarkozy's biggest headache is the expectation that he can do something to improve the economic outlook and increase household spending power at a time of global financial turmoil and rising inflation. Sarkozy promised to be "the president of purchasing power" during the 2007 election campaign, but the hoped-for economic boost failed to arrive and in January the president said he could do nothing to help because state coffers were "empty". The comment cost him dearly, undermining confidence in his ability to deliver on a raft of electoral promises. The president must also try to boost his credentials as a serious head of state after widespread accusations that he was leading a celebrity lifestyle out of keeping with his office. The president divorced last October and just weeks later married pop star Carla Bruni, raising eyebrows in France, particularly amongst traditionally minded elderly voters. He has since toned down the perceived excesses, but this has failed to boost his ratings. Discord among ministers coupled with a series of missteps over issues ranging from family benefits to ties with China have piled on the pressure. Presidential aides say Sarkozy will seek to redress the balance on Thursday and stress the numerous reforms that his government has already enacted, such as a shake up of universities, arguing that they need time to take effect. "No other government has undertaken so many reforms in such a short space of time," said Patrick Devedjian, head of Sarkozy's ruling UMP party. "But we only talk about things that go badly in this country, not the things that go well," he told reporters, pointing to unemployment which has fallen to 7.5 percent -- its lowest level since 1983
