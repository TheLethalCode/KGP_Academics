 BARCELONA, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona let Manchester United off the hook after failing to turn their domination into goals during their 0-0 draw at the Nou Camp but the Catalans are confident of finding the net in next week's return. "It was a shame we didn't get the goal we deserved," striker Samuel Eto'o told reporters. "It isn't enough to threaten, we have to score. But if we play like we did today when we go there next Tuesday then we can go through.

We have to continue like that as that's the way we like playing. "United were a little bit conservative but that was because we pressured them so much up front and the fact that they didn't score works in our favour." Barca are hoping United will be more adventurous at Old Trafford and leave gaps at the back as they try and push forward for a goal. However, the last time they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by an English side in the first leg of the semi-finals of a European competition, they failed to go through. United's rivals Liverpool held the Catalans at the Nou Camp in a UEFA Cup semi-final in 2001 and then beat them 1-0 at Anfield in the second le
