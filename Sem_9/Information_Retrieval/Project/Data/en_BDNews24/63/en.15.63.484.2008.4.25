<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)--China wants to help Bangladesh build its nuclear capability to produce power. Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi during a bilateral meeting with his Bangladesh counterpart Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury assured Bangladesh of providing support for the construction of the Rooppur nuclear project in Pabna. "They (China) want to get involved in larger projects, Rooppur nuclear power plant for instance. He (Jiechi) has said that Bangladesh-China peaceful nuclear power cooperation can be built on the China-Pakistan model," Iftekhar told reporters Friday after seeing off Jiechi at Zia International Airport. "China has shown keen interest even in a bigger role in the development of Bangladesh," he said. The two leaders had bilateral talks Thursday at state guesthouse Padma. Jiechi came to Dhaka Thursday on a two-day visit as part of his regional tour. The Chinese foreign minister also met chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and invited him to visit China by December this year. China is the second country to offer assistance to construct the Rooppur nuclear power plant. In September last year, Russia offered technical assistance to build the nuclear power plant when Iftekhar met Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. The interim government in Bangladesh decided to build the nuclear power project, the fate of which has been hanging in the balance since the1960s, to meet the growing power demand. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in June last year identified Bangladesh as one of the 8 developing countries as nuclear potential. But the government is yet to decide on constructing the Rooppur power plant. bdn
