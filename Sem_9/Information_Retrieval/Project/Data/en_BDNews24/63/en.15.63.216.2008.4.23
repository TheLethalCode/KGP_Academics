 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Mohammad Ershad said Wednesday national elections should be held amid the state of emergency. "If the elections are not held amid the state of emergency, detained politicians will come out of jail and the polls will turn into a money game," Ershad told reporters ahead of a JP presidium meeting at the chairman's Banani office. The former president said his party would take part in the elections even if the two major parties decided not to. "As we believe in democracy, we will participate in the polls even if Awami League and BNP do not." Replying to reporters' questions he said they were discussing the matter of forming a new alliance for elections. Ershad said he hoped local government elections would be held this year after the completion of voter listing, and the national elections at the beginning of 2009.
