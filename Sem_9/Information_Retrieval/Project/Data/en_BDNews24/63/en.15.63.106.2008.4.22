<TITLE> Japan man sentenced death after youth crime debate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japanese man was sentenced to death by a regional court on Tuesday for killing a woman and her baby daughter when he was 18, a ruling that follows intense public debate in Japan over how severely young offenders should be punished. The 1999 case in which the youth strangled and raped the woman and killed her 11-month-old baby prompted an outpouring of public emotion after the woman's husband appeared repeatedly in the media calling for the youth to be executed regardless of his age. Convicted criminals can be executed by hanging if they are 18 or above at the time of the crime, but death penalties for young offenders are rare. In Japan, anyone under the age of 20 is deemed a minor and the defendant in this case cannot be named because the youth was 18 years and one month old when he committed the murders. "This is not something to be happy about. I solemnly accept the court's decision," the widower, Hiroshi Motomura, told a news conference after the verdict, having sat in the court room holding a picture of his wife and daughter. "There has been retribution, so the family has been compensated to some degree, but the results are the deaths of my wife, daughter and the defendant, and that's not positive for society." Media said the defendant listened to the sentencing quietly and bowed to the judge, prosecutors, lawyers and the victims' family before leaving the court room. His large group of lawyers has appealed, Kyodo news agency said. "It's a very unfortunate ruling. We built a detailed case based on forensic medicine, but most of it was not recognised," one of the defendant's lawyers told a news conference. The defendant had initially admitted to the murders but during a retrial denied he had any intent to kill, according to Kyodo. RISING VIOLENCE The start of the court session was televised live by most broadcasters, and media said more than 3,800 people had vied in the morning for the 26 public viewing seats. The verdict, which comes after the Supreme Court's order for a retrial following a high court ruling of life imprisonment for the defendant, sheds light on the growing trend towards stiffer penalties for young criminals. Japan enacted a law last year under which offenders as young as 11 can be sent to juvenile detention centres. The ruling also highlights the growing number of death sentences in Japan, underlined by a public perception that violence is rising and an increasingly vocal victims' rights movement -- one that Motomura has played an active role in. Opinion polls show most Japanese support capital punishment, although human rights groups such as Amnesty International condemn the practice. "If the death penalty is to be handed down, there needs to be an explanation that there could have been no other punishment, but there wasn't one," said Makoto Teranaka, secretary-general of Amnesty International Japan. Japan executed four convicted murderers earlier in the month, only two months after the last round of hangings, but in line with the current justice minister's policy of cutting the number of death row inmat
