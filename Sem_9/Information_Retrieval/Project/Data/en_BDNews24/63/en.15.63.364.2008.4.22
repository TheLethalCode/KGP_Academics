 NAZRAN, Russia, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police have detained two of the main organisers of an anti-government protest in the southern Russian region of Ingushetia, local interior ministry sources said on Friday. Mainly Muslim Ingushetia borders Chechnya, the centre of two wars between rebels and Russian soldiers since 1994. Unrest has soared in Ingushetia over the last 12 months and barely a day passes without a bomb attack, kidnapping or murder. Police detained Maksharip Aushev and Magomed Evloev on Thursday and drove them to a detention centre in Nalchik in the neighbouring republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, said the source who declined to be identified. Evloev is one of the main opposition leaders in Ingushetia. He has the same first name and family name as the founder of the ingushetiya.ru Web site, which is the main source of opposition news from the republic. On Jan. 26 around 30 protesters defied a ban to march through Ingushetia's main town, Nazran, to complain about the worsening security conditions. They threw petrol bombs at police and torched the office of a pro-government newspaper. Opposition leader Evloev had also organised a petition against a Dec. 2 parliamentary election which official results said around 99 percent of voters had participated in and that nearly all of them had chosen Russian President Vladimir Putin's party. About 90,000 people had signed the petition out of a population of about 450,00
