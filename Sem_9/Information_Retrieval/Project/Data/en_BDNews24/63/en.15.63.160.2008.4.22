 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)Government officials are not complying with a government order to conserve power, especially when they are not in their offices, an official vigilance team found. Cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder has asked senior government employees to stop wasteful practices in order to save electricity, as the country is grinding under power shortages amid the seasonal heat wave. The vigilance team, constituted on Mar 13 last year, on a recent visit to the Bangladesh Secretariat found that lights, fans and air conditioners were unnecessarily turned on in the rooms of many senior officials. The finding prompted the cabinet secretary to remind senior staffers of the previous order. In a letter to the officials of various ministries and divisions, the cabinet secretary said: "Recently a vigilance team found that lights, fans and air conditioners were on although the officials were not in the office at the Secretariat. This goes against the government order, and it's not acceptable." "It clearly indicates that the order that has come from the highest authority to save electricity is not being followed." There country suffers a current daily shortfall of well over 1,000 megawatts. Nationwide production of electricity amounted to 3,500 megawatts Monday, against the demand for 4,600 megawatts. Commercial activities, public and private life are being hugely hampered because of on-and-off power supplies. After taking over in 2007, the interim administration has taken various measures to conserve power, ordering shopping mall owners to curtail their business hours at night and asking officials to cut unnecessary use of electricity in government offices across the country. bdnews24.c
