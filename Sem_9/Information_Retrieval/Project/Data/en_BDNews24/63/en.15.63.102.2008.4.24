<TITLE> British Somalia draft eyes increased UN presence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 United Nations, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain has circulated a draft resolution on Somalia to members of the Security Council that would open the door to a stronger UN presence and a possible deployment of UN peacekeepers. Somalia's transitional government has been urging the council to send UN peacekeepers to help stabilize the lawless Horn of Africa country. While the 15 Security Council members agree the situation is dire, most have been reluctant to send UN peacekeepers to Somalia, where warlords, Islamist insurgents and Ethiopian-backed Somali government forces are battling. The draft text, obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, asks the Security Council to "welcome" a recent report by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on preparations for a UN force to replace African Union peacekeepers, known as AMISOM. It also calls for Ban's office "to continue its planning for deployment of a peacekeeping operation, taking account of conditions on the ground, and considering additional options for the size, configuration, responsibility and proposed area of operation on the ground." In February the Security Council extended for six months U.N. endorsement of the AU peacekeeping mission. It consists of two Ugandan battalions, totaling 1,600 troops, and an advance party of 192 Burundians. Talk of UN intervention is still colored by memories of a battle in 1993 in which 18 US troops and hundreds of Somali militiamen died. The incident inspired a Hollywood movie, "Black Hawk Down" and marked the beginning of the end for a US-UN peacekeeping force. The British draft says the council is also concerned about human rights in Somalia and the "worsening humanitarian situation" and says the country "continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region." It urges UN member states to boost their support for AMISOM with money, personnel, equipment and services. Western diplomats on the council said the British would revise the text based on comments from other council members and hope to put it to a vote over the next week. SANCTIONS, PIRACY The British text also threatens to impose sanctions "against those who seek to prevent or block a peaceful political process, or those who threaten the (peacekeepers) ... by force, or take action that undermines the stability in Somalia or the region." It calls for a list of "individuals or entities" that would be targeted by sanctions to be given to the council within 60 days from the adoption of the resolution. The draft asks the council to back Ban's recommendation that the U.N. Somalia operations be moved from Nairobi to Mogadishu, a measure diplomats said would enable the United Nations to strengthen its presence on the ground in Somalia. France and the United States are drafting a companion resolution that will deal exclusively with the issue of piracy off the coast of Somalia and elsewhere. The second resolution would authorize countries to fight piracy more effectively. A surge in maritime hijackings for ransom off Somalia have made it one of the world's most dangerous shipping zones. The British draft contains several paragraphs that urge UN member states and regional organizations like the AU to fight piracy "to protect shipping involved with the ... delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia.
