<TITLE> UK court clears watchdog to probe bank charges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's consumer affairs watchdog won a legal victory on Thursday allowing it to press ahead with an investigation into bank charges. However, the High Court ruling by Mr Justice Andrew Smith stopped short of saying whether charges applied to unauthorised account overdrafts were unfair or not. Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) launched an investigation into the fees in March 2007 after a consumer backlash. But several of Britain's top banks disputed whether the charges, typically between 24 pounds and 39 pounds ($48-$77) for each unauthorised overdraft, were subject to oversight by the OFT, triggering the legal dispute. Britain's biggest banks, under fire from customers and consumer groups, paid out more than 400 million pounds ($794 million) in refunds in the first half of 2007, but say their charges are fair and clear. Analysts and campaigners have estimated that banks receive over 1 billion pounds in charges a year. Mr Justice Andrew Smith backed the OFT, which argues that the 1999 Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations can be applied to overdraft charges imposed by the banks and therefore the banks can be sued. But he added that this did not necessarily mean the terms imposed by the banks were unfair. "I reject the banks' contention that the Relevant Terms (the bank terms under challenge by the OFT) are exempt from assessment as to fairness under the 1999 Regulations," he said. But he continued: "This does not mean that the Relevant Terms are necessarily to be regarded as unfair or that they are not binding on consumers under the Regulations." "Those are not questions for me to decide in this judgment.
