 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)Diarrhoea is the latest cause of concern for Dhaka residents and others, already affected by summer heat and power cuts. According to the latest count, 519 diarrhoea patients are taking treatment at the ICDDR,B, with 392 admitted on Wednesday. The Directorate General of Health Services says 2,089 people have been affected by diarrhoea across the country. Two people died from diarrhoea this week. "On average, 480 to 520 diarrhoea patients are getting admitted every day. Of the total, 50 percent are under 5 years of age," Dr Azharul Islam, chief of the short-stay unit of the ICDDR,B, told bdnews24.com. "The situation may aggravate if the heat wave and humidity continue," he said. A mild to moderate heat wave has been prevailing in much of the country over the last few days. It is likely to continue, said the Meteorological Department Wednesday. The consumption of power has increased forcing the electricity authorities to resort to frequent load-shedding. There are reports of up to 10 power outages a day in different parts of the country. According to the Power Development Board, Tuesday's demand for power was 4650 megawatts against the production of 3794 megawatts. Load-shedding Tuesday was 742 megawatts and approximately 733 megawatts Wednesday, according to the PDB control room. The Met office said that slight to mild heat waves were going on in the regions of Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi and Chittagong. "Such a heat wave generally starts in May, the warmest month in Bangladesh. The present temperature is higher than the normal trend," Sujit Kumar Sharma, the chief weather officer of the Met office, told bdnews24.com. The country's highest temperature for Wednesday, 40.6 degrees Celsius, was recorded in Ishwardi. Dhaka's highest temperature was 36.1 degrees Celsius for the day. The temperatures in Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet were 38, 37.2, 36 and 36.1 degrees Celsius respectively. bdn
