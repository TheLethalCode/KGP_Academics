 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Better Business Forum has asked the central bank to continue pressure on banks to reduce interest rates to boost investment. The BBBF made the call to the central bank in its 114 recommendations to find ways to bring dynamism to the sagging economy. Wednesday's meeting of the BBBF with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed also asked the central bank to continue "moral pressure" on the commercial banks to slash interest rates to encourage investors. "The central bank has taken an initiative to cut the interest rates to as much as possible to speed up industrialisation," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told bdnews24.com. "Bangladesh Bank had a series of meetings with the owners and executives of commercial banks and urged them to reduce the interest rates for the sake of investment," he said. The adviser said the banks had assured the central bank of cutting the rates in three months. But they did not keep their promise. The BBBF in its recommendation on interest rate cuts said the central bank should continue to mount "moral pressure" on the banks to bring the interest rate spread to less than 5 percent. The central bank should publish monthly reports on slashing interest rates by different commercial banks, the BBBF recommended. The BBBF is also in favour of setting a ceiling of interest rates for productive industrial units. Besides, the BBBF has suggested that the central bank ask commercial banks to reduce interest rates for importing essential consumer items such as milk powder. The forum observed that the commercial banks were collecting excessive charges for opening LC and urged the central bank to use its good office for reducing the charges. The BBBF also said the central bank should keep vigil and mount pressure on foreign banks to reduce interest rates. The government in December last year formed the BBBF, headed by the chief adviser, to bring dynamism to business activities. The BBBF made 114 recommendations, piled by its five working groups. bdnews24.c
