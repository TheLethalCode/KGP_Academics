 COLOMBO, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan planes bombed rebel positions on Thursday, a day after dozens of Tamil Tiger fighters and government troops were killed in one of the bloodiest battles in 25 years of civil war. The army said it killed over 100 rebels in fighting around the northern Jaffna Peninsula on Wednesday, but also admitted 43 government troops were killed and 33 missing in action. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels said they killed more than 100 soldiers and lost 16 of their own fighters in the 10-hour battle. Fighting between government forces and the Tigers has intensified since the government formally pulled out of a six-year-old ceasefire pact in January. The military said Wednesday's battle was initiated by the rebels in a bid to recapture lost territory in the Jaffna Peninsula. The rebels insisted the military had tried to take their positions. "The airforce fighter jets attacked a LTTE 'Black Tiger' training base," said Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, referring to Thursday's raids against the feared rebel suicide bomber squad. CONFLICTING CASUALTY FIGURES Nanayakkara said government casualties from Wednesday's fighting in Muhamalai were 43 dead, 126 injured and 33 missing in action. Tamil Tiger rebel military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan said in a statement that they had recovered the bodies of 30 soldiers while more than 100 solders were killed and over 500 injured. He said 16 rebels died in the fighting. Both sides frequently underplay their losses and exaggerate their victories. Independent verification of their claims is usually impossible to obtain until weeks after the event. After driving the rebels from the east, the armed forces are focusing on Tiger-held areas in north, intensifying fighting in the civil war that has killed an estimated 70,000 people since 1983. Thousands have been killed in recent months. The rebels have hit back with bombings in Colombo and elsewhere in the relatively peaceful south of the island when they have come under military pressure in the past. Analysts say the military has the upper hand in the latest phase of the war, given superior air power, strength of numbers and swathes of terrain captured in the island's east. But they see no clear final winner and say the rebels still retain the capability to strike back, despite high security and military gains
