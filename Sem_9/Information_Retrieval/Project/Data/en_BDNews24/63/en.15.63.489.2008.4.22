<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission Tuesday invited BNP factional leader Hafizuddin Ahmed to dialogue for April 27, in a move that the rival faction of the divided party said was a conspiracy. Following the receipt of a letter from the EC, Hafizuddin, BNP's acting secretary general, expressed hope that he would go to the dialogue with a united BNP, including Khandaker Delwar Hossain. In his instant reaction to reporters at his Banani home, Hafizuddin said: "I have got the Election Commission's letter. I will decide on the next strategy after meeting acting chairman M Saifur Rahman." "I will also speak to Khandaker Delwar Hossain as well. We hope to go to the dialogue together." A special messenger for the EC carried the letter to his Banani home at 7.30pm Tuesday. "Preparation for the dialogue will be taken after discussion with senior leaders," he said. On the other front, BNP's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said the EC's invitation to the party's reformist leaders to dialogue was a conspiracy. "It's part of a blueprint to isolate the BNP from elections," Rizvi, loyal to a faction led by Delwar, told bdnews24.com in his instant reaction to the invitation. Rizvi has claimed that Delwar is the legitimate secretary general of the BNP. "Without him, a different leadership doesn't represent the party," he said. bdnews24.com
