 MOSCOW, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday that a Georgian unmanned reconnaissance flight over the Georgian rebel region of Abkhazia had violated United Nations ceasefire agreements. Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the drone had been shot down by separatist forces in Abkhazia -- not a Russian jet as alleged by Tbilisi. "This flight by the reconnaissance plane ... is a violation of both the Moscow ceasefire and force separation agreement of May 14, 1994, and a corresponding resolution of the United Nations Security Council regarding the mandate of the UN observation mission in Georgia," the ministry said. The Foreign Ministry said the drone flight took place on Sunday morning but the Georgian Interior Ministry had only informed the United Nations mission about it on Sunday evening. "Therefore the flight was an unsanctioned military action," the ministry said. Georgia's allegation on Monday that a Russian jet shot down its drone aggravated tensions between the neighbours which are already at odds over Tbilisi's ambitions to join NATO and Moscow's support for Georgian separatist regions. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili accused Russia of an "act of international aggression" but Russian President Vladimir Putin said Georgia was deliberately fanning tensions in the region by flying reconnaissance flights.
