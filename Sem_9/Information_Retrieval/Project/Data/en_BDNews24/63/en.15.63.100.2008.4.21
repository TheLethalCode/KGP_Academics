<TITLE> BoE mortgage swap plan is no 'silver bullet' </TITLE>

 Matt Falloon LONDON, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of England's mortgage rescue plan will help banks to start lending to each other again by ensuring funds are there as needed, but it is unlikely to spare Britain from the jaws of the credit crunch. The government, much in need of a boost as voters lose faith in Prime Minister Gordon Brown's ability to steer the economy safely, claimed the 50 billion pound-scheme will end the credit squeeze threatening to push Britain into a prolonged slowdown. Analysts were more cautious on Monday, saying that while the unprecedented plan may gradually deflate the rates at which banks lend money to each other -- bellwethers for lending across the economy -- it addressed just one bit of a complex problem. And we may never see a return of the sort of super-cheap credit that flooded the economy's housing markets and retailers early last year as banks and regulators redraw the parameters for once buoyant mortgage securities and their withering array of derivatives. "It is unlikely that the scheme will be a silver bullet that totally resolves the financial crisis and quickly returns mortgage lending spreads and credit availability to the easy conditions of early 2007," said Michael Saunders, an economist at Citigroup. "It is unlikely any such single silver bullet exists, or would be desirable. The strains in money markets are really just one aspect of the credit crunch, rather than the sole cause." BoE Governor Mervyn King told reporters on Monday that the plan was not meant to be a bail-out to allow banks to return to the elevated levels of mortgage lending that helped trigger the credit crisis. While the plan will make money continuously available over 6 months and for a longer period of time, the terms are just as strict as the central bank's previous operations to inject cash into the system. "If you need it, it is here," King said on Monday. "But there is a price to pay for it. This is not a gift." NO PAIN, NO GAIN Banks will have to take a financial hit on every asset they swap for government paper and must pay a fee on top of that -- linked to the spread between the sterling interbank lending rate and the costs of three-month government debt. "There should be little doubt: the Bank of England's new liquidity facility is a radical measure that could be a substantial help in reducing banks' liquidity funding risk," said Michael Hume, an economist at Lehman Brothers. "But we do not see it as likely to do anything other than smooth current tensions in the mortgage markets." The provision of extra liquidity should free up banks' balance sheets and allow them to lend more freely to each other and consumers. Posting collateral for cash advances is typically how banks raise short-term funds but doubts about the value and pricing of even top-rated mortgage securities renders them useless for collateral purposes. What the Bank of England action does is to temporarily swap banks' frozen mortgage securities for zero-risk government debt that will easily act as surety for cash. It buys banks time. By tying the fee for raising these gilt-edged securities from the central bank to the cost of raising cash on interbank markets, there is an added incentive for banks to keep a lid on the latter when dealing with each other. "With banks now having this extra liquidity and the incentive to keep London Interbank Offered Rates low, this fee could drop sharply," Hume said. The hope is that lower interbank rates could then have a trigger effect and grease the sticky cogs of the money markets and beyond. However, rather than dive on the news, three-month sterling Libor rates continued their modest easing on Monday, fixing at 5.88500 percent from 5.89375 percent. Analysts agree defusing this time bomb will be slow process. That said, lower interbank rates will at least allow some of the Bank of England's recent interest rate cuts to be passed on to the wider economy after three official rate cuts since December had little or no impact on consumer or corporate lending costs. Mortgage rates themselves will probably take far longer to deflate. "It is unlikely to be a panacea to the current predicament that the housing market finds itself in," said Jason Simpson, a bond strategist at ABN Amro. That will be unwelcome news for Brown and the Labour party, well behind in opinion polls ahead of regional elections on May 1 and desperate for Britain's economic fortunes to improve before parliamentary elections must be called by May 2010. BoE Governor King, himself, said the plan's success is still in the balance. "The real test is we suddenly wake up and think that for the last two months no one is concerned about fragility in the banking system," he said on Monday. With the ink on the nationalization of Britain's fifth largest mortgage lender Northern Rock barely dry, those charged with watching over Britain's financial system may have some time to wait for such a long period of calm.
