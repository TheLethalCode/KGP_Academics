 JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's central bank has no immediate plans for an emergency monetary policy committee meeting to discuss interest rates, an MPC member said on Friday, dismissing speculation about a special meeting. "None of us know anything about a meeting," Brian Khan, senior deputy head of research and policy development at the Reserve Bank and a member of the 7-person committee, said. Public broadcaster SABC said on its website, after an interview with Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni, that he might call an emergency meeting, after a further surge in inflation. It reported Mboweni saying economic conditions had changed drastically since the last MPC meeting on April 9-10. The MPC usually meets every two months. Date this week showed South Africa's CPIX inflation rate jumped to 10.1 percent year-on-year in March, its highest level in more than 5 years, raising speculation of another rate increase at the bank's June policy meeting. Producer inflation also climbed unexpectedly. This followed the latest 50 basis point increase in the repo rate to 11.5 percent on April 10, taking total increases since June 2006 to 450 basis points. The rand firmed more than one percent on the rumours, while government bonds pared earlier gains as the market moved to price in another half percentage point increase. Mboweni also complained that administered prices continued to rise above the 3 to 6 percent target and said the central bank would not change its mandate of fighting inflation, SABC said. He also hinted that rates could rise by more than the normal 50 basis points move, it added. The interview would be broadcast after 1700 GMT. The Reserve Bank has held a special meeting outside its regular schedule before, announcing in September 2003 a one percentage point rate cut to help boost the economy
