<TITLE> Bush meets Jordan's king before Palestinian talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush held White House talks with Jordan's King Abdullah on Wednesday as part of a diplomatic flurry this week aimed at shoring up the fragile Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Facing deep skepticism over his chances of forging a Middle East peace deal before he leaves office in January, Bush met Abdullah, an important player in regional diplomacy, on the eve of a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Washington. Abdullah stressed the need for U.S. support for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, telling Bush the talks "should be based on clear grounds and fixed timeframes," the Jordanian Embassy in Washington said in a statement. Negotiations between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have shown little progress since a U.S.-hosted conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in November, where they pledged to try to reach a peace deal by the end of the year. Bush failed to achieve any breakthroughs during a visit to the region in January, and he will travel to Israel again in mid-May to celebrate the Jewish state's 60th anniversary and try to advance peace efforts. Bush, who once disdained a hands-on role in Middle East peacemaking, seems intent on using the waning months of his presidency to shape a foreign policy legacy that encompasses more than the unpopular war in Iraq. Many analysts say that if Israelis and Palestinians are to resolve their decades-old differences, it will require direct, sustained presidential engagement. But Bush has made clear he has no intention of adopting what his administration once derided as predecessor Bill Clinton's "shoot the moon" approach to peacemaking that failed at the end of his presidency. INCREMENTAL STRATEGY Bush's talks with Abdullah -- whose country is one of two Arab states to have signed a peace treaty with Israel -- fit a more incremental strategy of lessening any damage to U.S. prestige in the Arab world should the overall initiative fail. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino dismissed the notion that Bush might cancel his Israel trip unless there is some kind of deal at hand. "The president looks forward to going," she told reporters. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was to meet Abbas on Wednesday to lay the groundwork for his talks with Bush. The Bush administration hopes to bolster Abbas, who essentially just controls the West bank after Hamas' violent takeover of the Gaza Strip in June. Abbas wants U.S. pressure on Israel for a framework agreement that would outline the way sensitive final status issues can be resolved to establish a Palestinian state. "There is a chance and we don't want it to be lost," Nabil Abu Rdainah, a senior Abbas aide, told Reuters. Olmert, also politically weak at home, has made clear he is looking for a vaguer list of "understandings." Negotiations have been bogged down by differences over Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and violence in and around Gaza, where Hamas cross-border rocket fire has drawn an Israeli military response. In talks with Bush, Jordan's Embassy said Abdullah told him Israel should refrain from "measures that would jeopardize negotiations with the Palestinians, and called for an end to all Israeli settlement activities, a lifting of the blockade and restrictions on the movement of Palestinians." Israel insists it is acting for its own security and self-defense, demands that the Palestinians do more to rein in militants and says it it has the right to build in large settlements it intends to keep in any final peace deal. Palestinian officials say if Abbas fails to win a framework deal by year-end, his credibility among his own people would be jeopardized and his Islamist rivals strengthened.
