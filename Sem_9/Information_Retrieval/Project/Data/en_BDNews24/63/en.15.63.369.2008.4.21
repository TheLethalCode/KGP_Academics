 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)Writer Momena Ahmed, the wife of the late chairman of Dhaka University's Applied Physics Department Sultan Ahmed, was knifed to death at her Dhanmondi home Monday, police and witnesses said. The police arrested a youth, named Faruq, on charges of being involved in the killing, and retrieved a blood-stained knife from the elevator of the building. A housemaid claimed that Faruq was held when he was fleeing the scene after slaughtering Momena at her home at about 1.30pm. Security guards held and handed Faruq over to the police. Investigators are chasing the leads to the killing of the 65-year-old woman, who had also worked for Udayan School as a librarian. Quoting Momena's relatives, the police said the killing might have stemmed from her row with a publishing house. Momena wrote a number of books including Hashi-Khushi, School Library Parjalochona: Prekkhit Bangladesh and Bhuture Gappo under the name of Momena Deyasini. Mamota, a seven-year-old domestic help, told reporters that Faruq, who had a good relationship with the family, came to the house at about 12.30pm and ate lunch. After lunch, Faruq was watching TV, and Momena was ready to go out, Mamota said. "Then I went to the kitchen and heard boroma crying for help. I rushed into her room and found Faruq holding her by the hair to kill her," Mamota alleged. "Faruq told me 'I'll kill you too if you get near me'." Mamota then ran out of the apartment and broke the news to neighbours. Lift operator Abdul Alim told bdnews24.com that Mamota and another domestic help of a different flat went downstairs crying for help. Meantime, an unnamed person from a flat in the same building told Alim by intercom that a man had killed Momena and was trying to flee. Faruq used the elevator to the ground floor but Alim and other security guards stopped him at the gate. "I found him covered in blood," Alim said. Momena's relatives said Faruq used to go to the apartment once in a while. Momena had helped him with money, they said. Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that the police would investigate the alleged links of the publisher in the killing. Major Ehsan Ahmed of RAB-2 who rushed to the scene told reporters that Momena had lived with her son Mainul Ahmed and Mamota in the apartment. Her other son Saiful Ahmed lives in Russia. Momen's husband Prof Sultan Ahmed died in 1994. bdnews24.com
