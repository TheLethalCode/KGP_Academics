 BAGHDAD, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Tuesday they had killed five militants overnight in the east Baghdad slum of Sadr City, where fighting has raged for weeks between Shi'ite militiamen and security forces. Lieutenant-Colonel Steven Stover said U.S. soldiers in an M1 Abrams tank and Bradley fighting vehicle had shot and killed three militants late on Monday after a U.S. route clearance vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. In another Monday night incident, a U.S. Apache helicopter fired a missile at gunmen in Sadr City who were carrying rocket-propelled grenade launchers, killing two, Stover said. Hundreds have died in the Baghdad stronghold of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr since Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki launched a crackdown on his Mehdi Army militia last month. Sadr has demanded a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and threatened over the weekend to wage "open war" if Maliki did not call off the campaign against his fighters in Baghdad, the southern oil-hub of Basra and other Shi'ite areas. Since Sadr issued his threat on Saturday, the U.S. military says it has killed around 50 militiamen in Sadr City and other Shi'ite parts of Baghdad.
