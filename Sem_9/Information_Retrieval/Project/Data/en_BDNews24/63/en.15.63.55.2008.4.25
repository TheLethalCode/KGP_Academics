<TITLE> EU`s Barroso says against Beijing Games boycott </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The president of the European Commission repeated on Friday he does not support a boycott of the Beijing Olympics despite some calls in Europe for leaders to avoid the opening ceremony because of Tibet. Jose Manuel Barroso made the comments in Beijing, where he is holding meetings with senior Chinese officials -- meetings whose agenda of trade and sustainable growth has been overshadowed by concerns over anti-government unrest across China's Tibetan areas. "Concerning the Olympics, I have already said in Europe -- and I repeat it in China -- that the Olympics must be a celebration for the youth of the world and that it must be a success," Barroso told a joint news conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. "That is why I am against the boycott," he said. Ties between the EU and China have been strained by calls in China to boycott European goods, following pro-Tibet rallies that dogged the Olympic torch relay through London and Paris. Barroso's comments also reinforce remarks made by EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, who said calls for boycotts of both the Beijing Olympics and European goods only "deepen differences, create massive resentment and make dialogue much harder". But apart from Tibet, the Olympics are also creating other strains in the relationship between China and Europe. On Friday, the European Chamber of Commerce in China said it had expressed concerns to China's Foreign Ministry about difficulties its members are encountering in obtaining and renewing "F" business visas. Companies have found express services for business visa applications suspended, refusal of multiple-entry visas, and Asia-based Europeans seeking to renew visas have been required to return to their home countries to apply. "Suspending the issue of express visas means that business opportunities are being missed," Chamber President Joerg Wuttke said in a statement.
