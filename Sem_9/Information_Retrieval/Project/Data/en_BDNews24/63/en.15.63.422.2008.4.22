 MILAN, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy scrambled to keep ailing flag carrier Alitalia in the air after suitor Air France-KLM withdrew its offer to buy it. Losing at least one million euros a day and faced with running out of money within weeks or a few months, Alitalia risks having its licence to fly revoked by Italy's civil aviation authority. The airline says it needs at least 750 million euros ($1.19 billion) by mid-year.

Corriere della Sera newspaper said Italian banks might come up with a 1 billion euro to 2 billion euro recapitalisation to give the airline a year to find a new partner. Intesa Sanpaolo, a bank which backed a failed bid by smaller airline Air One, has said that it might be interested under the right conditions. One union leader said a government loan was inevitable. "It doesn't mean that it has to be a bridge loan, there can be other kinds of loans," FILT CGIL's Fabrizio Solari told local radio. The head of the pilots' union still held out hope for a deal with Air France-KLM, telling local radio he refused to believe that the airline had called it qui
