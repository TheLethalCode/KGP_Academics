<TITLE> Exports wilt but mighty China barely winces </TITLE>

 BEIJING, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's immunity to the contagion of a global slowdown will be tested in the months ahead. Early signs are that it could escape with barely a cough. Trade is the main transmission belt by which a US recession would weigh on China, but, contrary to popular belief, exports are not the main driver of Chinese growth. Headlines about Chinese firms going under as the world economy slows have alarmed investors. Yet the latest hard evidence from Beijing paints the picture of an economy as resilient as it is roaring. "Export growth should continue to slow, but it should be offset by more domestic activity," said Paul Cavey, Macquarie's chief China economist in Hong Kong. To be sure, slumping sales to the United States are a drag. China's trade surplus narrowed in the first quarter and analysts expect it to shrink further over the rest of the year, potentially shaving about two percentage points off gross domestic product growth. Last year, net exports accounted for more than a quarter of China's 11.9 percent GDP expansion. The home front, though, is stepping into the breach. Shoppers are flocking to malls. Heady capital investment shows little sign of flagging. And, most importantly, authorities just need to relax curbs on bank lending to give the economy a big shot in the arm. "It's going to be very difficult for the government to sustain that tightening," Cavey said. "And loose monetary policy is always going to support real estate prices and construction." Annual gross domestic product growth dipped to 10.6 percent in the first quarter from 11.2 percent in the final quarter of 2007, Beijing reported last week. The deceleration in net exports was precipitous. The first-quarter trade surplus was 11 percent smaller than a year earlier. Fixed-asset investment and retail sales, by contrast, both expanded more than 20 percent from a year earlier. DECOUPLED China, in other words, is looking like a decoupled economy. The decoupling idea came into vogue last year for analysts describing how China, and Asia more broadly, could withstand a recession in the United States. Any country that trades with the United States is bound to feel some pain. The crucial question is whether falling exports have a knock-on effect on the domestic economy. "China's domestic demand has always been insulated from external shocks," Jonathan Anderson, head of emerging markets at UBS, said in a research note. He examined how big export declines affected different Asian countries over the past 15 years. Mammoth China was barely bumped, while small, export-focused economies, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, limped into recession. But the myth of China's export dependence is hard to dispel. Eye-catching trade surpluses are part of the explanation. Washington reckons its trade gap with China soared to a record $256 billion last year, adding fuel to complaints that Beijing holds the yuan down to give exporters an unfair advantage. There is no denying that China is a huge trading power, but exports are just one sector of the continent-sized economy. That scale matters. Net exports, in value-added terms, contribute more than 30 percent of GDP in Singapore and Hong Kong but only about 10 percent in China, Anderson calculated. UNEVEN PAIN Another source of the China export myth is the country's prominent role in global supply chains, assembling goods whose more sophisticated components are made elsewhere. Little of the key production is actually done in China in this kind of processing trade, limiting the contribution to GDP from such exports. Partly because of government policy aimed at pushing China away from low-value manufacturing, this is the export sector that has borne the brunt of weaker external demand. Annual growth in processing-trade exports slowed to 14.8 percent in the first quarter from 19.9 percent in the final quarter of 2007, Ting Lu, an economist at Merrill Lynch, wrote. By contrast, growth of exports primarily made in China actually quickened to 26.4 percent from 22.7 percent. "We believe that the slowdown in headline export growth has less impact on GDP growth than the market expects," Lu said. But life is unquestionably becoming harder for exporters. The yuan's appreciation, rising labour costs and the government's cutting of export subsidies have together squeezed their margins. Export manufacturing costs have risen by 30 percent in the past 12 months and firms have only been able to pass a third of that on to consumers, Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong, estimated. Warnings that thousands of export companies may be forced to close shop and that millions may lose jobs unnerve authorities obsessed by social stability. That could prod Beijing to support exporters, even if it has little to fret about on the GDP front. "I can see that the Chinese government has started to worry. It's not the growth loss, it's the job loss," Chen Xingdong, an economist at BNP Paribas in Beijing, said. "They'll see how policy needs to be adjusted.
