 New Delhi, April 23 (bdnews24.com)Indian classical singer Shanti Sharma died in mysterious circumstances after she fell from the second storey of her home south of Delhi, the family said Wednesday. Sharma was 52. News agency IANS quoted her husband Dinesh Sharma as saying: "Shanti jumped to death from our Malviya Nagar home Tuesday morning." "I am not in a position to say whether she was depressed. I rated her very highly among the singers of her age group. My teenaged son is taking it very badly," he said. One of Sharma's students in Bangladesh, Dithi Hasnat, also confirmed the news of her death to bdnews24.com. Contrary to the reports that she was disturbed after her daughter's death in an accident a few years ago, Shobha Deepak Singh, a close friend and director of the Bharatiya Kala Kendra, said: "Shanti was in a fine frame of mind." "Shanti spoke to her house-helps on Tuesday morning shortly before she died. She was supposed to go for a song recording. She seemed perfectly all right a day before her death when she performed at the India Habitat Centre," Singh said. Senior police officials, when contacted by IANS, said they have not received any report about the death. "Nobody has approached us about any such incident," said a senior police officer. bdnew
