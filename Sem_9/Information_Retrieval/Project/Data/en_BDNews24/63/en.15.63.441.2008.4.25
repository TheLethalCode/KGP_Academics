 SHANGHAI, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan will push for direct flights with China and allow more mainland tourists to visit the island once its president-elect Ma Ying-jeou takes office next month, a senior Taiwan representative said on Thursday. Chiang Pin-kung, chairman-designate of the Straits Exchange Foundation, the quasi-official body that handles negotiations with China, told a group of mainland-based Taiwan businessmen that the plans would be key to revive the island's economy. "I believe they would provide a big boost to our long stagnant private consumption," said Chiang, who is in Shanghai to thank mainland-based Taiwan businessmen for their votes for Ma, who favours closer trade ties with China. This marked the first visit by a senior representative of Taiwan to China's commercial capital since Nationalist Party's Ma was elected as president last month. China has claimed the self-ruled island as its own since defeated Nationalist forces fled there at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It has vowed to bring the island back under its rule, by force if necessary. Direct flights between Taiwan and China are banned, except during holiday seasons, for security reasons, usually forcing layovers in Hong Kong or Macau. Chinese tourists seldom enter Taiwan due to the island's fear of security breaches and overstays. Largely repeating what Ma has pledged to his supporters, Chiang said Taiwan wants to launch regular weekend charter flights to China by July and more regular flights 12 months from then, and it aimed to boost the number of mainland tourists to Taiwan from an initial 3,000 a day to 10,000 in the fourth year. Although Chiang gave no indication whether the plans will definitely be implemented according to Ma's schedule, he said it would be one of Ma's top priorities once he takes office on May 20. Ma has also vowed to push for curbs on investment in China to be removed and allow mainland firms to invest in select industries in Taiwan. Chiang, also a vice chairman of the Nationalist Party, said he had already started assembling a task-force to carry out the plans, which would help prevent Taiwan's economy from being further "marginalised". After visiting Shanghai, Chiang will travel to the eastern province of Jiangsu and southern China's Fujian and Guangdong provinces, where most Taiwan's mainland businesses are based, before returning to Taipei next wee
