<TITLE> North Korea vows to `astonish` with torch relay </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea's secretive leader Kim Jong-il looks forward to the Beijing Olympic torch relay in Pyongyang, where it will be met with grand ceremony and masses of cheering spectators, Chinese media said on Friday. China's staunchly communist neighbour is preparing a rousing traditional welcome for the Olympic torch during the relay there on Monday, the official Xinhua news agency reported. "North Korea has fully prepared an Olympic Games torch relay in Pyongyang that will be high-quality, outstanding, safe and successful," the report cited a North Korean official as saying. "It will astonish the world." At the start of the relay, the flags of North Korea and China will be raised, their anthems will play, and "major leaders of North Korea will attend," the report said. "North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-il hopes that this Olympic Games torch relay can proceed smoothly." The report did not say whether Kim would attend. The impoverished North has a close but prickly relationship with China, respected as a key provider of aid but resented as an over-sized power that long dominated parts of the Korean peninsula. Strictly controlled North Korea has dispatched hundreds of thousands of its citizens to the streets of Pyongyang to welcome selected state guests where the masses cheer on cue and wave bouquets of pink, plastic flowers. Protests that have dogged the torch in previous stops, especially London and Paris, can land participants in political prison for life in North Korea, human rights groups say. The torch will pass along a 20-km (12-miles) route through Pyongyang, the clean but dour capital, ending up at the Kim Il-sung Stadium, named for Kim Jong-il's late father, venerated as the state's founder.
