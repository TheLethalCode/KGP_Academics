 Jessore, April 24 (bdnews24.com)Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed stressed the urgency Thursday of cultivating every available plot of land so the country could become self-reliant in rice. General Moeen was addressing a gathering at Monirampur Monoharpur Technical and Science College after a paddy harvest festival organised by the 55th infantry division at Bhabadaha in Jessore. The army chief had earlier visited the site of the first harvest in many years in the waterlogged Bhabadaha area, which under supervision of the army has seen about 18,000 hectares brought under boro cultivation. The government deployed the army in Oct 2006 to assist a Water Development Board project to reclaim the submerged area for the landless locals. The army began work in Jan 2007. "They have achieved success in a very short time," Moeen said of the successful harvest. During his speech, the army chief mentioned the worldwide threat to food securityciting food riots in the Philippines, and the collapse of Haiti's government following food shortages. "Our neighbouring country has fixed the price of rice at 1000 dollars per tonne. They imposed a ban on export of rice." "To save ourselves from this situation we must become self reliant in rice. I have seen huge areas of land lying fallow. Not a single plot of land can be kept uncultivated," said the army chief. He stressed taking on more projects like Bhabadaha for long-term solutions to the problem of food security. "If the government wants the army will cooperate in this regard." General Moeen assured the people of Bhabadaha with regard to necessary steps for improving infrastructure in the area that is a permanent victim of water logging. Moeen said that the nation was doing relatively well considering it faced six separate crises last year: two floods, cyclone Sidr, global price hikes in food crops, rising oil prices and bird flu. "We have faced all these disasters well," said the army chief. The nation's effort and patience has been rewarded after all this time with good boro, wheat and potato harvests, he added. "Other crops including mustard, soybean and maize have also been good." Moeen urged farmers to use good seed, proper irrigation and particularly emphasised the importance of suitable fertiliser, urging farmers present to use guti fertiliser. Commander of the 55th infantry division and of the Jessore area Maj Gen Md Rafiqul Islam was special guest on the occasion. Jessore deputy commissioner Abul Hossain gave the address of welcome. bdnews2
