 Toufique Imrose Khalidi bdnews24.com Editor-in-Chief Gazipur/Mymensingh/Netrokona, April 22 (bdnews24.com)The harvest of boro crop, helped by Tk 4,000 crore in farm subsidy, raises hope for better days ahead, but farmers are not relieved of anxiety yet. For the first time, diesel subsidyTk 250 crore meant for about 67 lakh farmersis reaching out directly to those who need it most, said agriculture adviser CS Karim Tuesday, as he toured the northeast to see for himself the situation on the ground. Abul Khair Mondal of Birampur in Dinajpur is among those who are all smiles as the harvest is nearing. The 48-year-old farmer made a direct phone call to Karim to say he had received power for irrigation and fertiliser in time to grow crops. "I have never seen such crops in the last 15 years," Khair said. The picture is not the same everywhere though. Farmers Sharif and Siddique of Sreepur in Gazipur alleged that they had not received power most of the time, which was necessary for irrigation. "The availability of timely inputs is very necessary," said Khair, his face aglow with the high prospect for bumper crop. Dr Shahidul Islam, director (field services) of the Department of Agricultural Extension, told bdnews24.com: "It has been satisfactory so far. There're still vulnerabilities. Boro is a long-duration crop." Fear persists. The boro season is a long spell of suspense. Farming continues through the end of May. Terming the present situation sensitive, Dr Islam said: "Now the temperature is high." "The target may not be reached without proper irrigation. The possibility of natural disasters cannot be ruled out either," he said. Dr Islam said, according to a government account, 46.75 lakh hectares of land was brought under boro cultivation this time. The actual amount may be more. "If crop is harvested on 45 lakh hectares of land, farmers can get at least 1.75 crore tonnes of rice." "This time the harvest may cross the target," Dr Islam said. The picture in Gazipur was diametrically opposite of what farmer Abul Khair of Dinajpur painted. People in Sreepur of Gazipur district wore gloomy faces as they did not get timely, adequate power for irrigation. After hearing the farmers speak of their plights, the agriculture adviser who was present there directly made phone calls to Prof M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power. Karim was heard saying: "Please let urban people sacrifice for two more weeks and give the farmers of rural areas adequate electricity." At the time, he told bdnews24.com: "People in towns will have to suffer a little more." The adviser took note of the farmers' plights tied to the power crisis. In the area, many crop fields have developed cracks, while some areas have water. Abul Hashem, 60, of Banglahati village in Sreepur, said: "Irrigation is a problem and many fields are damaged." "Throughout the day, there's no electricity. It comes after 11pm," he said. Mohammad Siddique, another farmer, said he had bought 1.5 kg of seeds for Tk 300. An official with the agriculture department instantly asked him whether he had expected 30 maunds of rice. Siddique said: "I expect 36 maunds." The adviser, Karim, asked him whether he knew about the government's decisions of buying rice paddy at Tk 18 and rice at Tk 28 per kg as part of a procurement plan which was designed to give farmers a 40 percent profit. The government gave Tk 1,200 in subsidy on a Tk 1,500 sack of fertiliser, which sells at Tk 300. Siddique said he had bought a sack at Tk 325. This year, the government has taken special steps to increase boro output throughout the country to avoid a food crisis. Karim asked farmers if they had received government assistance. Asked if he had received any subsidy meant for diesel, Siddique said: "No." Boro has emerged as the only hope after the twin back-to-back floods and Cyclone Sidr. "Our farmers, our heroes have made it," Karim said of the imminent high harvest of the top-yielding variety, speaking to farmers at Shambhuganj Bazar in Mymensingh. The farmers gathered there to receive Tk 545 per acre to buy diesel. "This is not much," the adviser admitted. "This is a symbolic gesture of the government to help you, the heroes." Before heading for Netrokona, Karim said that 15 million farmers had "taken the risks for us150 million". bdnews
