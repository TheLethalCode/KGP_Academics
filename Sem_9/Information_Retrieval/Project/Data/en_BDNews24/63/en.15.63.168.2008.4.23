 Hong Kong, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares made dogged progress on Wednesday, shrugging off the burden of near-$120 a barrel oil and a record high euro to continue a rally that has recovered all the ground lost last month. Equity markets have suffered massive losses as fallout from the subprime crisis added to fear of a U.S. recession. But with many shares trading at bargain prices, investors have been looking for the moment to head back in. "Fears over the credit crisis have receded after U.S. bank results. But the clouds have not cleared, with the dollar weak and oil prices surging," said Harushige Kobayashi, head of research at Maruwa Securities. MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan was up 0.7 percent at 488.97 by 0232 GMT, having climbed back from a low of 418.05 struck on March 18. The dollar has tumbled in recent months and touched a record low of $1.60 to the euro on Tuesday, before recoiling to $159.74 in early Asian trade on Wednesday. "If the euro does not fall back immediately, it could move into a range of around $1.6 to $1.63," said a senior trader for a major Japanese trading house. The dollar held around 103 yen having bounced back from a low in mid-March, showing a strong correlation with Asian equity markets. OILING CHINA'S WHEELS The weak dollar has helped buoy prices for dollar-denominated commodities such as oil. Expectations that the European Central Bank would stay vigilant on inflationary pressures -- possibly meaning an even stronger euro -- helped push U.S. crude oil prices to a record high of $119.90 a barrel on Tuesday. Oil's strong rally in recent weeks has seen prices rise more than five-fold since 2002, as booming demand from emerging markets such as China coincide with long-term supply constraints. China, the world's No.2 consumer, further boosted the price of oil after new government data showed that demand rose 8 percent in March from a year earlier, the quickest rate in 19 months as refiners boosted imports ahead of the Olympic Games in August. "We are seeing no evidence of demand destruction even as prices keep rising," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois. "OPEC is still not willing to pump more oil on to the market and, to add to the situation, there is no significant production increase beyond OPEC," he added. In early Asian trade, oil pulled back to $118.05, still high enough to dent fuel-dependent stocks such as airlines. Korean Air Co, the world's top cargo carrier, was down 0.6 percent; Japan Airlines Corp fell 1.2 percent and Australia's Qantas shed 3.1 percent. The surge in oil prices and continued worries about consumer spending took 0.82 percent off the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid 0.88 percent. But Asian stocks held up, with Japan's Nikkei average adding 0.7 percent, lifted by trading houses such as Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co, which gained from strong oil prices. South Korean shares rose as the weaker won boosted technology exporters such as LG Electronics, the world's No.5 handset maker. Shares in Samsung Securities and Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance Co rebounded after the heads of both firms stood down on Tuesday in the wake of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee's resignation. Gold edged down around $1 to $919.50 an ounce.
