<TITLE> Newspaper calls for transitional Zimbabwe gov`t </TITLE>

 Harare, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Regional countries should mediate negotiations in Zimbabwe for a transitional government of national unity led by President Robert Mugabe to organise new elections that are free, a state newspaper said on Wednesday. The Movement for Democratic Change and Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF are locked in an election stalemate over delayed parliamentary results and a possible presidential runoff that has raised fears of widespread violence. The editorial on The Herald's website said political tensions make it impossible to hold a run-off, which the ruling Movement for Democratic Change rejects. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has said he won the election outright and accused Mugabe of seeking a run-off to rig victory. Tsvangirai has appealed to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and foreign powers to intervene to guarantee a democratic poll result and prevent violence. Mugabe has rejected that idea and accused the MDC of being puppets of former colonial master Britain. The Herald took a softer line, saying a transitional government should seek the help of the SADC and foreign countries to write a new constitution adopted after a national referendum. "It stands to reason that, the transitional government of national unity, negotiated by the twoleading contending parties, under the mediation of SADC, supported by the international community, should be led by the incumbent president," said The Herald. The MDC deprived Mugabe's ZANU-PF party of its majority in parliament in a parallel vote on March 29 but there has also been a delay to a partial recount of votes from that poll. The recount could overturn the MDC victory. The opposition and Western governments say it is merely another ploy by Mugabe to steal back the election.
