 Manila, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines fears the rise of more radical elements within the country's largest Muslim rebel group after Malaysia pulls out peace monitors later this year, Manila's chief negotiator with the group said on Tuesday. Rodolfo Garcia, a retired general, said there could also be a breakdown in the nearly five-year-old ceasefire between government forces and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as the withdrawal of peace monitors would affect negotiations. "There's no guarantee of continued stability on the ground in the south if the Malaysians pack up their bags and go home," Garcia told Reuters in an interview, adding radical groups within the MILF have been itching to resume hostilities. Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim said on Monday that Malaysia's mandate for the International Monitoring Team will not be extended when it expires in September. "The thing is, we have to get cooperation from both sides," the official Bernama news agency quoted him as saying. "But if one party is not making the effort, we will have to end the mission." That comment appeared to be directed at Manila, which has been accused of dragging its feet on reaching a peace deal with the rebels. While he conceded progress in the talks was slow, Garcia defended the Philippine government's cautious efforts in ensuring a peace deal that could be implemented smoothly. "I think it is the government's duty to conduct due diligence on what the two sides would eventually agree because there are so many legal and constitutional issues involved," he said, adding the government had not turned its back on the peace process. "It remains as one of the government's priorities and we're hoping to wrap it up before August this year." Negotiations between the government and the MILF have been going on for more than 10 years, making some rebel commanders doubt the sincerity of the government in ending the conflict. Philippine security officials said some MILF field commanders in Lanao and Maguindanao provinces with suspected links to regional radical group Jemaah Islamiah have been telling comrades to abandon the talks because the government was not sincere. "We knew how difficult it is for the MILF leadership to rein in some field commanders who are getting impatient," Garcia said, adding the longer it takes for the two sides to resolve issues, the greater the pressure from radicals. The monitoring team has been in place in strife-torn areas of Mindanao island since October 2004 and helped slash skirmishes between troops and Muslim rebels from 700 incidents in 2002 to less than a dozen in 2007. The unarmed monitors include about 50 troops from Malaysia, 10 from Brunei, two Libyan diplomats and a Japanese development worker.
