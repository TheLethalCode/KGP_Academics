<TITLE> Terrorism ruling is new blow for UK government </TITLE>

 LONDON, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five men suspected by Britain of "facilitating terrorism" won a High Court battle on Thursday against the freezing of their assets, in the latest blow to the government's security laws. The five, who deny involvement in terrorism, had challenged financial sanctions imposed on them under two laws enacted by the government as "orders in council", a form of legislation which does not require parliament's approval. "I take the view that both the ... orders as they stand are not lawful", High Court judge Andrew Collins said. The ruling means the government may have to present a new bill to parliament to create a legal basis for freezing the British assets of suspected militants, including alleged al Qaeda and Taliban associates blacklisted by the United Nations. Such a bill could be hard to push through, because the stringent sanctions are not subject to review by any court and the government does not have to tell people on what grounds it suspects them of involvement in terrorism. Prime Minister Gordon Brown was forced into a humbling climbdown on Wednesday over taxation of low earners. He also faces a threatened parliamentary revolt over plans to increase from 28 to 42 days the period for which arrested terrorist suspects can be held in custody before police have to charge them or let them go. The five men in Thursday's case, named in court only as A, G, K, M and Q, received identical letters informing them of the financial sanctions against them. 'REASONABLE GROUNDS' "The Treasury has reasonable grounds to suspect that you are, or may be, a person who facilitates the commission of acts of terrorism. In the light of the sensitive nature of the information on which this decision was taken, we are unable to give you further details," the letters stated. Under the sanctions, the men or their spouses require a licence from the Treasury to obtain welfare payments to cover essential items like food, and they have to submit exhaustive accounts showing how the money is spent. Anyone providing them with "funds, economic resources or financial services" is liable to prosecution and jail unless they have a Treasury licence to do so. The sanctions apply to individuals designated as suspected facilitators of terrorism by Britain, the European Union or the United Nations. UN-ordered terrorism sanctions are already being challenged in international courts. In January, an EU legal adviser recommended that the Court of Justice of the 27-nation European Union should cancel U.N.-ordered sanctions against a Saudi businessman and a Swedish-based money transfer business because the measures breached their fundamental rights. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, the continent's top human rights watchdog, said the same month that the UN and EU sanctions regimes were deplorable because they blacklisted people on the basis of "mere suspicion", undermining the credibility of the fight against terrorism. Britain's Labour government has suffered several setbacks to laws it has introduced to address the threat from militant Islamists inspired or directed by al Qaeda. Earlier this month, it lost a court bid to deport two Libyan men and a Jordanian it considers a "significant international terrorist", after their lawyers argued they would face mistrials or torture on being returned
