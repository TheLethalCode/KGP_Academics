 WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The American Bar Association said on Monday it was renewing its call for a nationwide moratorium on executions, based on a three-year study of death penalty systems in eight states that found unfairness and other flaws.

On Sept. 25, the high court agreed to decide a challenge to the three-chemical cocktail used under the lethal injection procedures in Kentucky, procedures similar to those used in other states.

All but one of the 38 US states with the death penalty and the federal government use lethal injection for executions. The only exception is Nebraska, which requires electrocution. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the Kentucky case in January, with a decision likely before the end of June.
