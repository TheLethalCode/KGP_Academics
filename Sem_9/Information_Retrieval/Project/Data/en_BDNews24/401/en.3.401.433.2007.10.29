<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - The government will not wait any longer to hand over Rupali Bank to Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Abdulrahman Al Saud once the month of November is over, a top official said Monday. "We will not wait for the handover of the bank after November whether they take over or not. We should not wait any further," Privatisation Commission chairman Abu Solaiman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com by telephone. The PC chairman also said he was unaware of the arrival of Al Saud's representatives, two of whom, according to reports, arrived in Dhaka Sunday to negotiate a final deal. Shares of Rupali Bank, one of the biggest shares by market capitalisation, grew 4.32 percent to close at Tk 2999.25 following reports of the representatives' arrival. Turnover from Rupali was Tk 75.98 million Monday. Prince Bandar, who won the purchase bid for a 67.26 percent stake in the bank at $330 million in 2006, also offered to buy the remaining 26 percent government stake for $128 million in February. Private investors hold the remaining 6 percent stake. But the handover of Rupali Bank through a sales and purchase agreement between the government and Bandar has been hanging in the balance since last year. "The government will decide what to do with Rupali Bank after November," he said. bd
