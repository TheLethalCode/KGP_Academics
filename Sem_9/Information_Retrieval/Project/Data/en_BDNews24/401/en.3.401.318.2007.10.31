 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  A BUET research fellow Wednesday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging Debapriya Bhattacharya's new job in Geneva. The government has recently appointed Debapriya as Bangladesh's ambassador and permanent representative to WTO and the United Nations Offices in Geneva. Mostafa Minhaz, a PhD research fellow of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, filed the petition. Minhaz's lawyer Mohammad Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan said: "The writ petition is meant to stop an illegal appointment." The same lawyer had earlier served a legal notice on the government seeking cancellation of the appointment of Debapriya, who had worked for nongovernmental think-tank, the Centre for Policy Dialogue, as executive director. The notice asked the government to scrap the appointment by Oct 29, saying the appointment was a violation of public services rules. Bhuiyan served the notice on the chief adviser, the foreign affairs adviser, the foreign secretary and the establishment secretary. Quoting rules on public servants, the notice said a person, who got married or promised to get married to a foreigner, cannot be assigned to any diplomatic position. The notice had threatened further legal action if the appointment was not cancelled. Debapriya is married to Irina Bhattacharya, a Russian. bd
