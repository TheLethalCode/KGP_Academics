 MUMBAI, Mon Oct 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares stormed to their 21st record high in 28 sessions since the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month, surging above 20,000 for the first time on Monday as traders priced in another US rate cut this week. Engineering and construction firm Larsen & Toubro led gains with a 10.3 percent rise, following a 12.2 percent gain on Friday. The company, whose shares have almost tripled this year, is seen as a big beneficiary of India's push to upgrade its ageing and inadequate infrastructure. The market ended up 3.82 percent, or 734.50 points, at 19,977.97, just off a high of 20,024.87 hit in late trade. The index has now risen 27.5 percent since the U.S. rate cut and almost 43 percent -- or almost 6,000 points -- since its weakest close during the subprime crisis in August. "India is no longer an option but a compulsion for an overseas investor, and money will flow like water as we are a very lucrative market," said Amitabh Chakraborty, president for equities at Religare Securities Ltd. "A lot of liquidity is expected to flow into our markets if the Fed cuts interest rate this week, and lower inflation will also help," he said. The record-setting run has been driven by foreign funds, who have bought a net $17 billion of shares this year up to Friday, but the massive inflows have worried policy makers. "I am bullish on India. Ideally India offers a very good opportunity for international investors," said Richard Frank, CEO at Washington-based Darby Overseas Investments Ltd. "There are a number of restrictions that we would like to see reduced. We can bring more capital," he said. Last week, India restricted an investment route used by unregistered foreign investors, saying the move was not to curb inflows but make them more transparent. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in Mumbai on Monday that India needs to accelerate reforms to open up its economy. Hemendra Kothari, chairman of DSP Merrill Lynch, said high oil prices and the appreciation of the rupee were risks. "People have to be careful and they have to see their own risk-taking abilities. To expect continuous growth in the market is foolhardy," he said. India's central bank meets on Tuesday to review monetary policy. None of the 11 analysts polled by Reuters expect it to change short-term rates, and only three expected an increase in banks' reserve requirements. Larsen & Toubro's gains lifted state-run power equipment maker Bharat Heavy Electricals, which rose 7.4 percent up at 2,612.10. It shares have risen 127 percent this year. Shares in Reliance Industries, the biggest stock in the index, rose 5 percent to 2,827.65 rupees as investors bet on its refining and exploration and production businesses. The broader 50-share NSE index rose 3.57 percent to 5,905.90 points, after hitting a record high of 5,922.50 during trade. In the broader market 1,551 gainers lead 1,186 losers in a total volume of 470 million shares. Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-Share index closed 0.37 percent down at 14,396.98 points and Colombo's All-Share index eased 0.21 percent to 2,614.73. STOCKS THAT MOVED: State-run power producer NTPC Ltd rose 2 percent to 233.25 rupees after its September quarter net profit rose 31 percent. Top tractor and utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd eased 0.7 percent to 796.35 rupees after reporting a 26 percent drop in quarterly net profit. MAIN TOP 3 BY VOLUME: Reliance Natural Resources Ltd on 42 million shares. Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd on 35.5 million shar
