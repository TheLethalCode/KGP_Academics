 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- A special court Sunday framed charges against former state minister Salauddin Ahmed in the Tk 1 crore bribery case. Judge Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court-5 framed the charges against Salauddin and GQ Ball Pen owner Kazi Salimul Huq and set Oct 31 for recording testimonies of witnesses. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Shafiqul Islam filed a graft case against the duo with Shahbagh Police Station on May 29. Twenty-six people were made witnesses in the case. Salimul Huq was accused of assisting Salauddin in taking bribe. According to case details, Salauddin, who served the BNP-led coalition government as state minister for communications, took Tk 1 crore bribe from Mir Zahir Hossain, owner of contracting firm Mir Akter Hossain Limited, to help him get a contract. The transaction was made into the bank account of Salimul Huq. Defendants' lawyer Dr Azizur Rahman Chowdhury appealed to court for freedom of his clients saying they were innocent. State lawyer Mosharraf Hossain told the court that they had evidence against the accused. Joint forces arrested Salauddin on February 6 at his Gulshan home. Salimul Huq is on the run. Zahir Hossain was at the centre of attention when a Dhaka court on August 27 sentenced former communications minister Nazmul Huda seven years in jail and wife Sigma Huda to three years in jail for taking Tk 2.4 crore bribe from him. bdnew
