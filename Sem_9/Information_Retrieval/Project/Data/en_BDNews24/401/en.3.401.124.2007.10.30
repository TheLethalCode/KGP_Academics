 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP MP Md Akhteruzzaman Monday claimed that two senior officials of an intelligence agency had asked party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain to leave his post in 24 hours. In a written statement to the media, he said the officials had allegedly asked Delwar to go to the house of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman by 7:30pm Monday and declare Saifur the party's acting chairperson and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan secretary general. But Akhteruzzaman, himself a former military officer, did not specify which intelligence agency the officials belong to. Retired major Akhteruzzaman confirmed that he had sent out the press statement when bdnews24.com contacted him. The former MP, whom the BNP expelled for his outspoken criticism of party leadership, also alleged that the intelligence agents had threatened to kill Delwar unless he complied with the order. The officials went to Delwar's home Sunday, he said. Delwar, last seen in BIRDEM hospital Monday evening, could not be reached immediately for his version of events. "They not only threatened the secretary general but aimed verbal abuse at me. If necessary, they will even kill me for helping Delwar," he said. Akhteruzzaman told bdnews24.com by phone that he was not present when the officials arrived at Delwar's NAM flat on city's Manik Miah Avenue, but that his statement was based on what Delwar said to him. The officials allegedly told Delwar that "Begum Khaleda Zia will not be allowed anymore to do politics on the soil of Bangladesh", the statement said. Akhteruzzaman sought intervention from the army chief and said people expected "rule of law". "Nobody is above the law," he said. "It's not the job of an intelligence agency or officials of such agency to decide who will be the party's secretary general, the president or who will do politics," said Akhteruzzaman, former MP from Kishoreganj-2 constituency. "Everything has a limit. I think government officialsmilitary or civilianshould not stretch the limits of responsibilities, nor should they go out of their way." bdnews24.com contacted information adviser Mainul Hosein for comment. Mainul only said: "I would not comment on it as I did not read the statement." bd
