 NAIROBI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali pirates have captured a South Korean cargo vessel off Mogadishu port in the latest seizure in one of the world's most dangerous waterways, a regional maritime official said on Tuesday. Andrew Mwangura, head of the East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme, said shipping sources in Somalia had confirmed the boat was taken on Monday or early on Tuesday.

Without central government since 1991, Somalia's waters have become among the world's most perilous despite calls for international action to patrol them. Attackers generally use speedboats to surround and board vessels, often justifying their actions as measures against illegal fishing and toxic dumping.

"These people are sending out a message of defiance," he said. "The Security Council was talking about this problem a few weeks ago, but has taken no action."
