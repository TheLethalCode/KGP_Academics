 Stockholm, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scandinavian airline SAS said Monday a decision to stop operating its Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop planes would cost it 300 million to 400 million Swedish crowns ($47 million to $62 million) over the remainder of the year. SAS cancelled more than 60 flights Monday after a third plane from its fleet of Dash 8 Q400s crash-landed over the weekend following two similar incidents in September. "An early estimate of the negative impact on the SAS Group's result is 300-400 million crowns for the remaining part of the year," the airline said in a statement. The airline said it would permanently stop using its fleet of 27 Dash 8 Q400s after Saturday's crash-landing in Copenhagen. No one was seriously injured in any of the three incidents, which all involved problems with landing gear. The airline has already said it would seek compensation totalling about 500 million crowns ($78 million) from Bombardier relating to cancellations after the first two Dash 8 incidents, one in Denmark and one in Lithuania, which led to hundreds of flights being cancelled. A spokesman for the airline, half of which is owned by Sweden, Norway and Denmark, said a total number of flights "in the 50s" from Denmark had been cancelled on Monday, plus nine from Norway. An SAS statement said eight flights from Sweden had been cancelled.
