 NEW DELHI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian approval of a delayed nuclear energy deal with the United States would be seen positively by global business, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday. He also said he felt Indian policy makers understood the need for reform, which would help improve the business and investment climate in Asia's third-largest economy. "I believe it would be perceived positively by the global business community if it goes through," Paulson said of the nuclear deal. Paulson, speaking to journalists accompanying him on his four-day visit to India, would not be drawn on whether business would view it negatively if the deal did not go ahead. Earlier on Tuesday, Paulson said the US valued the fact India was a vibrant democracy and said democratic processes needed to work for the country to come to a conclusion on the nuclear deal. "Let's let the process in India work on the civilian nuclear deal," Paulson told a business conference. Last week, Paulson said growing ties between the United States and India were broader and deeper than any single transaction. Leftist parties have threatened to withdraw support to India's coalition government if the nuclear energy deal went ahead, which could lead to the fall of the Congress-party led government. India has set itself a target of producing 20,000 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power by 2020, but the country's atomic energy department chief said on Tuesday it would fall short of the goal by 6,000 MW if the deal failed. "At some stage we had envisaged international cooperation to reach our target, but now if there is no deal then there would be a shortfall," Anil Kakodkar told reporters in India's financial capital, Mumbai. Supporters of the deal hope that it would give India much-needed uranium to power its reactors and eventually lower dependency on coal, which accounts for nearly 41 percent of its energy needs and has become a focus of global worries over climate change. Critics of the deal say nuclear energy will remain a small part of India's power supply for the next 25 years even if the pact materialises, and coal will remain vital. Nuclear power is expected to go up from the current 2-3 percent of India's energy supply to 6-7 percent by 2031 in the most optimistic scenario with the U.S. deal, they say. Paulson met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday evening. The treasury secretary said they discussed the nuclear deal, as well as the Doha round of world trade talks, climate change and Singh's domestic reform agen
