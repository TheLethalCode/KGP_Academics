 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) hopes to sign an agreement with Australian coach Jamie Siddons sometime Tuesday, said a BCB official. Siddons, widely regarded as the best Australian batsman never to have played Test cricket, Monday arrived in the city to give final touches to his contract to coach Bangladesh after the BCB named him Dav Whatmore's successor Sunday. "Everything is all right and we hope to sign sometime Tuesday," said BCB spokesman Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Boby. Siddons was introduced to BCB officials, including its president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali, supposed to sign the deal on behalf of the board. But the BCB boss left Dhaka on Monday night to attend the ICC meeting in Dubai. BCB member and press secretary to the chief adviser, Syed Fahim Munaim, will be acting BCB president. Munaim is scheduled to go out of Dhaka Tuesday and the deal will be signed when he returns. "He (Siddons) is a high profile coach and I hope the team will go a long way under his guidance," said BCB president Jamali after having talked to Siddons Monday. The BCB is to sign a two-year deal with the Australian, and it becomes effective November 1. Siddons will leave Dhaka on Wednesday and come back in the second week of November to take charge of the Bangladesh team. The 43-year old coach also talked to members of the selection committee and let them know about plans for the Bangladesh team. bdn
