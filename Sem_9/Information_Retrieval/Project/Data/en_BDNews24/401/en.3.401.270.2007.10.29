 DHAKA, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Bangladesh and India have exchanged lists of wanted criminals and suspected insurgent camps at a five-day meeting of their border forces which ended in Dhaka on Monday. Each country frequently accuses the other of sheltering insurgents and criminals. Although the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty, earlier this month India returned three wanted criminals to Bangladesh and a few more are likely to be sent back in the future. Officials said the Dhaka meeting ended with a pledge to improve bilateral relations. "We have requested India to hand over 1,591 wanted Bangladeshi criminals either hiding or detained in India," Major General Shakil Ahmed, Director General of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) border guard, told reporters at the end of the meeting. "We have handed a list of 141 Indian insurgent camps operating in Bangladesh, based on our intelligence reports," said Ashish Kumar Mitra, the chief of India Border Security Force, who led the Indian team at the meeting. He said Bangladesh had been asked to "destroy the camps after necessary investigations". The meeting also discussed other border issues including smuggling, trespassing and human trafficking.
