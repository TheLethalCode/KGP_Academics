<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Tajikistan shattered Bangladesh's hope to play the FIFA World Cup qualifying round, handing them to a massive 5-0 defeat in the second leg match of the pre-qualifying round in Dushanbe Sunday. After the barren first half, Numondzhon Khakimov, who scored the equaliser in a 1-1 Dhaka match, struck a hat-trick in the 47th, 50th and 75th minutes to see off Bangladesh, according to a message received here. After having talked to the team officials by phone, Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu told bdnews24.com that the footballers failed to cope with the chilly weather in Dushanbe and went down to Tajikistan massively. "I was told that the Dushanbe weather was too cold to play as it was initially 16 to 18 degree Celsius, but it suddenly fell to 12 degree during the match and the players got into a big trouble," said Malu. Malu also said that Tajikistan fielded an almost new set against Bangladesh as the hosts brought eight changes to the playing eleven that played in Dhaka on October 8. Malu also said that two key players  winger Jahid Hossain and Maruf Ahmed  sat down throughout the game following their stomach pain. The booters are scheduled to return home on October 30.
