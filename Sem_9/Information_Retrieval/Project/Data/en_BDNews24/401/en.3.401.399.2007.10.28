 Chittagong, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Chittagong seaport top executive Sunday said the country's main port earned Tk 60 crore more in January-September over the same period a year ago because of improved services. M Faruk, chairman of the Chittagong Port Authority, promised a further improvement in next six months removing all container jams from the port, which handles more than 75 percent of overseas trade. "If we can continue to improve, we'll be able to remove the existing container jams in next six months," Faruk told reporters. "The average turnaround time of a ship will also come down." The interim government had earlier claimed that the port's efficiency had been upgraded after the new administration coming to power in mid-January took steps to curb corruption and ensure better services. Business leaders and lending agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank also said they found a significant improvement of services in the port over the past few months. Faruk said the port could compete with other internationally reputed seaports in the region after a few months of their planned changes are done. To achieve the target, the chairman said they were trying to improve the port infrastructure. He said the revenue earnings of the port in January-September were Tk 682 crore, which means a Tk 60 crore rise from the same period of the previous year. The chairman said they were, meanwhile, preparing to appoint private sector operators for the New Mooring Container Terminal. Two conditions have been attached to the tender document so that local firms can team up with foreign firms to get the job, he said. TARIFF INCREASE The chairman, meanwhile, said they would charge more for container handling through gantry cranes, hiring tugboats and drinking water supplied to ships from Oct 31. After the introduction of gantry cranes in Chittagong Port in 2005 this is the first time the tariff has been increased, he said. Still, the new tariff is lower than in India, Faruk said. According to the new decision, the revised tariff for handling a 20-foot loaded container has been fixed at $15, which was $14.5. The rate for handling an empty container of the same length has been reset at $7.5 from $7.3. Tariff for hiring tugboats and prices of drinking water supplied to the ships would also be raised from the day, he said. bdnews24.
