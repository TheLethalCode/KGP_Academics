 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - Women and children affairs adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury Tuesday stressed the need for women to take a bigger role in raising awareness about their rights. Speaking at a two-day Commonwealth Asia Colloquium on gender, culture and law, the advisor said: "There are many laws related to women's rights, but in practical terms they remain on the books." "I want to ensure that these laws are implemented, so that women can get the most out of them," Geeteara said. The adviser said the caretaker government had already taken significant steps to curb crime and violence against women. "To cope with the situation several laws, such as the Suppression of Violence against Women and Children Act 2003, the Acid Control Act 2002 and the Acid Crime Control Act 2002 have been enacted," she said. In addition to these measures, a speedy trial tribunal has been set up to assist in the prosecution of crimes against women, she said. Geeteara added that one-stop services centres had also been established in six divisions to offer legal, psychological, medical and social counselling to women affected by crime. Sultana Kamal, a former adviser and executive director of Ain O Shalish Kendra, also spoke at the roundtable. "Despite constitutional guarantees of equality in all spheres, the laws applying to family life are still based on religious principles." Sultana, however, pointed out that an analysis of the discriminatory laws that exist in the country revealed that it was not only religion that was responsible for discrimination. "There is something beyond that, something we can call paternalism," said Sultana. "For example, citizenship laws in Bangladesh allow a Bangladeshi man to pass on his nationality to children of a foreign wife." "However, a Bangladeshi woman marrying a foreigner cannot do the same," she added. Representatives of women's rights groups from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and the Maldives took part in the discussion. bd
