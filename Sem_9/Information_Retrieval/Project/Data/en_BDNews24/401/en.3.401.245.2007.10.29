 Dhaka, October 29 (bdnews24.com) Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Monday asked judicial magistrates to work in a concerted manner and with integrity to give the Nov 1 plan for judiciary separation a head-start. "The judges must be answerable to people," Amin said, as there are only two days to spare for the much-expected compliance to the constitution. Speaking to an orientation session for the newly appointed judicial magistrates at the Judicial Administrative Training Institute in Dhaka, the chief justice asked them to work extra hours, if necessary, in the beginning. Authorities have already appointed 179 judicial magistrates to go ahead with the plan, and a fuller appointment is expected by next six months. The government faced a noisy phase to implement the separation plan, which triggered a row between the judiciary and the administration cadre. But the initial protest by a section of "administration cadre officials" was tamed after the government took a tough line. The chief justice asked the magistrates to keep patience and said, "All ventures face troubles in the beginning." "Please remember that the nation expects you to deliver honourably and establish laudable standards." Law adviser Mainul Hosein, meanwhile, at the same function criticised the political governments for their failure to separate the judiciary. He said if the separation had come into effect by a political government, it could have been more appropriate. "The separation of judiciary, if taken up by a political government, could have been more appropriately accomplished through consultations with all," he said. He insisted that there was no discord between the judiciary and the administration. "We are constitutionally bound to separate the two vital wings of the state to ensure good governance." bdnews24.com
