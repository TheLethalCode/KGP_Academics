 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Tuesday agreed in principle with the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) led by Hasanul Huq Inu for a ban on politics based on religion. "I in principle agree with your demand. We have to see now how it could be done," Huda told a JSD delegation, which held a dialogue with the Election Commission on electoral reforms, where reporters were present. The party, an ally of the Awami League-led 14-party alliance, also asked the commission to declare war criminals and anti-liberation forces ineligible for polls. JSD's executive committee president Mainuddin Khan Badal referred to some constitutional provisions during the dialogue, saying that they spell out clear guideline against political affairs based on any religion. JSD president Inu placed a set of recommendations to bring changes to the electoral laws. He demanded transparent ballot box, direct election to the reserved seats for women and freeing the commission Secretariat from the Prime Minister's Office. Election commissioners Md Sohul Hossain and M Shakhawat Hossain also attended the meeting. bdnews24.c
