 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Lieutenant colonels (retd) Syed Faruque Rahman and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed Tuesday moved the Supreme Court against their death sentence by the High Court in Bangabandhu murder case. Earlier, major (retd) Bazlul Huda, lancer Mahiuddin and lt col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan filed appeals on Oct 28 and 29 challenging the death sentence handed down to them in the same HC verdict. Independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were assassinated by some disgruntled army men on Aug 15, 1975. The trail court of Dhaka Sessions Judge Golam Rasool sentenced 15 accused persons to death in the murder case. The High Court on April 30, 2001, after hearing appeals, upheld the death sentences for 12 of the convicts and acquitted three. On Sept 23, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court accepted appeals of five death convicts to hear their petitions and ordered them to file regular appeals by Oct 30. bdnews24.co
