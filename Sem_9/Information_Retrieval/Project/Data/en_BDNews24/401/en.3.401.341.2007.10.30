 HARARE, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean companies face dire consequences if they use the foreign currency black market to finance imports, state media reported on Tuesday. In its latest bid to tame the world's highest inflation rate, the government will now require companies to provide proof of their import costs before they set their prices, the official Herald newspaper quoted National Incomes and Pricing Commission Chairman Goodwills Masimirembwa as saying. "Companies and individuals caught violating price management legislation will face the full wrath of the law," he said. Food shortages have worsened in the southern African nation since President Robert Mugabe's government ordered businesses to roll back prices to mid-June levels. The move triggered panic buying and emptied shop shelves. Price controls led to a slowdown in inflation in August but the official figure shot to a record 7,900 percent last month. Although the government has allowed retailers to set prices as much as 20 percent above the wholesale price, the pricing commission has said it would allow firms only to calculate import costs by using the official exchange rate. That rate is 30,000 Zimbabwean dollars to the US dollar. But the local unit trades 30 times weaker on the black market, where most firms source their foreign currency due to shortages on the formal market. "We will demand to see foreign currency invoices converted at the official exchange rate to determine the selling price," Masimirembwa was quoted as saying. "The commission is, therefore, warning that law enforcement agencies will demand documentation on the imported goods. Those found not complying will be dealt with accordingly." Critics say Mugabe's controversial policies, such as seizing white-owned farms to resettle landless blacks with little experience in farming, have brought Zimbabwe to its knees. Although there has been a slight improvement in the supply of basic goods in supermarkets following a gradual relaxation of price controls and the introduction of a special loan facility for manufacturers, the latest crackdown could see many companies cutting back output for fear of heavy losses. Central bank governor Gideon Gono warned against any new price control measures last week and said there should be no repeat of the "anarchy" triggered by the price freeze. Mugabe, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, denies he has mismanaged what was once one of Africa's most promising economies and accuses his Western critics of plotting to oust him as punishment for his nationalist polici
