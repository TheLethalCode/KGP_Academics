<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- A move to strengthen law enforcement among Saarc countries and create a Saarc police force has been delayed by six months to hammer out the fine details of the agreement, said local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal Sunday. "The meeting discussed the formation of a Saarc Police Force similar to the European Police, or EuroPol, although no final decision was taken in this regard," said Iqbal on his return from a Saarc home minister-level meeting in New Delhi. "Member countries have agreed to continue discussing the issue. There is a financial commitment and more discussion is required," Iqbal said. According to the adviser, a final decision on the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Agreement will be taken at an experts committee meeting in April after member countries have submitted their proposals to the Saarc Secretariat. Iqbal said the meeting focused on cross border narcotics smuggling, trafficking in women and children and fighting terrorism. "The meeting unanimously decided to create two new Saarc desks regarding the crucial issues. India has agreed to cooperate in making the desks as effective as possible." "Meetings between police chiefs from Saarc countries will now be held twice a year instead of once. Their next meeting will be held in Islamabad," the adviser said. Replying to a query, Iqbal said no bilateral issues were discussed at the meeting and no progress was made on prisoner exchange with India. The adviser also said he had not discussed the extradition of the Indian national and extremist leader Anup Chetia from Bangladesh. "We agreed to push back Indians who are living illegally in Bangladesh and push Bangladeshis who are living illegally in India the other way," Iqbal said. bdnews24
