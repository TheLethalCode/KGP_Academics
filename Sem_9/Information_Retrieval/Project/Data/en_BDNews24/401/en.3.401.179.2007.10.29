 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) -- Senior BNP leader and former finance minister M Saifur Rahman started a meeting with a number of senior colleagues Monday evening, apparently to reach a conciliation between the two factions of the troubled party. BNP's standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman confirmed the news to bdnews24.com by phone before the meeting started. The leaders gathered at Jalalabad House, Saifur Rahman's home in Gulshan. Other BNP standing committee members Advocate Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmed and M Shamsul Islam were among the first to arrive at Saifur's home. "It's an informal meeting," Mahbubur Rahman said, refusing to give further details. bdnew
