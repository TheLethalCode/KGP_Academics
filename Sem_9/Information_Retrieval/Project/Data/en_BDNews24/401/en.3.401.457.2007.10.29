 JERUSALEM, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told a top European Union diplomat on Monday he was committed to beginning formal statehood negotiations with the Palestinians following a US-sponsored conference this fall. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the EU's commissioner for external relations, said Olmert made clear he would enter final-status talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas despite right-wing opposition within his coalition government. In a telephone interview with Reuters after her meeting with Olmert, Ferrero-Waldner said she favoured holding another conference next year to follow up the one scheduled to be held in Annapolis, Maryland in as little as one month. Israel and the Palestinians failed to reach agreement on the final status issues -- statehood borders and the fate of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees -- in talks that collapsed in 2001 amid a surge in violence. Both sides have voiced concern about another outbreak of fighting should the talks collapse again, with the Palestinians divided between Hamas Islamists controlling the Gaza Strip and Abbas's secular Fatah faction ruling the occupied West Bank. Ferrero-Waldner warned Olmert against imposing "collective punishment" on the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza by reducing the territory's fuel supplies. "This development would certainly only play into the hands of those who are trying to derail the ongoing negotiations between the parties," she said, in the strongest comments so far on the latest Israeli measure. She stopped short of directly accusing Israel of collective punishment, all forms of which are prohibited under international humanitarian law. Olmert disclosed on Monday that he has prostate cancer and would undergo minor surgery in the coming months. It is unclear whether the illness will have an affect on his talks with Abbas. TWO-TRACK PROCESS Western and Israeli officials described a two-track process coming out of Annapolis: the start of formal negotiations over a Palestinian state and a US-monitored push to implement the first phase of the long-stalled "road map" peace plan. The officials said Washington was considering holding a large follow-up meeting in mid-2008, bringing the two tracks together in a way the Palestinians hope will culminate in some sort of agreement on statehood. By holding a follow-up meeting, the United States could offer the Palestinians a semblance of a timeline without setting firm deadlines opposed by Israel, Western diplomats said. The first phase of the road map calls on the Palestinians to crack down on militants and Israel to halt Jewish settlement activity and uproot illegal outposts. Washington will determine if and when both sides have met their obligations. "He (Olmert) very clearly made the point that he is serious about his commitment to launching this process and negotiating" final-status issues after Annapolis, Ferrero-Waldner said. "It is a process we want to launch, and not one conference only." Those negotiations will be based on a joint document to be presented at Annapolis that will address final status issues but not propose specific solutions. Ferrero-Waldner did not say if the EU supported Abbas's call for setting a timeline for talks, but added: "It's certainly important to see this process would not go on for too lon
