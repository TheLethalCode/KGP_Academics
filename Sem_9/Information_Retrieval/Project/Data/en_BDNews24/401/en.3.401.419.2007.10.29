 CANBERRA, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's conservative Prime Minister John Howard was urged to adopt a new election strategy on Monday, with his cabinet split on climate change and his popularity falling in key seats. Howard, in power 11 years, faces a national election on Nov. 24 and opinion polls point to a solid victory for his centre-left Labor rival Kevin Rudd. Senior government advisers have reportedly told Howard to change his election tactics for the final four weeks of the campaign, although analyst John Warhurst said there was not much the government could do at this late stage. "I think they are really feeling the pinch at the moment," Warhurst, professor of politics at the Australian National University, said. "But most of their options I think are gone." "Certainly we are at a stage in the campaign where the government has to get back on the front foot." The government's election problems have been further compounded by a damaging cabinet leak, which said Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull had urged Howard to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change -- a move Howard has rejected. Australia and the United States have refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which sets binding cuts in carbon pollution on developed countries. Howard says any agreement would not work unless China and India were included in curbs on carbon emissions, blamed for global warming. A new Galaxy poll in Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper on Monday also found government support had fallen 8 percent since the last election in four crucial marginal constituencies the government needs to win if it is to retain power. The first two weeks of the campaign have been marked by government attacks on Labor's links to the union movement, and warnings Australia's booming economy could go into recession if Labor wins power. But the government's usual advantage on economic management has been blunted by expectations of a rise in interest rates in November. It would be the sixth hike since the last election in 2004. The Australian newspaper said senior members of Howard's Liberal Party were concerned the prime minister had spent too much time defending his record and not enough time promoting a clear message for the future. Warhurst said the government could focus more on social issues and re-shape its message about its strong economic management, pull back on its attacks on Labor, and give Treasurer Peter Costello a stronger role in the campaign. Howard and Costello appeared at a joint media conference on Monday to announce A$2.1 billion ($1.93 billion) in spending over 10 years to help fund 100 new technical colleges. Rudd visited Queensland's Great Barrier Reef, where he announced A$200 million to help protect the reef from the impact of climate change, and to push his plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol if elect
