<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks slipped for the second-day Monday as investors locked in their profits in most sectors, particularly the major players in banking and power companies. "It's all right. Nothing to be worried about," said Saiful Islam, who deals with stocks at Equity Partners Ltd. Profit taking by institutional investors, especially the banks, started from the opening bell and depressed the market throughout the day. The market recovered some points before the close, but still ended negatively. "It appears that there is resilience in the market. Buyers are there," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance. The DGEN or general index shed 24.49 points or 0.84 percent to end on 2862.46. The DSI or all-share price index fell 13.88 points or 0.56 percent to end 2434.54. The DSE-20 blue chip index finished almost unchanged at 2240.63, down 1.61 points or 0.07 percent. Losers outnumbered gainers 140 to 75, with 12 issues holding steady. Turnover on the bourse also dropped to Tk 2.02 billion from 17,443,879 traded shares. "Some investors will definitely lose in the short term volatility. But the possibility of a major correction is low," Arif said. Islami Bank emerged as the most active share following a rumour that it would convert the face value of its shares to Tk 100 from the existing Tk 1,000. However, the bank said it had not disclosed any price-sensitive information, in response to a query from the Dhaka Stock Exchange. Islami Bank gained 3.39 percent to end on Tk 5778.5. Profit taking drove BRAC Bank, Trust bank and AB Bank to end lower. BRAC Bank dipped 2.28 percent to Tk 1475.50. Trust Bank declined 2.48 percent to Tk 1127.50. AB Bank lost 2.53 percent to end on Tk 2884.50. Rupali Bank, however, advanced on reports that representatives of its possible new owner, Bandar Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud, a Saudi Prince, arrived in Dhaka to negotiate with the government on signing a final deal. Bandar made an offer last year to the government to purchase 94 percent of the shares in the state-run bank for $458 million. Rupali Bank moved up 4.32 percent to Tk 2999.25. All power sector issues ended lower, led by Summit Power. Grameen1 Mutual Fund and AIMS 1st Mutual were among the most active issues among the mutual funds. Beximco Pharma lost, along with most other issues in the pharmaceutical sector. All major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange lost, with 34 scrips gaining, 84 losing and four holding steady. A total of 3,949,445 shares worth Tk 371.20 million were traded on the bourse. bd
