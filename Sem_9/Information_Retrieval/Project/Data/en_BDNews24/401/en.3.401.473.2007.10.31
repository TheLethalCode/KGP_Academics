<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The Sector Commanders Forum, an organisation of the sector commanders of the 1971 Liberation War, Tuesday moved to file cases against war criminals. The forum set up a legal committee to investigate allegations against the war criminals. From a press conference at the Liberation War Museum, the former commanders called upon all to help identify the war criminals. Retired air vice marshal AK Khandker, who was the deputy chief of staff of the liberation forces, came down heavily on Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed for his controversial remarks on the Liberation War and genocide of 1971. "His comments have negated the existence of Bangladesh and its constitution," he said. Khandker described Mojaheed's claim that there are no war criminals in Bangladesh as a plot to destroy the Election Commission's task to prepare a correct voter list. bdn
