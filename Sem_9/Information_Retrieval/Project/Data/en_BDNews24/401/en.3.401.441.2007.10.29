 Narsinghdi, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  A youth died in Narsinghdi police custody Sunday, prompting his family to allege that the death resulted from torture. Police, however, have refuted the allegation and formed a three-member committee to probe the death of Morshed Rana, 27, son of Suruj Miah of Dogoria village under Sadar Upazila. Officer-in-charge of Sadar Police Station Md Shah Alam said Morshed was arrested in connection with the theft of a motorcycle. Sub-inspectors Akbar and Matiar were taking Morshed to the capital in a bid to recover the motorcycle according to the information given by him during interrogation when he (Morshed) fell ill in Demra, the OC said. The two police officers rushed him to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, he claimed. bdnews24.com's medical correspondent reports said when the police officers brought Morshed to the hospital at around 10pm, doctors declared him dead and the body was sent for autopsy. Police officers Akbar and Matiar claimed that Morshed was not tortured, but Morshed's family alleged police torture as the cause of his death. Morshed's brothers Iqbal Hossain and Masud Hossain claimed that police tortured their brother after arrest and that that was how their brother died. They also claimed that there was no case with police against Morshed. The two brothers termed the death "murder" and said that they would file a murder case. They said that Morshed has two baby daughters named Meem and Mitu. Morshed's mother Morjina Khatun told bdnews24.com Narsinghdi correspondent that police had beaten her son to death. She demanded punishment to those responsible. Narsinghdi police superintendent Shahabuddin Khan said a three-member committee headed by district assistant police superintendent Harun-or Rashid had been formed to probe the death. He said the committee had been asked to submit the report at the earliest. bdnews24.com
