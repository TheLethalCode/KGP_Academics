<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka tasted Tuesday first win in one-dayer while Rajshahi and Khulna stretched their winning streak in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League. Dhaka registered a seven-wicket win over Sylhet at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Opener Junaed Imroz Siddique struck the league's second century to power hosts Rajshahi to a massive 116-run win over Barisal at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. A five-for from pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza helped Khulna beat visitors Chittagong by nine runs at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Rajshahi vs Barisal Sent in to bat, Rajshahi piled up 295 for eight in 50 overs, riding on a solid 121-run partnership for the opening wicket between Jahirul Islam and Junaed. Jajedul Islam broke the opening stand when he had Jahirul caught by Tariqul Islam for 55 off 52 balls, laced with five fours and three sixes. Juaned was the sixth man out, but by then Rajshahi reached 226 in 41.1 overs. The left-handed opener smashed 120 off 125 balls clubbing 13 fours and one six. Barisal faced an early setback as they lost opener Shahriar Nafees (0) in the fourth delivery of their chase. They slipped to 13 for two in 4.2 overs as pacer Mohammad Shahazada removed both openers. They eventually folded for 179 in 48 overs but owed the total to lower-order bats Shaheen Islam (30 not out) and Sajedul Islam (40) who put on 56 runs for the ninth wicket. Khulna vs Chittagong Khulna batsmen made a modest 196 all out in 46 overs after skipper Habibul Bashar decided to bat first against Chittagong, who had denied the hosts the previous day by drawing the four-dayer. Tushar Imran made a 70-ball 44 to take the hosts out of the woods after they had lost four wickets for only 69 runs. Lower-order batsman Ziaur Rahman made a quickfire 30 off 32 hitting two sixes and as many fours to give Khulna bowlers some sort of a total to defend. Spinner Sabbir Khan grabbed four wickets for 42 while Kamrul Islam took two for 40. In reply, Chittagong tottered from the start and reeled at 41 for four in 10.1 overs after strike pacers Mashrafee and Syed Rasel took two wickets apiece. Middle-order batsmen Ehsanul Haq (41), Dhiman Ghosh (38) and Faisal Hossain (19) put some valuable runs and just when it appeared Chittagong may overhaul the target Mashrafee struck once again to return with five for 31. Chittagong were skittled out for 187 in 46.4 overs. First-change pacer Ziaur also chipped in with two for 40. Dhaka vs Sylhet Sylhet could do little to justify captain Rajin Saleh's decision to bat first and were bundled out for a moderate 195 with Alok Kapali topscoring with 42 off 57 balls. Rajin (35), Mahmud (28), Kamrul Hossain (28) and Ilias Ahmed (27) also made contribution. Dhaka openers Javed Omar (48) and Al Shahriar Rokon (35) set off the chase to a brisk start putting on 86 runs. Musharraf Hossain Rubel (49 not out) and Mehrab Hossain Junior (34) then took their side to 184 for three in 39.2 overs. Mohammad Ashraful (9) and Musharraf steered their side to 196 for three in 41.2 overs and to their first win in two matches as well. b
