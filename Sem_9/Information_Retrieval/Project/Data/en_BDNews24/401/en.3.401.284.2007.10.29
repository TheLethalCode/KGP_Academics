Carbon markets allow countries and companies to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets by shopping around for the cheapest carbon offests, but some analysts say that wide differences among proposed schemes will prevent market links. The International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) hopes to become an international forum for governments which are carrying out tough measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions that are said to cause global warming. "This cooperation will ensure that the programs are more compatible and are able to work together as the foundation of a global carbon market," ICAP said in a statement on Monday.

The partnership will be signed on Monday by more than 20 founding members, including the President of the European Union Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, Prime-Minister Gordon Brown and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The United States is the world's largest producer of the heat-trapping gases that many scientists link to extreme weather like violent hurricanes and rising sea leve
