<TITLE> European stocks fall on telecoms;Fed meeting eyed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday led by telecom stocks after KPN's third-quarter results disappointed the market, while investors looked ahead to the US central bank's rate-setting meeting. The Dutch telecoms group dropped almost 5 percent and was the top decliner in the European benchmark index after third-quarter earnings per share missed expectations due to a higher tax charge. Telecoms were the weakest sector in Europe, with the DJ STOXX European telecoms index down 0.9 percent with index-heavyweight Vodafone down 1.3 percent and Nokia 1 percent lower. "It's a bit of disenchantment in the sector after it performed well over the past couple of days," said Andreas Heinold, analyst at Germany's LBBW. By 0939 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.2 percent at 1,584.92 points, snapping a three-day winning streak. The European benchmark index has risen 6.3 percent since the beginning of the year. The two-day Federal Reserve meeting, due to start later Tuesday, is widely expected to cut the 4.75 percent Fed funds rate to prevent declining house prices and tighter credit from tipping the U.S. economy into recession. "Everyone is waiting for the Fed and everyone is basically expecting the Fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point. Everything else would be a surprise," said Susanne Lahmann, strategist at Bremer Landesbank. "Too much or too little of a move would probably be poison for equity markets." While the market broadly expects a quarter-point cut, a Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday said a cut is no sure thing and officials are not seriously considering a half-point reduction. The article by Greg Ip, the Journal's Fed watcher who is known for reflecting the views of senior central bankers, said policymakers view this week's decision as a choice between a quarter-point cut to 4.5 percent and not moving at all. HEFTY WRITEDOWNS Amid a slew of corporate earnings, UBS fell 1.1 percent as the Swiss wealth manager reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter loss after hefty writedowns on subprime-related investments, but said it expects to turn in a group profit in the last quarter. French tyre maker Michelin tumbled 4.5 percent after posting lower-than-expected quarterly results, while its competitor Continenal fell 2.7 percent. The German car parts supplier said it would issue 14.65 million new shares to help pay for its takeover of Siemens VDO and just missed forecasts in third-quarter operating profit. A possible delay of the completion of the Altadis takeover weighed on Imperial Tobacco, the world's fourth-largest cigarette group, down 1.2 percent. On the upside, French construction and concessions group Vinci rose 2.7 percent on market talk that French investor Francois Pinault has lifted its stake in the firm to 15 percent. French wines and spirits group Pernod Ricard added 2.8 percent on forecast-beating first-quarter results, benefiting from rising sales in the booming economies of China and India. Linde, the world's largest industrial gases producer, rose 1.7 percent in anticipation of strong results, which are due later in the session, traders said. A press conference is scheduled for 1130 G
