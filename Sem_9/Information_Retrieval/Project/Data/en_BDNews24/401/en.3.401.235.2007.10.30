 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) Dr M Wazed Miah met with his wife Sheikh Hasina in special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises Tuesday morning after a passage of 104 days. Hasina and Wazed spent more than an hour together in the jail, the Awami League president's aide told reporters. With the meeting over, Dr Hasan Mahmud, Hasina's special assistant, told the reporters that Hasina had asked her husband and visiting relatives to convey to the government that she wanted to phone her son and daughter regularly. During their meeting, Wazed was accompanied by Hasina's aunt Razia Sultana, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim's wife Fatema Selim and Sheikh Rehana's sister-in-law Shamima Siddique. Dr Mahmud complained that Hasina was not allowed to see Wazed when he was hospitalised. Wazed thanked the government and the jail authorities for allowing him to see his wife, Mahmud said. "Sheikh Hasina is in good spirits and her health is all right," he said. But she complained, he added, that the satellite TV connection in her room was severed before the Eid and she has since been watching only BTV programmes. Hasina demanded that the cable TV connection in her room be restored, Mahmud said. bdnew
