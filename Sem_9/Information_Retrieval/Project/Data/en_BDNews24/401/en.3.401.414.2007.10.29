 Dhaka, October 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and India Monday said they exchanged lists of suspected criminals or alleged insurgent camps amid a renewed pledge that the two neighbours would improve their border relations. The declaration was made at a joint media briefing in Dhaka as the two sides, led by their chiefs of the border guards, concluded a five-day meeting. The nations share a porous border of about 4,000 kilometres where small skirmishes are common. India usually says smuggling and illegal crossings by Bangladeshis are rampant, while Bangladesh accuses India of killing innocent people along the border. India has long claimed that several insurgent camps operate from inside Bangladesh, which denies the charge. A Bangladeshi rights group recently said more than 90 innocent Bangladeshis had been killed along the border by the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) from January to September this year. Major general Shakil Ahmed, director general of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), said that they handed over a list of 1,591 criminal suspects who have allegedly taken shelter in India. On the other hand, BSF director general Ashish Kumar Mitra said they gave a list of 141 Indian insurgent camps to the Bangladesh side. Mitra said they made the list on the basis of intelligence reports and detained Indian insurgents' confessional statements. In response, the BDR chief said: "As far as we know there is no such camp in Bangladesh. We recently dismantled two abandoned camps in the Hill Tracts, but there was nobody there." "There's no specific proof about such camps." The two sides promised to show restraint on the border. India in particular said its border guards would exercise restraint in opening fire during the daytime. The BDR chief said Indian border guards could arrest somebody if they try to cross the border illegally, instead of opening fire. The BSF chief responded positively and said, "Well, the BDR too has the right to open fire at any Indian trying to enter Bangladesh territory." "I fully agree that offenders should not be killed and should rather be arrested and dealt with through the law." "How can we say that they were not guilty of any offence when they were attempting to cross into our territory at night? About 96 percent of the unfortunate casualties happened at night." Although the two neighbours have no extradition treaty, Mitra said his country would treat Bangladesh's concern to send Bangladeshi suspects hiding in India back positively. The BDR chief said they raised the issue of building a fence along the border as suggested by India, which has said it is important to fight cross-border crime. "To combat cross-border terrorism, we've sought Bangladesh's permission to build a fence at 265 points, stretching over 200-300 kilometres," the BSF chief said. The two sides agreed to hold commander level meetings frequently to improve understanding between the two sides. bdnews24.
