 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Tuesday staked a claim to the post of secretary general and alleged that he and his family had been threatened with death by a "quarter", which he would not name. "A group has asked me to stay away," he said, speaking to reporters from his hospital bed in BIRDEM. "A quarter threatened to kill me and destroy my family. They said, 'You will be killed, your family will be destroyed.' I am a sick person, I feel offended and such situation is shameful for me." "They forcefully wanted me to sign a resignation letter. They said that Khaleda Zia's leadership should be done away with, I would have to leave the post, there would be a new secretary general and I would have to join the standing committee meeting by 7:00 pm Monday." Delwar appealed to the president, chief adviser, advisers' council, chief justice and the army chief for security of his life. His comment came a day after the BNP's policymaking wing appointed former finance minister M Saifur Rahman as acting chief of the troubled party and Hafizudddin Ahmed as its secretary general. Delwar, who had earlier been installed as secretary general by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at the expense of Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, said: "I will press on with the responsibilities given by the chairperson." He alleged that a quarter had conspired to split the BNP and demanded a judicial committee be formed to look into the threat. Pressed on by reporters to take names, he said, "I have recognised the people who had threatened me but I do not want to name them now. I will tell their names before the probe committee. They threatened me coming to my home Sunday night." Continued Delwar: "I did politics in British and Pakistan periods, I have been doing politics for long in Bangladesh period too, but I never had to face such situation before." He was relieved of his secretary general post for health reasons at the late Monday night meeting. BIRDEM duty doctor Dr Mahbuba Tuesday said his health condition was critical as his blood sugar became unstable. On his ailment and staying at the hospital, he said, "I stayed at another place instead of at BIRDEM after the quarter had threatened me. But I came to know that the men of the agency had been frantically looking for me. As I was not there, I was saved by the grace of almighty Allah." "BNP is people's party. None can split the party through plots. Their ploy will never succeed." On the meeting of the policymaking standing committee Delwar said, "The party constitution stipulates that only the chairperson can call the meeting of the standing committee. No-one else has this right. Monday's meeting was illegal. "The constitution does not provide for appointment of acting chairman. The meeting was of the so-called reformists, they did it under pressure from a certain quarter," Delwar claimed. He asked party followers to unite under Khaleda's leadership. "The leaders and activists should be united so that nobody remains in confusion. Those who have made this incident happen will be condemned as traitors to the nation. The party won't be run by their activities." Acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, former lawmaker Maj (retd) Akhteruzzaman, Shirin Sultana, Rehana Akhter Ranu, among others, were present at Delwar's bedside. bdnews24.c
