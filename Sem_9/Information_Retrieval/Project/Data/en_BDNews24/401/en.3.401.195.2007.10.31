<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has said the participation of war criminals in elections is "completely unwarranted". "But how do you define war criminals? It has to be done through a legal process," Fakhruddin told editors at a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office Wednesday. "If any aggrieved person wants to take any legal course, the door is still open," he said. "I would always welcome (any such move)," Fakhruddin said. Answering a question from an editor, the chief adviser said: "I would not deny that some fundamental rights have been curbed because of the state of emergency." But Fakhruddin disagreed with the editor's comment that "people are entrapped". At some point, the meeting also focused on the political parties' demand for lifting the emergency rules. "There is no doubt that we have to lift the state of emergency," Fakhruddin said. bdn
