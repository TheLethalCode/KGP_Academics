 KHARTOUM, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Darfur rebels boycotting peace talks in Libya said on Tuesday they would meet envoys from a African Union-UN mediation team but specified conditions that gave little hope they would change their positions. The mediators had hoped to unite the rival rebel factions before peace talks opened in Libya on Oct. 27. But negotiations opened in the coastal Libyan town of Sirte with none of the key factions present. On Tuesday the joint UN and AU mediation team said it was sending delegations to the rebel leadership who did not attend. "This is part of the continuing process of consultations," said AU spokesman Noureddine Mezni. "We are having consultations with those here in Sirte and will be having consultations with those outside too." He did not have a specific date for the talks. The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) Unity, the main fighting factions on the ground, said they wanted united delegations from the rebel side before they went to any talks. "Whether or not they come this will not change the reality," JEM Chief Negotiator Ahmed Tugod Lissan told Reuters from Darfur. "If they want to take us to Sirte they have to remove all those other factions." He said only one delegation from JEM and one from SLA should be invited. SLA Unity said it would need at least one or two months to unify its cadres. "We want time to hold internal consultations and we want all the SLA factions to unite under one leadership and go as one delegation," said SLA Unity head Abdallah Yehya. Factions disagree about whether Libya is a viable venue for the talks. "Libya is not a neutral place," said senior SLA commander Jar el-Neby. SLA chairman and founder Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur, the most popular rebel leader who is supported by hundreds of thousands of Darfuris, said he would not attend until a UN force had deployed and provided security to his people, a condition which could take more than a year to finalise. He rejected the peace talks from the outset. The talks hope to end the spiralling chaos in Darfur which has claimed an estimated 200,000 lives and driven 2.5 million from their homes. The world's largest aid operation is sustaining around two-thirds of Darfur's population. On Tuesday an Arab League donor conference for Darfur opened. Diplomatic sources said Arab countries would donate some $300 million to the relief effort. Sudan receives around $1 billion a year in UN aid, mostly from Western natio
