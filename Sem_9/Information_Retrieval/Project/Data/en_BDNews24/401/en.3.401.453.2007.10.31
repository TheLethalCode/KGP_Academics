<TITLE> US to face `quagmire' if attacks Iran:commander </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States or its allies would find themselves trapped in a `quagmire deeper than Iraq and Afghanistan' if it chose to attack the Islamic Republic, Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander said on Wednesday.

Diplomats say Jafari, who was involved in strategic planning before his appointment, may have played a role in developing those tactics before becoming commander-in-chi
