 ATHENS, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 2,000 Greek pensioners demonstrated in central Athens on Wednesday demanding better pensions as the government prepared to launch a drastic overhaul of the ailing social security system. The ruling conservatives, who won a new four-year term in September, have vowed to reform the system which experts say could collapse in 15 years due to an ageing population. Holding banners that read "Decent pensions for decent people", pensioners, some aided by walking sticks, marched from the central Athens city hall to the Labour Ministry. "My pension is just over 250 euros a month," said Konstantinos Doganis, 75, who held up a blown-up photocopy of his pension slip showing he got 266 euros a month. "How can I live on that when every day prices are going up but my pension remains the same." Labour unions have said more than 70 percent of pensions are below 600 euros a month. Greece's central bank has urged the government to deal immediately with the pension problem, due to Greece's low birth rate, fragmented fund system and mismanagement, to avert havoc in public finances. "The central bank governor has a monthly salary that equals the pensions of at least 40 people," Diamantis Mavrodoglou, president of pensioners from IKA, the country's main social security fund. "No government has cared about us and so we will get what we are entitled to only if we take to the streets." He said more rallies were planneed for early November. Government officials say hundreds of pension funds may have actuarial deficits totalling close to 400 billion euros, about twice the country's GDP. Greece's largest unions, representing some 2.5 million workers, have turned down calls by the government to discuss reforms, saying they wanted to know the government's specific proposals before they sit at the negotiationg table. The ruling conservatives have yet to release their reform plan, which may feature extending age limits, merging funds and hiking monthly paymen
