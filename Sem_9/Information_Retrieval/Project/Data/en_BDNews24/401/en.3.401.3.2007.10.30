<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - The Investment Corporation of Bangladesh is set to float a Tk 1.0 billion ($14.68 million) mutual fund for non-resident Bangladeshi investors. It will be the second mutual fund, by the ICB, designed for non-resident Bangladeshis. "We have planned to issue another fund based on our previous experience. Our 1st NRB mutual fund was subscribed 9.4 times its size," Ziaul Haque Khondker managing director of ICB-a state-run investment bank, told a press conference in Dhaka. The size of ICB AMCL 1st NRB MF was Tk 100 million. The ICB earlier posted a 14 percent dividend for its shareholders at its 31st annual general meeting. The ICB also planned to float a Tk 200 million MF titled ICB 2nd AMCL mutual fund. Ziaul said that the fund would be a closed-end one in nature titled ICB AMCL 2nd NRB mutual fund. The NRBs, one of the main foreign currency earners after exporters, generally send billions of dollars a year. In fiscal 2006-07, remittance inflows grew 24.5 percent to $5.97 billion from $4.80 billion a year earlier. Non-resident Bangladeshis will be able to subscribe 60 percent of the total size of the fund. Local investors will be able to subscribe for 20 percent of the value while sponsors and mutual funds will each subscribe 10 percent of the fund size, he said. "We will try our best to bring the fund to the public within the first quarter of next year," he said. The ICB official also said that they had completed the process of bringing Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum to the stock market. Both the state-owned marketing companies are expected to sell 30 percent of their total shares. "We are now working to bring in Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company and Bakhrabad Gas Systems to the stock market. Raising funds through the securitisation of Jamuna Bridge is also under process," he said. Titas Gas, a state-run gas distribution company, is expected to sell shares worth Tk 2.16 billion through the stock exchanges. ($1=Tk 68.14) bd
