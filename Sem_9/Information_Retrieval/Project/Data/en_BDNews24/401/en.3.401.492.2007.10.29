 KIEV, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine will not join the World Trade Organisation until late 2008 at the earliest, 15 years after it launched membership talks, the government said on Monday. President Viktor Yushchenko promised to secure WTO membership within a year of taking office in 2005 after the pro-Western "Orange Revolution", as part of measures to move Ukraine closer to the West.

Once that issue is resolved, a WTO working group could prepare documents setting Ukraine's obligations in terms of tariffs and market access and limiting farm subsidies. "If Ukraine achieves an agreement with the WTO in March, its tariff obligations will then be confirmed. And the final draft could be readied for the end of April," the statement said. At least two months would then be needed to examine the draft. Ukraine has been seeking WTO entry since 1993. Parliament passed a series of laws last year and again in May to comply with WTO rules.
