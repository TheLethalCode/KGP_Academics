 MUSCAT, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - None of the 21 women who ran in Oman's elections won seats in the 84-member advisory Shura council, a symbolic body with no formal say in state affairs in the Gulf Arab country, results showed on Sunday. Two women won seats in 2003 in the last vote in the country, which has been ruled by Sultan Qaboos bin Said since 1970. Oman allowed public election campaigning for the first time this year. Candidates were able to post their pictures and political programmes for Saturday's ballot on billboards round the country.
