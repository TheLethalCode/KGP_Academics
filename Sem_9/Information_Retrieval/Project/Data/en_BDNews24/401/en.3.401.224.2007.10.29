<TEXT>
 Gregg Goldstein NEW YORK (bdnews24.com/Reuters Hollywood Reporter) - The Paris Hilton vehicle "The Hottie and the Nottie" will hit theaters just in time for Valentine's Day. Indie distributor Regent Releasing has picked up all North American rights to Tom Putnam's romantic comedy and set a February 8 release in ten major markets around the country. The heiress and former inmate plays Cristabel Abbott, who's been eyed since the first grade by an obsessed Nate Cooper (Joel David Moore). To win her affections, Nate is forced to find a boyfriend for her less-than-beautiful friend June Phigg (Christine Lakin). Hilton previously starred in the 2005 horror remake "House of Wax," although audiences reportedly cheered when her character was killed.
