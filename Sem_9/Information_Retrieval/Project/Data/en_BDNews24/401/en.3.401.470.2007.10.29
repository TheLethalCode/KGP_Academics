 FRANKFURT, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Miners buoyed by takeover news and firming oil stocks pushed European shares slightly higher by midday on Monday and the mood of investors lightened in anticipation of a US rate cut later in the week. At 1216 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.8 percent at 1,588.61 points, rising for a third session in a row. Europe's benchmark index is up 6.3 percent on the year. "The current optimism is still based on markets hoping for an interest rate cut on Wednesday," said Thomas Gruener, analyst at Landesbank Berlin. The Fed is widely forecast to cut rates by a quarter percentage point to 4.5 percent on Wednesday, while expectations are building for a follow-up cut in December to limit economic damage from the housing market's downturn. The likelihood of lower U.S. rates dampened the dollar, which fell to a record low against a basket of major currencies including the euro. But the stronger euro did not prevent shares of auto makers from rising. Renault gained 3.7 percent, tracking a sharp jump in shares of Nissan, in which Renault has a 44 percent stake, after the Japanese carmaker posted strong results. BMW rose 1.6 percent and Volkswagen gained 3.7 percent. M&A SUPPORTS MINERS Merger and acquisition news also lent some support, pushing European mining stocks higher, after Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata Plc offered A$3.1 billion ($2.8 billion) for Australia's fifth-largest nickel producer Jubilee Mines NL. Xstrata gained 1.7 percent, Rio Tinto added 3.2 percent, Anglo American rose 3.3 percent and BHP Billiton rose 2 percent. "It appears that the company has tested the market over the last couple of months and, quite simply, the Xstrata bid was the highest received," Citigroup said in a note, valuing the offer at 31 times Jubilee's 2008 earnings per share and 32 times 2009 EPS. "The key risk to the deal appears to be a counter bid from BHP Billiton," Numis Securities said in a note. "The M&A story is getting back on track, recovering from very depressed levels, and that sparks some hope," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers, in Paris. Energy stocks were on the rise as U.S. crude rose temporarily above $93 a barrel for the first time following a brief halt to one-fifth of Mexico's production. Total added 1.9 percent and BP gained 1.3 percent. Banks also moved higher, with UBS up 0.9 percent after the world's largest wealth manager confirmed its outlook issued at the beginning of the month that it would report a third-quarter pretax loss of more than $500 million. HSBC gained 1.5 percent, Barclays added 1.4 percent and Credit Suisse rose 1.5 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.7 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.7 percent. HEALTHCARE STOCKS SLIP Healthcare shares were the heaviest weight on the European benchmark index with Sanofi-Aventis falling 1.9 percent after Morgan Stanley cut earnings estimates ahead of the French drugmaker's third-quarter results on Oct. 31. German drugs and chemicals firm Bayer fell 0.9 percent on news of an impairment charge after a higher dose of its multiple sclerosis drug Betaferon failed to work better than a standard dose and rival Teva's Copaxone. "We believe this news is mostly negative for sentiment and would expect any weakness to be a good buying opportunity," Bear Stearns said in a note.
