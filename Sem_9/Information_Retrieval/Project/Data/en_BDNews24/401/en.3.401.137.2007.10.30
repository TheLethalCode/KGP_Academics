 KARACHI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf has undergone a precautionary MRI scan on a bruised knee before the team's departure for the tour of India. Team manager Talat Ali told Reuters that Yousuf had complained of pain in his knee after being struck by a ball during the one-day series against South Africa. "He was in some pain so we decided to have the precautionary MRI scans. But hopefully it is nothing serious," he said. "He is our main batsman and obviously we didn't want to take any chances before such an important tour," he said. Yousuf hit form against South Africa after a two-month break, scoring four half-centuries and a hundred in the final test and five-match one-day series. Pakistan play five one-dayers and three tests in India, starting with the first ODI at Guwahati on Monday
