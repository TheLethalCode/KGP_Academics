The Iraqi non-governmental organisation said Shehab Mohammed al-Hiti, a Sunni Arab editor of the al-Youm newspaper, was last seen leaving his home in the western Baghdad neighbourhood of Jamiaa on Saturday. He was heading for the newspaper's office in the centre of the capital. Iraqi security forces found his body later that day in the northern Baghdad district of Ur, which is a Shia neighbourhood. In a statement the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory did not say how he had been killed. Many journalists in Iraq have faced threats from Sunni Arab militants and Shi'ite militias. Others have been killed by US forces while reporting in the country. The New-York based Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the weekend killing.
