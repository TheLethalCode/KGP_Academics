 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission Monday said it was sending a letter to the secretary general of the BNP to invite the party to talks, but declined to name who the secretary general is. Election commissioner Sohul Hossain told reporters in his office Monday that the letter would be sent to the person who occupies the post of the BNP secretary general, avoiding entanglement in the party's ongoing squabble over leadership. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan from the post of party secretary general and appointed Khandaker Delwar Hossain in his place on Sept 3, the day she was arrested. Bhuiyan rejected his expulsion. Both men claim to lead the mainstream BNP. Sohul said the letter would be posted by Nov 7. "We sent letters to all parties 15 days before talks, and we'll do the same with the BNP. This means the invitations will be sent out by Nov 7." Asked to which BNP faction the letter will be sent, Sohul said, "We will send the letter to the person who holds the post of secretary general according to the party constitution." "The commission does not have a role in the making or unmaking of the BNP. As a citizen I hope all parties remain united." "That will also make our work easier." The Election Commission announced its timeline for talks with 15 political parties on Aug 22. It is slated to sit with the BNP on Nov 22. Delwar's faction in letters to the CEC on Sept 5 and 24, requested the EC to deal exclusively with them. The Bhuiyan-led faction sent a similar letter to the CEC on Sept 9. bdnew
