<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) The National Awami Party (Muzaffar) Sunday demanded that the known anti-liberation elements and war criminals be barred from taking part in elections. The fringe political party made the demand when it joined a dialogue with the Election Commission on electoral reforms. It also demanded that using religion and communal slogans and other "prejudicial practices" should also be banned. NAP general secretary advocate Enamul Haque raised several proposals at the dialogue, including the submission of wealth statements by all election contestants and their family members. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said: "After another round of talks with political parties over the draft electoral laws, we'll finalise a set of laws acceptable to all." After the ongoing series of meetings, the EC will make public a set of draft electoral laws, the CEC said. The dialogue was attended by the CEC, two election commissioners and election law officers, apart from the 10-member NAP delegation. bdnews24
