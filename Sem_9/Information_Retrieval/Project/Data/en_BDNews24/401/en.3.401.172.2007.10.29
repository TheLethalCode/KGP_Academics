<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The National Board of Revenue has extended the deadline for submitting individual income tax returns by another month, the country's top taxman said Monday. Considering the recurrent floods this year and then the Ramadan, the Eid ul-Fitr and the Durga Puja, the tax authority has taken the decision to enable the law-abiding to fulfil their responsibility at ease, the Board chairman said. NBR chairman Md Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com: "Considering the overall situation, we have decided to extend the deadline to Nov 30. I have instructed related officials to formally announce the decision." The deadline will not be extended any further and those who will not file their income tax return by the deadline would face punitive measures, he said. "We will take action against those who will fail to turn in their income tax returns by the extended deadline," Majid said. Earlier, responding to the requests and demands of various quarters and organisations, the tax administration extended the deadline for submitting individual tax returns for 2007-08 tax year until Oct 31. "Many could not submit their income tax return due to floods and the holy Ramadan and later the Eid and the Puja vacation. We have taken the decision considering the issues," NBR chairman said. In the first phase, the deadline of income tax return submission for 2007-08 tax year was set for Sept 30. Later the time was extended up to Oct 31 following the demand of different quarters and organisations. In 2006, nearly 5, 25, 994 TIN holders submitted Tk 252.14 crore with the deadline extended only once. bdnews
