 NEW DELHI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New call-up Praveen Kumar got his first taste of life as an Indian cricket acon on Monday -- and the experience put him in hospital. The 21-year-old fainted and fell from an open jeep during a packed parade in the northern Indian town of Meerut staged to celebrate the all-rounder's call-up to the national team. "It was just jostling and nothing else, I felt dizzy and fell down," the Hindustan Times daily quoted Kumar as saying. Fans who had caught up with his jeep had wanted to place a garland round Kumar's neck to mark his achievement, local reports said. India's domestic news agency quoted police as saying hospital X-rays revealed Kumar had not been injured in the fall. Kumar has been named in India's squad for the first two matches of the home one-day series against Pakistan starting on Monday
