 SARAJEVO, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The West should stay on in the Balkans because the unresolved status of Serbia's breakaway Kosovo province has created regional instability, Bosnia's top international peacekeeper was quoted on Tuesday as saying. "The instability is still visible not only in Bosnia but in the whole area of the Western Balkans," Hans-Jochen Witthauer, commander of the European Union's peacekeeping force EUFOR, told the Dnevni List daily. "That is why we are keeping a minimum force to be capable to intervene if war breaks out again," said the rear-admiral, who commands a 2,500-strong force. Bosnia's two autonomous ethnic-based halves, the Serb Republic and the Muslim federation, have had an uneasy, often hostile relationship since they were created as part of a power-sharing deal to stop the bloody 1992-95 war. The Bosnian Serbs have for years blocked reforms they see as chipping away at their autonomy. Last week, when international peace overseer Miroslav Lajcak imposed measures to streamline voting and pre-empt political deadlocks, they threatened to walk out of government. They were promptly backed by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who said the preservation of the Serb Republic and of Kosovo were Serbia's national priorities, a statement echoing the rhetoric of late nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic. Linking the future of Kosovo and Bosnia raises the spectre of radical changes of border and forced population shifts in the Balkans, eight years after the West went to war over Kosovo to stop the last ethnic conflict in the break-up of Yugoslavia. NATO bombed Serbia to force the withdrawal of its troops, accused of killing civilians while fighting a separatist war. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority is pushing for independence that Serbia is opposed to. "The resolution of Kosovo's status creates problems that have impact on the entire region," Witthauer said. "The entire Western Balkans is still a fragile and instable region. Ethnic tensions are powerful and the international community should pay special attention." He also warned that the gap between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic, was getting deeper. "Politicians cannot agree on issues of joint interest... which would bring (Bosnia) closer to the European Union," he said. Witthauer said the angry reactions against Lajcak showed there was strong resistance to Bosnia becoming a unified state. "If we look into these problems and events, I believe the international community is well advised to keep its hands on the Western Balkans," he sa
