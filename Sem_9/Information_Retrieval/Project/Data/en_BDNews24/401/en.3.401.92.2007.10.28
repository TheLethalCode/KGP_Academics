Telecom Egypt, which extended gains for a fifth day, is trading at a price to 2007 earnings ratio of 12.46 compared to a Middle East sector average of 13.48, according to Reuters data.

OCI shares surged 3.9 percent to 486.49 pounds, a record high. The benchmark Case 30 index climbed 1.4 percent to 9,276.84 points after hitting a record high of 9,294.36 points during the session. Egypt's well-watched Hermes index rose 1.6 percent to 82,328.12 points.
