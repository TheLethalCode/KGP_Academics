<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese stocks picked up steam on Wednesday as Fujifilm Holdings jumped after lifting its full-year forecasts, but investors remained reluctant to take big positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Another bright spot was Sapporo Holdings Ltd Shares in Japan's third-biggest beer maker surged by their daily limit after it said Morgan Stanley would take up to a 5 percent stake and work with it in the real estate business. But gains were limited as lower oil prices hit Mitsubishi Corp and other trading houses and energy stocks such as Inpex Holdings Inc, Japan's top oil developer. After the closing bell, Tokyo Electric Power Co cut its earnings outlook for the second time this year to forecast a loss -- its first in 28 years-- after it had to close the world's biggest nuclear power plant following an earthquake. The Bank of Japan announced as expected that it is keeping its policy rate target unchanged at 0.50 percent. The central bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, said later that global financial markets remain unstable due to problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector but that does not necessarily mean the bank will delay its next rate hike. "What's at the core of today's trading is that it's hard to make a move as investors don't know what the Fed's decision will be," said Naoki Koga, a senior fund manager at Toyota Asset Management. Investors are betting the Fed will lower its 4.75 percent federal funds rate on Wednesday, following a 50 basis point cut in September, to limit damage from the housing slump and tighter credit conditions. "Investor sentiment is not bad. Strong earnings results are having a positive impact on the market," Koga said. The benchmark Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent or 86.62 points to end at 16,737.63. The broader TOPIX index added 0.8 percent or 12.86 points to 1,620.07. Trade picked up, with 2.1 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section, compared with last month's daily average of 1.9 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by nearly three to one. Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities, said he suspects investors aimed to finish the day with neutral positions ahead of the Fed rate decision, but the downside was limited thanks to a series of strong earnings results. "Even if investors sell stocks, they are picked up along the way as results have been fairly good," Fukunaga said. FUJIFILM HIGHER Strong earnings prospects helped brighten the mood of the market. Shares of Fujifilm jumped 7.2 percent to 5,500 yen after the Japanese precision equipment maker revised up its full-year operating profit forecast by 5 percent after robust sales of digital medical imaging equipment buoyed its first-half results. Denso Corp shot up 7.9 percent to 4,650 yen. The top Japanese auto parts maker lifted its annual profit forecasts by about 10 percent after a hefty rise in interim earnings driven by domestic carmakers' robust overseas production. Shares of Sapporo surged 13.1 percent, or by its daily limit of 100 yen, to 865 yen. Sapporo also announced it had formed an alliance with Crescent Partners, a Japanese buyout fund, to overhaul its beverage business. But lower oil prices hit trading firms, with Mitsubishi Corp, Japan's top trading company, down 4.1 percent at 3,550 yen and No. 2 trading company Mitsui & Co losing 3.9 percent to 2,950 yen. Mitsubishi Corp booked a 1.2 percent rise in six-month net profit during the afternoon session, buoyed by surging oil prices, and raised its full-year forecast on expectations of strong commodity markets. Mitsui will report results on Nov. 2. Inpex Holdings slid 3.9 percent to 1.24 million yen, while Nippon Oil T, the country's top oil refiner, dropped 2.7 percent to 1,011 yen. US crude slipped below $90 after hitting a record $93.80 earlier this we
