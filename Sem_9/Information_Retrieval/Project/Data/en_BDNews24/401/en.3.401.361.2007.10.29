 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Australian Jamie Siddons arrived in Dhaka Monday to finalise his contract to coach the national team. The official Bangladesh Cricket Board late Sunday in a media statement named him as the successor of his fellow citizen Dav Whatmore. Arriving in Dhaka, he was approached by reporters at Zia International Airport, where he said he had taken the job as a "challenge". The national team also returned home with him by a plane of Thai Airways finishing Hong Kong six-a-side Tournament quarter final. The team happened to come across the new coach at Bangkok airport. Captain Mohammad Ashraful and his group aboard completed their introduction with him. Ashraful was impressed by Siddons. "He has been with the Australian Cricket Team since 2005 Ashes series. A coach like him will be good for us," Asraful said. Asked what the skipper expected from Siddons, he said, "Bangladesh has earned a good position in one-day cricket under Dav Whatmore over the past four years." "We all expect the new coach will help us do well in test cricket alongside the one-day internationals." As Siddons is an experienced batsman, Ashraful considered it a positive side to the team "as our main problem is with the batting side". "If our batting improves we can play better in the international cricket. The batting side will benefit more from him." bdnews24.
