 JAKARTA, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Indonesian men convicted of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed 202 people are likely to face the firing squad soon, after their families were allowed one last visit on Monday. Here are some facts about the three militants dubbed the Bali bombers. AMROZI: -- The mechanic from Lamongan, East Java, was the first of the three to be arrested by Indonesian police in November 2002, and the first to be sentenced to death, in August 2003. -- Amrozi confessed he took part in the attacks and was dubbed "the smiling bomber" because of his constant grin during the trial and apparent lack of remorse. The Supreme Court threw out his final appeal in September 2007. -- Amrozi was a student of radical Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who was also accused of being involved in the bombings. IMAM SAMUDRA: -- The alleged chief planner of the bombings, described by police as a computer expert from Serang in western Java, was the second suspect arrested, in late November 2002, when he confessed he planned the blasts. -- Prosecutors alleged that the former religious school teacher was behind a string of church bombings in Indonesia in 2000, having learnt how to make bombs in Afghanistan. -- Sentenced to death in September 2003, he unsuccessfully appealed to the Supreme Court two months later. MUKHLAS: -- Amrozi's older brother and the eldest of the three bombers, the now 47-year old Islamic teacher, also known as Ali Gufron, was arrested in central Java in early December 2002. -- Accused of being operational chief of Jemaah Islamiah's Southeast Asian branch, he said he did not play a direct role in the Bali attack and retracted a confession in June 2003, saying that he was stripped and tortured by interrogators into confessing. -- Mukhlas remained defiant throughout his trial and refused to co-operate with investigators, angering survivors and the victims' families. -- In February 2007, police alleged that Mukhlas gave guidance from jail to Muslim militants in the troubled Poso region of Indonesia's Sulawesi Island.
