 NEW DELHI, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's envoy to the United States formally apologised to parliament on Monday for likening MPs opposed to a controversial nuclear deal with Washington to a "headless chicken", lawmakers said.

Sen said the comment was not on the record and was aimed at journalists and not at politicians. Nevertheless, he apologised if it had hurt anybody's feelings. Lawmakers were not placated, however, and summoned him to the privileges committees of the upper and lower houses. "He offered an unconditional apology.

"He said the conversation was not on the record," the MP told reporters outside parliament, adding that the panel would draft a report and place it in parliament when it convenes next month. Sen is due to make a similar appearance before the upper house panel on Friday. According to the report published on rediff.com (www.rediff.com), Sen rounded on critics of the civilian nuclear cooperation deal, opposition to which has threatened to pull down Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition government. "It has been approved here by the president, and there it's been approved by the Indian cabinet," rediff.com quoted Sen as telling its reporter in Washington.

Rediff has said Sen's conversation with its reporter was on the record and that it stood by the repo
