 ABUJA, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian kidnappers have released six Indian and Polish hostages seized on Oct. 26 from an offshore oil production facility operated by Saipem, the Italian firm's parent company Eni said on Tuesday. Rebel group the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) had claimed responsibility for the attack on the Mystras vessel, which cut output by 50,000 barrels per day and helped lift oil prices to $92 per barrel on Friday.

The militants demand "resource control" or power over oil revenues, which they say have been squandered or stolen by successive Nigerian governments to the detriment of the poor majority in the delta, whose region has been polluted.
