 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- The Power Cell Sunday said it was evaluating tender bids to set up eight private sector rental power stations capable of bringing 310 megawatts of electricity onto the national grid. Thirteen proposals have been made for seven plants out of the eight, said officials with the Power Cell under the Power Division. Power Cell director general Abdul Jalil told bdnews24.com that the evaluation process started on Sunday. "We hope tender evaluations will be completed in a week. No bid was submitted for Fenchuganj. A fresh tender will be floated for it." The project sites are: Sylhet (50 megawatt), Fenchuganj (50mw), Shahjibazar (50mw), Ashuganj (50mw), Bhola (30mw), Khulna (40mw), Bheramara (20mw) and Bogra (20mw). The Bheramara and Khulna plants will be diesel-powered and the rest run by gas. The eight power plants will collectively generate 310 megawatts of electricity, according to the bids floated in October. Bids were submitted to set up power plants at every site but Fenchuganj, representing a production capacity of 260-megawatts of electricity. Power Cell officials said Aggreko (Singapore), Alstom Power Rentals (USA), Kaltimex Energy (Indonesia), Energy Prima (Bangladesh) and Green Power (Bangladeshi consortium) submitted 13 proposals for seven plants. The selection process will be finalised by the third week of next month, Jalil said. The selected firm's plant must be operational within 120 days of signing a three-year agreement with the government. The government had previously selected eight sites for rental power plants, each with easy access to gas and the national power grid. The Power Development Board is to allocate land for the rental power stations, which are expected to be portable. The government will supply gas on easy terms. Jalil said electricity prices would be determined after evaluating the proposals. The prices of electricity from the power stations might be a little higher than independent power plants, he said. bdnews24.
