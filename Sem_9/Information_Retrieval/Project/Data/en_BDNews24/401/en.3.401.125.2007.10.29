However, the main factors that predispose a person to develop melanoma seem to be fair skin, light coloured hair and eyes as well as regular exposure to the sun and a history of sunburn. What are the signs? The main signs of skin cancer are asymmetrical moles, moles that have ragged or irregular borders, moles that vary in colour and moles that are larger than a pencil's eraser.
