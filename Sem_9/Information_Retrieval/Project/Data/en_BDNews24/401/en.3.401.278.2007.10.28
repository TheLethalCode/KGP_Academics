<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi were close to winning their second successive victory in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League at the close of the third day of the second round four-dayer at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium Sunday. After being followed on against hosts Rajshahi, Barisal took an overall two-run lead with 219 for nine at stumps in the second innings. Hosts Khulna were also in a commanding seat against visitors Chittagong, who need another 342 runs with all wickets intact on the final day at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Chasing a target of 365 to win, Chittaong were 25 for no loss at the close of Day 3 with two unbeaten openers Tamim Iqbal (9) and Nafis Iqbal (13). The result of the match, however, depends on how Chittagong takes attitude on Monday. Rajshahi vs Barisal Barisal, having resumed on 77 for nine, added another 10 runs to finish at 87 all out, but they bettered their second innings to avoid an innings defeat on the third day. Like the first innings, Barisal collapsed once again in the second innings to reduce to 62 for six before Raisul Islam and Mohammad Shaheen (29) stood tall to put on 72 runs for the seventh wicket. Raisul topscored with 52 off 121 balls before giving a return catch to Suhrawardi Shuvo, who was the most successful Rajshahi bowler with three for 39. Afterwards, Ali Arman and Talha Jubair (45) added another 57 runs for the ninth wicket before the last wicket between Arman and Sajedul Islam took the play to the final day remaining unbeaten on 23 and nine. Khulna vs Chittagong The visitors Chittaong resumed the day on 231 for seven and finished their first inning at 248 all out, giving a 162-run lead to the hosts. Khulna set Chittaong to chase 366 runs to win after scoring 204 all out in 67 overs. Saqib Al Hasan, who scored 108 in the first innings, topscored with 50. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (30), Tushar Imran (26), Shagir Hossain Pavel (23) and Ziaur Rahman (23) were other notable scorers for Khulna. Tareq Aziz captured four wickets for 25 while Ehsanul Haq and Saju Datta each took two wickets for 46 and 52.
