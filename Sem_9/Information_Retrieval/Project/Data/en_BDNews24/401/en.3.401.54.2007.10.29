<TITLE> State-run banks lose edge in big-loan financing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - State-run banks' term loan financing is on the decline, while private banks have been consolidating their positions in the business. "This is not a positive sign. It seems that state-run banks' operating incomes are declining in the face of increased operating costs. These banks will be in trouble when their operating costs exceed income," said Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled, a former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank. "At some point, the government will have to provide subsidies or these banks will collapse." According to Bangladesh Bank, state-run banks' share in large-scale loan financing declined to 3.87 percent in fiscal 2006-07 from 16.87 percent in 2002-03. The share of state-owned banks in term loan disbursement started to dip after Bangladesh Bank signed memoranda of understanding with them to help them pull out of financial straits brought on by huge bad debt. The central bank set a 5 percent ceiling on state-run banks' loan growth rates. "State-run banks face unequal competition. They face restrictions in sanctioning loans while private banks are free in this regard," Khaled said. Private banks have been consolidating their positions overtime. Private banks' term loan financing accounted for 60.82 percent of the total in 2006-07, up from 40.30 percent in FY 03. Non-bank financial institutions' share in total loans declined while the share of foreign banks' loans remained steady. Sonali Bank managing director Aminur Rahman linked the decline in state-run banks' term loan operations to their 'cautiousness'. "We have become more cautious in issuing new loans. We are now emphasising recovery," he said, but added: "We will increase our stake in overall disbursement, through competition." The Bangladesh Bank figures show that overall, term loan disbursement by all banks and financial institutions tripled to 123.8 billion in 2006-07 from Tk 39.7 billion in fiscal year 2002-03. In fiscal year 2007, private banks sanctioned a total of Tk 75.3 billion in loans while state-run banks issued just Tk 4.8 billion. "I think this is a positive sign. It reflects that the government objective of increased private sector engagement in the financial sector is succeeding," said Bangladesh Bank deputy governor Nazrul Huda. Huda said, "The increased role of private banks could help decrease politically motivated loans." Citigroup's country officer for Bangladesh Mamun Rashid said: "We want to be identified with development." Rashid said banks should finance growth sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, power and infrastructure. "We should the support growth of these proven sectors if we want to do businesses here," he said. bd
