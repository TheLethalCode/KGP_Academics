 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Monday issued arrest warrants against former state minister and Awami League leader Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya and four members of his family. Dhaka senior special judge Md Azizul Haque gave the order Monday afternoon to issue the warrants. The court has set Nov 4 to report on the arrests. The five are currently evading arrest. Maya's wife Parveen Chowdhury, two sons Shajedul Hossain Chowdhury and Rashedul Hossain Chowdhury, and Shajedul's wife Subarna Chowdhury, have been charged in an ACC case of acquiring assets beyond their known income. The ACC filed the case on June 13 with Sutarpur police and submitted charge sheets against the five on Oct 25. Two others accused in the case, Maya's third son Rifat Saeed Chowdhury and Rashedul's wife Farhana Chowdhury, were cleared of charges. According to the charge sheet, the accused amassed Tk 5.8 crore in assets beyond their stated income, through corrupt means, while Maya served as state minister for shipping. They are also charged with concealing information on wealth of Tk 6.29 crore. The same court issued a custody warrant Monday against ex-BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu in a corruption case filed with Kamrangirchar police. According to the charge sheet, submitted on Oct 25, a RAB team confiscated corrugated iron sheets meant for relief efforts from one Rupa Molla's house at Kamrangirchar on Apr 2. When questioned, members of the family told law enforcers that the former lawmaker had given them the corrugated iron. Sub-inspector Sheikh Abdul Motalib of Kamrangirchar police filed a case the same day against Pintu as there was no documentation for the materials handed over by the BNP leader.
