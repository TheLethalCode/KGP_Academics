<TITLE> Standard Life faces up to Resolution battle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Standard Life faces the task this week of restructuring its 4.9 billion pound bid for UK insurer Resolution, under pressure from investors worried it may be straying from its core strategy and destroying value. Former mutual Standard Life's cash-and-shares bid for smaller Resolution was trumped less than an hour after it was made on Friday, when rival suitor Pearl muscled in with a third, all-cash, offer and raised its holding in Resolution to more than 24 percent -- virtually a blocking stake. The move from Pearl, which like Resolution has focused on consolidating life funds no longer open to new business, forced Resolution to drop its recommendation of Standard's offer on Monday, and has thrown the takeover battle for Britain's sixth-largest life insurer back into uncertainty. Resolution's shares were trading at 728p on Tuesday, above both Pearl's 720p cash offer and the 714.3p current value of Standard's offer, indicating investors expect a higher offer. Standard Life is meeting investors this week, and sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday it planned to overhaul its offer and hoped to sweeten the terms of the deal by early next week. "Strategically, this is something Standard Life wants, and Resolution can see the rationale for having Standard Life as an owner, so I don't think there are any issues on that front. It is going to revolve around price and around whether they can get it past shareholders," said Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, which holds Standard Life shares. "Given the current state of the wider market, (Standard Life) are going to try to keep the amount they pay to an absolute minimum both to pacify shareholders and to make the deal viable." Both analysts and investors say Standard Life is expected to change the structure of its offer, which currently requires 75 percent of Resolution shareholders to approve it. But they said the group could find it hard to deliver a knockout price by either boosting its planned share issue -- already almost a quarter of its shares in issue -- or by raising more debt, without further depressing its shares. "I think they will be looking to wring as many savings as possible from offer number one without coming back with a knock-out bid," Hargreaves Lansdown's Hunter said. UNDER PRESSURE Standard Life, which listed in 2006 at the end of a three-year overhaul, is under pressure from investors who fear it could stray too far from its current growth strategy as it tries to stay in the battle for Resolution, a consolidator of closed life funds. The former mutual's shares rose almost 36 percent in the first year as a traded insurer, boosted by bumper sales in 2006 and the success of its self-invested personal pension (SIPP). But the stock has been virtually flat since it said in September that it was considering a bid for Resolution, underperforming the sector by 10 percent. "I'm not entirely sure where the logic lies in buying Resolution. I think Pearl is a better suitor, so I am not keen for Standard to pay up. Frankly, I'm happy for them to pull out," said one institutional shareholder who declined to be named. "This might be a different line of growth for it to go for, but I think Standard Life has other avenues, and I think it can go down the organic path." Standard Life's results, which have shown market-leading sales growth in recent quarters, indicated a dip in its key SIPP sales in the third quarter, leaving analysts to question whether the deal would cloud lucrative SIPP growth even further. Sources close to the situation have said one key move being assessed by Standard Life and its advisers is the shift to a takeover structure for the deal as opposed to the current "scheme", which requires 75 percent of Resolution shareholders to approve the bid and could allow Pearl to block it. However, Pearl's stake could still stop Standard Life from delisting Resolution in the event of a deal, diluting the effect of the sale of some Resolution assets to Swiss Re, a move expected to raise 2.35 billion pounds in cash.
