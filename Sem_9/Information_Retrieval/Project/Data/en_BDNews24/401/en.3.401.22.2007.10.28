 KIRKUK, Iraq, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb exploded outside a bus terminal in the volatile northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, killing at least eight people and setting shops and cars ablaze, police said.

The terminal is the starting point for buses heading to the northern cities of Sulaimaniya, Mosul and Arbil. Kirkuk, which sits on Iraq's northern oil fields, is contested by Kurds, Turkmen, Shi'ite and Sunni Arabs. Kurds want it to be incorporated into their largely autonomous Kurdistan region, but Arab residents want it to remain under the authority of the Baghdad government.
