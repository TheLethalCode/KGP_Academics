<TEXT>
 Kolkata, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dozens of people were injured in clashes with police and buses were set on fire in West Bengal Wednesday during a strike called to protest against the killing of villagers opposed to industry. The strike shut schools, offices and businesses across the communist-ruled state and transport was hit as protesters blocked rail tracks, witnesses and police said. "We are sorry that people have to suffer a bit," said Mamata Banerjee, chief of the Trinamul Congress, the state's main opposition party which called the day-long strike. "But poor villagers are still being killed by communist party workers in Nandigram for protecting their land, and we cannot sit quietly anymore," she said. Hundreds of Trinamul activists blocked highways, ransacked buses and set fire to some to protest against what they say is frequent attacks by communist party workers on poor villagers opposed to a special economic zone (SEZ), or industrial enclave, in Nandigram village. The West Bengal government had planned to set up a SEZ for chemical industries in Nandigram, 150 km southwest of Kolkata, but had to abort the project as villagers refused to give up their farmland. The row saw violent clashes between locals opposed to the project, its communist supporters and police, and dozens of people have been killed and over 200 injured since January. Although the project has been shelved, hostilities have not abated and at least six villagers have been killed in clashes between locals and communist workers in the latest trouble in Nandigram since Saturday.
