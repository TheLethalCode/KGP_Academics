<TITLE> Ashraf refutes Delwar on 'return' to BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 28 (bdnews24.com) - Pro-reform BNP leader Ashraf Hossain, in clear contradiction to Khandaker Delwar Hossain's statement of Saturday, has said he and fellow reformists are "in the real BNP" and so the question of 'returning' does not arise. Ashraf said Sunday that there was no scope for misunderstanding on this point. "We are in the real BNP. We want to make the party stronger and election-oriented." In reply to reporters' queries after he met with the pro-reform leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home, he said BNP is a major political party. "There might be differences of opinion in the party. But we believe BNP is one party and there is no division in it." Ashraf added that there were differences of opinion in the party on whether democracy would be practiced or whether the party would be run in an autocratic way. Delwar, appointed secretary general by party chairperson Khaleda Zia on the day she was detained, told reporters Saturday that pro-reform leaders including Bhuiyan were seeking a way to return to BNP. Delwar also claimed they had put forward proposals in this regard. When Ashraf Hossain was asked about the matter Sunday he differed with Delwar, saying categorically: "We have made some reform proposals for more democratic practices within the party." "The proposals enjoy huge support from BNP leaders and workers throughout the country. If democracy cannot be established in the party, the organisation will become weak." Refuting Delwar's statement that people were recruited to the pro-reform camp through intimidation, he said: "We do not do politics of intimidation. Those who are for individual leadership are making the political arena murky by intimidating the leaders and workers." Ashraf said leadership would be established through democratic means by holding elections in the next BNP council. The party and the country would both benefit if the party were run through joint leadership instead of individual leadership, he said. bdnews
