 BEIJING, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China condemned Canada's prime minister on Tuesday for `disgusting conduct' for playing host to the Dalai Lama and demanded that Ottawa stop supporting anti-Chinese activities by exiled Tibetans.

"For decades the Dalai Lama's words and deeds have demonstrated that he is a political exile who wears a religious cloak while engaging in activities splitting the motherland and sabotaging ethnic unity," Liu, the spokesman, said. US President George W Bush and leaders of Congress gave the Dalai Lama the Congressional Gold Medal in a packed ceremony in the US Capitol on Oct. 17.
