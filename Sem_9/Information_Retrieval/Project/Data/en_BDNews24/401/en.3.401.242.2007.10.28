 New York, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Travellers want to go green and stay clean in the next year  and they don't want cell phones disturbing their peace, according to an annual survey of travel trends. TripAdvisor, a travel Web site, surveyed more than 2,500 travellers globally, finding the top trends were concerns about germs, the growth of green tourism, and opposition to cell phone use on planes. It also found emerging hotspots for vacations in 2008 were Jerba in Tunisia, Makandi Bay in Egypt and Phangnga in Thailand. "The major trends we're observing are that travellers value cleanliness above all else and are becoming more environmentally conscious," Michele Perry, spokeswoman for TripAdvisor, said in a statement. The survey found 80 percent of respondents were concerned about germs, bacteria and viruses when travelling. Airplanes were deemed the most germy, according to 28 percent of those polled, with public transportation next, followed by restaurants, hotels, and airports. In keeping with the germaphobia, 55 percent of travellers said they tend to wash and disinfect their hands more often while travelling with 27 percent of Americans  up from 22 percent in 2005  taking disinfectant, cleaning supplies, shower shoes, pillows, towels or linens, when going on a trip. Nearly half  or 45 percent  of travellers said their worst experience at a hotel was a dirty bathroom or dirty sheets but 17 percent said they encountered vermin. Travellers are going greener, with 26 percent planning to be more environmentally conscious in their travel decisions in the coming year, with plans ranging from biking to hiking. They clearly don't want cell phones disturbing their peace, with 78 percent of travellers believing that mobile phones should not be allowed on flights. The survey found that 53 percent of travellers said it takes less than a day to unwind on vacation while 35 percent take 1-2 days to relax. Travellers will average about three vacations in the coming year with beaches getting hotter as 64 percent plan to vacation at a sandy spot this year, compared to 59 percent last year. Using a system that looks at various criteria such as search activity and postings, TripAdvisor predicts the rising stars in travel. It said the top three emerging world hotspots for travel are Jerba, Tunisia, Makandi Bay, Egypt and Phangnga, Thailand. Rounding out the top 10 are Kovalam in India, Sabaudai in Italy, Asilah in Morocco, Ko Phangan in Thailand, La Plagne in France, Yangshuo in China, and Kotor, Montenegro.
