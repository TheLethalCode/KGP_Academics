 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  A presidential ordinance which gives limited judicial powers in certain cases to executive magistrates was officially published Tuesday in advance of its implementation on Nov 1. The Mobile Court Ordinance 2007 received its final approval Sunday from a meeting of the council of advisers. The new ordinance will provide executive magistrates with limited judicial powers such as mobile court work and legal oversight of examination centres. Under the change, the executive magistrates cannot hand down any punishment other than a monetary fine. However, if the fine cannot be realised, the magistrates are permitted to sentence offenders to a maximum of three-month imprisonment. >>Mobile Court Ordinance 2007 bdnews24.c
