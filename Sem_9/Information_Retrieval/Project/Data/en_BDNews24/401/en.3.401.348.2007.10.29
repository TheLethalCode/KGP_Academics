<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi raced to their second successive win in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League with a convincing eight-wicket win over Barisal in the second four-dayer at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium Monday. Tamim Iqbal smashed 81 for Chittagong to deny hosts Khulna their first triumph, with the match ending in a draw at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Star-studded Khulna, however, earned four points by virtue of a first innings lead and squeezed full eight bonus points on offer from the game. Chittagong had to settle for seven points, including five bonus points. The two straight wins put last year's runners-up Rajshahi on top of the six-team point table with 30 points, seven clear of Khulna, who are yet to taste triumph in two outings, in the second slot. Holders Dhaka, who beat Sylhet Sunday, are in the third with 21 points from two matches while Barisal are in the fourth with 18 points. Rajshahi vs Barisal Rajshahi were very close to winning the match against Barisal Sunday and it was a matter of when rather than if the victory would come although they got a bit of jolt Monday morning. Rajshahi raced to nine for two in reply of Barisal's eight. Sajedul Islam trapped Rajshahi opener Jahirul Islam (5) in the first over and pacer Talha Jubair bowled one-down Rafiqul Islam (0) to reduce Rajshahi to eight in the 2.2 overs. But Nayeem Islam made sure that there was no further drama, taking took the winning single to give Rajshahi their second win on the trot. Earlier, Barisal, having resumed the final day on 216 for nine, added only six runs on way to their final score of 222 all out in the second innings, setting Rajshahi to chase just nine runs to win. Barisal were forced to follow on after being bundled out for 87 runs in reply to Rajshahi's first innings total of 301 all out. Khulna vs Chittagong Having resumed the final day on 25 for no loss, Chittagong needed another 342 runs to beat Khulna, who set the visitors to chase 367 runs. Chittagong were 252 for seven in 103 overs when the bails were drawn for the final day. Pacer Ziaur Rahman raised the hope of an unlikely triumph removing Nafees Iqbal (27) and Gazi Salahuddin (0) for 51. But opener Tamim Iqbal and Nazimuddin kept the Khulna attack at bay to put on 98 runs for the third wicket. Tamim was bowled by Saqib Al Hasan for 81 off 166 balls, studded with nine boundaries and two sixes. Nazimuddin then paired with Faisal Hossain (48) to add another 79 runs for the fourth wicket before Chittagong saw three wickets fall on the same score to slip to 228 for six in 85.3 overs. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza caught and bowled Chittagong skipper Ehsanul Haq (13) in the 85th over before Syed Rasel removed Nazimuddin (56) and Dhiman Ghosh (0) in two successive deliveries in the next over. It was not too little too late to tame the visitors as Ashiqur Rahman (5 off 50 balls) and Tareq Aziz (2 off nine balls) came up with real rearguard action to help Chittagong avert their second straight defeat. Ziaur, Rasel and Mashrafee each took two wickets for 20, 59 and 67 runs. b
