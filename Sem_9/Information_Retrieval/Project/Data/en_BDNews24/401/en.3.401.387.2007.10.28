 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the trial of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust graft case, in which she is a suspect, under emergency powers rules. The hearing on the writ petition is likely to be held Monday. Hasina filed the appeal with the High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury. Hasina's protocol officer Monzila Faruk was granted power of attorney, with the bench's permission, to submit the writ petition on Hasina's behalf. The case was filed with Tejgaon Police Station on September 2. The case alleged that the accused had taken Tk 3 crore in "donations" to Bangabandhu Memorial Trust for approval to set up three barge-mounted power plants. Anticorruption Commission deputy secretary SM Sabbir filed the case against seven people including Hasina, former energy secretary Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former Power Development Board chairman Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal and Summit Group managing director Muhammad Aziz Khan. The case alleged the accused had misused power and colluded with one another to sign an agreement with Wartsila Power Development to install the three power plants, instead of selecting the lowest bidder. The case was included under the emergency powers rules on September 20. Hasina sought bail and appealed for proceedings to be suspended in the writ petition. The writ petition said that putting the case under the emergency powers rules violated the law. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq and barrister Shafique Ahmed will represent Hasina at the hearing. bdnews24
