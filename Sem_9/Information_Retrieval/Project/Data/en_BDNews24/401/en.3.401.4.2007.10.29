<TEXT>
 MINGORA, Pakistan, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani troops killed up to 60 Islamist militants during fierce fighting in the Swat valley in the country's northwest, the army said on Monday, while the insurgents called a truce to recover their dead and wounded. Troops firing artillery and backed by helicopter gunships on Sunday battled militants led by a pro-Taliban cleric seeking to impose strict Islamic code in the scenic valley close to Pakistan's lawless tribal belt bordering Afghanistan. "We heard big bangs the whole night. We don't know how many people were killed," a terrified resident of Charbagh, 3 miles (5 km) west of the valley's main town of Mingora, told Reuters. Army spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said that, based on reports by police and the paramilitary Frontier Corps, up to 60 militants had been killed. He had no reports of casualties among security forces, although residents saw at least nine dead paramilitaries. The eruption of violence in Swat comes as the Supreme Court is hearing challenges to the re-election earlier this month of U.S. ally President Pervez Musharraf. It follows a suicide attack on former prime minister Benazir Bhutto that killed 139 people in the southern city of Karachi when she returned from self-imposed exile on Oct. 18. Islamist militants seeking to destabilise nuclear-armed Pakistan regard Musharraf and Bhutto as lackeys of the West. There is speculation the pair, who have vowed to fight militancy and extremism, could share power after national elections due by January, although Bhutto is bitterly opposed to conservatives in the ruling Pakistan Muslim League. Militant activity has surged in Swat since pro-Taliban cleric Maulana Fazlullah launched an illegal FM radio station and urged a jihad, or Muslim holy war. Fazlullah, known as "Mullah Radio", is de facto head of a pro-Taliban group, Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) or Movement for the Implementation of Mohammad's Sharia Law. He is a son-in-law of TNSM's founder Mullah Sufi Mohammad, who was captured in late 2001, after the movement sent thousands of fighters to Afghanistan in a vain attempt to help the Taliban repulse U.S.-backed forces. SUICIDE ATTACKS, BEHEADINGS A suspected suicide attack that killed at least 21 people, mostly soldiers, last Thursday triggered the latest violence. A day later the militants killed seven civilians and decapitated three soldiers and three policemen. Villagers said the militants had announced by radio and loudspeaker that a ceasefire had been agreed to allow funerals on Monday for those killed in the fighting, although military officials said there was no formal truce. Thousands fled their homes on Sunday as the fighting intensified, residents said. Suicide and roadside bomb attacks on security forces have multiplied since commandos stormed the Red Mosque in the capital, Islamabad, in July to crush another Taliban-style movement. More than 100 people were killed in the fighting. Many of the Red Mosque followers hailed from Swat, Waziristan and other poor areas of North West Frontier Province. An already dire security situation in NWFP deteriorated further after the Islamist-led provincial assembly was dissolved earlier this month as part of a move designed to ease the way for Musharraf's re-election by parliament and provincial assemblies. In Waziristan, a hotbed of support for the Taliban and al Qaeda at the other end of the Pashtun tribal belt from Swat, more than 200 soldiers have been held captive since Augu
