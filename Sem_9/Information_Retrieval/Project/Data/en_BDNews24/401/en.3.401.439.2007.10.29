 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  An anticorruption taskforce Monday started quizzing former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in special jail in connection with the power-plant graft case. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "An ACC team is conducting the investigation in special jail." Hasina's lawyer Toufique Newaz was with the three-member ACC team. The investigators entered the special jail around 10:30am. The former prime minister Sunday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the trial of the graft case under emergency powers rules. The case filed with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 alleged that the accused had taken Tk 3 crore in "donations" to Bangabandhu Memorial Trust for approval to set up three barge-mounted power plants. Anticorruption Commission deputy secretary SM Sabbir filed the case against seven people including Hasina, former energy secretary Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former Power Development Board chairman Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal and Summit Group managing director Muhammad Aziz Khan. The case alleged the accused had misused power and colluded with one another to sign an agreement with Wartsila Power Development to install the three power plants, instead of selecting the lowest bidder. The case was included under the emergency powers rules on September 20. bdnew
