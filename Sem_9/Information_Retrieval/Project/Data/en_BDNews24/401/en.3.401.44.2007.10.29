 LONDON, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain failed to act on information passed to it by Saudi Arabia which might have helped prevent suicide bombings in London in 2005 that killed 52 people, Saudi's King Abdullah said on Monday. In an interview with the BBC on the eve of a state visit to Britain, King Abdullah accused London of failing to do enough to combat international terrorism and said al Qaeda continued to pose a major threat. "We have sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist attacks in Britain but unfortunately no action was taken," he said, speaking through an interpreter. "And it may have been able to maybe avert the tragedy." The July 7, 2005 suicide bombings on London's transport system were Britain's most devastating peacetime attack. A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Downing Street office said no warnings were received before the attacks. "We made it very clear at the time that no specific warnings were received from any source," he said. "We do have a very close intelligence relationship with the Saudis and cooperation on counter-terrorism is generally very good. We just happen to disagree on this point." King Abdullah is due to arrive in Britain later on Monday for a state visit. His visit has prompted protests in Britain from critics of the Saudi government's human rights record. Demonstrations are planned outside the Saudi embassy in London later this week. The Saudi monarch said he thought most countries -- including Britain -- did not view terrorism seriously enough. "I believe strongly ... that it will take 20 to 30 years to defeat the scourge of terrorism with vigilant effort," he said. "And I strongly urge all countries in the world, including Great Britain, to take the matter of fighting terrorism very, very seriously, and to combat terrorism day and night with robustness and vigilance." Vince Cable, acting leader of Britain's third largest party the Liberal Democrats, said he will boycott a banquet for the Saudi king to be held by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. "By any standards, and in the assessment of our own Foreign Office, the human rights record of this government is absolutely appalling," he told BBC radio. "They point to the systematic discrimination against women, people of other religions, the exercise of systematic corporal punishment, through amputation, the public beheadings." John McDonnell, a left-wing member of parliament in Brown's Labour Party, said Britons would be "aghast at the government entertaining ... one of the most prominent anti-democratic and human rights abusing leaders in the world." Last December, then Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped in to halt a Serious Fraud Office investigation into a deal between the defence contractor BAE Systems and Saudi Arabia, citing the risks it posed to British-Saudi relations. Blair's action sparked sharp criticism from commentators and opposition politicians who accused him of cozying up to Saudi Arab
