 Dhaka, Oct 28(bdnews24.com)  The ACC missed the deadline Sunday for submitting investigation reports on Tarique Rahman, wife Dr Zobaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu. Judge Mohammad Mizanur Rahman of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court reset the submission date for Nov 28 after the Anticorruption Commission assistant director Towfiqul Islam failed to submit the reports on time. The ACC filed a case against Tarique, his wife and mother-in-law with Kafrul Police Station on September 26 for alleged concealment of assets. ACC deputy director Zahurul Huda filed the case against the suspects for allegedly amassing wealth worth Tk 4.82 crore without any corresponding source of income and also concealing wealth worth about Tk 4.23 crore. Tarique submitted his wealth statement to the ACC from prison on June 10. He showed his net worth to be Tk 1.37 crore. Joint forces arrested Tarique at his Dhaka Cantonment home on Shaheed Mainul Road on March 8. bdnews24.com/
