 Dhaka, October 28 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday directed lenders to expedite the disbursement of farm loans to help the sector recoup losses wrought by the recent floods. Bangladesh Bank deputy governor Nazrul Huda briefed reporters about the CA's directives after attending a meeting of the BB agriculture loan disbursement supervision and monitoring committee. The CA underscored the urgency of short-term cash and crop loans, he said. Huda said agriculture loan disbursements of about Tk 1,185 crore in the July-September quarter of 2007, or 15 percent of the target amount, has not been satisfactory or desirable. The shortfall was due to the second wave of flooding and subsequent pressure for loans in the September-October period after the recession of floodwaters, he said. Huda suggested that the government chalk out a plan to pull together banks and government agencies to improve the distribution of resources such as seeds, fertilisers and water for irrigation. He said IMF worries about lowered GDP growth rates of 5.5 percent for this fiscal year could still be averted. But he admitted that GDP growth would suffer in the event of agriculture sector deficits. To combat such a situation, Huda said, the BB has taken measures and directed commercial banks to encourage fertiliser imports. bdnews24.c
