The RAB was not sure whether the firearmsthree guns and one revolverwere unlicensed. "We didn't get any documents on the arms yet. It's too early to confirm," Sultan Mohammad Khan Nurani, RAB-3 commanding officer, told bdnews24.com by phone. The elite force widened its search for Purbani director Mahbubur Rahman Joynal and his girlfriend Jannatul Ferdous, a model, who RAB officers said had peddled Yaba tablets. Nurani, a wing commander, who had led the raid, showed reporters the goods recovered from the house on Road No. 27 in Dhanmondi. He said the foreign currencies were worth Tk 28.5 crore.

We are in search of Jannatul Ferdous," Nurani had earlier told bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib on the scene. Major Imrul Kayes Chowdhury, a member of the RAB team, alleged that Jannatul, nicknamed Nikki or Ena, had long been living in the building. "She is a Yaba peddler," he said. Among the passports seized from the building, one is Jannatul's, another RAB officer, squadron leader Khalid Shams, said. According to details in the passport, she is 22 years old.
