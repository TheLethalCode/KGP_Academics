<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Environment and forest adviser CS Karim Saturday said the country must be equipped with policy to fight challenges posed by global warming. The country has experienced a significant change to its climate, especially increasing the trend of drought in the north and recurring floods in the central region, experts said. Such changes are causing loss of livelihood and degradation of nature in Bangladesh, a delta nation. Scientists have warned that about 30 million Bangladeshis in southern Bangladesh could become "environmental refugees" losing homes if the sea rises by 3-4 metres in future. "It is high time we rose to the occasion," Karim told the conclusion of a climate change workshop in the city. "If we cannot comprehend the dangers of the global climate change now, it could be catastrophic in future." At the workshop on "National Capacity Self-Assessment for Global Environmental Management", participants had earlier designed a set of recommendations to implement the three Rio Convention related to biodiversity, climate change and land degradation. They said saving the country's ecologically critical areas should be a top priority of the government. They also said cooperation among various government agencies should be strengthened. The Ministry of Environment and Forest and IUCN Bangladesh jointly organised the workshop. bd
