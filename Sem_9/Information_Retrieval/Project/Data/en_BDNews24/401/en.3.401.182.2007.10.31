<TITLE> Savour whisky like wine, the Glenmorangie way </TITLE>

 Miral Fahmy SINGAPORE, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) -- They're not about to turn whisky into wine, but Glenmorangie wants you to savour its single malt like one as the Scottish distillery seeks to broaden its appeal beyond the archetypal Western male luxury spirit drinker. Glenmorangie, part of the world's largest luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has renamed its flagship blend, reshaped its bottles and launched whiskies with wine-like flavours to attract the young and affluent, especially in Asia. "We're aiming to build on our roots to create something more modern that is more appealing and relevant to today," Frank Braillard, business development director for the Asia Pacific region, told Reuters during a recent tour to promote the brand. "We want people to focus less on our tradition and more on how this whisky tastes. It should be less relevant how old it is, and more relevant how it tastes." The quest for flavour has led the distillery to create three blends which are extra-matured in casks that previously held wines -- the Lastana in Spanish Oloroso sherry casks, the Quinta Ruban in port pipes from the Quintas wine estate in Portugal and the Nectar D'Or in French Sauternes wine barriques. "For years, single malt has been a niche market. We would like to expand beyond that," added Braillard. Asia's growing ranks of affluent, trendy youth hungry for the good life is one of the key markets Glenmorangie, along with most other international luxury brands, is targeting. The region, especially China, has long been a significant consumer of whisky, but mainly local blends and not the more luxurious -- and expensive -- single malts. Mixing green tea with your spirit was once popular, but Braillard said that trend was on the decline and more neutral mixers such as water or soda are now fashionable. "Asia is discovering whisky and some markets are literally on fire," he said, referring to China, Japan and Singapore among others. "People also want to drink better which, combined with the rising level of affluence, makes us believe that Asia is a great market." According to the 2006 International Wines and Spirits Report, the whisky market has been growing by 0.8 percent on an annual basis from 1997 to 2006 while Asia grew ahead at 2.58 percent. The malt whisky has been growing at 4.5 percent a year over the past 10 years globally. By comparison, the Asia Pacific region has been growing at a staggering 26 percent a year, accelerating at over 35 percent a year over the past four years. And in case you're wondering, its pronounced "Glen-MOR-anjee".
