 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Acting BNP chief M Saifur Rahman Tuesday played down his appointment to the top post and called for unity for the party to win the upcoming national elections. He said he had been steadfastly attached to his party since its inception and urged all to work together to help BNP win the polls. "We have to unite BNP. BNP will take part in the next election uniting nationalist force," Saifur said at a news briefing at his Gulshan home in the afternoon. "President Ziaur Rahman was my political leader. I have been in the party since 1977. Many of my fellow men left the party, but I continued to uphold the nationalist philosophy of the party. "We must work together so that BNP emerges winner in the next election," the former finance minister said. Accompanied by scores of party workers, Saifur placed wreath at the grave of president Zia. BNP leaders AHM Mofazzal Karim, ZA Khan, Osman Farruk, Abdul Alim and Ebadur Rahman Chowdhury were among the leaders. He claimed that he agreed to take responsibility of the party to honour the request of others. "My only goal is to unite the party and prepare it for the polls." He said getting appointed a leader somehow did not matter much and that what was more important was now to stay united and consolidate the nationalist forces. "It is not really a big issue who leads BNP today, our mission is to take forward and champion the late president Zia's philosophy. We must make efforts to keep BNP united and always remember that BNP is our party." The BNP standing committee late Monday night unanimously appointed Saifur acting chief and Hafizudddin Ahmed, secretary general. The veteran leader warned party men against conspiracies. "The country is passing through a transitional period. There might be elements lurking at home and abroad trying to breach our solidarity. That's why we have to stand united and save our nationalist fortress," he said. Saifur said the remarks of BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain were personal. "The party activities cannot remain suspended only for a person." Delwar earlier staked a claim to the post of secretary general and said the meeting of the standing committee was illegal. Saifur dismissed the claim. "It is not a matter of concern as to what is legal and what is illegal. Election process is going to begin soon. Any kind of feud within the party cannot be allowed to exist. We have to take the party forward in line with the ideology of Zia." He said he was grateful to the party standing committee and that he would carry out his responsibility with integrity. "Those who do not accept the standing committee decision do not have confidence in the party. The committee was nominated by the party chairperson Khaleda Zia," he said. Asked if there was a provision in the party constitution of acting chairman, the former finance minister said: "Constitution does not contain everything. The constitution was drafted in 1978. "The trend of politics changed. We have to move forward for the sake of the country and development in line with the current situation." "There is no dispute in Awami League but we are still divided. It must be removed. We have to move forward forgetting the past." Saifur asked party followers not to give in to fallacy. "Those who want to divide BNP do not belong to the party, they are against it," he added. The party leaders and workers also went up to Hafizuddin's Banani home and congratulated him on his joining office as the acting secretary general. Hafiz said the party would launch a legal fight to free Khaleda. "Our party chief will get justice and will return to us," he added. "All of us have to work altogether. No split will be promoted in the party from now. Chairperson Khaleda Zia is behind bars, but we cannot stop our activities. We have to ready BNP for the next polls." bdnews24
