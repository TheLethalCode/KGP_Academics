<TITLE> CFO goes as Alcatel Lucent reports another loss, more job cuts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Martyn Warwick LONDON, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) -- Heads are starting to roll at Alcatel Lucent as the troubled "marriage of equals" continues to head for the rocks. The company has released its Q3 figures Wednesday morning and dismal reading they make. Alcatel-Lucent posted a net loss of 258 million euros during the period compared to the 532 million euros profit posted for the same quarter in 2006. Turnover fell by 11 per cent to 4.35 billion euros, due, the company claims, "to lower investment in the mobile phone sector". Beleaguered CEO, Patricia Russo, says "market conditions remained difficult, with continued pressure on revenues and margins due to intensified competition and some slowdown of spending in North America." Just how long she can remain at the helm of this drifting ship has been the subject of much industry speculation for months past, but she remains in post today even as the CFO, Jean-Pascal Beaufret falls on his sword and leaves the company to, as the hoary old chestnut has it, "pursue other opportunities". Beaufret was one of the old guard and was CFO of Alcatel before the ill-fated merger. His replacement is Hubert de Pesquidoux who, until this morning headed-up Alcatel Lucent's enterprise division. Despite the abysmal numbers, Patricia Russo remains remarkably upbeat and claims that the company will see an increase in overall revenues over the course of the full financial year. Simultaneously with the departure of the CFO the company also announced a further five per cent cut to be imposed on its work force. An extra 4,000 jobs are to go. It is claimed that these redundancies will eventually save Alcatel Lucent some 400 million euros a year. In earlier axe-swinging exercises the company lopped 12,500 from the payroll. Patricia Russo says that with the re-organisation plan in place the company is to target gross margins in the high 30 per cent range and that in the "post-integration phase" (that has been one hell of a time coming and will not kick in until 2010) is looking to achieve operating margins of 10 per cent and above. Whether the CEO will be around to witness that happy day must remain a moot point. In an effort to fashion a trendy silk purse out of what is currently very much a sow's ear, Alcatel Lucent has streamlined its regional structure whilst Russo has set up a seven-man management committee to oversee the execution of the company's strategy and to create the "more focused and efficient operating model" that Alcatel Lucent so desperately needs. Only a few weeks ago, the board of Alcatel Lucent, in an effort to quash speculation about Ms. Russo's future pledged their full support to her. The months ahead will probably test that resolve to its limits. bdn
