 Dhaka, October 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion arrested Akhter Hamid Paban, son of embattled BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Tuesday night, hours after a Dhaka court issued an arrest warrant. Major Mahmud Hossain of RAB-4 confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. "Paban was arrested at Japan Garden City in Mohammadpur shortly after 9pm," he said. Also arrested was Paban's cousin Nahid, the RAB officer said. Paban was at the centre of a hunt by RAB officers for a cartel of Yaba peddlers, another RAB officer had earlier told bdnews24.com. The chief of RAB's media and legal affairs wing, Abul Kalam Azad, said: "Paban was named by other suspects who were arrested earlier." Azad alleged that Paban had links to most inbound shipments of Yaba, a combination of powerful and addictive stimulant methamphetamine and caffeine. An early arrest of two suspected extortionistsAnwar and Apu with a revolver and a pistolled to the detention of Paban as they named him as the "real user of the firearms". The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Tuesday issued the order to arrest Paban in a carjacking case. According to case details, Paban's associates on October 13, 2005 stole a car of businessman Kazi Mizanur Rahman, which was parked in front of Amin Court in Motijheel. Security forces retrieved the car and arrested him. A case was filed with Motijheel Police Station. Paban received bail from the High Court in the case on December 28, 2006. His father, Delwar, who was installed by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia as secretary general to keep the party up and running in her absence, has been removed from the post in line with a decision by the party's policymaking body. bd
