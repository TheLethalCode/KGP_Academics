 London, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - EBay division Skype and mobile phone group 3 said on Monday they have launched a mobile handset that allows users to access internet calls provider Skype while on the move. The companies said in a statement that the new 3 Skypephone would allow Skype users to make free calls to each other from the mobile and also send free Skype instant messages. In the UK, the phone will cost 49.99 pounds on a pay as you go basis, or free for 3 contract users. It will be on sale in 3's high street stores on Friday November 2. "Skype is now truly mobile. This new handset lets you make free mobile Skype calls when you are on the move to other Skype users all over the world," Skype acting CEO Michael van Swaaij said in a statement. Skype was bought by EBay for up to $4.3 billion in 2005 as the on-line auction site gambled on the fast-growing popularity of the web-based call service, although it wrote down $1.2 billion from the value at the start of this month. Skype has 246 million registered users.
