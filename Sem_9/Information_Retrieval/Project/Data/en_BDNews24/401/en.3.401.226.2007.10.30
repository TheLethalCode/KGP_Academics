<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Tuesday termed the changes in the BNP top brass a "midnight coup". His comment came to reporters at his Gulshan home Tuesday after a meeting with leaders and workers of the Krishak League, held to observe "Krishak Banchao, Desh Banchao (save farmers, save country) Day". Zillur said the changes in the BNP would not have any effect on the Awami League and added, "There is nothing to worry about. I am not yet clear about the matter." "BNP leaders Mr Delwar and Mr Hannan have disappeared from the scene. The matter will be clear after they make statements." He demanded a ban on all war criminals as well as religion-based parties, including the Jamaat-e-Islami. The AL leader said that though the government was claiming an adequate stock of fertiliser in the country, in reality, a crisis was prevailing. Zillur demanded subsidy on the agriculture sector and distribution of fertiliser on easy terms to increase production. bdnews24.
