 BAGHDAD, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber wearing an explosives belt killed 25 policemen and wounded 16 on Monday when he blew himself up inside a police base in the city of Baquba, police said. They said the bomber struck during a training session at the base in Baquba, 65 km (40 miles) north of Baghdad. Baquba is the capital of Diyala province, where al Qaeda and other Sunni Islamist militants as well as Shi'ite Muslim militias operate. The US military launched a major offensive against al Qaeda in Baquba this year. Baquba's police chief was among 26 people killed last month when a suicide bomber struck in a mosque compound where local Shi'ite and Sunni Arab leaders were holding reconciliation talks.
