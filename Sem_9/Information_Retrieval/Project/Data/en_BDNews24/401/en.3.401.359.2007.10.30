<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's Indian football coach Syed Nayeemuddin said the food trouble led Bangladesh to go 5-0 down against Tajikistan in the away match of the FIFA World Cup pre-qualifying round in Dushanbe. The Bangladesh national football team Tuesday returned home after playing a disastrous defeat against the Central Asian nation, who booked their qualifying seat on an aggregate 6-1 margin. "The boys suffered from food problem from the beginning in Tajikistan and they most of the time had puffed rice, taken from home, tomato and salads; even some players of the starting eleven went to play the match without having meal and it led them down physically," Nayeemuddin told reporters at the Bangladesh Football Federation Tuesday. With the food trouble, key midfielders Jahid Hossain and Maruf Ahmed sat on the sidelines due to stomach pains, he added. Nayeemuddin also alleged that they faced hostile attitude from the hotel employees and it didn't work despite letting the match commissioner know about the problems. Not only the hotel employees, the host booters also played rough against the visitors after having injured defenders Wali Faisal and Rajani Kanta Barman at very beginning of the match, said Nayeemuddin. The Indian coach also said that the hotel authority could not provide enough drinking water to the players, who even could not take their proper baths due to water crisis. The first half of the game ended in a goalless draw, but Bangladesh conceded three quick goals within five minutes after resuming the game and never stood tall against the physically fit Tajik players. For the loss, the coach also blamed the uneven pitch covered with long grass, hostile (chilly) weather in Tajikistan and the different kind of ball allotted for the game. "However, there was no lack of effort from the players, who tried hard till the last," said Nayeemuddin. bdn
