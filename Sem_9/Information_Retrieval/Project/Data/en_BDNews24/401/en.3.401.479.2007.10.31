<TEXT>
 PHILADELPHIA, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Democratic presidential contenders went on the attack Tuesday against front-runner Hillary Clinton, accusing her of shifting her positions for political convenience and saber-rattling against Iran. With Clinton holding a huge lead among Democrats in national opinion polls ahead of the November 2008 election, rivals Barack Obama, John Edwards, Chris Dodd, Bill Richardson and Joseph Biden all took turns aiming shots at the New York senator in hopes of bringing her back to the pack. Obama, who is running a distant second in polls to Clinton, said she had changed positions on trade, Iraq and Iran "whenever it's politically convenient." Edwards said she had flip-flopped on Social Security and Iraq, and helped President George W. Bush set the stage for war with Iran by voting for a Senate resolution labeling an Iranian military unit to be a terrorist group. "I think the American people, given this historic moment in our country's history, deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth, and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time," he said. Clinton defended her record in the Senate and the campaign trail as consistent. "I've been standing up against the Republicans on everything from preventing them from privatizing Social Security to standing up against President Bush's veto of children's health," she said. She said her vote on the Iranian resolution was aimed at building a "vigorous diplomacy" to rein in Iran's nuclear program. She rejected what she said was a "false choice" between a rush to war and doing nothing. "Many of us who voted for that resolution said that this is not anything other than an expression of support for using economic sanctions with respect to diplomacy," Clinton said. The debate at Drexel University in downtown Philadelphia was expected to produce fireworks as the Democrats try to overtake Clinton, who has opened up a huge lead in the national polls. Obama, an Illinois senator, has indicated several times, most recently over the weekend, that he intended to be tougher in criticizing Clinton, but had not significantly sharpened his tone until Tuesday
