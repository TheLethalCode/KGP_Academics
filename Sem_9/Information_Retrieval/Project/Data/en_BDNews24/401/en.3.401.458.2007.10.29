<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina did not respond to specific queries by investigators as she was "not informed" earlier, her lawyer said Monday. An Anticorruption Commission taskforce quizzed Hasina for about one and a half hours in special jail where she has been detained in connection with the power-plant graft case. Hasina's lawyer Toufique Newaz, who was present during the grilling, quoted the Awami League chief as saying: "I don't know what allegations have been made against me." "The former prime minister did not reply to any of the specific queries," Newaz told reporters at the gate to the Sangsad Bhaban Complex, where the special jail is located. Hasina's lawyer quoted his client as saying that she was not notified in advance about Monday's interrogation. "If I had received a notice I would have replied within two weeks, after consulting my lawyers and going through case papers," Newaz quoted Hasina as saying. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui had earlier told bdnews24.com: "An ACC team is conducting an investigation in the special jail." The four-member investigative team included ACC deputy director Morshed Alam and taskforce official Major Humayun. Prior to the ACC visit, Hasina's other lawyers Khandaker Moniruzzaman and Barrister Fazle Noor Tapash met their embattled client in special jail. The former prime minister Sunday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the validity of the graft case under the emergency powers rules. The case was filed with Tejgaon Police Station on September 2, and alleged that the accused had taken Tk 3 crore in 'donations' for the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust to approve three barge-mounted power plants. Anticorruption Commission deputy secretary SM Sabbir filed the case against seven people including Hasina and former energy secretary Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury. Also accused are former Power Development Board chairman Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal and Summit Group managing director Muhammad Aziz Khan. The case alleges the seven accused misused their power and colluded with one another to sign an agreement with Wartsila Power Development to install the three power plants, instead of selecting the lowest bidder. The case was included under the emergency powers rules on Sept 20. bdnews24.com/l
