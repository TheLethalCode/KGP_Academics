 LONDON, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal and Manchester United are neck and neck in England's Premier League after the Gunners drew impressively 1-1 at Liverpool and United thumped Middlesbrough 4-1 at home in weekend action. In Europe's other big leagues, unbeaten Bayern Munich's lead in Germany was reduced to four points when they were held 0-0 at Borussia Dortmund, while in France Olympique Lyon opened up a four-point lead with a 3-2 away win over Paris St Germain. ENGLAND Manchester United equalled a 100-year-old club record with a 4-1 victory over Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Saturday that put them top of the table for 24 hours until Arsenal drew 1-1 at Liverpool. The two, who clash in London next weekend, have 26 points, while Chelsea are back in the top four after a 6-0 thrashing of third-placed Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. It was their biggest league win for 10 years. Two goals from Carlos Tevez and one each for Nani and Wayne Rooney sealed the points for United and an eighth successive league victory. It is the first time since 1907 they have scored four goals in four consecutive matches. Arsenal answered any doubts about their ability to challenge for the title with a superb display at Liverpool. Cesc Fabregas cancelled out Steven Gerrard's early opener to put Arsenal ahead of United on goals scored. GERMANY Bayern Munich dropped points for only the third time this season in the Bundesliga when they were held to a goalless draw away to Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. Hamburg SV emerged as the closest challengers to the Bavarians after winning 1-0 away to Duisburg with a Vincent Kompany goal eight minutes before the end of the first half. That win was enough to take Hamburg up to second place, within four points of Bayern, after Werder Bremen drew 1-1 away to Schalke 04 and Karlsruhe were held 0-0 at Hansa Rostock on Saturday. With 11 games played, Bayern remain the only unbeaten team on 27 points. Hamburg have 23 points, Werder 21, Karlsruhe 20 and Schalke 18. FRANCE Olympique Lyon stretched their lead in Ligue 1 with a 3-2 win at Paris St Germain on Sunday courtesy of a Hatem Ben Arfa double and despite being a man down for most of the second half. The six-times French champions lead second-placed Nancy, who have a game in hand, by four points after the Lorraine side drew 0-0 at neighbours Metz on Saturday. Ben Arfa, 20, netted twice before halftime and Sidney Govou added a third five minutes from time. PSG's Portuguese striker Pauleta twice reduced the arrears after Lyon's Brazilian defender Anderson had been sent off in the 51st minute. Stade Rennes are third, also four points off the pace, following a 2-1 victory at struggling RC Lens. SPAIN Real Madrid needed late goals from Raul and Robinho to see off Deportivo Coruna 3-1 at home in the Primera Liga on Sunday and maintain their place at the top of the standings. Depor had taken the lead in the second minute, though Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly levelled from the penalty spot. Real have 22 points from nine games and are two ahead of arch-rivals Barcelona, who climbed to second with a comfortable 2-0 home win over promoted Almeria with a Thierry Henry strike and Lionel Messi penalty. Third-placed Villarreal and fourth-placed Valencia, both with 18 points, slipped to heavy defeats. Villarreal were hammered 4-1 at Real Zaragoza and Valencia proved no match for Sevilla, under debutant coach Manuel Jimenez, and went down 3-0. ITALY AS Roma were the big winners in Serie A after Mirko Vucinic's header secured a 1-0 win at beleaguered AC Milan, who had Massimo Ambrosini sent off and still have not won at home in the league this season. Despite missing the injured Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi fluffing a penalty, Roma moved up to second after Fiorentina had to settle for a 0-0 draw at Genoa and Juventus lost 3-1 at Napoli on Saturday. Juve were furious at Napoli being awarded two highly controversial penalties which Maurizio Domizzi converted in the second half after the match had been evenly poised at 1-1. Roma are three points behind leaders Inter Milan, who have 21 points after a 0-0 draw at Palermo. Fiorentina and Juventus have 17 points, while AC Milan are 13th with 10. NETHERLANDS PSV Eindhoven went top with a 4-1 win at Sparta Rotterdam on Sunday following former leaders Feyenoord's 2-0 defeat at Twente Enschede the day before. Kenneth Perez set up Danko Lazovic for PSV's first goal after 37 seconds, Mike Zonneveld and Jefferson Farfan hit the back of the net with long-distance strikes before the break and Perez added a fourth in the second half. PSV have 23 points after nine matches, two more points than Ajax Amsterdam, who won 1-0 at Utrecht, and Feyenoord
