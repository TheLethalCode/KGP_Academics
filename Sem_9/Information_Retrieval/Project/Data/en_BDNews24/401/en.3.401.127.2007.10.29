<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (BUET) wants one more week to test the debris of the Bangabandhu National Stadium press box that collapsed October 8. "The BUET has wanted another week for the laboratory test on the debris of the collapsed press box, and we hope the enquiry report gets a good shape in the next 10 days," said Aminul Islam, secretary of the National Sports Council (NSC). The press box roof collapsed some time after the World Cup pre-qualifying match between Bangladesh and Tajikistan on October 8, and the NSC formed an enquiry committee that submitted its preliminary report the next day. The committee, however, said that it would put in the final report October 31 as it had sent samples of the collapsed roof to the BUET and the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST) for laboratory tests. The BUET reopened October 24 following Durga Puja holiday. "We expect the MIST report in our hands before the BUET report, and hope to complete the final report in the next 10 to 12 days," said Abdur Rahman, chief of the five-member enquiry committee. bdn
