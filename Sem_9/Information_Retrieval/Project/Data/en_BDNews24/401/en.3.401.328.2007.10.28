 MADRID, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Mallorca held Espanyol to an an entertaining 2-2 draw in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Last year's UEFA Cup finalists Espanyol came into the game on the back of a four-match winning streak having ended leaders Real Madrid's unbeaten start to the season last week. Ariel Ibagaza's quickly taken freekick allowed Venezuela striker Juan Arango to volley Mallorca in front after just two minutes, but Espanyol were soon back in contention. Luis Garcia's freekick in the 21st minute flew off Arango's head into the top corner of his own net, and five minutes later Raul Tamudo tumbled under a challenge from Mallorca defender Sergio Ballesteros for a penalty. Ballesteros was sent off and Spain striker Tamudo scored from the spot. Espanyol were themselves reduced to 10 men when Clemente Rodriguez received his marching orders early in the second half and Mallorca levelled in the 69th when striker Daniel Guiza controlled a long pass in the area, turned and scored. Espanyol stay fifth with 17 points from nine games, while Mallorca climb to sixth with 15. In the late game, Athletic Bilbao made all the running but could not find a way past Real Betis and drew 0-0 at home. Real Madrid host Deportivo Coruna on Sunday when Barcelona are at home to promoted Almeria. Sevilla coach Manuel Jimenez takes charge for the first time since the departure of Juande Ramos, named Tottenham Hotspur manager on Saturday, when Valencia visit the Sanchez Pizjuan
