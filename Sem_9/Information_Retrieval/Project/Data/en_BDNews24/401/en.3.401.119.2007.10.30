<TITLE> No deal by Japan PM, opposition on Afghan mission </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and the leader of Japan's main opposition party failed at a meeting on Tuesday to break a stalemate over a naval mission backing US-led Afghan operations, but they agreed to meet again. Fukuda is struggling against a newly confident opposition to enact a bill to enable Japan's navy to keep providing fuel for US and other ships patrolling the Indian Ocean for drug runners, gun smugglers and terrorists -- a role Washington says is vital for Tokyo to play in the battle against terrorism. Failure to end the stalemate with opposition parties, which won control of parliament's upper house in a July poll, could even spark a snap election for the powerful lower chamber, something ruling party lawmakers are keen to avoid. "Unfortunately, we did not reach an agreement today," Fukuda told reporters after meeting Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa. Officials from the ruling and opposition camps said Fukuda and Ozawa might meet again on Friday or over the weekend. "We have to make efforts to find some common point, so we agreed to meet (again)," said Fukuda, who had requested the unusual political summit. A Japanese supply ship on Monday conducted its last refuelling operation under current legislation, which expires on Nov. 1. "The prime minister asked for cooperation on the special terrorism law," said Ozawa, who objects to the naval mission in part because he says it lacks a formal UN mandate. "But discussions proceeded in parallel," he added. SCANDAL COMPLICATIONS Fukuda's predecessor, Shinzo Abe, resigned suddenly last month after a year in office plagued by scandals and gaffes among cabinet ministers, saying he hoped to clear the way for extending the naval mission. But prospects for doing so have been further complicated by a scandal involving a former No. 2 at Japan's defence ministry. Former Vice Minister Takemasa Moriya admitted in parliament on Monday that he had wrongly played golf with and accepted gifts from a defence contractor for more than a decade. But he denied doing favours in return. The Democrats and their smaller opposition allies, who can delay legislation in the upper house, have vowed to vote against the mission and hope to use the scandal to boost voter opposition to its extension -- and perhaps prompt a general election. Moriya also said politicians -- including an ex-defence minister -- had been present when he was wined and dined by the company executive, but he declined to identify the politicians. Opposition lawmakers and Japanese media said the testimony had not laid the scandal to rest and the Democrats suggested that Moriya -- dubbed by some a "shadow defence minister" -- might be called to testify again. "To continue to be wined and dined for a lengthy period of more than 10 years without seeking anything in return is inconceivable in the ordinary run of things," said the Nikkei business daily in an editorial entitled "Suspicions have deepened further with Mr Moriya's sworn testimony". The Yomiuri newspaper, however, echoed the government stance that the scandal was a separate matter from the naval mission. "It is important to press hard to uncover the truth, but Moriya's case should be regarded as a separate issue from the deliberations on a new antiterrorism bill," it said in an editorial.
