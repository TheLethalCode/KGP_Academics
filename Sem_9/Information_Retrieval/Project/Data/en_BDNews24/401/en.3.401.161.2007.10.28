 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday said independence of the media does not mean that journalists have the right to report in any way they choose. "Journalists have an increased responsibility to serve the public," Mainul said in his address to a seminar on the role of the media in areas of conflict, which was also attended by senior editors and columnists from South Asia at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. The two-day Senior Editors' Conference for 2007 pulled in 22 journalists from Saarc member countries. Mainul said political leaders from Saarc nations had long since agreed on the importance of the free flow of information in strengthening cross-border cooperation and security. Mainul said: "I urge political parties to avoid clashing with one another and expect journalists to assist in this." Mainul went on to say that it was reasonable for journalists to expect some level of risk when covering wars or other conflicts. "Neither the Geneva Convention nor any other attempt to safeguard people is perfect," said the adviser. The Mass Communication and Journalism Department of Dhaka University organised the conference in conjunction with the Press Institute of Bangladesh and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Finn Ruda, head of ICRC's Bangladesh mission, said journalists and the mass communication sector as a whole have a great ability to form public opinion in the sub-continent. Ruda told reporters: "Help bring change to many policies and strategies in future. The profession can also play a positive role in reducing the impact of conflict on victims of war." ICRC communication coordinator Philippe Stoll said: "Although not everyone is affected, many are victims of ongoing conflict in the sub-continent." "If accurate information can be collected on the impact of conflicts, the state can take the initiative to resolve any problems, in this way reporters can help the common people," Stoll said. Journalists from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Afghanistan and the Maldives took part in the seminar, titled, "Report of the Mass Media: Armed Conflict and Attack". bdnews24.
