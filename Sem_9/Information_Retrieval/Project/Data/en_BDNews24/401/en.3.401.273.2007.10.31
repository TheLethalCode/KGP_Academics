 CANBERRA, Tue Oct 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's military will ask 90,000 soldiers for DNA blood samples to help identify troops as the country prepares for more deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan. After two soldiers were killed by the Taliban in Afghanistan over the last month, Australian commanders on Wednesday said voluntary DNA collection would begin as soon as possible for 3,500 Australian soldiers currently deployed overseas "as a result of recent operational experience". "What that'll allow us to do is to enable rapid and positive identification of deceased remains that can't otherwise be identified by traditional forensic methods, such as dental or fingerprint evidence," Australian Defence Force spokesman Brigadier Andrew Nikolic said. Australia, a close US ally, was one of the first nations to commit troops in late 2001 to the US-led war to oust the Taliban and al Qaeda militants from Afghanistan. It also has about 1,500 troops in and around Iraq. The decision comes amidst campaigning for a November 24 national election, marked by popular opposition to Canberra's military role in both the Iraq war and Afghanistan. An Australian soldier died on October 8 when his armored vehicle was demolished by a Taliban roadside bomb in the southern Afghanistan province of Uruzgan, where almost 1,000 Australian soldiers alongside Dutch troops on security and reconstruction. An elite Australian special forces commando was also shot dead in a firefight with Taliban on October 25 during a sweep of militia strongholds in the Chora Valley. That assault was continuing with around 50 Taliban killed and a dozen more captured during an Australian-led operation codenamed Spin Ghar, or White Mountain, over the weekend, local newspapers reported. DNA REPOSITORY Nikolic said the DNA blood samples would build a bank of identifying material for all 90,000 regular and reserve soldiers in the country's military. "An interim DNA repository is being set up right now and that'll cater for those personnel considered most at risk, for examples those deploying to the Middle East area of operations," Nikolic told local radio. Conservative Prime Minister John Howard last week promised to review the role of Australian combat troops in Iraq as he battles polls showing near-certain defeat. Howard's Labor opponent, Kevin Rudd, has pledged to withdraw combat troops from Iraq but keep soldiers in Afghanistan. Opinion polls show Australians are widely opposed to both wars and have begun to lose faith in Howard's tough security stance, which has won him previous elections. The Australian Defence Association defence lobby group said DNA tests would help speed up the identification process in case several troops were killed together in a roadside bomb blast or firefight with insurgents. "About two-thirds of our diggers in World War One are buried in unmarked graves because they weren't able to be identified at the point of burial," Executive Director Neil James said. Taliban insurgents have been intensifying their attacks over the past 20 months, the bloodiest period since the US-led troops overthrew the Taliban government in Kabul in late 2001. Last month, three Australians were wounded during a firefight with Taliban forces near Tarin Kowt, also in Uruzgan provin
