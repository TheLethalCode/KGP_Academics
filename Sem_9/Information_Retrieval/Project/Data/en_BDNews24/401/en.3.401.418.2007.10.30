 NAIROBI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali pirates captured another foreign cargo vessel off Mogadishu port and seized its crew in the second attack since the weekend along one of the world's most dangerous coastlines, a maritime official said on Tuesday. News of the second hijack emerged as the US Navy said coalition forces patrolling the Red Sea region had opened fire on pirates who seized a chemical tanker on Sunday, destroying speedboats they typically use in their raids. The East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme said the second ship taken on Monday or early Tuesday was North Korean and had 22 crew members on board. Another source said the ship was carrying sugar from Brazil. "It looks like there was some sort of dispute near the port. It could be some business that went sour, but we are still checking for the full details," said Andrew Mwangura, head of the Kenyan-based seafarers' association. "The situation is getting really bad in those waters." A senior Somali police source said Somali forces were giving chase to the seized ship. "We are still after the hijacked ship. We have three boats and around 30 soldiers on board and we are around 10 miles away from it," the officer told Reuters. NAVAL FORCES OPEN FIRE On Sunday, pirates hijacked a Japanese-owned chemical tanker flying the Panamanian flag off Somalia with 23 people on board. The U.S. Navy said on Tuesday coalition naval forces belonging to Combined Task Force 150 had pursued the pirates into Somali waters and opened fire, destroying speedboats the seized vessel had in tow that were used in the raid. "CTF-150 responded to a distress call from the tanker Golden Nory, warning shots were fired and the skiffs in tow were engaged and sunk," a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said by telephone from Bahrain. There were no reports of any casualties. He said coalition forces had opened fire in the Gulf of Aden. "The operation is ongoing (to recover the ship) and there are indications a number of pirates are still on board," the spokesman said, adding that a number of battle ships were in the area and monitoring developments. Mwangura said the Golden Nory was carrying the inflammable and toxic chemical, benzene, and was being held off the northern Somali province of Puntland. The U.S. Navy said it was aware of reports of a second hijack in the region but could not confirm it had taken place. Four other boats -- a Comoros-registered cargo ship, two Tanzanian fishing vessels, and a ship from Taiwan -- are also being held by armed groups. Without central government since 1991, Somalia's waters have become among the world's most perilous despite calls for international action to patrol them. Piracy off Somalia dropped briefly last year during a six-month period in which most of the south was ruled by a hardline Islamist movement. Incidents rose again since the sharia courts movement was toppled in Mogadishu at New Year. Attackers often justify their actions as measures against illegal fishing and toxic dumping. Mwangura said the recent upsurge in attacks off Somalia may be a response to threats by the UN Security Council and others to take action against piracy. "These people are sending out a message of defiance," he said. "The Security Council was talking about this problem a few weeks ago, but has taken no actio
