 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks ended lower for the third day Tuesday as investors continued to lock in their profits in shares that recorded gains in previous rallies. "Corrections are always good for the market, although they may hurt new investors' more than old ones," said Shairf Ataur Rahman, who has been involved in the market for 30 years. The market recovered some losses in the morning trade but started a slow decline in the face of profit taking by both institutional and retail investors toward closing. The main DGEN or general index fell 7.09 points or 0.24 percent to end on 2855.36. The DSI or all-share price index slumped 29.66 points or 1.21 percent to finish on 2404.88. The decline was supported by a fall in the shares of Rupali Bank, the biggest share by market capitalisation. Rupali Bank slid 16.27 percent to Tk 2511.25 after the government gave a November deadline to its highest bidder, Bandar Bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, to finalise the takeover deal. The DSE-20 blue-chip index lost 29.42 points or 1.31 percent to end on 2211.20. "On one hand I feel the need for more correction: on the other hand I feel the prices of issues are not being firmly anchored. Indeed, in some cases they are surpassing their previous levels," said Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of Imtiyaz Husain Securities. "A number of investors are cashing in their gains in preparation for up-coming public offers," added Husain. Of the issues traded, 103 advanced, 102 dropped and 14 held steady. A total of 14,112,264 shares, worth Tk 2.02 billion, changed hands. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh headed the turnover table, adding 3.63 percent to end on Tk 627. Other power sector issues, including Summit Power and DESCO declined. Trust Bank continued its fall from the previous day, loosing 3.19 percent to finish at Tk 1091.50. BRAC Bank, however, recovered some losses, adding 1.05 percent to end on Tk 1491. Islami Bank declined for the second day following an announcement that it had not taken any decision on converting its book value to Tk 100 from Tk 1000. Islami Bank ended at Tk 5469.50, down 5.34 percent. Eastern Bank dropped 3.02 percent to finish on Tk 1059.25. Social Investment Bank continued its rise. Life insurance issues also advanced, led by Fareast Islami Life Insurance. Most pharmaceutical stocks declined, with Beximco Pharma the biggest loser. All indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also fell, with 42 issues advancing, 72 loosing and 10 holding steady. Turnover on the bourse stood at Tk 373.36 million from 148,168 traded shares. bd
