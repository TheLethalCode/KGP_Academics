<TITLE> Thais urged to stop Hmong refugee deportation plan </TITLE>

 BANGKOK, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the sole medical provider to 7,500 ethnic Hmong at a Thai refugee camp, urged Bangkok on Wednesday not to force them to return home to communist Laos, saying they faced persecution. MSF said it wanted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to be allowed to screen the Hmong at the camp in the northern province of Petchabun before any are repatriated. Its Thai mission chief Gilles Isard said the Hmong, who say they are persecuted in Laos because their parents and relatives sided with America in the Vietnam War, were threatened every day "with an imminent return" to their country. "This not only violates international standards on repatriation of refugees, but shows a basic disrespect for the dignity and safety of people who are living in fear," Isard said in a statement. A government spokesman said Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont had told visiting Lao Defence Minister Thongban Sangapohn on Wednesday there would be no forced repatriation. Last month, Thailand and Laos agreed to repatriate the Hmong before the end of 2008 without any independent screening. Thailand says they are the victims of human traffickers who are charging huge fees to smuggle them into Thailand so they might be resettled in the United States. Bangkok said on Wednesday its own screening was transparent. "The local screening process is being done in an open and transparent manner, in which the UNHCR has been regularly informed," Foreign Ministry spokesman Tharit Charungvat said. The U.N. refugee office in Bangkok does not agree. "We have repeatedly offered our expertise to the Thai government if they would like our advice on how to uphold international standard. They have never replied," spokeswoman Kitty McKinsey said. "The whole point about the people at Petchabun is that they have never been screened to determine who among them might be legitimate refugees, who might need international protection." McKinsey said Thailand had also made little progress with another batch of UN-registered Hmong refugees -- 59 adults and 90 children -- kept at an immigration detention centre in Nongkhai province bordering Laos since January. "There is no reason for them to be kept in detention because we do have places for them in third countries and they could easily go and start their lives over again, instead of languishing in detention in Thailand," she sa
