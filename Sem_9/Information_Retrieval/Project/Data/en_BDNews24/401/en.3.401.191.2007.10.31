<TITLE> Zimbabwe white farmers' trial postponed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The trial of white Zimbabwean farmers charged with resisting eviction from land targeted for seizure was on Wednesday postponed to December after the state failed to present documents requested by defence lawyers. President Robert Mugabe's government embarked on a drive in 2000 to take commercial farms from whites to resettle landless blacks. An estimated 600 out of the previous 4,500 white farmers now remain on the land. Eleven white farmers from Zimbabwe's northwestern Mahsonaland West province, who appealed against eviction notices issued by the government, now face trial for failing to leave the farms after a Sept. 30 deadline lapsed. They have been charged under the gazetted land act for failing to vacate farmland marked for acquisition by the government. They stand accused and it remains to be seen if the prosecution will seek to place them in custody. If convicted, the farmers face heavy fines or jail terms of up to two years. "The trial cannot kick off because the lands office didn't supply the state with the necessary papers requested by the defence counsel," prosecutor Allen Chifokoyo told the court. "The state is unable to proceed into trial today and will, with the consent of the defence, ask for the accused to be remanded to December 17." Critics say Mugabe's controversial land policy has plunged the southern African country -- once a food exporter -- into a severe economic crisis marked by food shortages and the highest inflation in the world above 7,900 percent. Mugabe says his land seizure drive was meant to correct colonial imbalances that saw a few white farmers owning the bulk of the country's prime farmland. The trial of the first farmer, which was supposed to start on Wednesday, was delayed because the lands ministry failed to provide information requested by defence lawyers. Defence lawyer David Drury had asked the prosecution to provide information from the state land allocation committee detailing how the farms in question were targeted for seizure, before the trial could begin.
