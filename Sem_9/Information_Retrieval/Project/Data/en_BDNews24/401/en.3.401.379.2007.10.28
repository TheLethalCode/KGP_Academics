 PARIS, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is preparing an official visit to France, a French government official said on Sunday, in what would be the former pariah's first state visit to Paris in over 30 years. French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche earlier reported the visit would take place in December. Citing a diplomatic source, the paper said the trip would take place before or after an European Union-Africa summit in Lisbon on Dec. 8-9. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office confirmed a visit was being arranged but did not give a precise date. "The President of the Republic went to Libya in July, so it is quite normal that the Libyan leader should do the same thing," said a government official. Sarkozy signed a defence accord and a memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy deal during his July trip. Days later, the French government announced Libya would buy anti-tank missiles and radio systems from European aerospace and defence group EADS. It denied allegations the arms deal was a trade-off for the release, hours before Sarkozy's arrival in Libya, of a group of foreign medics held in jail for eight years for allegedly infecting Libyan children with HIV. Sarkozy had sent his then-wife Cecilia on two missions to Libya to seek their release -- irritating EU officials who felt he was ignoring their own negotiating efforts -- and the medics left Libya with her on a French presidential jet. Libya, rich in oil and gas reserves, has been rehabilitating itself with western powers after years of isolation following the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, which cost 270 lives. Libyan intelligence agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was found guilty of the bombing by a Scottish court in 2001. He has always said he is innocent and won the right in June to launch a second appeal against his conviction. The country is a potential growth market for many western companies, and Le Journal du Dimanche said important French business deals could be signed during Gaddafi's trip. Outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair unveiled a gas deal between oil major BP Plc and Libya in May. The paper said France might try to strike a maintenance deal for 15 Mirage F1 fighter planes currently used by the Libyan air force, and might try to sell Libya the Rafale combat jet. Both planes are made by French group Dassault Aviation. It said Libya and France might also seek deals on nuclear energy and water treatment, while another option might be for Libya to buy stakes in leading French companies. Libya was elected this month along with four other countries to a two-year term on the United Nations Security Counc
