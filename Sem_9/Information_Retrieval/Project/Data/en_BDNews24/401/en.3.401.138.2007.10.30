<TITLE> Britain underestimates number of foreign workers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Labour government set off a political storm on Monday by acknowledging it had underestimated the number of foreign nationals who had come to work in the country in the last 10 years by 300,000. The opposition Conservatives released a letter from Work and Pensions Secretary Peter Hain in which he apologised for having given them wrong information. New analysis of labour market data showed that, instead of 800,000, "there are, in total, an extra 1.1 million foreign nationals in employment in the UK since 1997," Hain wrote. Hain's department confirmed the upwards revision which it said was due to "a more rigorous definition of foreign national workers". Between 7 and 8 percent of the 29.1 million people in work in Britain were foreign nationals, it said. Immigration has become a hot political issue in Britain with some people fearing that the fast pace of migration has put severe strain on housing, education and health services. Conservative work and pensions spokesman Chris Grayling called Hain's revision "an extraordinary development" that cast doubt on the government's competence. "The fact that the government did not know the true number of overseas workers who have come to the UK in the past 10 years is profoundly worrying, and confirms fears that ministers have simply lost control of our systems for migrant workers," he said in a statement. Opposition Liberal Democrat employment spokesman Danny Alexander said: "Getting these figures so wrong further undermines the credibility of the government's claims to be able to deliver a well-managed system for foreign workers." CALL FOR ANNUAL LIMIT Hain's admission came on the day that Conservative leader David Cameron called for annual limits on migration to Britain from countries outside the European Union. A projection from Britain's statistics office last week showed the population is set to grow from 60.6 million last year to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031, with immigration a key factor. Policymakers say a large influx of migrants in recent years has helped boost economic growth while competition from east European workers has helped keep wage inflation in check, easing the pressure for higher British interest rates. Critics argue that immigrants are taking jobs from Britons -- although some business executives dispute this. Employment Minister Caroline Flint said Britain's labour market remained in very good health. "There are opportunities for British workers with nearly 660,000 vacancies waiting to be filled," she said. Britain was one of three EU members that granted open access to workers from eight east European countries that joined the bloc in 2004, but it restricted migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania when they joined the EU in January. The government is expected to announce on Tuesday it will extend those restrictions. The government is also introducing an Australian-style points-based system for migrants from outside the EU next year. It would restrict entry to those who have the skills that Britain needs.
