 BANGKOK, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Notorious Golden Triangle drug lord and one-time Shan freedom fighter Khun Sa has died after a long illness, a former associate and the top Shan rebel leader said on Tuesday.

"But when the people he was supposed to be leading or liberating didn't accept his leadership, he turned his back on them." Khuensai said Khun Sa had been cremated in Yangon, the former Burma's main city, on Tuesday and his ashes would probably be scattered around the Bay of Bengal rather than being returned to his ancestral home in the Shan hills of eastern Myanmar.
