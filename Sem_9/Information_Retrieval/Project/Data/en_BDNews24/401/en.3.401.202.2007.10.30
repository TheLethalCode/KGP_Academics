 WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and John Edwards sharpened their attacks on Monday on rival front-runner Hillary Clinton as they sought to keep her within striking distance. While Clinton has a big lead in national polls, her advantage in the early voting state of Iowa is only slight. A University of Iowa Hawkeye poll gave her 28.9 percent support in Iowa, to 26.6 percent to Obama and 20 percent to Edwards. Iowa is important because its caucuses on Jan. 3 are the first actual contest of the November 2008 election and the winner there can claim momentum for the campaign battles ahead. Obama has largely held back from attacking Clinton, but with his large donor base worried that he has not made a move, has decided to step up the attacks. At a town hall meeting in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Illinois senator accused Clinton of refusing to say how she would strengthen the Social Security retirement system for older Americans, arguing that she represents conventional thinking in Washington that needs changing. "She's not alone in ducking the issue, of course. Because conventional thinking in Washington says Social Security is the third rail of American politics. It says you should hedge, dodge, and spin, but at all costs, don't answer," Obama said. Edwards, a former North Carolina senator, accused Clinton of being in the pocket of special interests in Washington by accepting campaign contributions from lobbyists. "It's time to tell the truth. And, the truth is the system in Washington is corrupt. It is rigged by the powerful special interests to benefit the very few at the expense of the many. "And, as a result, the American people have lost faith in our broken system in Washington, and believe it no longer works for ordinary Americans," Edwards said in Manchester, New Hampshire. The attacks set the stage for what could be a combative Democratic debate on Tuesday night in Philadelphia. The Clinton campaign rejected the sharp rhetoric coming from the New York senator's top rivals. "It's interesting that the two candidates who helped make their name by pledging to be positive and sunny have now gone down this path of attack politics," said Clinton spokesman Phil Singer. Obama and Clinton engaged in dueling campaign advertisements in Iowa, Obama arguing that Social Security will not be repaired until politicians engage in a "real honest conversation" about how to fix it. Clinton responded with an ad defending her record on Social Security, saying that when President George W Bush tried to allow Americans to use the stock market to build a retirement plan, "Hillary was there fighting every step of the way to stop him."
