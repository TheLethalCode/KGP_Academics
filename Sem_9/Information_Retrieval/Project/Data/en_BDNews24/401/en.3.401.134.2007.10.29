<TITLE> UK envoy wary of foreign investment shift over delayed decisions </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury Sunday warned that foreign investors could shift to other places if the government delayed decision-making. Foreign investments are at a standstill as pent-up decisions continue to mount, Choudhury said. "Investors are now unclear about the future. They lose patience and go elsewhere or stay adding up costs, which will eventually have to be recovered," he said. The UK envoy made the remarks at a monthly luncheon meeting of the Foreign Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry, also attended by Asian Development Bank's country director Hua Du. FICCI president Masih ul Karim chaired the programme. Choudhury's comments came as the government shelved decisions on big foreign investment proposals such as TATA. The Indian business giant with a proposal of $3 billion in power, coal and fertiliser has been waiting for the green light from the government since 2006. "A decision paralysis is the order of the day," the British envoy said. The UK is one of the largest foreign investment sources for Bangladesh. Currently, UK firms have a total of $4 billion investment here ranging from energy to security services. Another $2 billion investment is underway, he said. "We, foreign friends, are ready to invest as we see the country's potentialities since prosperity is the best guarantee to democracy and stability," he said. "Bangladesh's political transformation has to be underpinned by business and investment." The envoy, referring to the ongoing anticorruption crackdown, said there were 'unmatched' actions on corruption. "In fact there seem to be strategic action on everything but trade and investment, and at a time when trade and investment are seen to be suffering from unforeseen and paradoxical consequences," he said. "The anticorruption drive has upset the old ways, the old system of understanding, and this has led to near collapse in business confidence as people sit on the fence to discover how and if the new system will work and sustain." He warned the GDP growth might drop by about 2 percentage points this fiscal. "The action is still slow, so a decisive strategy is urgently needed to boost the confidence of businesses and accelerate the pace of the economic development," Choudhury said. bdne
