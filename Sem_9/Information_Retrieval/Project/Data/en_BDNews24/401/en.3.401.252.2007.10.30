<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell by midday on Tuesday as disappointing results from KPN weighed on telecoms and lower crude and metal prices hit commodity stocks ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting expected to yield a US interest rate cut. At 1145 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.36 percent at 1,582.57 points, breaking a three-day winning streak as investors took profits ahead of the rate decision. KPN , a Dutch telecoms group, dropped 5 percent to figure among top European losers after third-quarter earnings per share missed expectations due to a higher tax charge. The fall also hit stock in peer Vodafone, which fell 1.6 percent. Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro and French tyremaker Michelin kept KPN company at the top of the decliners list, falling 6 percent as updates disappointed. But strategists said that the overall picture for equities was still strong. "People are more worried about results than needed -- I see strong Asian growth going through into 2008 and this should help European equities," said Tuomas Komulainen, strategist at Danske Market Securities in Helsinki. "We think the earnings disappointments will be more in U.S. equities. Valuations are still a positive factor in Europe, all of which makes European equities our preferred asset class ahead of other equities and of bonds." Heavyweight oil shares fell, with BP and Shell both losing 1.1 percent, as crude prices fell $1.20 a barrel, while mining stocks were hit by lower copper prices and India-focused miner Vedanta fell 4 percent on talk that it was revising down its profit expectations. The company was not immediately available to comment. The U.S. Federal Reserve begins a rate-setting meeting later in the day and is due to unveil its decision on Wednesday, with many analysts expecting a 25 basis point cut. "Everyone is waiting for the Fed and everyone is basically expecting the Fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point. Everything else would be a surprise," said Susanne Lahmann, strategist at Bremer Landesbank in Bremen, Germany. "Too much or too little of a move would probably be poison for equity markets," she said. A Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday said a cut is no sure thing and officials are not seriously considering a half-point reduction. THIN-SKINNED RECOVERY A crunch in credit markets sparked by bad investments in risky US mortgages took European equities down by 13 percent in one month from mid-July. Stocks have recovered since then, coaxed higher by a hefty US rate cut in September. European shares are now about 6.7 percent higher on the year but the recovery has been sensitive to any bad news from banks on their exposure to the subprime crisis. Swiss wealth manager UBS fell 1.1 percent as the after it reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter loss after hefty writedowns on subprime-related investments, but said it expects to turn in a group profit in the last quarter. A possible delay of the completion of the Altadis takeover weighed on Imperial Tobacco, the world's fourth-largest cigarette group, down 1.2 percent. On the upside, French construction and concessions group Vinci rose 2.7 percent on market talk that French investor Francois Pinault has lifted its stake in the firm to 15 percent. French wines and spirits group Pernod Ricard added 1.6 percent on forecast-beating first-quarter results, benefiting from rising sales in the booming economies of China and India. But Linde, the world's largest industrial gases producer, fell 2.1 percent despite posting strong results as investors took profits after an impressive recent run in the sto
