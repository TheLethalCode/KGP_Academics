 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has slipped 15 places to 107 in 2007 from 92 in 2006 in the worldwide ranking in terms of competitive edge, according to Global Competitiveness Report 2007. Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of nongovernmental think-tank, the Centre for Policy Dialogue, Wednesday launched the World Economic Forum report on a survey of competitiveness perceived by top executives of business organisations in 131 countries. Corruption, inefficient government bureaucracy, inadequate supply of infrastructure and policy instability have been blamed to have affected the country's business environment, he said. The WEF assessed competitiveness in 125 countries in 2006. "Our ranking has also slid by six places to 98 if we exclude the new countries covered under GCR 2007," he added. The GCI 2007, which also includes Business Competitiveness Index, was based on 12 indicators such as institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic stability and, health and primary education. The survey found that Bangladesh ranked lower on all indicators. The country also slipped to 118 from 99 in the BCI ranking, according WEF. Bangladesh's positions in other global business indices such as Doing Business Index 2007 and Corruption Perception Index 2007 also worsened. "It's frustrating," he said. According to the GCI, Bangladesh appears among the bottom 10 countries when it comes to institutions, higher education and training and technological readiness. But it ranks relatively better in case of market size, financial market sophistication and labour market efficiency, the CPD executive director said. "It will be a mistake if we take a major decision based on these indicators. But keeping this information in mind will be a smart thing to do," he said. "It will give you indications as to where you have to hit." The GCI 2007 for Bangladesh was prepared taking perception of 99 top executives of business firms with a capital of Tk 100 million. The CPD official, citing its Business Environment Survey, also said business environment shows poor performances. He put this down to a "very low" level of public trust about financial honesty of politicians, government officials favouring well-connected firms and individuals, ineffective national parliament and wasteful public spending. b
