<TITLE> Ukraine "orange" govt on course: president's allies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Backers of President Viktor Yushchenko said on Tuesday plans remained on course to form a liberal "orange" government and dismissed any notion that defectors could allow their rivals to take power. Two parties linked to the 2004 "Orange Revolution" won a tiny majority in last month's parliamentary election and have agreed to form a coalition government with former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko restored in her old job. News reports have, however, suggested that some members of the pro-presidential Our Ukraine party would break away and form a "broad coalition", including the president's arch rival, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. But Our Ukraine leaders told a news conference they wanted the new parliament to begin meeting on Nov. 15 and would uphold their coalition agreement with Tymoshenko's bloc. "Deputies from Our Ukraine...through their executive bodies, have unanimously confirmed their intention to create a majority with the Yulia Tymoshenko bloc," said Yuri Lutsenko, head of a group that ran on the same ticket with Our Ukraine. "There is no other news. And no need to comment on meetings between the president and other political forces. Let me simply tell our citizens: Don't worry. Everything will be just fine." Our Ukraine and the Tymoshenko bloc won between them 228 of 450 seats -- two more than needed to win most votes in what is often a fractious parliament. Tymoshenko, who sealed a reconciliation with the president in the campaign, says the president backs the proposal of both parties to put her back in the premier's seat. Yanukovich's Regions Party took first place, but has insufficient support for a majority. He backs a "broad coalition", including his party, to bridge the traditional divide between the nationalist west and Russian-speaking east. The president had since the election called for Yanukovich's allies to be given top government jobs, while steering clear of all talk of a "broad coalition". News reports have said some Our Ukraine members, deeply suspicious of Tymoshenko, could break away and produce just such a coalition, allowing Yanukovich to remain in office. Tymoshenko stood alongside Yushchenko in the mass 2004 rallies over poll fraud that led to his election victory over Yanukovich and within weeks she was named prime minister. But she was fired within eight months and mistrust dogged her relations with the president until late in the campaign. Yanukovich became prime minister following a parliamentary election last year after some "orange" supporters changed sides and handed him a majority. He and the president fought for months over a division of powers, prompting Yushchenko to dissolve parliament and call the new election.
