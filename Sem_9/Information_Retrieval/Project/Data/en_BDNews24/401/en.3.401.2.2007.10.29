 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday turned down an appeal by an Anticorruption Commission official to take Arafat Rahman Coco, who has reportedly been suffering from heart diseases, on remand in Gatco graft case. Metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Mizanur Rahman did not accept the appeal for a seven-day remand by ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda, also investigating officer of the case. The magistrate however allowed the officer to interrogate Coco, son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, at the jail gate. The case involves awarding contracts to the local firm for operating two state-run container depotsone at Kamalapur Railway Station and the other at Chittagong Port, during his mother's latest term in office. Charges of misuse of power and corruption have been brought against Khaleda while Coco allegedly influenced his mother to approve the deal. Eleven other people have also been charged in the case. Coco was in the dock when the magistrate ruled Monday. Coco was arrested along with his mother on Sept 3, and hours later Khaleda was sent to jail, pending trial, while Coco was taken to a seven-day remand for interrogation. He was sent to jail on Sept 5 after he reportedly fell sick. He has been undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital since Sept 7. bdnews24
