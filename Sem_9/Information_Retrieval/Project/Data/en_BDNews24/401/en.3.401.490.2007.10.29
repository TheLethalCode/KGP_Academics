 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering imposing financial penalties and barring individuals suspected of corruption from taking part in elections if they submit to the Truth Commission, rather than imprisoning them. Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein outlined the proposal Monday at a meeting at the information ministry. "Those who confess before the commission might not have to go jail, but they may be barred from elections along with facing some financial penalty," said Mainul. "However, it would be better if they are self motivated not to participate in the polls," Mainul said. The adviser said that the initial proposals had intended to give the opportunity to appear before the Truth Commission to businessmen alone, but the latest thinking had leaned towards blanket coverage. "A law meant for a special class would be discriminating," the adviser said. Mainul stressed the need for establishing the Truth Commission as soon as possible, as it would 'facilitate the country's economic activities'. "The country's economic activities should be increased right now. If this does not happen nothing can be brought under control, even with the joint forces in charge." "However, nothing is finalised, the law ministry will work on the proposals," Mainul said. Regarding war criminals and the Truth Commission, the adviser said: "It is a complex matter, and a lot has to be done in this regard." bdnews24.
