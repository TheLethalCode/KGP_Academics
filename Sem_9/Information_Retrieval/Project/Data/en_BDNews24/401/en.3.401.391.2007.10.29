 BAIDOA, Somalia, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somalia's prime minister, Ali Mohamed Gedi, resigned on Monday after a long feud with the president that frustrated Western backers and split the government while it faced an Islamist insurgency. "Today I want to state that I am going to resign, that I am leaving the government," Gedi told parliament in the south-central trading town of Baidoa. His remarks brought applause from legislators. The rift between Gedi and President Abdullahi Yusuf had hindered progress by the government, the 14th attempt at installing central rule in Somalia since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre's ouster sunk Somalia into anarchy in 1991. It was unclear who would replace Gedi, and if it would help the government unify or just start a new round of wrangling. Gedi proffered his resignation to Yusuf and parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Madobe when he arrived in Baidoa on Monday, but was requested to do it formally in front of parliament. A veterinary surgeon by trade, Gedi rose from obscurity three years ago to become prime minister at the end of Somalia's peace talks in Kenya. Although he and Yusuf have both enjoyed Addis Ababa's support since they came to power in late 2004, the two have differed almost from the start. Though they began to work together earlier this year, the rift widened again when they backed separate parties interested in exploiting Somalia's oil potential. FORCED OUT Yusuf's allies say the president, with some Western support, decided in September Gedi must go and set out to force him from office with a constitutional ploy that would have amounted to a no-confidence vote, if successful. Gedi tried to garner support from his powerful Hawiye clan in Mogadishu. But he never got the unified backing he needed -- especially since many Hawiye have complained he was not their choice to take the clan's top position in government. Yusuf hails from the rival Darod clan, and as such the prime minister had to come from the Hawiye clan as part of a power-sharing agreement reached at the peace talks in Kenya that gave birth to the government. Distrust of Yusuf as a Darod and dissatisfaction with Gedi as prime minister has kept the Hawiye mostly against the government since its inception. Those factors, diplomats and analysts say, made it difficult for the government to return to Hawiye-run Mogadishu until the Ethiopian military helped them over the New Year, only to be met by a Hawiye-backed Islamist insurgency. Speculation has been rampant as to who might replace Gedi if he were to go, but diplomats and Somali officials say no clear candidate has emerged. Many in the West hope parliament will first pass a law that will allow anyone, and not just sitting parliamentarians, to take the job in the hope of widening the fie
