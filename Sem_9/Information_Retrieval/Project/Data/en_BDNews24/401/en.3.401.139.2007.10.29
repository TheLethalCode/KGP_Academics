 Dhaka, October 29 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain fell sick Monday and was admitted to a city hospital. Doctors have advised complete rest. Hospital authorities said visitors were not allowed to see him. Delwar had been suffering from health complications including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and liver problems for some time. Dentists advised him to fill his decaying teeth. Delwar fell ill at BIRDEM hospital while visiting for a regular check-up Monday. BNP's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The secretary general has been admitted to hospital as he is seriously ill. He has been suffering from a number of diseases for some time. His high diabetes has prevented him from receiving necessary dental work." He said the BNP secretary general requested the people to pray for his quick recovery. Khaleda Zia appointed Delwar, former chief whip and BNP standing committee member, as party secretary general in September immediately before her detention. He replaced expelled secretary general of the party Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. bdnew
