 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Jamie Siddons, widely regarded as the best Australian batsman never to have played Test cricket, Monday arrived in the city to put final touches to his contract to coach Bangladesh. The former assistant coach of Australia told reporters at the Zia International Airport that he took his new job as a "challenge." The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Sunday in a statement named Siddons as the successor to his compatriot Dav Whatmore, whose four-year stint expired after the ICC World Cup in the West Indies. The BCB, however, had extended his contact to India tour of Bangladesh in May and the Australian stepped aside after the tour. Asked why he felt to coach Bangladesh, ranked ninth among 10 Test-playing nations, Siddons' reply was "challenge." Siddons said he thought Bangladesh had the potential to do something different and it had inspired him to take up the challenge. He said the huge cricket following in Bangladesh also attracted him. The 43-year-old assessed Bangladesh as "a young team, they are growing fast and has a great potential." Siddons scored 11,587 first-class runs at an average of 44.91 for Victoria and South Australia between 1984 and 2000. He never broke into the Australian Test team but played a lone one-day international against Pakistan in 1988. Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful was impressed after having discussion with Siddons during their trip from Bangkok to Dhaka. Ashraful also returned Monday along with Siddons by a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok Airport after the International Cricket Sixes in Hong Kong where he had led the national six-a-side team to quarterfinals. He hoped that Siddons would improve their Test performance alongside the one-day internationals now that Dav Whatmore had given Bangladesh a good footing in the one-day game in the last four years. "I had a long discussion with Siddons, whose interest in Bangladesh cricket has attracted me and everyone will now expect that he would improve our Test performance alongside one-day internationals." Siddons is considered a batting-oriented coach which is what the BCB had been looking for. He was recently on cricketing legend Shane Warne's list of top 50 batsmen. "Batting is our main problem, and we will be able to do better at international level if the problem is solved. "Our batsmen will benefit from him, who is considered a specialist batting coach," said Ashraful. Siddons' first international assignment will be Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand in December for two Tests and three one-day internationals. "He has been with the Australian cricket team since 2005 Ashes series. A coach like him will be good for us," Asraful said. bdnews24.com/
