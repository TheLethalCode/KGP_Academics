 LJUBLJANA, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leftist Danilo Turk was confirmed on Tuesday as the second contestant in Slovenia's presidential runoff, and analysts said he would probably beat a conservative backed by most of the right-of-centre government. Official results showed that Turk, a former diplomat and United Nations official, won 24.5 percent, behind ex-prime minister Lojze Peterle's 28.7 percent. A second left-of-centre candidate, Mitja Gaspari, came in a close third with 24.1 percent. Turnout in the first round was 58 percent down from 72 percent in the first round of presidential election in 2002.

While Peterle failed to convince the voters, Turk's views on matters such as abortion, homosexuality and World War Two were clearly expressed during the campaign," Borut Hocevar, an editor at the daily Zurnal 24, told Reuters. The new president will be sworn in only a few days before Slovenia takes over the rotating presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1. Although the post is largely ceremonial, the president will feature prominently during Slovenia's EU presidency. The winner will replace Janez Drnovsek, a popular veteran left winger who frequently clashed with Jansa's government and is not running for a second five-year term. Although Turk is an independent candidate, he is backed by the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, and the pensioners' party Desus, a junior partner in the government coaliti
