<TITLE> China cracks down on athletes lying about age </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's sports system is upgrading its athlete registration system to end the widespread problem of athletes lying about their age, a senior official said on Tuesday. Chinese athletes are often encouraged to pretend to be younger than they are to strengthen teams at school and city levels. Recent National Basketball Association (NBA) recruit Yi Jianlian, for example, is officially listed as being born in 1987 but the internet is awash with school photographs and documents which would make him three years older. Guo Jianjun, vice director of the competitive sports department at the sports ministry, told state news agency Xinhua 40 athletes had been excluded from the ongoing Chinese National City Games in Wuhan for misrepresenting their age. That, Guo said, was a great improvement on the 102 who were excluded at the last City Games in Hunan in 2003. By the end of this year, an online database will carry information on China's 41,000 national-standard athletes, including photographs, blood type, I.D. number and fingerprints. Each athlete will be given an identity card containing all the information. "Using these kind of cards instead of handwritten forms to do tournament registration will effectively control age-fudging cases," Guo said
