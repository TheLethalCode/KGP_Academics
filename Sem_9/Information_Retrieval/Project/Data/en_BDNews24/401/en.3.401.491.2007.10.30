<TITLE> World Cup more than a sporting event, Brazil tell FIFA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZURICH, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014 will be far more than a sporting event and will help transform the nation, the head of the country's football association told FIFA on Tuesday. Brazil are the only country bidding to host the finals in seven years' time, but went through the formality of making a final presentation to FIFA's executive committee at the headquarters of world soccer's governing body before the decision is officially announced later on Tuesday (1430GMT). Ricardo Teixeira, the president of the CBF, the Brazilian football association, and himself a member of FIFA's executive committee, told his FIFA colleagues: "The World Cup goes far beyond being a sporting event, it will be a tool for social transformation and leave a lasting legacy for the Brazilian population. "Brazil will benefit from hosting the World Cup but there will also be benefits for the world from Brazil hosting the tournament." The writer and poet Paulo Coelho said that football was such a part of Brazilian culture that people spent more time discussing matches than their sex lives. "I have heard people discussing a match for five hours, I have never heard anyone talk about their sexual relationships for five hours," he said, adding that the World Cup will ignite an emotional response in all Brazilians. UNITED DREAM Orlando Silva, Brazil's minister for sport, said "the land of the football boot" would benefit enormously from hosting the finals. "Brazil is united behind a dream to host the World Cup and it will help to further develop our country." Although Brazil will be granted the right to stage the tournament for the first time in what will be 64 years later on Tuesday, a massive amount of work needs to be done on its infrastructure before its stadiums are up to FIFA's modern-day safety standards. Eighteen cities are expected to bid to host games, with eight to 10 being chosen. Brazil are setting aside US$1.1 billion for updating their stadiums, including the Maracana which hosted the World Cup final in 1950 in front of a world record crowd of 199,000. That was the last time Brazil hosted the World Cup. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said afterwards: "Brazil is more than just a country, it is a sub-continent. Perhaps I should not say this, but I was very impressed with their bid." Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was among the 27-man Brazilian delegation to FIFA which included national team coach Dunga and his 1994 World Cup-winning team mate Romario. However Pele, the world's greatest-ever player who won the World Cup with Brazil in 1958 and 1970, was not among the delegation. He has expressed reservations with Brazil bidding to stage the World Cup in the past and has a strained relationship with the CBF
