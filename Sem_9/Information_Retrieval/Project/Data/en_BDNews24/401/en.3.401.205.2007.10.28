<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) A new law is in the making to arm executive magistrates with judicial powers, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Sunday. "A draft law has already been made. It will be reviewed, amended and finalised soon. It is a separate law," the adviser said, speaking to reporters at the housing and public works ministry. "The Criminal Procedure Code however remains a distinct and stand-alone law, as before," he clarified. The interim cabinet Saturday approved in principle giving specific judicial powers to executive magistrates under the proposed Mobile Court Ordinance 2007. "As the government must make the judiciary autonomous, it should also make the executive branch well-equipped to run the administration unhindered," Mainul said. The decision to allow executive magistrates to have some judicial powers follows a meeting of the leaders of Bangladesh Administrative Services Association with the law adviser. The association asked the government to grant some judicial powers to executive magistrates. bdnews24
