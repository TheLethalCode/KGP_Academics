<TITLE> UN votes against US embargo on Cuba for 16th year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to urge the United States to lift its four-decade old embargo against Cuba in a resolution adopted for the 16th consecutive year. The resolution entitled "necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba" was passed with 184 votes in favor, four against and one abstention. The measure is nonbinding and has had no impact on US policy in the past. President George W. Bush last week rejected any easing of sanctions on Cuba without a full transition to democracy and said doing so would only bolster the communist government's grip on power. In his first formal speech on Cuba since an ailing Fidel Castro handed power to his brother Raul in July 2006, Bush labeled the Castro government a "disgraced and dying order" and urged Cubans to push for democratic change. Every year since 1992, the UN General Assembly has told the United States to lift the embargo against Cuba. Last year's resolution was approved by a record 183-4, with one abstention.
