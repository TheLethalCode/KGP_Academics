<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) Debapriya Bhattacharya, ambassador and permanent representative-designate of Bangladesh to the WTO and UN Offices in Geneva, Tuesday tagged the issue of workers rights to better access to the international market. He said industry owners the government would have to be sincere in upholding workers' rights in line with laws recognised by International Labour Organisation. He made he comment at a reception accorded to him by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI) in the morning. Debapriya said the international community viewed the labour rights issue seriously. "If we show negative attitude towards workers' issues it will have a negative impact on our getting trade facilities including duty and quota." DCCI president Hossain Khaled presided over the reception at the DCCI auditorium. Former DCCI chief MA Quasem, Bangladesh Pharmaceutical Industries Association president Nazmul Hasan, DCCI vice president Alauddin Malik and director Syed Toufique Sikder spoke. Debapriya said, "The duty facilities provided to the least developed countries under the WTO regime have been reversely used. Though different LDCs have got duty free access to US market Bangladesh has not yet received the facility. "However, in the international arena the duty is now coming down for different reasons. WTO has no link to it. Different international financial institutions played a role in the decrease of different types of duty from 1980 to 2006. "So Bangladesh should now concentrate on increasing bilateral relations with different countries for getting trade facilities instead of duty facilities." He said, "The quality of goods has to be improved for continuing the trend of increase in export from Bangladesh in the highly-competitive world market. "The government and the private sector will have to work together to utilise the opportunity created for export of medicines." Hossain Khaled said, "The government has for the first time appointed a person from the private sector to an important post in the WTO. The private sector of Bangladesh will benefit from it and it will contribute to realising trade facilities in the international arena." Bhattacharya said he would join his new assignment on Nov 3. bdnew
