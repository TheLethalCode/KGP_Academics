<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Rtv has asked chief news editor Syed Ishtiaq Reza and head of programming KM Harun not to attend office until further notice, the private television channel said in a statement Sunday. The statement, signed by Rtv general manager Modasser Hosain, said the decision came after allegations of "various irregularities" against Reza and Harun. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Modasser said: "There are allegations that the two have been involved in misappropriation of funds. There has been a strong backlash among the other employees of the channel against them." He said a departmental investigation would be opened into the charges Monday against the two senior employees of the channel, which is owned by National Television. Reza has brushed aside the allegations against him and Harun. He said the two had been struggling to lead the channel since the arrest of its managing director Mosaddek Ali Falu. The owner of the troubled TV station was arrested on February 5 in the framework of the anticorruption drive launched by the caretaker government. "We've been struggling to pay the employees. We have done our best to run the channel," Reza told bdnews24.com by phone late Sunday. He also said that "hired hooligans" had stopped him at the gate of the channel's premises Sunday morning and told him not to enter the office. Reza said he had no idea why this was happening to them. "We worked in our office until Saturday midnight. We're astonished to find that the channel's authorities sent a statement to the media about us." "I have no idea why the authorities have behaved like this without talking to us." Harun could not be reached immediately for comment. bdnews24.
