<TITLE> Stocks, oil hit new highs as dollar wilts </TITLE>

 HONG KONG, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks struck a record high on Monday and the dollar sank to an all-time low as investors bet the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this week to shore up the world's largest economy. Strength in stocks looked set to spread to Europe where financial bookmakers expect gains of up to 1 percent for the three major European stock indexes. UBS is also likely to be in focus after the world's largest wealth manager reconfirmed guidance issued at the beginning of the month that it would report a third-quarter pretax loss of more than $500 million. A wilting dollar coupled with a brief halt to one-fifth of Mexico's production fired up oil prices, sending US crude above $93 a barrel for the first time. Gold rode on the coat-tails of oil to a 28-year high of $794.40 an ounce and other base metals such as copper also firmed on the weak dollar. Further lifted by upbeat earnings from firms such as Nissan Motor, Japan's Nikkei average climbed 1.2 percent to a one-week closing high, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 2.4 percent by 0618 GMT. The MSCI index hit an all-time high near 588 and has risen more than 45 percent this year -- triple the gains for MSCI's main world equity index Expectations for a US rate move was the major driver for markets at the moment, offsetting simmering worries that record high oil will fuel inflationary pressures. "Most countries at the moment are coping with the high oil price, but the question is for how long before inflation starts to rear its ugly head again," said Anthony Muh, executive director at AllianceTrust Asset Management in Hong Kong. "Investors are going to go from ignoring it one day to saying this is a problem overnight. In the end, its one of those very difficult period, but if you don't participate in the market, you're going to look very bad in terms of performance." Lower US interest rates should boost economic growth in Asia's main export market, and also make equity valuations more attractive. Among major markets in the region, South Korea's benchmark KOSPI and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index both ended at record closing highs, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was at a fresh peak at the end of morning trade. After two straight weeks of losses, Chinese mainland stocks rebounded, pushing the Shanghai Composite Index about 2 percent higher. BANKS SHINE Markets were led by financial names as investors expected that further rate cuts by the Fed, whose two-day policy-setting meeting kicks off on Tuesday, will help loosen up credit markets that had been hit hard by the US subprime market woes. Persistent weakness in the US housing market is expected to spur the Fed to lower rates again after the aggressive 50 basis point cut last month that gave global stocks a boost. Japan's top lender, Mitsubishi UFJ, jumped 4.7 percent and South Korea's Kookmin Bank gained 4 percent ahead of its quarterly results. At the market close, Kookmin posted a 14 percent rise in quarterly profit. MSCI's index of financial stocks in the region put on 3.1 percent, after also rising to a record high. Investors snapped up Nissan Motor, sending the stock up 14.2 percent, after the automaker posted a surprise gain of 12 percent in quarterly operating profit on Friday, while Australian nickel miner Jubilee Mines surged 39 percent on the back of a $2.8 billion takeover offer from Anglo-Swiss miner Xtrata. Advantest Corp, however, skidded 6.7 percent after the world's largest maker of microchip testers posted a drop in first-half net profit and cut its guidance for this year to below expectations. DOLLAR WILTS Amid views of lower US rates, the dollar plumbed new depths against the euro. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, eased 0.2 percent, after earlier touching an all-time low of 76.827. The euro rose to a high near $1.4430 and also climbed against the Japanese currency to 164.70 yen The dollar though was little changed at 114.18 yen The low-yielding yen tends to underperform when stock markets rally as it is usually used to fund the purchases of higher-yielding, more risky assets in the popular carry trades. A barrage of US data this week, including the advanced reading of third-quarter economic growth report, will help determine the fate of the dollar, especially if they turn out surprisingly positive for the US economy. "All of the dollar negatives are priced in, so we need data and some new factors," said Luke Waddington, head of forex trading at Royal Bank of Scotland in Tokyo. Safe-haven government bonds were torn between stock market gains and expectations of lower US rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds closed one basis point lower at 1.605 percent after erasing early gains. The Bank of Japan will also meet this week to discuss monetary policy, but was seen holding the overnight call rate target steady at 0.5 percent.
