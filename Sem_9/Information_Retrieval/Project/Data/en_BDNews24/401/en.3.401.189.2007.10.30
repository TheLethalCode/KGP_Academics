 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture adviser CS Karim said Monday that there is no real fertiliser crisis in the country, but that the government is acting to avoid problems in its distribution. Karim denied any shortage of fertiliser, saying there should be no reason for shortage when supply is ensured. Speaking at a press briefing Monday at the Press Information Department, the adviser said the government would involve joint forces to ensure adequate distribution in the coming boro crop season. Karim said six senior officials of the agriculture ministry have been appointed to monitor the distribution process. Each of them will look after 10 districts, he added. "Demand for fertiliser is relatively low during the ongoing aman crop season, compared to the coming boro season." The demand for the coming season has been calculated after consulting with farmers after the last boro season, and stockpiling has been done accordingly, he said. Related officials have also been warned about the smuggling issue, he added. Mentioning unrest among farmers in '23 places in 16 districts', the adviser said: "All concerned have been warned as the crisis arises in the coming season." The adviser said: "The stock of fertiliser on Oct 27 last year was about 2.8 lakh tonnes. On the other hand, this year it is 4.22 lakh tonnes." He said this year's demand for urea fertiliser has been calculated at just over 28 lakh tonnes. In the past, only 25 lakh tonnes have been supplied a year. The adviser said that the government subsidises locally produced fertiliser at Tk 2.4 per kg, and imported fertiliser at Tk 25.7 per kg. Industry secretary Nurul Amin told reporters at the press briefing that the government had formed a committee comprising secretaries of the finance, agriculture and industry ministries to prevent a crisis, and tackle the problems in distribution. However, he added: "The committee made a three-point suggestion, but the government did not implement it." The secretary said that fertilisers are smuggled to India, as the price is higher there. "The committee suggested raising the price of fertiliser. This will prevent smuggling and save the local industry." "Otherwise, the fertiliser industry will face the same consequences as the jute industry," he said. The adviser said the government did not approve the committee's suggestion to raise the price at this moment as it may instigate a fabricated crisis of fertiliser. bdnews24.com
