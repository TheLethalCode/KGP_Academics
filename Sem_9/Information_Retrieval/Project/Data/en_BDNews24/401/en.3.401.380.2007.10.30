 ISLAMABAD, OCT 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed seven people, including himself, in an attack on Tuesday at a park in Rawalpindi, less than a kilometre away from President Pervez Musharraf's army headquarters, Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said. Musharraf, who was in his office at the time of the blast, was unhurt. Two of the dead were policemen, manning a checkpoint on a road leading to the army headquarters. "The blast took place near the house of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee," Cheema said.
