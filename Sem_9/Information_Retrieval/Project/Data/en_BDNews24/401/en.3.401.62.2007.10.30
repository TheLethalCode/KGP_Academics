 TEHRAN, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran summoned the ambassador of European Union president Portugal on Tuesday to protest a statement which Tehran said backed elements suspected of spying and linked to terrorist groups, an official news agency said.

It said the Foreign Ministry's human rights department strongly protested against the statement which "supported elements suspected of espionage and linked to terrorist groups and put them in the same row as human rights activists." Like neighbouring Iraq and Turkey, Iran also has a Kurdish minority and has faced cross-border attacks by rebels based in northern Iraq, who Tehran brands as terrorists.

It said last month they had called off a hunger strike they started in mid-July. Iran's rights record is often criticised by the West and rights groups say that Tehran imprisons pro-reform writers, journalists and intellectuals without due legal process.
