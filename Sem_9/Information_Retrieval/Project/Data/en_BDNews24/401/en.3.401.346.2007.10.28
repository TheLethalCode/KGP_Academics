<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) The National Awami Party (Muzaffar) Sunday ratcheted up the call on the Election Commission to bar the known anti-liberation elements and war criminals from taking part in elections. The fringe political party made the demand when it joined a dialogue with the Election Commission on electoral reforms. It also demanded that using religion and communal slogans and other "prejudicial practices" should also be banned. NAP general secretary advocate Enamul Haque raised several proposals at the dialogue, including the submission of wealth statements by all election contestants and their family members. After the talks, Haque told reporters: "Adherents of Nizami-Mujahid are the anti-liberation force." He said the sacrifice by tens of thousands of people in 1971 cannot go meaningless. "There is no scope to make excuses. We demanded a ban on the political rights of war criminals." After a dialogue with the Election Commission on Thursday, Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid had told reporters there was neither anti-liberation force nor war criminals in the country. On the role of Jamaat in 1971, he said: "You rather find out and evaluate." At Sunday's dialogue, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said: "After another round of talks with political parties over the draft electoral laws, we'll finalise a set of laws acceptable to all." After the ongoing series of meetings, the EC will make public a set of draft electoral laws, the CEC said. The dialogue was attended by the CEC, two election commissioners and election law officers, apart from the 10-member NAP delegation. The Election Commission started talks with the political parties on Sept 12. bdnews24.co
