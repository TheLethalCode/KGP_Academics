<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops repelled a series of overnight raids by Tamil Tiger rebels in the island's north, killing 13 fighters, the military said on Tuesday. The clashes in the northern Jaffna peninsula and northern district of Vavuniya came just days after the rebels had mounted their biggest suicide operation by land backed by air strikes. The Tigers were not immediately available for comment on the fighting. An estimated 5,000 people have been killed since early last year amid near-daily land and sea clashes, ambushes and air strikes. The death toll since the conflict erupted in 1983 stands at about 70,000.
