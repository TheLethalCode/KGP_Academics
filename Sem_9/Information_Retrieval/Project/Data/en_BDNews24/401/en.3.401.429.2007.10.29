 KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia rolled out an ambitious bid on Monday to transform its ethnic Malay heartland into a farming, energy and tourism powerhouse by pouring in $34 billion by 2020. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi launched Malaysia's third development corridor as his government tries to position the country for future growth amid expectations that national elections could be held in early 2008. "We expect to create more than 560,000 new jobs in the corridor over the next 12 years," Abdullah told a 3,000-strong crowd at a makeshift canopy overlooking the South China Sea. In a televised speech, he also announced an initial 6 billion ringgit ($1.80 billion) budget to kickstart the economic zone. Agriculture and tourism are key focus areas, with nearly half the funds earmarked to strengthen transport links and infrastructure in some of the poorest states, home to nearly 4 million people in Malaysia's northeast. Abdullah was speaking in the capital of Terengganu state, where two members of an Islamist hardline opposition party were wounded last month after police fired to disperse rioters at a political rally. Malaysia's opposition parties called the incident the country's worst political violence in recent years, and analysts see Abdullah's plan as a major sweetener to win back support for his ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party. UMNO is also looking to recapture neighbouring Kelantan from the Islamist opposition Parti Islam se-Malaysia, which wants to turn the country into an Islamic state that punishes thieves by chopping off their hands. PAS, which rules Kelantan since 1990, has banned gaming and public consumption of liquor. Women are not allowed to hold public office. Malaysia will try to entice foreign investors to participate in the plan, which expects to raise a fifth of the needed $34 billion from the private sector, another 27 percent from public-private initiatives, and the rest from government, planners have said. Terengganu is Malaysia's largest oil producer, with state energy firm Petronas and Exxon Mobil Corp being the biggest operator in the state. Petronas, tasked with chalking out the plan, has said it also intends to invest in the region. Energy services firms are likely to benefit from a slew of potential projects in the so-called East Coast Economic Region. They include Petronas Gas, Dailog Group, KMN Group, Kencana Petroleum, MMC Corp and Muhibbah Engineering. The ECER Abdullah launched on Monday sprawls over 51 percent of the Malaysian peninsula, through the northeastern states of Kelantan, Terengannu and Pahang to Mersing in southern Johor. He said the plan would involve upgrading of airports, roads, ports and telecommunications facilities. It will also expand a gas and petrochemical hub and set up a zone for plastic makers. He also announced plans to set up a major international Internet exchange in Terengganu to serve Southeast Asia. Education is also targeted in the plan, while the property sector will get a boost from moves to ease development of land that cannot now be sold to non-Malays. Nearly half the land not owned by the government in the eastern development region is in this category, state news agency Bernama said when the plan was announced last month. In July Malaysia launched a $51 billion development plan to turn its mainly agricultural north into a logistics, food-processing and tourism zone by 2025. Last November, it unveiled an ambitious two-decade blueprint to turn 2,200 square km (850 square miles) of Johor next to Singapore into an industrial and tourist zone. ($1=3.343 Malaysian Ringg
