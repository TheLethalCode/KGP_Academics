<TITLE> Success of separation hinges on judicial magistrates </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mustafa Kamal Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  I am being requested for the last few weeks by various quarters to give my reactions and observations on separation of the judiciary from the executive, because I was the main author-judge of the judgment in Majdar Hussain's case containing 12-point declarations and directions. It goes without saying that I shall be pleased if the separation takes place. When the caretaker government declared its positive attitude after assuming office on the 11th January, I congratulated the caretaker government expressing my satisfaction over the declaration. The process was not easy and the future ongoing process will not be strewn with a bed of roses either. India had done the separation on the initiative of the government by amending the code of Criminal Procedure extensively in 1973, but the separation did not come about the same way in Bangladesh. Separation is being made here in execution of a judgment of the Appellate Division and under its supervision. This supervision is so wide and deep that if any change, expansion or reform has to be made in the rules and law approved by the Appellate Division, that can only be done with the approval of the Appellate Division, as the separation appeal is still under its consideration. Any step that touches upon the directions of the Appellate Division will attract its consideration like a magnet. So long 635 executive magistrates were exercising both executive and judicial powers. There are provisions in the approved rules and law to allow them to exercise only judicial power either by absorption or on deputation. Process is on to recruit 200 new assistant judges within two months and it is learnt that there is a thinking to recruit 200 more assistant judges by next March. On and from the 1st November, 201 judicial officers will take over the functions of judicial magistracy. They all have prior experiences of conducting criminal cases. These 201 judges will perform the judicial functions of 635 persons for the time being. This is without doubt that a big challenge is before them. For the administration too this interim situation poses a grave problem of law and order. It is my earnest prayer that they both come out of this crisis without hindrance and faithfully. People of our country do not want to enter into the complexity of who is conducting a trial, a man from the administration or a man from the judiciary. They want that there be no harassment, bribery and corruption be stopped, cases be disposed of quickly and there be a just judgment. The success or failure of separation depends upon these 201 judicial magistrates. If they are honest, go by the rules, be true to their duties, sit in the ejlash for the full prescribed period and keep the criminal courts as far as possible free from the vicious circle of bribery and corruption, then the people will come to realise the qualitative change in criminal magistracy and separation will go ahead climbing upon the steps of its own success. I give my blessings and extend my goodwill to these 201 persons. The administrative and supervisory work of the Supreme Court has now registered a manifold increase. I hope that the Supreme Court will not disappoint the countrymen in the due discharge of its extended functions. The caretaker government has been able to launch the primary work of separation despite many resistances and I congratulate both the caretaker government and the Appellate Division for their accomplishment. At the same time I cherish the hope that the distribution of work among all kinds of magistrates will follow the directions of the Appellate Division. No one wants a clash. Mustafa Kamal is a former chief justice.
