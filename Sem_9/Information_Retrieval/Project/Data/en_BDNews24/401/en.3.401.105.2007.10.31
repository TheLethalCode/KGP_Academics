<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has slipped 15 places to 107 in 2007 from 92 in 2006 in the worldwide ranking in terms of competitive edge, according to Global Competitiveness Report 2007. "It indicates that we are losing our competitiveness," said Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of nongovernmental think-tank, the Centre for Policy Dialogue, Wednesday launching the World Economic Forum report on a survey of competitiveness. The findings were based on perceptions of top executives of business organisations in 131 countries. This is the latest in a series of global ranking reports in 2007 which showed deterioration in Bangladesh's positions. The Corruption Perceptions Index, Ease of Doing Business Report and World Investment Report 2007 came earlier. Bangladesh slipped in all the indices. "It's frustrating. All the survey results are giving negative indications. It's not good for the economy," Mustafiz said. Corruption, inefficient government bureaucracy, inadequate supply of infrastructure and policy instability have been blamed to have affected the country's business environment, he said. Mustafiz said top executives in Bangladesh observed that performance in terms of institutions, higher education, macroeconomic stability, training and technological readiness had deteriorated. But the perceptions on market size, financial market sophistication and labour market efficiency improved although its rankings fell, compared to other countries, he said. The GCI 2007 for Bangladesh was prepared taking perception of 99 top executives of business firms with a capital of Tk 100 million. "It will be a mistake if we take a major decision based on these indicators. But keeping this information in mind will be a smart thing to do," he said. "It will give you indications as to where you have to hit." According to the GCI, Bangladesh appears among the bottom 10 countries when it comes to institutions, higher education and training and technological readiness. But it ranks relatively better in case of market size, financial market sophistication and labour market efficiency, the CPD executive director said. The GCI 2007 was conducted taking 12 indicators such as institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic stability and health and primary education. The country's performance in the business index also deteriorated. The CPD executive director, referring to entry of six new countries to the survey, said Bangladesh's ranking has dropped by six positions to 98 even if the new entry is counted out. He also citied CPD's Business Environment Survey and said business environment showed poor performances. He put this down to a "very low" level of public trust about financial honesty of politicians, government officials favouring well-connected firms and individuals, ineffective national parliament, wasteful public spending and poor infrastructure are the main reasons for poor business environment. Mustafiz is however upbeat about Bangladesh's ranking in the next year GCI. "The government has taken some reform measures after the survey period (January-March 2007). We hope to get a better picture in the GCI 2008," he said. A sense of fear and uncertainty prevails among businessmen, he said. "But if the initiative taken by the government works properly, it may give us better results." The government on October 30 formed a Regulatory Reforms Commission to woo businesses. Speaking on the macroeconomic situation, he said: "The fundamental challenge is inflation. It appears that inflation will put an impact on everything from production to people's purchasing power.." bdnew
