 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) -- The bourses closed lower Sunday due to profit-taking in the heavyweight power and banking issues. DESCO led the sell-off rush. The market opened upbeat but fell sharply in midday trade due to strong pressure to sell DESCO shares following dividend postings. Indices inched up during the day but remained in negative territory toward the close of the day's trading. "The market continues to show such a level of maturity then it may be sustained," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. DESCO, the most active share, declined 15.69 percent to Tk 1164.25, depressed by its dividend disclosure. DESCO posted a 25 percent cash dividend for 2006-07. Other power issues, Summit Power and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, also closed lower. Banking stocks also slumped. Trust Bank, although trading higher than the previous day's trade till midday, declined 0.85 percent to Tk 1156.25. Trust Bank said its present market price was not 'commensurate with fundamentals.' Sharif Ataur Rahman, who has about 30 years' experience in the stock market with SAR Securities, observed that many investors were immature. He said buying Trust Bank issues even after it had voiced concerns about the continuous rise in its share price was not prudent. "How can you say it is mature behaviour when Trust Bank shares rise even after such a disclosure?" Sharif said. "It appears the market will be sustained because there are buyers." AB Bank dropped 3.11 percent to Tk 2959.5. Profit taking drove BRAC Bank down 0.85 percent to Tk 1510. Rupali Bank fell after reporting that its board did not issue dividends for the year 2006. Social Investment Bank also finished lower, clarifying that it had no official record that the central bank had released it from the 'problem bank' category. Banks are placed under this category if their financial performance is unsound. "Trading was good. Both profit takers and bargain hunters were active," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage Tk 1.0 billion in funds with AIMS of Bangladesh. The DGEN or general index shed 15.03 points or 0.51 percent to 2886.95 The DSI or all-share was down 22.35 points or 0.90 percent to 2448.43. Buoyed by a rise in Islami Bank, the DSE-20 blue chip index added 11.11 points or 0.49 percent to 2242.24. Losers beat gainers 108 to 97. Nine issues held steady. Turnover stood at Tk 2.39 billion from the trading of 2,25,65,542 shares. Pharmaceuticals stocks closed with mixed performances. Beximco Pharma, the day's third most active share, rallied 9.87 percent to Tk 76.80. Mutual funds advanced with AIMS 1st mutual fund emerging as the most active share in the sector. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange ended lower with energy and banking stocks leading the downward trend. Of the issues traded, 51 gained, 58 lost and eight held steady. A total of 49,85,315 shares worth Tk 414.91 million were traded. bd
