 PARIS, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were mostly higher rose by midday on Wednesday, as a lack of negative surprises in Deutsche Bank's results pleased investors and sent banking stocks higher. But with the US Federal Reserve widely expected to unveil a rate cut after European markets close, investors remained cautious. At 1223 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,587.04 points. European banking shares advanced across the board after Deutsche Bank beat its own earlier forecast with a 1.4 billion euro third-quarter pretax profit despite making a loss at its flagship investment banking division. Investors were relieved by the absence of any shock news, particularly in the area of fixed income, where rival banks such as UBS have taken big writedowns related to the crisis in US subprime mortgages. "Clearly they are a very good set of results which probably puts some people's minds at ease," said Vasco Moreno, chief banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. "They have been resilient in an area seen as a problem," he said. Deutsche Bank gained 4.4 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland added 2 percent and Societe Generale surged 2.5 percent. The DJ Stoxx European banking index gained 1.5 percent after bearing the brunt of investor worries over a crunch in the credit market in recent months. The banking index is down 7 percent on the year, going in the other direction to the broad FTSEurofirst 300, which has gained 7 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.2 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.3 percent. British supermarket chain Tesco surged 2.8 percent after Britain's competition watchdog published provisional findings of an inquiry into the industry which analysts said issued only mild criticisms. Dutch digital map provider Tele Atlas soared 17 percent in anticipation of a bidding war after US digital device maker Garmin made an unsolicited bid Tele Atlas, trumping an earlier offer from TomTom. TomTom sank 19 percent. German engineering firm GEA Group fell 3 percent after disappointing investors with a lower-than-expected order intake. Dutch food group Wessanen NV jumped 6 percent after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly results and said it is on track to reach its targets for 2007. On the macro front, investors braced for the interest rate decision from the US Federal Open Market Committee, scheduled to issue its statement at 1815 GMT. The Fed is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 4.5 percent to limit economic damage from the US housing market's slump. The Fed slashed its discount rate in August in a surprise move aimed at calming turbulent financial markets. That was followed by cuts in the discount and the main fed funds rate in September. Monetary policy easing by the Fed has been key to a rebound in stocks from a sharp sell off in the second part of the summer, sparked by worries that a squeeze in the credit market would spread to the broader economy. On Wednesday, the focus will be on the Fed's statement as investors will look for clues on the outlook for rates. "Risks remain both on growth and on inflation, which should provide for a neutral bias officially. Nevertheless, Fed officials will want to dampen expectations for a path of cuts without economic trends warranting such action. We expect this to be the last cut this year." Societe Generale analysts wrote in a note.
