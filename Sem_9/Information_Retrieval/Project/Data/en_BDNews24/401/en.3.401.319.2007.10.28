 COLOMBO, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed 15 Tamil Tiger rebels and three soldiers died in clashes in the north, the military said on Sunday, as stepped-up fighting continued in the latest chapter of a long-running civil war. Troops fought four separate battles with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northern district of Vavuniya on Saturday, and another on the Jaffna peninsula on Sunday, days after the rebels mounted their biggest-ever suicide operation by land backed by air strikes.

The latest fighting in the north, where a new chapter of a two decade civil war is focused after troops drove the Tigers from bastions in the east of the island, comes after the military said dozens of Tigers were killed in heavy clashes in the region last week. An estimated 5,000 people have been killed since early last year amid near daily land and sea clashes, ambushes and air strikes, taking the death toll since the conflict erupted in 1983 to around 70,000. While the government has had the upper hand in recent months, analysts say there is no clear winner on the horizon and fear the conflict could rumble on for years.
