 BAGHDAD, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi authorities have set up more checkpoints to restrict the movement of Kurdish rebel fighters and cut supply lines to their mountain hideouts, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said on Wednesday. "There is an increase in checkpoints to prevent the PKK from getting food and fuel. There are measures to prevent them from reaching populated cities," Zebari told a news conference. Zebari also said after a meeting with his Iranian counterpart that "intensive efforts" were under way to secure the release of eight Turkish soldiers seized by the PKK rebels in an attack earlier this month. Turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops along the Iraqi border in preparation for a possible cross-border incursion to root out an estimated 3,000 PKK rebels, but Washington and Baghdad fear such an operation could destabilise the region. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since the group launched its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984 and has urged Iraq to clamp down on the separatist guerrillas. The United States and the European Union, like Turkey, brand the PKK as a terrorist group. US, Turkish and Iraqi officials will make diplomatic efforts to avert a major military operation at a conference of Iraq's neighbours in Istanbul this weeke
