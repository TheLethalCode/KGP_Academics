 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The full bench of the Supreme Court Wednesday set Nov 15 for next ruling in the Mazdar Hossain case that set off moves to carve out a free judiciary. On Nov 15, the court will also issue rulings in the two contempt of the court cases filed against 13 government officials, including four secretaries, on charges of their complying with the verdict on separation of the judiciary from the executive. The full bench once again ordered the government to complete the tasks for the separation, including construction of courtrooms for judicial magistrates and putting in place other required infrastructure. A seven-member full bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin gave the rulings at 9:36am. The apex court is also set to issue ruling on Nov 15 regarding the law ministry letter that asked the district judges not to ask for separate courtrooms, vehicles, manpower and other facilities for the judicial magistrates. On Sep 18, it asked the government to ensure the availability of courtrooms, vehicles, manpower and gear for the judicial magistrates and notify the court of the compliance with the order. The court on Oct 28 issued a ruling against four government secretaries over the fiasco created by the Oct 24 law ministry letter. It stayed execution of the letter and ordered the government to finish the tasks and file a status report to the court within two days. Attorney general Fida M Kamal Wednesday submitted affidavits to the court detailing the governmental steps taken for constructing courtrooms for judicial magistrates and for other necessary infrastructure facilities. In the affidavits, the cabinet, establishment, housing and public works secretaries pledged total cooperation in the matter. They said the divisional and deputy commissioners had been asked to provide courtrooms and all assistance to the judicial magistrates. The law secretary in his submission said after an inter-ministerial meeting on Oct 24 on the issue of judiciary separation, the letter was despatched in good faith to promote the governmental decision and it was done with the approval of the law adviser. The attorney general later told bdnews24.com that he submitted the affidavits and the court would give its ruling on Nov 15. Barrister Amir Ul Islam, chief counsel for the complainant, said the separation of judiciary was progressing smoothly when the law ministry letter hindered its pace. He said the process of separating the judiciary had been on over the last 250 years. The British rulers had vested both judicial and executive powers with their administrators to consolidate their control over the Indian sub-continent. Since 1921, efforts had been ongoing to separate the judiciary as the political and administrative contexts were changing over time, but those attempts did not succeed because the administration always opposed the move, barrister Amir said. He said the separation of judiciary was necessarily a positive move and it was certainly the result of the concerted work of 30,000 lawyers. bdnews24
