<TEXT>
 THE HAGUE, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Croatian general Ante Gotovina went on trial at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal on Tuesday for driving up to 200,000 Serbs from a rebel enclave in a bloody campaign that made him a hero in his homeland. Gotovina and his fellow generals Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac are accused of orchestrating the killing of hundreds of people and the shelling and torching of towns and villages in the Serb-held Krajina region in 1995. "Serbs were in panic-stricken flight, not by accident but by design," U.N. prosecutor Alan Tieger told the court. "For those who remained, life became a nightmare." Years of pressure on Croatia to deliver its last war crimes suspect finally ended in 2005 with Gotovina's seizure in Spain's Canary Isles. His capture triggered large protests in Croatia, but also an invitation to Zagreb to start European Union accession talks. The Krajina region, which skirts the borders of Bosnia in southern Croatia, had been heavily settled by ethnic Serbs for centuries. They claimed it for themselves, driving the minority Croat population out, in 1991 as it began to appear inevitable that Croatia would break away from Yugoslavia. Prosecutors say Gotovina, 52, and his fellow accused were instrumental in planning "Operation Storm" to recapture the territory from August 1995. WASTELAND The legality of the recapture of Krajina is not in question, the prosecution said crimes against humanity and war crimes took place during a massive military operation that left behind a wasteland of destroyed Serb villages and homes. As the overall commander of the offensive, prosecutors say Gotovina knew of the mistreatment of Serbs but failed to prevent the crimes or punish the perpetrators. The start of the trial was being televised live in Croatia, but it has so far caused little public anger. Bruno Lopandic, a foreign policy expert at the daily Vjesnik, said Croatia was now more focused on its EU bid. "The Gotovina trial is no longer a big issue, and this shows Croatia is one of the few countries in the region that has embraced the rule of law," he said. All three accused, who have pleaded not guilty, are charged with participating in a joint criminal enterprise alongside Croatia's late nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. Prosecutors played a recording of Tudjman, who died in 1999, describing a campaign of disinformation that would pretend to guarantee Serbs civil rights. The recording ended with Tudjman giving what prosecutors called "a knowing laugh". Prosecutors also quoted him describing Serbs in Krajina as a "cancer on the underbelly of Croatia", and multi-ethnic states as "unsustainable". Former Croatian justice minister Vesna Skare Ozbold said it was important that the trial determine whether Croatia had committed war crimes while trying to liberate its territory. "At the end of the day, the verdicts will make history books, that's what will remain written about the events in 1995," he said
