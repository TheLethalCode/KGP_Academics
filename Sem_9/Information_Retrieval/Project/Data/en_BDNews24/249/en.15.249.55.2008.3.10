<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com) - Former national star Kazi Salahuddin has decided to compete in the upcoming Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) election as president. The announcement came Monday through a written paper signed by Salahuddin, who quit the BFF from the post of vice president in July 2006 citing non-cooperation from his president, SA Sultan. "I hope the BFF election will take place in time in line with the guidelines of the world's governing football body and I believe that I will take over the responsibility of the president through the election," read the statement. "I think I will be able to implement the dreams of the country's football crazy people as I believe that I have that experience and confidence to execute the plans," the statement added. Salahuddin urged all to be united, and sought cooperation and advice of well wishers for him to attain the goal. The FIFA and AFC instructed the BFF to hold the election by April this year, but not before forming the Football Associations at district and divisional levels.
