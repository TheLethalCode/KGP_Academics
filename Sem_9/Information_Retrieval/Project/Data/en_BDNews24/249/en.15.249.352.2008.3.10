<TITLE> Hasina wants 'consistent treatment': doctor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina's personal physician Dr ABM Abdullah said Monday that the former prime minister asked for doctors to work in unison to treat her. After visiting Hasina in the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, Dr Abdullah said the Awami League chief was not happy with the way she was being treated. "You are giving different medicines at different times," she was quoted as saying by Dr Abdullah, after his visit Monday morning. Her personal physicians have visited her separately in jail over past few days. Hasina's allergy condition has improved and her physical condition is now better but her eyes and ears still bear severe complications, Dr Abdullah said. No tests suggested by her personal doctors have been done yet, Abdullah quoted Hasina as saying. On whether all seven personal physicians would be able to see Hasina together, Dr Abdullah said there was no such decision by the government yet. "The prison authorities have not informed anything about the matter," he said. Dr Abdullah echoed physician Pran Gopal Dutta, who Sunday suggested Hasina needed treatment in the US otherwise she may face complete hearing loss. bdnews24.co
