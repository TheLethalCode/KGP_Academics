 MADRID, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's voters looked likely to return the ruling Socialist Party to power on Sunday in an election unlikely to produce an absolute majority. While campaigning has centred on a slowing economy, the murder of a former town councillor on Friday, blamed by all the parties on the Basque guerrillas of ETA, has reminded voters of deep political divisions on Basque separatism. Commentators said the shooting could boost turnout as Spaniards defy attempts to scare them out of exercising their democratic rights. Dry weather across most of the country also looked likely to encourage voting. A high turnout -- of 75 percent or more -- would probably benefit the left, whose voters are ordinarily more susceptible to political apathy. "The call, repeated by nearly all politicians and responsible media, for a massive turnout has an additional reason: ETA has called for 'active abstention' as a way of delegitimising Spain's institutions," the left-leaning El Pais newspaper said in an editorial comment. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is expected to win after four years of strong, though now slowing, economic growth and bold and controversial measures to modernise Spain, such as legalising gay marriage. Those measures, and his abortive peace overtures to ETA, have angered the conservative opposition Popular Party (PP), pushing it further to the right, and polarised many electors. The PP would almost certainly have won the last election in 2004 but for its reaction to an election-eve bomb attack on Madrid's commuter trains, when it alienated voters by rushing to blame ETA instead of the real perpetrators, Islamist militants. This time, the most recent opinion polls show the Socialists on 43.4 to 43.9 percent and Mariano Rajoy's PP at between 39.3 and 39.5 percent -- not enough for either to be able to govern without some form of support from regional parties. Analysts say a turnout of less than 75 percent would harm the Socialists, and below 70 percent could even tip the scales towards a conservative victory. Zapatero and Rajoy both voted early in the day. Zapatero urged voters to teach ETA a lesson by using the ballot. "Democracy is strengthened if all citizens turn out to vote," he said, to simultaneous applause and jeers. In the Basque province of Vizcaya, a group of people burst into a polling booth, destroying ballot papers and boxes, local media reported. The equipment was replaced and voting continued. Carmen Salinas, a 73-year-old dance company director, queued to vote in central Madrid, cradling a small dog in her arms. "For me, voting is very important because I could not vote until I was 44, after the dictatorship (of General Francisco Franco, who died in 1975)," she said. "Election day is a celebration of the liberty that we have won, and I believe in our young democracy." The PP has centred its campaign on the economy. Analysts predict growth could fall as low as 2.0 percent this year -- a rate not seen since the early 1990s -- from 3.8 percent last year as a global credit squeeze chokes Spain's already-cooling property sector. Unemployment, which hit a 29-year low last year, is up by almost 300,000 since June to 2.3 million, and many are grappling with higher mortgage repayments and higher prices in shops. Many are also unsettled by an unprecedented influx of more than 3 million registered immigrants in the last eight years -- most of them from Morocco, Eastern Europe and Latin America, another issue the PP has seized
