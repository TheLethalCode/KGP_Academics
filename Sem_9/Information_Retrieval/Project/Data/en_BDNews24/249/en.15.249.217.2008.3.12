 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The Democratic Left Alliance Wednesday asked the caretaker government to announce a schedule for the national polls and to lift the state of emergency. "The government seems intent on implementing its political agenda in the name of reform, instead of concentrating on the electoral process," coordinator of the alliance Junayed Saki told a press conference at the National Press Club. "The government is not serious about taking measures to combat the skyrocketing price of essential commodities," Saki said. The coordinator said he had asked the Election Commission to hold dialogues with all democratic parties and alliances. He added that the draft electoral reforms of the commission, including the registration of political parties, contradicted Section 66 of the Constitution. The alliance leader also demanded an early completion of the voter listing and called for anyone convicted of corruption or war crimes to be declared unfit to contest in the elections. bdnew
