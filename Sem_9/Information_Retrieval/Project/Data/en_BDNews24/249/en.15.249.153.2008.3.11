 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has spelled out concern over a steady rise in the prices of essential commodities and asked different agencies to sharpen market watch, an adviser said Tuesday. The CA held an emergency meeting with several edible oil businessmen in his office, ahead of his visit to Senegal to attend the OIC summit. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman also attended the meeting. "The chief adviser is particularly concerned about the overall market situation," Hossain Zillur told reporters at the commerce ministry on his return from the meeting. The CA held the meeting as he would be away for 10 days, he said, adding: "The meeting focused on commodity prices." The CA urged businessmen to take less profit on the sales of essential commodities, the adviser said. Hossain Zillur said specific plans had been made to curb the prices, but he refused to reveal the plans for now. But the government does not want "unnecessary intervention" in the market as it is the age of free-market economy, he said. "If necessary, we have to overhaul TCB (Trading Corporation of Bangladesh) and take more help from the BDR to bring equilibrium to the market," he said. "What we want more than anything else is a stable market." The adviser said the prices of edible oil were stable until March 1 from Feb 24 when the commerce ministry fixed the prices. The prices rose again later, prompting the government to send letters to some businessmen to know the reason for the rise. Although the prices of oil edged slightly down on the international market, there was no clear sign of a positive impact on the local market, the adviser said. Hossain Zillur said: "The market would have been more unstable, if we had not fixed the prices of edible oil." The government is trying to sharpen market watch and alter the monitoring strategy, the adviser said. bdn
