<TEXT>
 Sydney, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timorese Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao visited President Jose Ramos-Horta in an Australian hospital on Monday in a show of solidarity after the two men were targeted by rebels in assassination attempts in February. Gusmao said he was happy to see Ramos-Horta walking again after the shooting that had left him critically wounded, and hoped the operation to capture the remaining rebels behind the attacks would end this week. "I came as a gesture of solidarity," Gusmao told reporters after visiting Ramos-Horta in the Darwin hospital. Gusmao, a long-time friend of Ramos-Horta, said he at first asked: "How are you Mr President?", then "How are you brother?" "We are very glad and happy to see the president walking around and making a good recovery," he said. Ramos-Horta was rushed to Darwin, in northern Australia, with gunshot wounds after the attack in which rebel leader Alfredo Reinado was killed. The rebel group was also thought to be behind a simultaneous attack on Gusmao, who escaped unharmed. Ramos-Horta will remain in Darwin for a few weeks to further recuperate before returning to East Timor, said Dr Len Notaras, general manager of Royal Darwin Hospital. "He may need some minor surgery to attend to some of the grafts," Notaras said. Ramos-Horta has already undergone five rounds of surgery. Arrest warrants were issued against 17 people suspected of involvement in the Feb. 11 attacks, including Gastao Salsinha, who took command of rebel soldiers after Reinado. "We hope that this week will be the end of this operation," said Gusmao, warning Salsinha to surrender or face the consequences. "After that we can continue to make efforts to solve our many humanitarian and social problems in our country," he said.
