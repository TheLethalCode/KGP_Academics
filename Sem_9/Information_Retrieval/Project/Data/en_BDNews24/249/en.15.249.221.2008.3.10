 Brussels, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union officials said on Monday they were confident voters in Serbia would back pro-EU parties in the forthcoming parliamentary election after the fall of its 10-month-old coalition. Nationalist Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica dissolved his government at the weekend amid divergences on the importance of Kosovo versus ties with the EU. A new poll is slated for May. Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said he hoped for a victory for pro-European parties in the poll. "Now with the election coming, I hope that the pro-EU forces will win ... I have seen encouraging signs," he told reporters on arriving to chair a meeting of EU foreign ministers. "To be quite frank, I don't think there is any other possibility for our Serbian friends than the European Union. Where should they go?" he added. EU officials, who openly supported the re-election of pro-Western Serbian President Boris Tadic last month, made clear they saw the poll as a chance for Serbs to tell their leaders they wanted to pursue EU ties after the loss of the cherished province of Kosovo in a secession backed by major EU countries. "We have an opportunity for the people of Serbia to choose their way forward," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. "I hope very much they will continue pushing for a relationship, deep and solid, with the European Union," he said. The EU has initialled a so-called Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade as a first step on the long road to membership, but has refused to sign the accord until Serbia cooperates fully to arrest war crimes indictees. Moderates such as Tadic say Serbia should continue to deepen EU ties, while nationalists want a freeze on relations with Brussels as long as the bloc backs Kosovo's independence.
