 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina should be sent abroad for proper treatment of her ear complaint, a doctor said Tuesday. "It is impossible on the part of Square Hospital to provide treatment of such a complicated ear complaint," Prof Md Abu Tahir told reporters after examining Hasina for over four hours following her admission in the morning. "However, the other complaints may be treated here," he added. "It will be harmful if the treatment is attempted in the country," said Prof Tahir, who is vice chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. He said Hasina's blood pressure was under control, though the allergic reactions affecting her eyes and tongue had increased. "The dosages of a number of medicines have been changed," the doctor said. Seven doctors have seen Hasina at Square Hospital so far since she was admitted in the morning, the hospital's general manager John Gomes told bdnews24.com. Prof Tahir and head of general medicine Tofail Ahmed followed five of Hasina's preferred specialists who had examined her in the morning after her arrival. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters: "The doctors have not given any final opinion yet. We will arrange her treatment according to what they say." Ear, nose and throat specialist Dr Pran Gopal Dutta, eye specialist Dr Syed Modasser Ali, heart specialist Dr MH Millat, general medicine specialist Dr ABM Abdullah and dermatologist Dr Kabir Chowdhury arrived at the hospital shortly after Hasina's admission to check on her condition. The five specialists were Hasina's own choice of physicians, Siddiqui said. Hasina's lawyer and relative barrister Fazle Nur Taposh visited her following her admission. "Sheikh Hasina was taken to Square Hospital today as she agreed to be hospitalised last night," Siddiqui told bdnews24.com earlier in the morning. "The decision on forming a medical board will be made after the doctors give their final opinion." Strict security measures were put in place around the hospital as the former prime minister was admitted. The detained Awami League chief arrived at Square Hospital at 8:50am from the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises amid tight security, with police, the Rapid Action Battalion and other security agencies continuing to mount watch in front of the hospital. The former prime minister has been suffering from partial hearing loss and raised blood pressure. She also has difficulty with her balance, her personal physicians who visited her in special jail have said. Hasina was earlier taken to Square Hospital on Feb 21 for a check-up. bdnews24.com/mk/lh/sum/ahd
