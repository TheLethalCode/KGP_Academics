<TEXT>
 BERLIN, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Social Democrat (SPD) party chief Kurt Beck will meet party officials on Sunday when he returns from two weeks of illness to criticism over his decision to cooperate with a far-left party in Hesse. "Today: Comeback or Beck gone," Bild Am Sonntag tabloid said, referring to Beck's meeting with senior SPD officials later on Sunday, in which the party's future direction is set to feature high on the agenda. He is due to hold a news conference on Monday. On Friday, state SPD leader Andrea Ypsilanti said she did not have enough backing inside her own party to form a minority government in Hesse using votes from the Left party, a grouping of ex-communists and leftist radicals.

And although senior SPD officials voiced their support for Beck over the weekend, media have speculated that his days as party chief might be numbered. Bild daily said former party head Franz Muentefering could take over again, and media have reported that Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier could become the SPD's candidate for chancellor in next year's election, rather than Beck.

Der Spiegel weekly quoted Steinbrueck as saying he thought his party no longer stood a chance in the 2009 polls. "We licked the plate clean for Merkel," Spiegel quoted him as saying. Recent polls show the internal quarrelling has cost the SPD. Its popularity fell 4 points last week, and stands at 24 percent, versus 38 percent for the CDU and 14 percent for the Left party, the party's highest this year, a recent poll showed. In Hesse, Dagmar Metzger, the rebel SPD official who sparked Friday's crisis when she said she would not vote for Ypsilanti if she sought the support of the Left Party, faced pressure from the party on the weekend to give up her oppositi
