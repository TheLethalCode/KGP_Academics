<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks headed for a sharply higher open on Tuesday, led by financial shares, after the Federal Reserve announced a new effort with other central banks to add up to $200 billion to strained credit markets. In an surprise announcement, the Fed said it was expanding a securities lending program and will accept a broader base of securities as collateral, including many mortgage bonds whose value has declined as the housing bubble burst. Shares of mortgage-related companies and banks rose before the bell following the Fed announcement, positioning the market for a big bounce following three days of losses. Shares of the largest and second-largest US mortgage finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, rose sharply. Shares of Wall Street banks such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns were also up. "The action comes at a critical time for the market. It's the next line of defense. The Fed has got to be creative," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut. "This is a favorable thing to move the paper that's been clogging up the system. If we can lower the (credit) spreads, we can make housing more affordable." S&P 500 futures jumped 29.4 points, and were above fair value, a pricing evaluation that accounts for interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 239 points, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 29.5 points. Surging oil prices boosted energy companies. Oil rose above $109 a barrel while climbing metal prices helped shares of mining companies. Stocks rose in Europe and also ended higher in Asia
