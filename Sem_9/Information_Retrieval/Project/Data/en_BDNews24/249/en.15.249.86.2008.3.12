 Hong Kong, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rebounded from a recent slump on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve and other central banks teamed up to inject hundreds of billions of dollars in new funds into cash-starved credit markets. European shares were set to rise, with Britain's FTSE 100 seen opening up as much as 1.4 percent, Germany's DAX seen up as much as 1.7 percent and France's CAC-40 seen gaining up to 1.8 percent. But the U.S. dollar slid, paring back its rally against the euro on Tuesday, amid scepticism that the Fed's steps will solve the fundamental problems faced by credit markets. and on continued concerns over a potential U.S. recession. Investors also opted to maintain their hedging against inflation, with oil prices steady within a record of near $110 a barrel hit in the previous session, while gold edged higher. "The Fed's decision to get funds for credit markets has soothed investor sentiment," said Hwang Geum-dan, an analyst at Samsung Securities in Seoul. "Fundamentals remain grim, and questions about where the global economy and inflation are headed still remain unanswered." The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan rose 2.1 percent by 0640 GMT. The benchmark hit a seven-week low on Tuesday, and is still down around 13 percent this year as a U.S.-led global economic slowdown and more writedowns in financial firms worldwide are coming just as the region is grappling with rising inflation. Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.6 percent, helped by revised data showing the economy grew a surprisingly strong 0.9 percent in the last quarter of 2007. Stocks in Australia, Singapore and India rose more than 2 percent each. South Korea and Hong Kong were up more than 1 percent, while Taiwan shares gained 0.6 percent. But China's shares dropped 2 percent as investors worry about more tightening measures to combat rising inflation. Financial stocks across the region such as South Korea's Kookmin Bank led gainers, while Japanese exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp also rallied as the dollar's firmer tone against the yen would boost export earnings. DOUBTS REMAIN The rise in Asian stocks came after major central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, injected hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh funds into cash-starved credit markets. But continued signs the region's previously red hot economic growth is slowing down at a time of rising energy and food costs could prevent further equity market gains, analysts said. India's industrial output grew 5.3 percent in January from a year earlier, slowing sharply from the previous month, according to data on Wednesday. A survey on Wednesday showed Australian consumer sentiment slumped in March to its lowest in more than 14 years, while an index in China for January showed the weakest confidence in five years. Japan is facing headaches of its own, despite the stronger-than-expected final estimate for the fourth quarter. Analysts warn of a slowdown in the country's economy early this year, while the world's second-biggest economy faces a potential void atop the Bank of Japan at a time when central banks are working together to help stem a global credit crisis. Opposition lawmakers on Wednesday vetoed the Japanese government's pick for central bank governor, Toshiro Muto, leaving the country with no successor to Toshihiko Fukui one week before he retires. DOLLAR SLIPS The dollar edged down 0.4 percent to 102.91 yen reversing into its biggest one-day rise versus the Japanese yen since August 2007 struck on Tuesday. The U.S. currency hit an eight-year low of 101.40 yen on Friday. The euro edged up 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade to $1.5373 not far from a record high of $1.5496 hit on Tuesday. "To many, the latest (central bank) measures merely address the symptoms and not the cause of the credit crunch problem," analysts at DBS said in a research note. "Like measures in the past, this exercise is seen as another attempt to buy time." U.S. crude futures steadied at $108.73, stopping a drop that had seen prices retreat from a record $109.72 hit on Tuesday, before the Fed announced its liquidity measures. Gold firmed to $974.20/$975.00 an ounce, up from around $971.40 in late trade in New York on Tuesday, and again approaching the record $991.90 on March 6. Japanese government bond futures steadied from earlier sharp falls, with June 10-year futures down 0.06 point at 139.44, recovering from an intraday low of 138.98.
