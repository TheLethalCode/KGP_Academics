 BUENOS AIRES, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A train crashed into a bus at a rail crossing in Argentina early on Sunday, killing 18 people and injuring about 45, local media reported. Several witnesses said the bus driver drove through the crossing's lowered safety barriers, the Clarin newspaper reported on its Web site, but the bus company said the cause of the accident was not clear. "It seems the driver of the bus passed when the barrier was down and the train cut the bus in half," Daniel Scioli, the provincial governor, told local television at the crash scene. "It was inconceivably imprudent." Roberto Capiel, a health official from the town of Dolores, said some of the victims were "in a very serious condition." Television pictures showed the train partially derailed, with the wreckage of the bus lying alongside. Some of the victims were returning from holidays on the Atlantic coast. "There are injuries among the people who were traveling on the train, but the most serious are those who were on the bus," one doctor said. "It's a difficult situation, really a tragedy." The drivers of the train and the bus both survived the accident, which took place just after 2:30 a.m. about 130 miles (205 km) south of the capital Buenos Air
