<TITLE> Growth worries hit Europe shares; M&A limits losses </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell early on Monday as heightened fears that the US economy is close to a recession sparked global equity declines, but merger and acquisition talk limited the downside. At 0814 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.2 percent at 1,267.34 points, having hit its lowest close in six weeks on Friday. Growth worries weighed on mining stocks, with Rio Tinto the biggest weighted loser, falling 3.7 percent. Elsewhere, BHP Billiton shed 3.4 percent. But banks buffered losses as shares in HSBC jumped nearly 2 percent after reports the global lender will try to raise its slice of China's fifth-largest lender beyond a legally allowed 20 percent. Spanish power company Iberdrola was the biggest percentage gainer in Europe as election results boosted merger speculation. Spain's governing Socialist Party won Sunday's election but fell short of the absolute majority that might have helped them act more quickly to cusion an economic slowdown.
