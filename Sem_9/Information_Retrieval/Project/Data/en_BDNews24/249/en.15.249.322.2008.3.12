 Tulkarm, West Bank, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops fired at a Palestinian militant belonging to the Islamic Jihad group near the West Bank city of Tulkarm on Wednesday and appeared to have killed him, a witness said. The witness, a television cameraman, said he saw the militant lying motionless on the ground after an exchange of fire with Israeli troops who raided a village near Tulkarm in the occupied West Bank. An Islamic Jihad official said the militant belonged to the group. An Israeli army spokeswoman said she was looking into the incident. The shooting could complicate Egyptian efforts to mediate a ceasefire between Israel and militant groups in the Gaza Strip, Including Islamic Jihad and Hamas who controls the coastal territory. Israeli troops frequently raid West Bank towns in search of militants suspected of involvement in attacks against Israelis.
