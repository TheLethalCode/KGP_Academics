 BEIJING, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least five political allies of Chinese President Hu Jintao are likely to become senior advisers to parliament as he moves to further consolidate power, two independent sources with ties to the leadership said. Hu, who doubles as Communist Party and military chief, has promoted his men to key positions as he seeks to shake off any lingering influence of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, during Hu's second five-year term. Wang Gang, who is acceptable to both Hu and Jiang, is tipped to become the No. 1 vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body to parliament, the sources said, requesting anonymity. Li Junru, vice-president of the Central Party School that grooms up-and-coming Communist Party officials, said the advisory body would play a bigger role in domestic politics. "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has bright prospects in the building of democratic politics," Li said in a speech on the sidelines of parliament last week. The advisory body is responsible for co-opting non-Communists, as well as Taiwanese, Hong Kongers and Tibetans. It currently has 27 vice-chairmen, who hold a rank equivalent to a vice-premier. Jia Qinglin, ranked fourth in the Communist hierarchy, will almost certainly be reappointed chairman of the advisory body to parliament on March 13, but may not serve out the full five years of his new term, the sources said. "Wang Gang will eventually replace Jia Qinglin," one source told Reuters. One of Hu's closest allies, former minister of culture Sun Jiazheng, was also expected to be appointed a vice-chairman of the advisory body, the sources said. In 1978, officials in the eastern coastal province of Jiangsu rejected Hu's request to posthumously politically rehabilitate his father, Hu Jingzhi, purged during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. "Hu Jintao was grateful to Sun Jiazheng for arranging his father's funeral," a second source said. Sun was then secretary of the Communist Youth League in the provincial capital Nanjing. Yet another Hu ally, Hu Deping, the eldest son of Hu Jintao's mentor, will become either a vice-chairman or a member of the elite Standing Committee of the advisory body, the sources said. The two Hus are not related. Du Qinglin, minister of the Party's United Front Work which is also charged with co-opting non-Communists, and Qian Yunlu, Party boss of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, are also candidates to become vice-chairmen of the advisory body, the sources said. Both Du and Qian are Hu Jintao's men, cutting their teeth in the Youth League once headed by Hu. Hu has also looked after the children of Chairman Mao Zedong and other "princelings", the privileged children of incumbent, retired or late leaders. Two of Mao's daughters and a grandson all sit on the advisory body to parliament. The wheelchair-bound son of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is also due to become a vice-chairm
