 LAHORE, Pakistan, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two suspected suicide car bombs exploded in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Tuesday, killing 22 people and wounding dozens, most of them in an attack on a government security office, police and officials said. More than 500 people have been killed in Pakistan this year in militant-related violence, including a campaign of suicide bombings. One of the bombs went off outside the city-centre Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), badly damaging the multi-storey office and nearby buildings, shortly after working hours began. The agency focuses on illegal immigration and people smuggling, "It is now more obvious that the terrorists are targeting the law-enforcement apparatus of the state," city police chief Malik Mohammad Iqbal told reporters, adding that a suicide car-bomber was suspected to have carried out the attack. The blasts came as opposition parties that won a Feb. 18 election were forming a coalition government, raising hopes for political stability after months of turmoil over opposition to President Pervez Musharraf. Interior Minister Hamid Nawaz said the FIA blast occured near the entrance to the office. "It was a huge blast that took place near the reception," Nawaz told Reuters. Hospital officials said 20 people had been killed in the blast, in addition to the bomber, and about 120 were wounded. "FIGHT THE SCOURGE" A second car bomb, also suspected to have been a suicide attack, went off in a mainly residential neighbourhood, about 10 km (six miles) away, police said. City administrator Mian Ejaz said the bomb killed two children while hospitals said it wounded more than 60 people. Police said the car had two people inside and blew up after it was stopped at the gate of an advertising agency office, near the Lahore home of Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Zardari, who led Bhutto's party to election victory last month, said this week the party would not flinch from a long fight against militancy. He was in Islamabad on Tuesday. Last week a twin-suicide bombing killed five people in an attack on a navy college in the eastern city. Pakistan has been battling Islamist militancy since joining the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. While much of the violence has taken place in remote northwestern regions, suicide attacks have taken place in all of Pakistan's major cities over the past year. In a separate incident, three suspected militants were killed in an army artillery attack on their hideout in the Swat Valley in North West Frontier Province, police said. Pakistani stocks fell slightly after the Lahore bombs heightened concerns about deteriorating security, dealers said. Musharraf condemned the blasts. "Acts of terrorism cannot deter the government's resolve to fight the scourge with full force," the state news agency quoted him as saying. Also on Tuesday, cricket officials said Australia had postponed their planned tour of Pakistan because of security fea
