<TITLE> Booker winner slams censorship before China trip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Man Booker Prize winner Anne Enright says censorship never works, while voicing her conviction ahead of a first visit to China that words ultimately prevail over powers seeking to curb the freedom of expression. Censorship in China has come under greater scrutiny ahead of the Beijing Olympics in August, and some global artists have clashed with the Chinese government over its bleak rights record. "Words are liquid, they get everywhere. Emily Dickinson has a line that says you cannot fold a flood and put it in a drawer," Enright told Reuters in Hong Kong, referring to the reclusive 19th century American poet. Enright, a Dubliner known for her works exploring the darker elements of the human condition, won the prestigious 2007 Man Booker prize for her novel "The Gathering". She was in Hong Kong for the Man International Literary Festival and plans to fly to Shanghai afterwards. When asked to comment on China's curbs on the freedom of expression, from banning books to jailing writers, Enright spoke broadly of the prevailing power of literature in overcoming the debilitating effects of censorship on society. "There was no way that when I was growing up that the tide of Irish writing was going to be stopped by something even as powerful as the Catholic Church," she told Reuters, citing the uncompromising writing of Edna O'Brien and John McGahern. "By conviction I'm against censorship in general and also in a pragmatic kind of way I think it doesn't work," she added. Human rights groups have used the global spotlight on China ahead of the Games to highlight a range of issues from jailed dissidents, internet and media censorship and religious controls to Beijing's policy on Tibet. China announced last week it would tighten controls over foreign singers and other performers after Icelandic singer Bjork shouted "Tibet! Tibet!" during a recent Shanghai concert. Director Steven Spielberg quit as an artistic adviser to the Olympics due to Beijing's policy toward Sudan's Darfur. PEN, the international writers' association, urged Beijing to free nearly 40 jailed dissident writers before the Olympics, some of whom had been silenced without trial for alleged subversion. While China invariably bars the publication of politically sensitive books, Enright said she was pleased at the hunger of Chinese publishers to translate and publish difficult literary works such as her own. Her novel "The Gathering" probes sexual taboos and thwarted lust in a large Irish family. "I'm fascinated by the idea that the Chinese publishing houses bought all my backlist. I'm always interested in questions of cultural interpretation, and how somebody in a very different culture interprets my work is a really intriguing question." Enright, dressed in a black Jaeger dress with an Oriental design touch, said the world was now afraid and curious about China as its influence ripples across porous borders. "My children at the ages of five and seven know the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin. Ireland is not a monolithic, Catholic society anymore."
