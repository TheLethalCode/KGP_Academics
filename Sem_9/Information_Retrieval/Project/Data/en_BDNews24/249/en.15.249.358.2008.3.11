 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh's left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak has been signed up by the Bangalore Royal Challengers in the second round of the Indian Premier League's player auction in Mumbai Tuesday. Razzak becomes the first Bangladeshi cricketer to get the chance to play in the IPL leaving behind his teammates captain Mohammad Ashraful and vice-captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who were also in the running for Tuesday's mega auction. The 25-year-old spinner will receive $50,000, according to a Reuters list of player purchases. "I knew nothing about it before and just came to know from Lipu bhai (BCB cricket operation chairman Gazi Ashraful Hossain) and Ashraful today," Razzak told bdnews24.com by phone Tuesday. The Bangalore Royal Challengers also signed up Pakistani Misbah-ul-Haq, India's Under-19 World Cup-winning captain Virat Kohli and Indian U-19 wicketkeeper Shreevats Goswami, according to cricinfo. "I felt really lucky to have got the opportunity in the IPL as I knew only that the names of Ashraful and Mashrafee were up for the auction," said the young cricketer. "I will try to do my best, and it is an opportunity to spread our national cricketers outside of Bangladesh," said Razzak, who has 82 ODI scalps under his belt in 56 matches, and 13 wickets in eight Twenty20 matches. The eight-team Twenty20 league is scheduled from April 18 to June 1 in India. Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid will lead the Bangalore Royal Challengers comprising star players like Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble, Dale Steyn, Zaheer Khan, Shivnarine Chandarpaul, Nathan Bracken and Mark Boucher. bd
