 GUWAHATI, India, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bhutanese soldiers and police have launched a crackdown against ethnic Nepali rebels ahead of the tiny, isolated Himalayan nation's first parliamentary elections this month, officials said on Wednesday. The Indian army has also put its forces on "maximum alert" along the 400-km (250-mile) border with Bhutan to prevent insurgents sneaking in to disrupt the polls, an army officer said, and both sides are coordinating intensified border patrols. A senior Bhutanese police office said they had raided two small Maoist camps in the jungles in the south of the country and captured at least eight rebels with weapons. But dissident groups complained of a climate of fear being generated among the ethnic Nepali minority in southern Bhutan. They said more than a dozen people had been arrested, and that five suspected Maoists were believed to have been killed. "Security is very tight and people are not allowed to move and talk freely inside Bhutan," said S. B. Subba, head of the Human Rights Organisation of Bhutan (HUROB), a group believed to be sympathetic to the dissidents. Tens of thousands of mainly Hindu ethnic Nepalis were expelled or fled mainly Buddhist Bhutan in the early 1990s after protesting for democracy and human rights and against discrimination. More than 100,000 live in refugee camps in Nepal, from where three small rebel groups have emerged, the Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist), the Bhutan Tiger Force and the United Revolutionary Front of Bhutan. At least five bombs have been detonated inside Bhutan this year, including one in the capital Thimpu, but there have been few injuries and no deaths. SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS Bhutan, a country of more than 600,000 people, is the last Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas, and fiercely guards its ancient traditions and culture. Its monarchy has led a gradual transition to democracy, but only two parties have been allowed to contest the March 24 poll, both of which are close to the royal family. "We have taken the security aspect more seriously as we cannot take chances," Kunzang Wangdi, Bhutan's chief election commissioner, told Reuters by telephone from the capital Thimphu. "The fact is people in camps and the communist parties have made in clear that they want to stop the elections. They have even distributed pamphlets urging people not to participate," he said. "We cannot take it as a hollow threat." Tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalis still live in Bhutan but are closely monitored by security services and are effectively second-class citizens, human rights groups say. "If you look at Bhutan maybe there is a move towards democracy, but this exercise itself is not democratic," said Suhas Chakma of the Asian Centre for Human Rights in New Delhi. "Issues of concern to the Nepalis cannot be on the agenda of any political party," he said, adding some ethnic Nepalis felt the process would be used to legitimise the status quo and further entrench their exile and alienation. "That is why there is a little bit of desperation on the side of the Bhutanese Communist Party to do something," Chakma said. Subba said he was concerned about the fate of the arrested men and did not know their whereabou
