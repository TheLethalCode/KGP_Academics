<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)The long-cherished dream of 30 million people in southern coastal districts turned into a reality with the launch of the Laxmipur-Bhola ferry services Tuesday. The services heralded a new era in the communication sector and trade for the 21 districts in the southern and western parts of the country. It will be a transit point for Bhola and Laxmipur and will also cut the distance of Chittagong port with the southwestern district of Khulna. Travellers bound for Barisal and Khulna from Chittagong will no longer have to make a detour through the capital city. South-bound vehicles would be able to skip Mawa and Aricha ferries to reach their destinations. "The new ferry services will add speed to economic activities and everyday life of the people of southeastern and southern districts," said shipping adviser MA Matin while inaugurating the ferry services at the point of Maju Chowdhury Haat in Laxmipur Sadar. On Feb 25, the BIWTC started ferry services on trial between Laxmipur and Bhola. Three ferriesKetaki, Kishori and Kasturiwere pressed into service to navigate a distance of 28km of the Meghna from Maju Chowdhury Haat to Elishghat in Bhola. Trade and economic activities have increased thanks to new-found transparency, accountability and momentum in the managements of ports including Chittagong and Mongla, Matin added. "By freeing the Chittagong port from an evil coterie, necessary measures had been taken to upgrade the port," he said. Matin said the caretaker government was "working hard" to hold a fair election free from black money and at the same time doing its job to build a corruption-free society, contain crimes and establish the rule of law. "Law and order had improved much," he said adding that law-enforcement agencies were now able to work with efficiency. The adviser said work on voter listing has been going on in full swing. He said the Regulatory Reforms Commission had been set up to make the rules and regulation appropriate to the needs of society. bdnews2
