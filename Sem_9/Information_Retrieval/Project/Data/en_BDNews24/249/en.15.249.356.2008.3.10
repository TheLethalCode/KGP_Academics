 Kuala Lampur, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian stocks fell limit-down 10 percent on Monday on political uncertainty after the ruling coalition suffered its heaviest election setback in its 50-year reign. "It's all because of the election results, there's no other reason," said a dealer with a foreign brokerage. At 0648 GMT, the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index was down 130 points at 1,166.32. Under stock exchange rules designed to prevent panic selling, trading will be halted for an hour.
