<TITLE> Bush team worried time running out on Colombia deal </TITLE>

 Washington, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration cannot allow Congress to run out the clock on free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea by delaying votes on the pacts, a senior US official said on Tuesday. "We want to do this in a bipartisan way. We want to do this together. But I'll tell you, we cannot run out of time," U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez told reporters. "What has always worried us about this approach is that we're simply allowing the clock to be, to be run out." The statement was the closest a Bush administration official has come to saying the White House was intent on submitting the agreements to Congress, even if it cannot work out a deal with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, to pave the way for a vote on the three trade pacts. Pelosi has insisted that Colombia make more progress on reducing violence against trade unionists and bringing murderers to justice before the Democratic-controlled Congress votes on that pact. The pacts with South Korea and Panama have their own obstacles preventing their quick passage. The Bush administration wants Pelosi to give her assent to a vote on the Colombia agreement, even if she personally opposes the pact. Administration officials believe they can round up the 218 votes needed for approval in the House if Pelosi does not insist all Democrats vote against it. Business lobbyists have said the White House could send the Colombia agreement to Congress as early as this week. That has prompted opponents to begin mustering their own efforts to defeat the agreement. "Simply put, the Colombia FTA would be bad for America, Colombia, and workers around the world," Rep. Mike Michaud, a Maine Democrat, and Rep. Phil Hare, an Illinois Democrat, said in a joint statement. "If the Bush administration decides to unilaterally submit the Colombia FTA to Congress -- this week or any other -- we will work hard to convince members on both sides of the aisle to join us in opposition," they said. THIS WEEK? Both Gutierrez and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab refused to say if the White House would submit the pact this week, or identify just when time would run out on the pact. "I'm not going to get into speculating on that, or setting up a date ... The only thing I will say is this is important for the president," Gutierrez said. But from a national security standpoint, the United States cannot afford to deny its longtime ally Colombia the benefit of a vote on the pact, Gutierrez said. "Our goal has always been to work with Congress to find a way forward on the Colombia free trade, all of our free trade agreements," Schwab said. "We always have had the option of sending up the bill. We continue to meet with congressional leadership in the hope of finding a way forward." All three trade deals are protected by trade promotion authority, which means the House must vote up or down on the agreements within 45 legislative days without making changes. The Senate would have another 45 days after that to act, but the House is considered the bigger obstacle. If the White House waits too long to submit the agreements, it's possible Pelosi could avoid voting by adjourning the House before the 45 legislative days are up. Congress will take its usual August break and is expected to adjourn by mid-October because of the November presidential and congressional elections. It's not clear whether they will return after that for a "lame-duck" session. House leaders also could rewrite trade promotion authority to avoid a vote. But Schwab argues that would be tantamount to an outright rejection of the Colombian agreement.
