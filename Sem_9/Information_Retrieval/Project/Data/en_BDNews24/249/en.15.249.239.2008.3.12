 Kabul, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two women and two children have been killed during a NATO operation against suspected Taliban insurgents in southern Afghanistan, the alliance said. Civilian deaths are a sensitive issue for the foreign forces under the command of the U.S. military and NATO and for President Hamid Karzai's government. In the operation, which happened on Monday, one child was also wounded and evacuated for treatment by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), NATO said late on Tuesday. "During an ISAF operation in the area of Regional Command South yesterday, a group of insurgents engaged ISAF forces who returned fire immediately," it said in a statement. "Tragically, a group of civilians received fire causing the death of two women and two children. ISAF sincerely regrets the loss of any civilian life and is saddened that casualties were caused as a result of a deliberate attack against ISAF forces instigated by insurgents." The latest civilians deaths come days after several non-combatants were killed during a house search operation by NATO in the southern province of Helmand, according to residents. More than 500 civilians were killed during operations by foreign forces last year, sparking protests and adding to the growing frustration of ordinary Afghans more than six years after U.S.-led troops overthrew Taliban's government. Karzai has repeatedly urged foreign troops to coordinate operations with his government.
