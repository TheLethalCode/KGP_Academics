<TEXT>
 DHAKA, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's tour of Bangladesh is ideal preparation for the forthcoming test series in India, off-spinner Paul Harris said on Tuesday. The South Africans play the first of three tests in Chennai on March 26 after completing the three-match one-day series against Bangladesh which they lead 1-0. "Conditions in Bangladesh are very similar to India, I am looking forward to it," Harris told reporters. "It is going to be a challenging tour for our spin bowlers to bowl in India. "Bowling in India can only make me a better player. Hopefully, I can go there and win some matches for my country." Harris missed the 2-0 test series sweep over Bangladesh after surgery on an abscess but returned to take one for 30 on a slow wicket in the first one-day game in Chittagong. "I think our spinners bowled pretty well in the first game, the wicket turned quite a bit and it helped us. And there was a bit of bounce as well, which was surprising," Harris said. "I haven't seen so much bounce here, but in the last game it definitely bounced. That's quite encouraging," the 29-year-old said ahead of Wednesday's second one-day match in Dhaka. The final game will also take place in Dhaka on March 14
