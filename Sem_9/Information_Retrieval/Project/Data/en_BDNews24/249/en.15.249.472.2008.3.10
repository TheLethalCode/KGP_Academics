<TITLE> China should integrate change better, says adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's next phase of reform should focus on better integrating economic and political change, with a planned reorganisation of government ministries as a start, a senior Communist Party adviser said on Monday. Reform advocates have said they hope this year's 30th anniversary of the 1978 meeting celebrated as launching Deng Xiaoping's market reforms will give a push for bolder changes now. Li Junru, a vice president of the Central Party School, the ruling Communists' main think-tank, added his voice to that call. "What's most important is to have breakthrough progress in new reform issues -- that would be the best commemoration of the anniversary," Li told reporters. "This year I think we must better integrate economic reform and political system reform." Li was speaking between sessions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body he belongs to that meets at the same time as the National People's Congress' annual session. On Wednesday, the parliament will hear the Party leadership's plan to recast dozens of ministries into larger, and officials hope more effective, "super-ministries" likely to cover industry, transport and possibly energy and the environment. Li said the administrative shake-up could be a "breakthrough point" for a raft of other changes to make government more attentive to the needs, and complaints, of citizens and businesses, and to promote more balanced growth. He said he had studied where China should focus its reform energies and "most experts and scholars regard administrative system reform as the major link between market economic reform and democratic political system reform". The parliament and advisory council are controlled by the Party and packed with obedient state officials, and never more than a small minority of members have voted against Party-backed policies or legislation. GREATER RIGHTS But even some establishment voices, among them Li, have nudged Party leaders to take bolder steps to give citizens more say in government and rein in often unchallengeable officials. Li wrote an enthusiastic preface for a recent book by Party School scholars detailing a "comprehensive plan" for gradual political reform over coming years, keeping Party control while giving citizens greater rights and say in decisions. "As reforms constantly deepen, issues of political system reform will also inevitably be ever more sharply placed before us," Li told a meeting of the Consultative Conference on Sunday. The Communist Party Central Committee, a 204-member leadership council, in late February also vowed to "deepen political system reform" in response to citizens' growing demands for improved rights and welfare. But China's party leaders have shown no appetite for radical change that would challenge one-party rule, and with Beijing preparing for its showcase Olympic Games in August, they will be especially wary of unrest. That wariness has been on street-level display during the parliament session, with thick rings of police and anti-riot troops preventing ordinary citizens from even approaching parliament members gathered in Beijing. Li said China was nonetheless becoming more open to citizens demands through limited elections for government and Party posts and local experiments in "consultative democracy" to set official budgets and policies. But he stressed that any political reform will be gradual and the Party's ultimate control would remain unchallengeable. Deng's "quiet" approach to political reform was the right one, Li added. "Deng Xiaoping was not just a strategist, he was a tactician," he said, adding that Deng had "avoided making a big hoopla about political reform and creating social upheava
