 Dhaka, March 09 (bdnews24.com)The World Food Programme Sunday said it will continue to help Bangladesh meet its food requirements and assist in specific feeding programmes for those affected by Cyclone Sidr. "The WFP will continue to partner Bangladesh in satisfying its food requirements," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury quoted WFP' outgoing country representative Douglas Broderick as saying. Broderick made a farewell call on Iftekhar at his office Sunday. The WFP country representative for Bangladesh told the adviser that since December last year his organisation has been feeding 22 lakh people in areas hit by last year's cyclone. In December, the government requested the international community and the WFP to provide about 2 million tonnes of rice by March in order to face potential food shortages in the country. Donor agencies then asked the government to procure the rice through the WFP to accelerate its procurement. Bangladesh has been attempting to build its stock of food since two severe floods combined with Cyclone Sidr to devastate large areas of crop land in the country. bdn
