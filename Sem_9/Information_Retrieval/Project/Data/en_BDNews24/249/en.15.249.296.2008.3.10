 HONG KONG, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong blue chips rebounded into positive territory by the close on Monday as bargain hunters saw value after shares sagged to seven-week lows. HSBC Holdings plc shot up on talk that the British lender was seeking to raise its stake in China's Bank of Communications. Investors also sought shelter in Hong Kong utilities, with CLP Holdings getting a boost from a broker upgrade. "We should not be too bearish in the near term. Too much bad news has been factored in," said Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance. "Besides, we're already in March, near the quarter's end, so there'll be some window dressing." Analysts expect more near-term consolidation before the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting a week from Tuesday. The market turned a corner in the afternoon to end near the day's high after shedding more than 2 percent at one point to levels not seen since Jan. 22. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up nearly 1 percent, or 203.72 points, to end at 22,705.05. The China Enterprises index of H shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, pared most of its earlier losses but still ended down 0.7 percent, or 87.08 points, at 12,519.75. Mainboard turnover was HK$87 billion (US$11.2 billion), compared WITH Friday's HK$83.0 billion. HSBC gathered further momentum in the afternoon after outperforming the market earlier. Its shares ended up 2.9 percent at HK$120.80. Jiang Chaoliang, chairman of the Bank of Communications, told reporters in Beijing on Monday that both lenders had agreed HSBC would have the option to raise its stake to as much as 40 percent, when regulations allowed. Bank of Communications rose nearly 1 percent to HK$8.61. Hong Kong power company CLP Holdings was another bright spot and the top blue-chip performer as investors sought defensive plays with higher yields. Its shares shot up 6.2 percent to HK$60.60. Goldman Sachs added CLP to its conviction buy list, replacing mainland power producer China Resources Power. China Resources Power fell 2.8 percent to HK$16.02 while Hongkong Electric vaulted 3.5 percent to HK$44.50. Investors booked gains in stocks that have done better than the broad market in recent days. Gold miners, which have outperformed on record gold prices, also took a hit. Zijin Mining Group Co Ltd slid 3.7 percent to HK$9.71. The gold miner posted a yearly net profit of 2.6 billion yuan, up 50 percent from a year ago. Lingbao Gold slumped 4.3 percent to HK$4.68.
