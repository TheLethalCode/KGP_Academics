<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  Former national captain Habibul Bashar Monday smashed a fine fifty to power newcomers Surjo Tarun to a four-wicket win against Kalabagan KC in the Premier Cricket League at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BSKP) ground. Another half-century from Pakistani Anwar Hafiz helped title contenders Abahani Limited to a massive 166-run win over City Club at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. BKSP tasted their first win by drubbing Partex SC by four wickets in the low-scoring match at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Abahani vs City Club Put in to bat first, Jahirul Islam (26) and Mahbubul Karim (38) gave Abahani a solid start, putting on 60 runs for the opening stand. Middle-order bats Hafiz, Tushar Imran and Nadif Chowdhury then sustained the momentum by keeping the opposing bowlers at bay. Hafiz piled up 70 runs for the fourth wicket with Tushar (39) and added another 48 runs with Nadif (45 not out off 40 balls) before he was the fifth batsman out for 56 off 92 balls. The Dhanmondi-based outfit lost the three wickets in 27 runs and finally ended up at 254 for eight in 50 overs. City Club, in their reply, could hardly find their ground in the face of fierce spells from pace duo Ziaur Rahman and Talha Jubaer, who ripped through the top-order to reduce the opponents to 51 for six in 13 overs. Lower-order Rashedul Islam top-scored with unbeaten 17, followed by Pakistani Zahoor Elahi with 16. Talha and Zia each took three wickets for 16 and 43. Surjo Tarun vs Kalabagan Surjo Tarun made heavy weather of the chase of 163, which looked pretty gettable, and played until the 46th over losing six wickets before making 167 in 45.5 overs. Bashar, who scored 56 runs in the previous match against City Club, continued with his fine form and made 66 off 118 balls, studded with eight fours. Bashar and Nayeem Islam (44) put on 76 runs for the fourth wicket after Abahani were reduced to 31 for three in 5.4 overs. Another former Bangladesh skipper Khaled Mashud (16) and Nazmul Hossain (6) remained unbeaten to take their side home. Earlier, Kalabagan made 162 all out in 47.2 overs as Mohammad Younus (4/24), Pakistani Saad Nasim (2/28) and Delwar Hossain (2/32) shone for Abahani with the ball. BKSP vs Partex SC Nasir Hossain hammered an unbeaten 64 as BKSP raced to 138 for six in 40.4 overs in reply to Partex's paltry total of 137 in 46.5 overs. Partex got off to a fine start after being sent in to bat first but failed to keep the momentum. Latiful Azam and Nasir Hossain wreaked havoc grabbing three wickets each for 15 and 21 respectively. Rashed Hanif (27), Shahin Hossain (23) and Ariful Haq (21) were notable scorers for Patex. In reply, BKSP lost the first three wickets for 37 runs inside 11 overs as Dipujjal Dey and Rashed Hanif removed the batsmen before captain Mushfiqur Rahim and Nasir prevented further damage contributing 55 runs for the fourth wicket. Hanif later took another two wickets inside five runs but could not stop BKSP, with Nasir remaining unbeaten on 64 off 96 balls with the help of 10 fours and one six. b
