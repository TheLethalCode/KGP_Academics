 Penang, Malaysia, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Malaysian opposition Democratic Action Party will review plans for an $8-billion real estate development project in the northern industrial hub of Penang, a party official said on Monday. It is the first major project the opposition wants to review after winning five of the country's 13 states in an election upset at the weekend, and has close links to the federal ruling coalition. The project's major backer is a firm partly owned by businessman Patrick Lim, a friend of the prime minister's son. The ethnic Chinese-dominated Democratic Action Party is forming the island's government after Malaysia's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition lost the state in an election upset at the weekend. "Once the DAP state government is sworn in, Penang Global City Centre will be reviewed," the party's state treasurer, Phee Boon Poh, told Reuters. "It will definitely be reviewed because it was not included in Penang's development structure plan." The Penang Global City Centre forms part of a $51.2-billion plan unveiled last July by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to turn Malaysia's mainly rural north into a logistics, food-processing and tourism powerhouse by 2025. Malaysian property developer Equine Capital Bhd , valued at just $87 million, owns 25 percent of Abad Naluri, the unlisted firm behind the government project. Plans include luxury homes, shopping malls, parks and a convention centre. In January, domestic media reported the Malaysian government had asked the developers to revise their plans, which could delay the project, following widespread protests from residents. The revisions sought included such measures as scaling down its density, complying with affordable housing norms and leaving hilly land untouched. Shares of Equine were down 29 percent at 1.01 ringgit by 0416 GMT. ($1=3.165 Malaysian Ringgit)
