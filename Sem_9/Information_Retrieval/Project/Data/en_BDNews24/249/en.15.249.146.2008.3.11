 London, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Members of Parliament, under intense fire over their expenses after the Derek Conway scandal, will have to provide receipts for everything they spend over 25 pounds, a special Commons committee ordered on Tuesday. The Members Estimate Committee, chaired by the Speaker Michael Martin, said the threshold for expenses without invoices and receipts would be reduced from 250 pounds to the new limit from April 1. MPs claimed more than 85 million pounds in expenses in 2006/7, an average of around 135,000 pounds a year each, on top of their 60,000 pounds salary. The Speaker's committee is reviewing expenses in the wake of the suspension of Conservative MP Conway for abusing staff allowances by paying his son thousands of pounds for work he appears never to have done. In a report, the committee said that some MPs had suggested there should be random spot checks on a percentage of claims. "Members have told us they expect there to be a more rigorous system for checking the money has been spent on the purpose intended," it said. It will publish another report at the end of March. Last month Conservative leader David Cameron ordered his front bench to disclose details of how they spend their allowances and which relatives they employ. Speaker Martin himself has resisted calls to go following the resignation of his press spokesman in February who said he had quit because he had been misled over 4,000 pounds of taxi expenses run up by Martin's wife
