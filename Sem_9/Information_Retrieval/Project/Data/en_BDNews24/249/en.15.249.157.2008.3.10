<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy Monday said 'reformists' would have to set aside bickering to respond to party chief Khaleda Zia's call for initiating an effective unity process. Speaking to reporters at the NAM flat of former lawmaker Mohammad Shahjahan, the pro-Khaleda leader sounded sanguine about the beleaguered party getting united under the leadership of the detained former prime minister. "It is not a matter of concern as to what decision was taken at what meeting. Detained leader Khaleda Zia has issued a directive to unite the party. All leaders and workers of the party will have to abide by that. All will have to work together to implement her call." Goyeshwar, however, claimed the BNP was united from the grassroots to the highest level under Khaleda's leadership. He said it depended on the leaders how they would be involved in the unity process; they needed to understand what the people and party workers expected of them, he added. Replying to a question, he said without taking names that the grassroots leaders and workers expected one or two leaders to play a role in uniting the party from their own positions instead of bargaining. Former lawmakers Mohammad Shahjahan and Mehedi Ahmed Rumi were present. Khaleda on Feb 1 through her lawyer urged the party to unite. On Saturday, her adviser ASM Hannan Shah as part of the unity effort wrote a letter to pro-reform faction leader and acting chairperson M Saifur Rahman. The letter urged him to cancel the decisions of the standing committee meeting on Oct 29 last year. But Saifur on Sunday rejected the proposal. bdnews2
