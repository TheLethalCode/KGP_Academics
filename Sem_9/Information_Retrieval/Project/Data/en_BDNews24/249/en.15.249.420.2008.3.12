<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan's 18-year-old striker Alexandre Pato is to make his Brazil debut after being named in the squad for the friendly against Sweden in London later this month. Barcelona's Ronaldinho was left out while four other uncapped players were called up, coach Dunga naming several hopefuls for the Beijing Olympics. Dunga urged Brazilians not to get carried away with the recent performances of Pato, who was included in the squad for last month's game with Ireland but had to pull out because of injury. "Alexandre has played some good games but, in the desire to create another star quickly, people get carried away," said Dunga. "We mustn't put too much responsibility on him. Young players have problems with consistency, their performances vary a lot." Although Ronaldinho has been playing for Barcelona recently, Dunga suggested that the former World Player of the Year was not fully match fit. "He's getting better, he's starting to play again and it's important that he continues this way," he said. "With the Brazilian team, there's not much time to train. We have two important World Cup qualifiers in June and we want him to be fully fit by then." Brazil are away to Paraguay in June and face Argentina at home four days later. Dunga also called up uncapped goalkeeper Diego Alves, defender Leo, midfielder Hernanes and forward Thiago Neves. Dunga will also be in charge of the Olympic team, where Brazil are attempting to win their first soccer gold medal. Goalkeepers: Diego Alves (Almeria), Julio Cesar (Inter Milan) Defenders: Daniel Alves (Sevilla), Alex Costa (Chelsea), Juan (AS Roma), Lucio (Bayern Munich), Marcelo (Real Madrid), Rafinha (Schalke 04), Leo (Gremio) Midfielders: Gilberto Silva (Arsenal), Hernanes (Sao Paulo), Josue (VfL Wolfsburg), Kaka (AC Milan), Lucas (Liverpool), Richarlyson (Sao Paulo), Diego (Werder Bremen), Julio Baptista (Real Madrid) Forwards: Alexandre Pato (AC Milan), Rafael Sobis (Real Betis), Robinho (Real Madrid), Thiago Neves (Fluminese), Luis Fabiano (Sevill
