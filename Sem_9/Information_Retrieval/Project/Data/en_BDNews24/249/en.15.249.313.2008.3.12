 Savar, March 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Students from Jahangirnagar University's economics department have appealed for an amendment to their exam grading scale. Head of the department, Prof Anisur Rahman, told bdnews24.com that he sympathised with the students' demands and would raise the matter in the next departmental meeting. The University Grants Commission fixed a scale of grading at Bachelor (Honours) degree level for the 2002-03 academic year. According to the commission, the grade point average (GPA) is calculated from a scale of 40 marks to 80 marks, where a minimum of 40 marks is a GPA 2 and a maximum of 80 marks is a GPA 4. Students at the university, however, say the economics department set their own grade scale, where a minimum of 40 marks constitutes a GPA 1.75, and a maximum of 85 marks is a GPA 4. The students claim they will face unfair competition due to change, which would limit their prospects in the job market. bdnews2
