<TITLE> Microsoft will not rush Yahoo merger says exec </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Microsoft Corp would not rush to merge its technology platform with Yahoo Inc's after a takeover of the Internet company, according to the Financial Times, citing an interview with Microsoft chief software architect Ray Ozzie. Ozzie described technology companies that rush to merge things together as "reckless", according to the paper. The paper reported that Ozzie said he was "very optimistic" Microsoft could achieve the main goals of the $41 billion deal, provided it concentrated on not disrupting the experience of Internet users and advertisers, rather than on racing to get all the financial and other benefits from a consolidation of the two companies' operations.
