 TOKYO, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The political row over who should lead the Bank of Japan remained deadlocked on Monday, with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda saying he had no plans to change his nominee and the opposition refusing to back down. The nominee at the centre of the impasse is one of the central bank's deputy governors, Toshiro Muto, who will get his say on Tuesday when he appears before both chambers of parliament -- the government-controlled lower house and then the upper house dominated by opposition parties. It is just over a week until incumbent Toshihiko Fukui retires, making markets wonder if the politicians will resolve their row or leave the world's second-largest economy without a central bank head in the midst of market turmoil and fears of a recession in the United States, and possibly also Japan. "I have no plan to submit new candidates. I put forward what I thought would be the best candidates," Fukuda told reporters, referring to Muto and the government's two nominees for deputy governor, former central bank official Masaaki Shirakawa and academic Takatoshi Ito. Growing fears of a U.S. recession sent Japan's main stock tumbling to a 2-1/2-year closing low on Monday, which Fukuda said showed the urgency to resolve the issue before Fukui retires on March 19. "Is it not a reason why the decision on the new BOJ governor should be made soon?" he told reporters. Observers ranging from a senior business leader to the U.S. ambassador spoke out, saying it was important for the row to end. "The government has picked the best candidates," said Fujio Mitarai, the head of lobby group the Japan Business Federation. "At a time when global financial markets are unstable, we cannot have the BOJ governor position vacant from the viewpoint of Japan's credibility in the international field." OPPOSITION FIRM Fukuda reiterated he was willing to meet Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, to try to resolve the row but the Democrats showed no sign that opposition lawmakers would accept Muto. "When I asked each party's opinion, there was no party that supported Muto," Democrat secretary-general Yukio Hatoyama told reporters after a meeting of officials of opposition parties. "Therefore, the situation is very tough." Hatoyama said each opposition party will make a final decision on the nomination after listening to Muto on Tuesday, but they felt the opposition bloc should vote together. Some opposition lawmakers, including Democrats, say appointing Muto, previously a top finance ministry bureaucrat, would undermine the BOJ's independence as he is too close to the government. The Democrats, along with smaller opposition parties, control the upper house of parliament. Both houses must approve the appointment of a BOJ governor and deputy governors. Political wrangling over the nomination could further dent the government's credibility, adding to pressure on Fukuda, whose popularity ratings are already sliding. U.S. ambassador Thomas Schieffer said Japan needed to resolve the row for the sake of the global economy. "These are pretty turbulent times in the financial markets and it is important for Japan to have a steady voice that people can rely on to understand what their particular reactions might be to a monetary crisis," Schieffer told reporters. "So it is important for the world economic community to know whose hand is on the tiller of the Japanese central bank." The parties cannot even agree on when to vote on the BOJ nominees, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party wanting a vote on Friday and the Democrats seeking one on Wednesday -- to give time for an alternative nomination if Muto is voted down. "It is not desirable to have the BOJ chief position vacant, so we should make a decision quickly," Hatoyama said. Hisaoki Kamei, secretary general of the small opposition People's New Party, told reporters there was no support at the opposition meeting for Muto or Ito, who serves on a government advisory panel, while no views were expressed about Shirakawa. If a replacement is not found for Fukui before he retires, a temporary governor would step in but analysts say it is unlikely that a stopgap governor would take long-term decisio
