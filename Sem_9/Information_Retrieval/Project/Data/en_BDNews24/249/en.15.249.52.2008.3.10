<TITLE> BRTA to introduce digital driving licences </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority will introduce digital licences for drivers where all related information would be compressed, an official said Monday. BRTA chairman Sunil Kanti Bose said they had taken the decision to reduce cheating as duplication of licence is widespread. "We want to start work on digital licensing by next two years," Bose told reporters at the BRTA headquarters in the city. The chairman said they were working to reduce the timeframe for issuing licences. "Previously getting blue book needed even years. Now a car owner will get it in a week. In some cases, may be it will take at best one month," Bose said. He said BRTA officials filed cases against 714 vehicles in the capital between Feb 26 and March 6 after examining documents. As many as 66 vehicles have been seized during the time for not having proper documents, he said. Bose said they would be able to take ramshackle vehicles off the streets once the proposed Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 2007 is promulgated. He said the BRTA needed autonomy to provide people with better services. bdnews2
