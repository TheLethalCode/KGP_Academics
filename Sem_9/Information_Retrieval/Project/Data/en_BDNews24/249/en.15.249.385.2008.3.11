 ISLAMABAD, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani man who lost his passport in India while there to watch cricket in 2005 was buried on Tuesday a day after his body was sent home from India where he had been imprisoned as a spy, his brother said. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have improved their relations after nearly going to war a fourth time in 2002 but they are still deeply suspicious of each other.

We have taken very strong notice," said the spokesman, Mohammad Sadiq. He also said India had not given a cause of death. Referring to last week's release of the Indian prisoner, the brother Sadiq said: "We send their man with garlands as a gesture of friendship but got the dead body of our brother in return." The neighbours launched a peace process in early 2004 and began sending cricket teams to each others' country soon after that.
