<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose by more than 2 percent by midday on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve and other major central banks unveiled measures to inject liquidity into strained money markets, which pushed up financials. Banks replaced utility and energy stocks as the best performers on the broader market after the Fed said it would lend up to $200 billion in Treasury securities to primary dealers and would act in concert with the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank to calm the money markets. HBSC shares were the top positive weight on the broader market, rising by nearly 5 percent, while Banco Santander was up 4.5 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland gained nearly 7 percent. The DJStoxx index of European banks was up 4.5 percent, set for its largest one-day rally since Jan. 24. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 2.3 percent at 1,283.86 points by 1307 GMT. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 12 to one, compared with a ratio of about four to one earlier in the day. "The Fed appears to be working or stepping beyond just the interest rate measures which clearly some people were starting to believe just weren't working," said Philip Isherwood, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort. "Predictably equities have rallied on the back of it and bond yields have backed up. But I think we'd still expect the Fed to do more next week," he said. The Fed has cut US interest rates by 125 basis points to 3 percent so far this year to shore up the broader economy against slowing consumer spending and a deteriorating employment backdrop triggered by the slump in the housing market. Investors already widely expect the Fed to cut rates again when it releases its monetary policy decision on March 18. Insurers also gained after the Fed announcement. Germany's Allianz rose nearly 5 percent, while France's AXA gained 4.9 percent and Britain's Prudential rose 4.1 percent. Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis rose 5.5 percent after Web site El Confidential said Santander and several sovereign wealth funds were among candidates who may inject up to 2 billion euros in Fortis. Santander and Fortis declined to comment. VODAFONE UP Beyond financials, Vodafone was one of the largest positive influences on the market after a positive brokerage comment from Goldman Sachs, which added the company to its "conviction buy" list, lifting the stock 3.1 percent. Spanish utility Iberdrola was also among the largest positive weights on the broader market, rising by nearly 6 percent after a report in free newspaper Negocio saying France's EDF would launch a bid for the company. Crude oil futures hitting record highs for a fifth day in a row helped boost shares in BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total by 2 to 3 percent. Among declining stocks, Finland's Nokia lost 4.2 percent after Texas Instruments cut its first-quarter forecasts citing a weak market. European aerospace group EADS fell 4 percent after it posted a worse-than-expected 2007 net loss. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was on track for its largest one-day rise in about a month, but is still down 15 percent this year, led by financials which have borne the brunt of investor unhappiness over mounting losses linked to a meltdown in US subprime mortgages. "The Fed will probably cut by 50 basis points, but people will be interested in hearing their comments on the crisis in the banking sector," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Swiss bank Pictet. "The main fear in the market still surrounds the real situation around bank balance sheets, and the mood is deeply dubious about what banks will report for the first quarter." Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns are all due to report over the next ten days. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was up 2.7 percent, Germany's DAX was up 2.2 percent and France's CAC was up 2.4 percent
