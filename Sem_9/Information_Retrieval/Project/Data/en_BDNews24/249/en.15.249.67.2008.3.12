 Quebec City, Quebec, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Canadian soldier was found dead in Afghanistan on Tuesday but enemy action has been ruled out, officials said. He was the 80th member of Canada's military mission to die since 2002. Bombardier Jeremie Ouellet, 22, was discovered at the main Canadian base in the southern city of Kandahar. No further details were available. The Canadian Parliament on Thursday was expected to approve exending the 2,500-member mission to the middle of 2011 from the scheduled end date of February 2009.
