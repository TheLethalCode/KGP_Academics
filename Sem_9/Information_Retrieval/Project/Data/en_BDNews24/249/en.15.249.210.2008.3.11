<TITLE> Estonia, Latvia to sign US visa deal, despite EU ire </TITLE>

 STRASBOURG, France, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Estonia will ignore protests from the European Commission and sign a bilateral visa and air security deal with the United States on Wednesday, the Baltic republic's president said. Fellow Baltic state Latvia is also due to sign an agreement on Wednesday, its Foreign Ministry said, adding to a row between the European Union executive and some new member states keen to get visa-free treatment in the United States. President Toomas Hendrik Ilves said Estonia had kept Brussels informed at every step of its talks with Washington. "Estonia, which will sign a memorandum of understanding tomorrow, has been pursuing this for four years and has kept the European Commission informed at all times about what we are doing," Ilves said on Tuesday. "The Commission only now has decided to say something ... No one seemed to care during this process," he told reporters during a visit to the European Parliament. "To continue this line of thought, it occasionally strikes me as odd that countries that have visa waiver programmes, and have had them for decades, should suddenly say you can't have one," Ilves continued. Latvia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that its aim was to end inequalities in the treatment of EU citizens travelling to the United States. Most EU states are already part of a U.S. visa waiver programme which allows people to travel without visas, but not 11 of the 12 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007, or older member Greece. The Commission, which has already tried to press the United States to grant visa-free access to all 27 EU states, was due to ask member governments on Tuesday for a mandate to act as sole negotiator on securing visa-free access to the United States. But the efforts of European Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini to keep the negotiations as the exclusive competence of Brussels have been undermined by new members of the bloc agreeing to do bilateral deals. The Czech Republic angered the Commission and some older member states last month when it signed a deal to make it easier for Czechs to travel to the United States visa-free in exchange for enhanced air security cooperation. Hungary is expected to do the same later this month. Countries signing such pacts do not get immediate visa-free status, but Washington will make access easier when they fulfill a number of security criteria. For the Czech Republic, these include more cooperation on passport and airport security and armed sky marshals. US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is due to sign the visa and air security deals with Estonia and Latvia on Wednesday, a day before before he meets Frattini and other senior EU officials for talks in Sloven
