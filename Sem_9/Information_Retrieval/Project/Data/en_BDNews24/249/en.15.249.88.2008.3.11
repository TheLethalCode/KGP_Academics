 MOSCOW, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO will trigger outright secession by Georgia's Moscow-backed rebel regions if the alliance puts Georgia on the path to membership, Russia's ambassador to NATO told Reuters on Tuesday. The Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions already run their own affairs but pro-western Georgia's bid to join NATO could cement the split and make it more likely foreign states will recognise the separatists, Dmitry Rogozin said in interview. Moscow is fiercely opposed to ex-Soviet neighbour Georgia joining the alliance, and the warning was delivered three weeks before a NATO summit in Romania at which members will consider whether to initiate the membership process for Georgia. "Abkhazia and South Ossetia do not intend to join NATO. They have a completely different view," Rogozin said in a telephone interview from Brussels. "(Georgian President Mikhail) Saakashvili knows about that. It is precisely for that reason he conducted a referendum (on NATO membership) everywhere except South Ossetia and Abkhazia." That decision was an "historic mistake", said Rogozin, "because in this way he personally excluded Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia." And Rogozin added: "As soon as Georgia gets some kind of prospect from Washington of NATO membership, the next day the process of real secession of these two territories from Georgia will begin." He signalled this could mean Russia throwing its weight behind the separatists' campaign for international recognition, a possibility that alarms Georgia's Western allies who say its territorial integrity should be respected. "My personal view is this: we will have no arguments remaining to stand in the way of this process," he said. Rogozin said recognition would be a matter for Russia's political leadership: "But I can put it like this -- I see the situation fairly objectively and I am sure that my prediction corresponds to reality." KOSOVO CONNECTION Western states are wary that Russia could use Kosovo's split from Serbia as a precedent to justify recognising the Georgian breakaway regions. Georgian leader Saakashvili is pressing for his country to be granted a NATO Membership Action Plan, the first step on the path to joining, when alliance members meet for their summit in Bucharest on April 2-4. Russian President Vladimir Putin is to attend the event, becoming the first Kremlin leader to take part in a NATO summit for six years. Responding to Rogozin's comments, NATO spokesman James Appathurai said the alliance had taken no decision on whether to offer Georgia a Membership Action Plan. "That being said, NATO allies fully and strongly support the territorial integrity of Georgia under any possible scenarios," he said. Abkhazia and South Ossetia threw off Tbilisi's rule in fighting in the 1990s. They do not have international recognition, though Moscow provides aid and most of the population hold Russian passports. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, backed by Western powers, says the two regions must remain part of Georgia. They redoubled their campaign for recognition after Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. The Georgian separatists accuse the West of a double standard by recognising Kosovo but refusing to do the same for them. The European Union voiced concern this week that Russia may be preparing to recognise Abkhazia, the bigger of the two rebel regions which lies a few kilometres (miles) from the site where Russia will host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. Moscow announced earlier this month it will drop formal trade restrictions on Abkhazia, a largely symbolic move to signal its support for the separatists. Tbilisi condemned the decision, saying it was an attempt to destabilise Georg
