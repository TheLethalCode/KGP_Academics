<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Academic activities at Jagannath University came to a standstill Tuesday after protests over an alleged assault on a teacher. Teachers, general students, employees as well as members of other student bodies took part in the protests. The teacher's forum announced a five-point programme to condemn the incident. Scheduled classes and exams were not held. The teacher was meted out indecent behaviour last Sunday when she refused to permit a group of "unruly students", led by Md Imran Hossain and Md Yunus, to take another student, Shahinur Rahman Ovi, out of a Bangla Department classroom saying that permission would not be granted while class was in progress. The group of students, angered by the refusal, later also got on the same bus as the teacher and allegedly assaulted her. Several teachers and students took part in the demonstration that started around 8am Tuesday and took out a procession from Kala Bhaban through the JU campus to gather in front of the Shaheed Minar around 11am. Addressing the gathering, Dr Nurul Alam said: "We will continue our demonstration until these criminals in the guise of students are punished." Science Faculty dean and Teachers Forum conveyor Dr Abu Yusuf announced the five-point programme that includes expulsion of the students responsible, suspension of classes until justice is served, arrest of the offenders within 24 hours, submission of a memorandum to the home affairs adviser and IGP and demonstration in front of Shaheed Minar from 11am every day wearing black badges. Chhatra Dal, Chhatra League and Chhatra Union held joint protests on campus. Meanwhile, Bangla Department Professor Amena Khatun in a case filed with Kotoali Police Station on behalf of her colleague accused third-year social sciences student Md Imran Hossain, and second-year student Md Yunus of involvement in the incident. Vice-chancellor SI Khan said the offenders would be expelled and punished severely after the investigation committee filed its report. bdnews24.co
