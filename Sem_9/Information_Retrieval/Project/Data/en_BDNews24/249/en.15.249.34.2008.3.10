<TITLE> Malaysian prime minister sworn in after poll debacle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kuala Lampur, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's prime minister was sworn into office in a colourful traditional ceremony on Monday, despite a dramatically reduced majority that makes it tough for his government to push through its projects. But Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's future as leader is in doubt after he saw his party's record majority collapse in a general election at the weekend, giving control of five of the nation's 13 states to opposition Islamists and reformists. Abdullah, dressed in traditional Malay costume, read the oath of office in the ruler's imposing domed palace in the Malaysian capital, surrounded by cabinet members and government officials. Abdullah's multi-racial National Front, or Barisan Nasional, coalition has effectively ruled Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957.
