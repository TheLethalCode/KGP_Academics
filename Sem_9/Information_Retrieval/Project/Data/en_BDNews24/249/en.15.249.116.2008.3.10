<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)The unstable commodity prices that are plaguing ordinary people need urgent action "based on the economic realities", commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday. "Policymakers at the highest level of government are busy discerning why efforts to check commodity prices have failed," the adviser said. Speaking to reporters at the inauguration of the two-day South Asian Sociological Conference held in the city, the adviser said the government has been watching the situation closely. "The government closely monitored the recent instability in the edible oil market. Keeping the markets stable requires coordination of the interests of the producers, consumers and traders." All possible measures for redress were being considered, the adviser added. "The advisory council has been discussing the hurdles and the shortfalls in the commodity market, and in the demand and supply chains, exhaustibly." Zillur said he was set to speak to the chief adviser about the matter in a couple of days and then share the relevant strategy with the media. "We'll have an open discussion with the media as soon as we hold the meeting with the chief adviser." He said policy was being discussed at the highest level of government to discern why efforts to check spiralling prices have so far been ineffective. Zillur stressed: "The government has been sincere in all its interventions so far to keep commodity prices stable." Following a meeting with businessmen in February, the market looked more or less stable for a brief period between Feb 24-Mar 2, but again registered fluctuations in prices of essentials. "We have to review the whole situation, taking into consideration the international market prices of essentials, effective monitoring of market prices at home and other relevant issues," the adviser said. "The government's decisions have to be based on the economic realities, keeping the needs of the poor multitudes in focus at the same time." The opening session of the South Asian Sociological Conference was presided over by Independent University, Bangladesh vice chancellor Prof Bazlul Mobin Chowdhury. Conference convenor Prof Nazrul Islam, Indian Sociological Society president Prof Uttamrao Bhoite, its former president Partha Nath Mukherjee and Pakistan Sociological Association president Fateh Mohammad Burfat were among those who addressed the session. bdnews2
