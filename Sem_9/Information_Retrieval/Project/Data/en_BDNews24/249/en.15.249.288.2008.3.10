<TEXT>
 BEIJING, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China trotted out its hand picked delegates to represent Taiwan at the annual session of parliament on Monday, but for many of them memories of the island are fading fast, if indeed they have ever even been there. Despite not governing Taiwan, the ruling Communist Party appoints its own officials to China's parliament to represent Taiwan, to enforce its claim the island is just a wayward province and should rightfully be run from Beijing. The representatives are mainly Taiwanese Communists who went to China just before or after the civil war, their descendents, or defectors who abandoned Taiwan in the years following 1949, when the defeated Chinese Nationalist fled to the island. "Although we can only go rarely, that does not mean we're not regularly in touch. We talk to the Taiwan businessmen in China," Taiwan delegate Chen Qinghai told reporters on the sidelines of parliament. "I have relations there. It was only my parents who came over. The rest of the family stayed," he added. "The other side won't let us go. It's hard to apply." Chen, whose day job is as a government anti-corruption official in the poor inland province of Anhui, has only been to Taiwan once. "I'm from Wulai," he said, referring to a rural area outside of Taipei perhaps better known for its waterfall. "I've been. I took a photograph." Wu Qiongkai, who works as a tax inspector on the southern resort island of Hainan, has never been. "My deepest impression? My deepest impression? Er, the, er, level of production there," he struggled to answer when asked what his most overwhelming impression was of Taiwan. The head of delegation, Liang Guoyang, defended the make up of his group, saying it had been "democratically elected" and was very representative, adding its main role was to help the hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese businessmen in China. "Most of us are second generation, born on the mainland," he admitted, refusing to offer any other defence when queried by reporters, aside from saying: "I've already answered that". The delegates used Communist phrases like "socialist market economy" and "harmonious society", which would sound distinctly out of place in Taiwan, with its free-wheeling and sometimes chaotic democracy. They barely mentioned the island's upcoming presidential election, sticking mainly to stock expressions about opposing Taiwan independence. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, and in recent years has been incensed by pro-independence comments from President Chen Shui-bian. Taiwan reporters attending the delegation's meeting could barely suppress their giggles at some of the staid answers they received, being more accustomed to dealing with feisty Taiwanese politicians. "They don't represent us," one Taiwan reporter remarked dismissively of the delegat
