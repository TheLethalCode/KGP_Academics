<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)  The executive committee of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) sits Monday to fix the much -awaited dates for the extraordinary general meeting and the annual general meeting. "We need an approval of the statutes of Football Associations at district and divisional levels through the EGM or the AGM before holding the BFF election, and we are going to sit together to fix the dates," said BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu Sunday. The AFC and the FIFA last year instructed the BFF to form FAs before going to hold its election by April this year, but the BFF high-ups seemed to be reluctant to hold the EGM or the AGM. But, the AFC on Friday instructed them to hold EGM or AGM to approve the FA statutes and country's football governing body has decided to hold its executive body meeting to fix the schedules. The meeting will also discuss the national team's participation in the upcoming AFC Challenge Cup and finalise a date for the residential football camp. Malu said they would finalise a camp date and coach Abu Yousuf would pick his preliminary squad for both the AFC Challenge Cup and the SAFF Championship.
