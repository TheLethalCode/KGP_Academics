<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)Detectives have arrested the suspected mastermind of the much publicised BRAC Bank heist that took place at the start of the year, a DB inspector said Tuesday. Sakur Mahmed Sukkur was arrested by the Detective Branch (DB) in Keraniganj on March 5, which brings the number of arrested in the case to 23. Almost 3000 grams of the stolen gold has so far been recovered, according to the police. The theft was discovered on Jan 5, when the bank reopened after a two-day holiday. It was then found that a gang had broken open 62 lockers in the bank's Sukrabad branch and made off with a large amount of gold jewellery. The gang gained access to the banks vault through a second storey room in the Hotel Nidmahal. Detective police inspector AKM Nasirullah told reporters that all the arrested members of the gang had confessed to their involvement. "Sukkur confessed to checking out the site before the robbery with the help of some accomplices," said Nasirullah. "Then their plan involved sending an accomplice named Abu Taher to stay in the hotel for a day or two to get to know the layout." "They drilled through the hotel floor over a period of one-and-a-half months before looting the vault," said the detective police inspector. Sukkur told DB officers that Raja Miya and one Hanif used a rope to climb down into the vault from the second floor before making their escape by the same route, Nasirullah said. The police officer said they then divided the stolen goods into 19 parts in their hotel room. Sukkur confessed to receiving five parts of the divided haul, which he then had an accomplice send to Chittagong. His share of gold was sold for eight lakh taka, said the officer. "Police have so far recovered about six lakh of the eight lakh taka. Sukkur gave the rest of the money to an immigration agent to arrange his travel abroad," added Nasirullah. bdnews
