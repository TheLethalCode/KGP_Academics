 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were little changed on Monday, as strength in oil stocks and talk of M&A activity offset concerns over US economic growth. At 1216 GMT, the FTSEurofirst was down 0.1 percent at 1,268.12 points in a volatile session and after falling to its lowest closing level in more than six weeks the previous day. After data on Friday showed the US labour market was struggling, worries over the global growth outlook kept miners under pressure. Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Antofagasta were down between 4 and 4.7 percent. Oil stocks were the top performers as crude prices remained within sight of an all-time high, just below $105 a barrel. BP was up 2 percent, Royal Dutch Shell added 1.1 percent, and Total rose 0.3 percent. HSBC jumped nearly 2 percent after reports the global bank would try to raise its stake in Bank of Communications, China's fifth-largest lender, beyond 20 percent when regulations allow. HSBC declined to comment. Elsewhere, banks were mixed, with BNP Paribas down 0.4 percent, and RBS up 0.6 percent, while three-month lending rates shot to their highest in two months as credit market conditions deteriorated. "We are still advising clients when you want to be short the market, short the index, and don't short too much individual names, because we've seen some take-outs," said Philippe Gijsels, senior equity strategist at Fortis Bank. "Let's not forget that this is a problem that at the moment is very much in the financial sector, but not that much in the other sectors just yet." The FTSEurofirst 300 has fallen by 16 percent so far this year and is more than 20 percent below last July's 6-1/2 year peaks as the deterioration in the credit markets has hit the financial sector particularly hard. Spanish utility Iberdrola SA was up 2.9 percent, as news that the Socialist Party would stay in power fanned speculation sector consolidation would go through more smoothly, dealers said. Gas Natural jumped 4.6 percent. Iberdrola, Spain's top utility by market capitalisation, has been in play since it emerged that shareholder ACS had held talks with France's EDF on a break-up bid that would also include Union Fenosa, controlled by ACS. The strength in utilities helped Spain's main Ibex index up 0.5 percent, outperforming Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40, which were all down between 0.1 and 0.3 percent. M&A TALK Volkswagen rose 1.8 percent as Focus magazine reported, without citing sources, that Porsche plans eventually to raise its Volkswagen stake to 75 percent in order to achieve a domination and profit transfer arrangement. Porsche was down 0.4 percent. Porsche denied it would seek to increase its stake in Volkswagen, while Volkswagen declined to comment on the report. Swiss logistics firm Kuehne + Nagel fell 3.6 percent after it gave a more cautious outlook and its profits missed forecasts. The extent of the weakness in US data fuelled the view the Federal Reserve will cut rates again, but the market struggled to stage a rebound. Data on Friday had shown the biggest monthly fall in US jobs in five years. "Certainly in the US we've gone through a key support area, so I would have thought we would continue to head down, particularly in the light of last Friday's non-farm payrolls and the growing conviction that the US is now in recession," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin. "Bad news for profitability, among other things, so that's going to put pressure in the European markets." On Friday the US central bank said it would add $200 billion to the banking system in an emergency bid to ease persistent liquidity strains that have led to a global credit free
