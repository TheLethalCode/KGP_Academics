<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  The National hockey players Monday demanded increase of the number of pool players for each club ahead of the inter-club players transfer, scheduled for March 23 to 26. The Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) last week brought 26-players under the pool system with allowing each club to rope in a maximum of five players on their side. The bracketed players Monday gathered at the federation and demanded an increase of the pool quota to seven from five so that the players could play in good teams after two years. They also met with BHF general secretary Sajed AA Adel and placed a written demand on expansion of the quota. "I have assured them of doing something though the decision has to come from the league committee," Adel told bdnews24.com. Adel hinted that the number of pool quota might be increased to six from five. Under the pool system in 2006, some pool players like Asif, Titu, Shishu, Mokshed, late Shamim and Shuvo had to wait up to the last minute to find the team and they were signed up with low placed-teams.
