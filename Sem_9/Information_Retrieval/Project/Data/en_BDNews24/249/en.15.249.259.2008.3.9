<TEXT>
 BERLIN, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German railway operator Deutsche Bahn and union officials were to meet for last-minute talks on Sunday to prevent new strikes, but the company said rail traffic would be disrupted on Monday even if a deal was reached. After a first round of negotiations on Saturday, the head of train drivers union GDL said he was optimistic a planned strike could still be avoided if Sunday's talks were successful. But the rail operator said it had already arranged for reduced train services and adjusting to a no-strike situation would take some time. "We can no longer undo the substitute time table," a spokesman for Deutsche Bahn said, adding traffic was set to be disrupted on Monday. GDL had threatened strikes from early on Monday, escalating a months-long wage dispute with Deutsche Bahn. If the rail strikes were to go ahead, they would coincide with a separate labour dispute at Berlin local transport operator BVG, which has paralysed bus, tram and underground services in the capital since last Wednesday. German rubbish collectors, nursery workers and other public sector employees could also stage new strikes, after talks between the government and service sector trade union Verdi ended on Friday without a wage deal for some 2 million federal and local government staff and headed for arbitration. Separately, workers at postal delivery firm Deutsche Post could also go on strike from April, Verdi has said. Economists and business lobbies have voiced concern that a series of high wage deals in Europe's largest economy risked driving up inflation. This year has already seen a 5.2 percent pay rise for German steel workers, their biggest in 16 years. The head of Germany's BDA employers association Dieter Hundt said excessive wage deals would threaten jobs. "If Verdi and GDL get down to business, they are threatening the current positive development of the economy and of the labour market," Hundt told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. "Continued strikes could lead to a situation, where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year," he said. In January, Deutsche Bahn and GDL ended months of tortuous wage negotiations and long, disruptive strikes with a deal that gave the union's 34,000 drivers an 8 percent pay increase from March and another 3 percent rise from September. But they are still haggling over a so-called basic wage contract, which would set out how wage deals Deutsche Bahn had agreed with other unions fitted in with the GDL accord. Deutsche Bahn has said it wants to keep its employees under the aegis of a sector-wide agreement. But one of GDL's core demands is that it have its own deal. GDL head Manfred Schell expressed optimism after Saturday's talks that the strikes could still be avoided. "If it continues like this, we will get through," he sa
