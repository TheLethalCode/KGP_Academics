<TEXT>
 New York, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pop singer Janet Jackson, whose fluctuating weight has fascinated the tabloids for years, is co-writing a book about her journey as an "emotional eater." A title and publication details are expected to be announced soon, but Jackson hopes to have the book out by the end of the year. She is collaborating on the project with her nutritionist, David Allen, she told Billboard.com. "It's not just this sterile, weight loss and how to do it book, but my journey even from when I was a kid ... being an emotional eater," said Jackson, who is 41. "It takes you through those moments in my life up 'til now and what worked for me. And hopefully within that, if it doesn't work for them, maybe they'll find something that does work for them and a nice place for them to be content with who they are." Jackson, who said last month on CNN's "Larry King Live" that she liked French fries, sweets, caramel and candy apples, reportedly put on 60 pounds in 2006. She currently occupies the No. 1 spot on the U.S. pop album chart with her latest release, "Discipline," and plans to tour later this year
