<TITLE> Blatter shows no sign of slowing down at 72 </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Millions of men tend to take things a little easier by the time they reach their 72nd birthday but FIFA president Sepp Blatter appears to be moving into overdrive. He was spending his birthday on Monday chairing a FIFA technical committee meeting in Zurich, after a flying visit to Gleneagles in Scotland for the annual meeting of the law-making International Football Association Board (IFAB). Asked if he was going to find time during the weekend to play a round at Gleneagles, one of the greatest golf courses in the world, Blatter, laughed. "It's a wonderful game, golf, but let's talk about football," he told Reuters in the luxurious surroundings of the Gleneagles Hotel. Blatter joined FIFA as technical director in 1975. By 1981 he was the body's general secretary, a post he held until 1998 when he was elected president. He has had his ups and downs over the last decade and this week a court case into the collapse of FIFA's former marketing partners ISL opens in Switzerland. Some observers say it could prove damaging to FIFA; Blatter disagrees. "FIFA has nothing to fear," he said. "We welcome the case, we were the ones that brought it." FIFA was a very different organisation when Blatter arrived. "FIFA employed 11 people then, now we have 300 people and football is the global game. We all know this but we have to respect our history, our past and our responsibilities. HUMAN NATURE "It is not just about money and the big clubs. We have many problems in football but I believe in the good side of human nature. "I believe we can maintain football as a very important factor, not only to provide entertainment but also to bring emotion and passion and to integrate people and bring hope around the world. Of course that is easier said than done, too." Blatter admitted that greed and the sheer economic dynamics of soccer made those ideals hard to attain. He said football provided the livelihoods for some 260 million people around the world and there was only so much FIFA could do to maintain standards. As he celebrates 10 years as president, he seems determined to leave a lasting legacy for the sport. When he might retire is anyone's guess. Before he quits, he wants to have the "6 plus 5" quota system in place throughout FIFA's 206 member nations to preserve, or re-introduce, some national identity to clubs. By 2012 he wants every club to start games with a minimum of six players eligible to play for that club's home international side and is not put off by European laws which forbid restraint of trade on grounds of nationality. "We have established the specificity of sport in the EU treaty and I am sure the European Parliament will understand what we are trying to do is for the good of the game. "You cannot have a European solution to a worldwide problem either and we are prepared to fight for this. Fans must start to have a national identity with their own teams again." LIFE BANS In the last few weeks he has condemned as "a joke" English Premier League plans to host a 39th competitive league match overseas and he is also determined to ban players who commit violent fouls. "There is no place for someone who wants to demolish another player in the game. They should be banned for life," he said. He is also against, but admits he is powerless to stop, wealthy overseas owners taking control of foreign clubs. "I do not like it," he said. "It is like a fashion now for a rich man to buy a football club. For a while they wanted to buy a Formula One team, or a personal golf course, or they have race horses and now it's football. The football community should pay attention to such things." Blatter keeps a close eye on every development in the game: the role of agents, third-party ownership of players, foreign coaches taking over at major countries and the laws of the game. On Saturday, FIFA finally ended all experiments with goal-line technology, something he had opposed for years. That decision was taken by the IFAB, a somewhat obscure arm of FIFA that is the game's ultimate law-making body. Formed in 1886, it comprises the four British associations and four from FIFA and rarely makes major changes to the laws of the game. "It is one of the reasons football remains such a great game. FIFA once had a general secretary between 1981 and 1998 who always wanted to change things. You may know who he was. The International Board stopped a lot of his ideas -- and they were right," he laughed as he left to make the draw for the Scottish Cup semi-finals before heading back to FIFA House in Zurich; definitely not via the golf course
