 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)The government expects a bumper boro output this season subject to continuation of the ongoing favourable climate for the next two months up to harvest time. If the boro-friendly climate continues, rice supply from domestic sources will start building up in the first week of May. The boro harvest in low-lying areas will start in the last week of April and continue up to the first week of June, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). Farmers began cultivating boro from the last week of December. The DAE says that boro has been cultivated on 46.6 lakh hectares of land against the targeted area of 45 lakh hectares this year. The boro production target for the fiscal has been estimated at 1.75 crore tonnes. Last year, 1.59 crore tonnes of boro was produced on 43.67 hectares of land against the annual target of 1.66 crore tonnes. The government projects total rice production at 3.27 crore tonnes in the current fiscal (July 2007 to June 2008). "If the current favourable climate lasts up to the first week of June and rains take place in time, we will have a bumper production of boro, about 58 percent of the country's rice production, this season," Shahidul Islam, DAE director (field service), told bdnews24.com Monday. He said that owing to the price hike of rice and the spectre of a possible food shortage, farmers had cultivated as much boro as they could this year to increase rice production. "As per the field reports, the farmers have cultivated boro to secure food supply in their own interest and hoping for better prices too," he said. Shahidul said that the recent mild rain and sunny weather had contributed positively to the boro cultivation. According to DAE officials, flash floods, hailstorms, draughts and pest attacks were the risks that could hamper boro production. "We have put our agriculture offices on alert to possible pest attacks," a DAE deputy director told bdnews24.com. The rice production over the past year was badly hampered as two severe floods and a cyclone washed away or badly damaged standing crops across the country. The aman crop cultivation target of 1.3 crore tonnes in the ongoing season could not be harvested owing to the calamities. The country's food security depends heavily on the boro production in the current season since the government and private dealers have been facing problems in importing rice and wheat. Last year's natural calamities have made Bangladesh more dependent on import of rice this year to feed the population. On average, Bangladesh imports 10-20 lakh tonnes of food every year. bd
