 MANCHESTER, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A post mortem examination is due to be held on police chief Michael Todd on Wednesday after he was found dead at the foot of a cliff in north Wales, police said.

Todd, 50, married with three children, had spoken to colleagues about problems in his personal life in the days before his death, according to media reports.

His inquiry found no evidence to support the allegations. He helped police the Queen's Jubilee celebrations, the Notting Hill Carnival and the large May Day demonstrations in London.
