 Jane Barrett MADRID, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's governing Socialist Party won Sunday's election by an increased margin, but just short of an absolute majority, according to early official results. With 33.1 percent of the vote counted, the Socialist party was projected to win 170 seats in the 350-seat lower house. The conservative Popular Party, which had trailed in every opinion poll before the election, was on 150 seats. In the 2004 elections, which Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero won in a last-minute turnaround, the Socialists won 164 seats and the PP 148. Three out of five exit polls had put Zapatero on the verge of an absolute majority, which requires 176 seats. With both parties' policies broadly similar for tackling a sharp slowdown in economic growth, financial markets would welcome an overall majority as a sign of stability as Zapatero would not need to court smaller parties to pass laws. "All the exit polls agree the Socialists have won. It is the leading party in terms of votes and seats," Socialist party organization secretary Jose Blanco told reporters. PP officials said their result could be better than the exit polls suggested because voters were often unwilling to admit to voting conservative outside the polling booths. MARKET NERVES Most opinion polls in the run-up to the election pointed to a Socialist victory, but none suggested they might grab an overall majority. Analysts have said such a clear victory would calm market nerves about Spain, which is heading into an economic slowdown after a decade of stellar growth fuelled by low interest rates, easy borrowing and European Union funds. The economy dominated the election campaigns as 300,000 people joined the jobless queues in the space of nine months, most of them from the construction sector. Several analysts have cut their 2008 growth forecasts to about 2 percent after 3.8 percent growth last year and some worry that things could get worse if property companies start defaulting on their huge piles of debt. As well as managing a slowing economy, the next government will have to crack down on the Basque separatists of ETA, whom all parties blamed for the point-blank shooting of a former Socialist councilor on Friday. The PP also sold immigration as a major policy issue for the first time in Spain, a 10th of whose population is now made up of foreigners, many of whom work in unskilled, low-paid construction jobs -- the sector leading the economic slowdown. Samira Oukhiar, a Moroccan who has lived in Spain for seven years and works for an Arabic cultural association sponsored by the Socialists, turned up at party headquarters to watch the election results come in. "The community I represent has been very frightened by the way immigration has been used in this election and some have asked me what will happen to us if the PP win," she said. In 2004, voters turned out en masse and brought the Socialists to power three days after train bombs that the PP initially blamed on ETA, but which turned out to be the work of Islamist militants.
