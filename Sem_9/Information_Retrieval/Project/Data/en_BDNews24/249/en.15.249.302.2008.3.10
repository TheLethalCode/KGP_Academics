<TITLE> SC ends appeal hearing on ACC wealth notice to Hasina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com) - The Supreme Court Monday concluded the proceedings of an appeal hearing against a High Court order that had ruled illegal the ACC wealth notice on Sheikh Hasina. A seven-strong bench of the Appellate Division chaired by chief justice M Ruhul Amin heard concluding statements from both sides and said the court would stand in recess until the verdict. The Anticorruption Commission served the wealth statement notice on Hasina last year shortly after her arrest on July 16. On Nov 21, the High Court quashed the proceedings of the ACC notice and declared it illegal upon a writ petition of the detained former prime minister. The ACC in turn appealed the High Court ruling. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said in his concluding remarks to the court Monday: "There was no inquiry or investigation before the notice was served. This is illegal and ill-designed. It has no legal merit." Attorney general Fida M Kamal countered: "The ACC has gone by the law to serve the notice for Sheikh Hasina's wealth statement." The court asked the attorney general if there was any proof that the ACC had conducted an investigation before serving the notice. The attorney general answered: "Only the notice has been served, no case has been filed. So there's no question of investigation." "There's no relation between her the arrest and the notice. The ACC is an independent body," barrister Fida said. bdnews2
