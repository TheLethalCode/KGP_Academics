<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand are expecting a much better England team in Wellington than the one that lost the first test by 189 runs, captain Daniel Vettori said on Wednesday. England were bowled out for just 110 in the second innings at Seddon Park but Vettori's side are under no illusions about their opponents' mental strength going into the second match on Thursday. "I'm expecting them to come (back) very strong," Vettori told reporters on Wednesday. "They're a resolute side and very well led. I know Michael (Vaughan) will be asking a lot of them. "There is personal pride at stake as well. Guys will be wanting to step up and turn up and put in performances that are worthy of their ability." New Zealand, considered the underdogs before the three-match series, dominated in Hamilton, batting positively and bowling consistently to plans. "Confidence can turn pretty quickly and if we can turn up on the first morning and do a job, bat or ball, then hopefully we can carry that on," Vettori said. "But if England turn up and turn the tables quickly, then they'll be the ones carrying the confidence. "The responsibility is on us to do it well and hopefully carry on some of that momentum from the Hamilton test match." While the Basin Reserve pitch appears to have more grass on it than that at Hamilton, Vettori said his side would need to adjust to the conditions. "That's the thing about cricket, you travel around the world and have to adapt to the conditions," he said. "That's the thing about good teams... we have to make sure that we can win in any conditions in front of us. "You look at Australia and they have been able to produce good performances in any conditions. "Whilst I'm not saying we're comparing ourselves to the Australians, if we want to be become a consistently good side then we have to turn up time again and perform in any condition
