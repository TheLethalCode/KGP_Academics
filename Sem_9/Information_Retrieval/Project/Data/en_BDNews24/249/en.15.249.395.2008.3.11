 CAIRO, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian shares recovered from three days of declines after a shaky start on Tuesday, and the market awaited 2007 results from Orascom Telecom (OT), the dominant share in the market. Brokerages and bankers estimated that OT, which operates mobile services from North Africa to Bangladesh, would report net profit of between 11.7 and 13.0 billion Egyptian pounds ($2.1 and $2.4 billion) for 2007. Much of the income would come from capital gains, they added. OT shares closed 1.1 percent higher at 79.00 pounds. The results are expected about 1600 GMT. Brokers said the market received no major news to move prices but was generally bullish, especially for big-cap stocks. Ezz Steel rose 8.7 percent to last trade at 82.90 pounds and investment bank EFG-Hermes ended the day 2.8 percent higher at 60.09 pounds a share. Investors see the Egyptian market as relatively immune from the troubles on markets in other parts of the world. Some brokers say it has benefited and will continue to benefit from perceptions that it is a refuge from developed markets. "The Egyptian market looks good compared to the disasters happening elsewhere. It's a safe haven," Bassim Arida of CIBC brokerage said. Alexandria Mineral Oils (AMOC) fell 0.4 percent to 79.42 pounds after the Capital Market Authority rejected its request for a five-for-one share split. The authority has decided to take a tougher line on share splits because it suspected that companies were using them to stimulate short-term prices rises driven by retail investors. The benchmark CASE 30 index, which has risen about 7 percent this year, rose 0.61 percent to 11,295.57 points. The widely watched Hermes index ended the day 0.25 percent up to 98,990.59 points.
