<TEXT>
 BUDAPEST, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungarians went to the polls on Sunday to vote in an opposition-sponsored referendum over whether to abolish doctor and university fees. Although the vote looked likely to pass, it is not expected to threaten the position of Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, whose Socialist-led government has slashed the budget deficit with unpopular tax rises and subsidy cuts, as there is currently no challenger to Gyurcsany in his own party. At least 2 million of Hungary's 8 million voters have to say "yes" for the three referendum questions to pass and even pensioners, traditional backers of the government, appeared to be supporting the opposition Fidesz party's call. Pollster Szonda Ipsos predicted late on Friday that turnout would be between 40 percent and 45 percent and the "yes" votes would be between 81 and 83 percent of those cast, which is enough for the referendum to be valid. "To me, the 300 forint ($1.72) (doctor) visit fee is not petty cash like the government says," said Erszebet Papp, a pensioner, after casting her vote. "This government promised the opposite, that healthcare would remain free," Papp added. Polls close at 1800 GMT and first results are expected at around 2000 GMT. Analysts say that even if the government, which introduced the health fees and university tuition fees last year to curb budget expenditure, loses the vote the consequences will be muted both politically and for the budget. "The budget impact from the three items under question is not big, around 0.1 percent of gross domestic product," Lehman Brothers economist Silja Sepping said in a note. "So, abolishing the fees should not endanger Hungary's fiscal consolidation efforts," Sepping added. He noted however that victory for the opposition could further unnerve foreign investors in Hungarian markets, which have been hit hard by the global credit crunch. Hungary has been struggling to cut what has been the 27-nation European Union's biggest budget deficit and analysts forecast the 2008 deficit at 4 percent of GDP, down from 5.7 percent in 2007. The referendum loss could increase tensions within the ruling coalition however, but it is not seen falling ahead of elections in 2010. "Both sides have hedged their bets and are already looking beyond the referendum and both sides have set up escape routes... so in a political sense, the parties are already done with the referendum," political analyst Zoltan Kiszelly sa
