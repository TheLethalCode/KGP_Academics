<TITLE> Impact of climate change falls unequally: Queen's Commonwealth message </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)This year's Commonwealth Day message from the Queen focused on global climate change concerns and their particular impact on the developing world. In her annual message, the head of the Commonwealth echoed the concerns of least developed countries, stating: "The impact of pollution falls unequally." "It is often those who pollute the least - notably in the world's least-developed nations - who are closest to the razor's edge: most affected by the impact of climate change and least equipped to cope with it." The Queen stressed that the environmental choices available were not the same for all nations. "In some parts of the world, for example, fossil fuels can be used more sparingly and buildings can be made of more efficient, sustainable materials." "It is far harder to expect someone to adapt if he or she relies on the trees of a local forest for fuel, shelter and livelihood," the Queen said. She also spoke of competition for fresh water among a growing global population becoming a source of potential conflict in the world. "Our own attitudes to the environment, and the use we put it to, may have consequences for people on every continent and for every ocean and sea." Recognising the interests and needs of those most affected by environmental changes was an essential part of bringing about lasting change, Queen Elizabeth said. British prime minister Gordon Brown also voiced grave concerns about global climate change, in his Commonwealth Day message. He stressed the need "to take urgent action today to guarantee tomorrow's future", and spoke of "the urgency and gravity of the situation". "The only way out is, together, to build a low carbon global economy as soon as we can," the prime minister said. March 10, Brown said, was the day when the UK reflects on its Commonwealth membership and heritage, "and looks ahead to the challenges facing us and our fellow member states". He highlighted the fact that the Commonwealth brings together a critical cross-section of countries  industrialised countries with significant greenhouse gas emissions, emerging economies, energy producers and poor and vulnerable states, some of whose very survival is directly threatened by climate change. Commonwealth States share the same dilemma, he said. "We need to find a way to grow and develop our economies without destabilising the climate." bdn
