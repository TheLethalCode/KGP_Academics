 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)The government has given final approval to a new legal provision to strip MPs of their influence over Upazila Parishad, a government spokesman said Monday. At a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, the interim cabinet also decided to transfer power from the local government ministry to the Election Commission to announce schedule for upazila elections, CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said. The government had earlier agreed in principle to amend some provisions of the Upazila Parishad Act 1998. According to the old Upazila Parishad Act, local MPs were advisers to the Upazila Parishad, but the amended law ended the provision. The latest move was meant to curtail the interference of lawmakers with the Upazila Parishad affairs. The final approval for the amendment came in line with recommendations by a committee formed by the interim government. The committee headed by adviser and former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali had been tasked with making suggestions to strengthen and modernise local government bodies. It had recommended that the lawmakers should be stripped of the powers of being automatic advisers to the Upazila Parishad in their constituencies. bdnews2
