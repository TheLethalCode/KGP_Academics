 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club and Biman Bangladesh extended their winning streak while Old DOHS recorded their second win in the Premier Cricket League Tuesday. A blazing century from opener Imtiaz Hossain powered Mohammedan to an emphatic 79-run win over Young Pegasus at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. Skipper Sawar Hossain hammered fifty to inspire Biman to a hard-fought two- wicket win over Victoria Sporting Club at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Half-centuries from Hamidul Islam and Monir Hossain guided Old DOHS to hand a tense 12-run defeat to Sonargaon Cricketers at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Mohammedan vs Pegasus Mohammedan stepped on a wrong foot losing Emrul Kayes (10) after opting to bat first, but opener Imtiaz along with Rashdul Haq (30) piled up 78 runs for the second wicket before the latter was removed by spinner Sabbir Khan, who returned three for 30. Imtiaz added another 61 runs for the fourth wicket with Pakistani Aqeel Arshad (32) before he was the victim of Sabbir for 101 off 117 balls that studded nine fours. Later, Suhrawardi Shuvo quick-fired 23 off 20 balls taking the Motijheel-based outfit beyond the 200-mark. In reply, Pegasus nerve seemed to stand against the Mohammedan bowlers after being reduced to 77 for seven in half way of the game and they finally ended up 146 for nine in 50 overs. Spinner Shuvo and pacer Tareq Aziz wrecked havoc taking three wickets each for 10 and 30 respectively though opener Ashiqur Rahman (33), Nazmul Hossain (26 not out) and Jamiul Alam (20) provided some resistance. Biman vs Victoria Despite a bad start, Victoria posted a fighting total of 241 for nine in 50 overs with Farhad Hosssain (48), Nasiruddin Faruque (40), Enamul Haq (39), Mahmudullah Riad (38) and M Shahajada (31) playing the key role in the match. Pace duo Alamgir Kabir grabbed three wickets for 46 while Mahbubul Alam took two wickets for 36. In reply, Biman had to wait to the last over to find their third triumph as they reached 244 for eight with two balls to spare. It seemed that it was tough for Biman to reach the target with 34 runs needed in 26 balls after Sajjad Kadir was the seventh batsman out for 34, leaving the side at 207 for eight in 45.4 overs. But, late order Alamgir (26) and Mahbubul Alam (20) blunted the Victoria bowlers to add 37 runs in 24 balls for ninth wicket to give the national flag carrier third win in as many matches. Earlier, Sanwar Hossain (51) and Arman Hossain (31) piled up 66 runs for the third wicket to repair the initial damage after Biman were reduced to 30 for two. DOHS vs Sonargaon DOHS's decision to bat first seemed wrong after losing opener Mahbub Alam (0) in the second over. But opener Sakib Razzak (40) and one-down Hamidul Islam (68) repaired the setback before Monir Ahmed blazed a 53-ball 54 to give DOHS a defendable total of 240 for nine in 50 overs. Sonargaon, in reply, got off to a fine start with openers Elias Sunny (32) and Mehrab Hossain Opee (27) putting up 60 runs. One-down M Huymaun (48), Aram Hossain (43), and Salahuddin Khan (31) gave them a solid ground before Khan left the side at 195 for five in 41.1 overs. But, they dramatically lost the last five wickets in 34 runs and slumped to 228 all out in 48.2 overs to concede third defeat in a row.
