 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said Monday that the retail price of rice is yet to come down to a tolerable level despite adequate supplies in the market. The adviser made his remarks at a seminar on food security organised by the Economic Reporters Forum at the National Press Club. Shawkat said the problem arose from a shortfall in national food stocks, although the caretaker administration was addressing the matter. "The government's contingency stock of food should be at least 10 lakh tonnes. The amount should not fall below that level, and it is better if it remains higher," he said. The adviser said the caretaker government currently has food stocks of around five lakh tonnes. "From Tuesday, seven to eight thousand tonnes will be added to the amount every day," said Shawkat. To date, 29 lakh tonnes of rice and wheat have been imported into the country at both the governmental and private level, the adviser said, adding that the amount would stand at 40 lakh tonnes by next June. According to the adviser, the yearly domestic production of rice stands at about 2.5 crore tonnes, although not all of it comes onto the market. "Between 40 to 45 percent of the rice comes to market, the rest remains with the farmers. Although rich farmers can keep rice at home, poor farmers cannot afford to do that," said Shawkat. The adviser stressed the need for the government to maintain its food stocks to ensure the food security of less well off people. The process of monitoring and pre-evaluating food in the market is being strengthened in addition to identifying fallow land that farmers will be given assistance to cultivate, said the adviser. Former commerce minister and Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed said if the government had maintained its 10 lakh tonne food stock the market situation would not have deteriorated to such an extent. bdnews
