<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  A top prisons official Monday said detained leader Sheikh Hasina would be allowed out of jail for treatment soon, as she showed "a positive attitude" towards hospitalisation. Brigadier General Zakir Hasan, inspector general of prisons, said authorities had not yet decided, however, if she would be treated locally or abroad. He spoke to reporters after a meeting with home affairs adviser MA Matin at his Secretariat office, in which he informed the adviser about the latest on the treatment of the Awami League chief. "Sheikh Hasina will be hospitalised very soon since she is positive towards that. After necessary tests a decision will be taken on where she will actually be treated," Hasan said. Asked to specify, the IG said: "Previously she was admitted to Square Hospital. If she wants to be admitted there again we will do that. If she has an alternative choice, we have no problem." On whether a medical board would be formed for her, the IG said: "A decision on that will come after her hospitalisation." An Awami League leader, meanwhile, said they would welcome any move such by the government. "If the government goes for it, we will welcome it," Hasina's political secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. The Awami League has long been demanding overseas treatment for the party chief. Hasina's personal physicians, who have visited her separately in the jail over the past few days, have also suggested Hasina should be sent to the US for treatment. bdnews24.com/mk
