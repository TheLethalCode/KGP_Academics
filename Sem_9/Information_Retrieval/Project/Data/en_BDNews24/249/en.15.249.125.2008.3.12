 LONDON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 1.2 percent early on Wednesday, led by banks and commodity shares after the joint move by major central banks to inject cash into strained credit markets. By 0821 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 68.8 points at 5,759.2 after advancing 1.1 percent in the previous session and ahead of British Finance Minister Alistair Darling's budget speech at 1230 GMT. Insurer Standard Life climbed nearly 9 percent to top the gainers' list on the FTSE 100 after it posted a forecast-beating rise in 2007 operating profit, despite a 249 million pound charge as UK customers continued to cash in policies early. Peers Old Mutual and Aviva were up 4.4 and 1.8 percent, respectively. The UK benchmark index is still down 10 percent for the year, with investors rattled by fears of the credit crisis pushing the US into recession. Analysts welcomed the move by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks but added it was too early to predict whether it would be successful in boosting markets in the medium term. "It shows global central banks are taking it very seriously and are doing everything they can," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. "We will see whether or not it will be effective." "In terms of sentiment, that comes at a very good time when sentiment is kind of bottoming out. We were seeing major equity markets were returning to late January's low levels and it was starting to look a bit bleak." Banks, which have been clobbered by credit market turmoil in recent months, also gained sharply. Barclays advanced 3.4 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland 3.1 percent, Alliance & Leicester 1.1 percent and Lloyds TSB 3.1 percent. HBOS was one of five losers, down 1.4 percent after going ex-dividend. Major European indexes were also higher in early trade. US stock indexes rallied 3.6 to 4 percent on Tuesday after the Fed said it would add up to $200 billion to unlock credit market strains in a coordinated effort with other central banks. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average gained 1.6 percent on Wednesday. Oil shares were in demand as crude prices steadied near a record high of $110 a barrel. BP tacked on 0.7 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 0.4 percent. In the mining sector, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, Vedanta Resources and Lonmin were up between 1.6 and 3.9 percent. AstraZeneca was up 0.7 percent after the drugmaker said a US court would hear its patent case against Teva and Sandoz, which are seeking to make a generic version of schizophrenia drug Serquel, from Aug.
