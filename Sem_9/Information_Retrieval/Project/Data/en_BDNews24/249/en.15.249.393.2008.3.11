 BRUSSELS, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belgium and its banks and insurance companies will pay 35.2 million euros ($54.5 million) to compensate for the theft of possessions from Jews during World War Two, a government-sponsored commission said on Tuesday. A further 75.4 million euros has been set aside for a Belgian foundation to honour the victims of the Holocaust and for its social, religious and cultural projects for Belgium's Jewish community. The Belgian state collaborated actively with Nazi Germany in persecuting Jews during World War Two, according to a report commissioned by the Senate and published last year. Relatives of Holocaust victims welcomed the move, but said that the Belgian state should now look deeper into its responsibility for a policy of discrimination and the deportation of Jews to concentration camps. "Indemnificating is not all," Judith Kronfeld, director of the Belgian Judaism Foundation, told Reuters. "We need to find out the responsibilities of some Belgian personalities in the discrimination, persecution...and deportation of Jews and Roma." Kronfeld and Micha Eisenstorg, president of the Union of the Jewish Deportees of Belgium, said Belgian authorities should now follow-up on last year's Senate report. "SYMBOLIC" Eisenstorg said he was satisfied with the work of the indemnification committee, although the money handed out was merely "symbolic". Nearly 6,000 victims and relatives have claimed compensation, 80 percent of them granted sums ranging from 400 euros to over 20,000 euros to cover stolen property, unpaid wages, furniture, jewellery and businesses. In some cases, the loss could not be determined. A lost business, for example, would then result in a payment of a modest 1,500 euros lump sum. "This law has nothing to do with moral compensation... It is on material goods that have been stolen," said Lucien Buysse, head of the indemnification commission. Isaie Gruszow, born in 1939, complained during a news conference that his family had not been adequately compensated for its losses, saying a few hundred euros did not cover the rare books and jewellery taken. Some 30,000 Jews were deported from Belgium during the war. Of almost 25,000 adults sent to camps, 1,455 survived, the indemnification commission said in its repo
