 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A storm rushing in from the Atlantic lashed the south west on Monday as high winds and tides brought the risk of coastal flooding. Gusting winds brought down trees and ripped tiles off roofs, damaging power lines and cutting electricity to parts of south Wales. The Environment Agency issued seven severe flood warnings around the Cornish and Devon coastlines and advised local people to check the agency's flood hotline and listen to local radio.

"We are saying to people, stay away. It's very impressive to watch but these waves could come over at any time.
