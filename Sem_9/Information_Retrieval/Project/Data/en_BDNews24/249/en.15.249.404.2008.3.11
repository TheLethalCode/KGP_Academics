<TITLE> Croat PM to ask parliament to end fisheries zone </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Zagreb, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader will ask parliament to give European Union countries fishing rights near its waters, ending the implementation of a no-fishing zone that had stalled EU membership talks. Sanader, who met all parliamentary parties on Tuesday, said EU membership was Croatia's priority. "Both the fisheries zone and the EU are our national interests. But we in the HDZ (ruling party) think the EU is absolute priority and most leaders of parliamentary parties think the same". The parliament will discuss the issue on Wednesday. "If parliament confirms this, it will be a difficult decision but the right one for Croatia's future," said Sanader, who was re-elected for another four-year term in November and rules in coalition with two small centrist parties. At the start of the year, Croatia added EU members to the list of those it has barred from fishing in the zone, which reaches into the middle of the Adriatic and is aimed at preserving fish stocks and limiting pollution. Italy and Slovenia complained the move breached Zagreb's earlier pledge not to apply the zone to EU states. The European Commission made clear Croatia's accession talks would stall unless the issue was resolved. Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who visited Zagreb last week, said Croatia's accession talks should gather pace as soon as the issue was resolved. "Mr Rehn has given us guarantees that the talks will accelerate after the fisheries issue is resolved and I am convinced this will indeed happen and we shall finish the talks by the summer of 2009," Sanader said. Many Croats, including some nationalist parties, say the zone's suspension is a "capitulation in the face of an EU ultimatum". But Nacional weekly said local businessmen were being practical. "Message from businessmen: Down with the (fisheries) zone, long live the EU," the weekly's front page said. It said the booming tourism industry, as well as export-oriented firms, would only suffer if membership talks were further postponed. Sanader said his government aimed to continue talks with Italy, Slovenia and the European Commission to remove their objections to the zone which would remain in force for all other countries except EU members. Croatia, which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, has made joining NATO and the EU its top strategic goal, which should boost its economic prosperity and ensure political stability after the turbulence of its Yugoslav past
