<TITLE> NU plans to overhaul exam system to prevent question leaks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)  The National University is planning to bring a change to its examination system to stop the recurrent leaking of exam questions, the acting vice chancellor said Sunday. "We are going to introduce such a system so that question papers cannot be leaked out," Professor Syed Rashidul Hasan told a meeting at the National Press Club. His announcement comes in the wake of recurrent allegations of leaked NU exam questions in recent months. Hasan also announced a decision by the university academic council to offer a new Master's course in "computer information technology" for students in post graduate colleges under the National University. The education ministry has already approved its introduction, and university authorities are now awaiting the green light from the Planning Commission, the acting VC said. Prof Hasan said computerisation of the National University Library was underway, in such a way that colleges with online facilities will be able to access the NU's library. The acting VC presented a written report on administration and financial matters, and exam-related and development activities of the university. On reported graft allegations against NU staff, Hasan said: "If any complaint is established steps will be taken based on the report of a probe committee." "Proper measures will be taken whoever the accused are," he said. Sunday's programme was organised by the university authorities and sponsored by BSB Global Network, a consultancy firm that arranges admissions for students to foreign universities. The firm has faced controversy in the past over alleged misconduct in running a shady Dhaka-based campus of a foreign university. Asked why the meeting was sponsored by such an institution, Prof Hasan said that he was not aware of such allegations. bdnews2
