<TITLE> Russian Foreign Minister to visit Middle East </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 moscow , March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will fly to the Middle East next week to drum up support for a regional summit in Moscow amid fresh tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. Chairing a major regional conference in Moscow would be a strong boost in the Kremlin's efforts to present Russia as an authoritative and independent regional player. Lavrov will visit Syria, Israel and the Palestinian Territories on March 19-21, the Foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said in a statement. Kamynin said the regional situation had worsened this year since Israel responded to rocket attacks from the radical Hamas group based in the Palestinian controlled Gaza Strip with air strikes and military operations. "Impetus given to the peace process at the Annapolis summit needs to be supported," he said referring to talks between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders in the United States last November. "In these circumstances, many of our partners have confirmed their interest in holding a Middle East meeting in Moscow," Kamynin added. He said Russia was in consultations on the issue with the Palestinians, Israelis and members of the international quartet also including the United States, the United Nations and the European Union. The Middle East has been one of the key Cold War battle fields where the Soviet Union supported Palestinians versus US-backed Israel. Post-Soviet Russia has improved ties with Israel, but lost most of its influence in the region. Under President Vladimir Putin, whose rule has been marked with the revival of Russia's economic might and global ambitions, Moscow stepped up efforts to regain its role in the Middle East game now dominated by the United States. Lavrov's trip will follow a regional tour by US Vice President Dick Cheney, who will visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank, Turkey and Oman this week
