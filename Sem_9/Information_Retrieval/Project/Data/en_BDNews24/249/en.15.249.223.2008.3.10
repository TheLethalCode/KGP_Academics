<TITLE> Roll up for the Magical Memory Tour </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For millions of fans around the world, the Beatles wrote the soundtrack to their lives. Now they are being used to try to find out what triggers people's most vivid memories. British scientists, testing the link between memory and music in a new psychological study, have launched a "Magical Memory Tour" and asked fans to help create the biggest database of "autobiographical memories" ever attempted. For University of Leeds psychologists Martin Conway and Catriona Morrison, the Beatles were the perfect choice as global icons who spanned different generations, countries and cultures. "The chance to collect a huge body of memories from around the world was too great to resist," Conway told Reuters. "They (the Beatles) map onto people of different ages and still have very broad appeal," he said. "I would hope we are going to amass at least 10,000 memories and possibly even more." The findings will be presented in September at a festival organised by The British Association for the Advancement of Science in the Beatles' home town, Liverpool. The results of the online survey will help the psychologists understand how children develop a capacity for memory, how adults process recollections and how memory changes with age. Participants signing on at www.magicalmemorytour.com should think about the first thing that comes to mind from their life that is related to the Beatles. Was it a song, a special album, a concert they saw or maybe something that happened to their favourite Beatle -- like where you were when you heard the news of John Lennon's murder. "The key thing is to respond with the first memory that comes to mind," said Conway. "Don't try and edit -- just let it happen." He did make one plea: "We are happy to hear about your personal recollections but please spare us any graphic details." Most memory studies look at "flash-bulb" events -- where were you when President Kennedy was assassinated? Where were you when man first walked on the moon? -- but this, thanks to the universality of the Beatles, is designed to be much wider. Take the different reactions of Conway and Morrison. "I remember my mother doing the ironing while I was listening to the album Revolver," said Conway. For Morrison, the first memory is more unsettling. "Mine was Yellow Submarine at my auntie's house. I was about three or four years old. It definitely wasn't a happy memory. I didn't understand this strange adult world. The whole song was weird," she told Reuters. For her, the Beatles are the perfect choice to unearth a whole treasure trove of memories, both happy and sad. "They are global cultural icons that people can relate to in lots of different ways. The Beatles had an important role to play in defining how people shaped themselve
