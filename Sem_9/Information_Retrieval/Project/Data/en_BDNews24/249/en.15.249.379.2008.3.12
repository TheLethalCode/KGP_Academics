<TITLE> Rasheda says women's development policy doesn't contradict Islam </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)Women affairs adviser Rasheda K Choudhury Wednesday said the recently announced women's development policy does not contradict any part of the Quran or Hadith. "Those who are raising their voices against women's inheritance are doing so without reading the policy in depth," said Choudhury at a meeting at the women and children affairs ministry. The adviser's comments come in the wake of recent threats from certain religious quarters to launch a movement against the National Women Development Policy. Choudhury said the policy did not mention women's inheritance rights, although it did talk of assets or resources earned by women entrepreneurs. "A lot has happened in the field of women's development in Bangladesh, but a lot more remains to be done," said Choudhury. "And that is exactly why a comprehensive policy has been drawn up after consultation with individuals from all walks of life." The adviser said previous policies from 1997 and 2000 did not mention the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, a reference document for development, or Millennium Development Goals, which have been incorporated into the new policy. The policy was sent to the law ministry for review before being made public, although the ministry returned it saying it was not a legal instrument and did not require their endorsement, the adviser said. The council of advisers finalised the policy after consultations and review, Choudhury said. The policy recommendations include increasing the length of maternity leave from four to five months, which, the adviser said, may be possible to implement during the caretaker government's tenure. bdnew
