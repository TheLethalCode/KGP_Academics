 BAGHDAD, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi police raided strongholds of the Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia in the southern city of Kut on Wednesday, hunting gunmen who battled with security forces a day earlier. Several Iraqi security officials said the gunmen were members of the Mehdi Army, which is meant to be observing a ceasefire, but the director of Sadr's office in Kut said they were "outlaws" with no links to Sadr. Sadr renewed the ceasefire last month but at the weekend issued a statement telling followers they could defend themselves if attacked. Until Tuesday's fighting, which health officials said killed 13 people, there had been no major reported violations of the ceasefire. Kut police officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Sudad Jamil, said police were in control of the Anwar Sadr, al-Izza, Al-Shuhada and al-Zahra districts, all Mehdi Army strongholds, and had begun raiding homes and setting up checkpoints. A fifth neighbourhood where the Mehdi Army has a presence, al-Jihad, had been sealed off, he said. He had no details of what was happening there as it was outside his unit's area. No fighting was reported in the city. "We have purged four neighbourhoods and arrested a group of Mehdi Army gunmen, including a senior leader," said another police officer, Lieutenant Aziz al-Amara, who commands a rapid reaction unit. Amara said that under interrogation the gunmen had denied breaking the ceasefire and said they had acted in self-defence. However, Kut police chief Major-General Abdul-Hanin al-Amara, said at a news conference that those detained had told police they belonged to a religious movement, suggesting they were not linked to Sadr. He gave no further details. There were differing accounts of what triggered the fighting. Iraqi police said it started on Monday night after a mortar attack on Delta, a U.S. military base in the area. A joint Iraqi-U.S. force had been dispatched to the districts where the mortar bombs were suspected to have been fired. Mehdi Army gunmen confronted them and clashes ensued. The U.S. military said in a statement late on Tuesday that U.S. special forces had come to the aid of an Iraqi security patrol and had been attacked by a large number of "suspected criminal militia fighters". An air strike had destroyed a van loaded with weapons and explosives. The Special Forces unit destroyed two other vehicles carrying machineguns and several gunmen were killed. DEATH TOLL A health official in Kut, who declined to be named, put the final death toll from Tuesday's clashes at 13, including two policemen, three children and one woman. Abu Sadek, director of Sadr's office in Kut, denied Mehdi Army gunmen were involved in the fighting. "These gunmen are outlaws. They are not affiliated to the Mehdi Army," he said. Sadr's ceasefire, which he first announced last August, has been credited by U.S. commanders for helping to reduce sectarian violence between majority Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims that had threatened all-out civil war. But members of the Mehdi Army have chafed at the ceasefire, complaining that it has been used by the U.S. military and rival Shi'ite factions to target them. Scores have been arrested. The fighting in Kut came amid renewed violence across Iraq in the past week, including suicide bombings blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. While noting some increase in violence since January, a Pentagon quarterly report on Tuesday said there had been a sharp overall decline in attacks in the past eight months. "This has unquestionably been a tough few days," US military spokesman Major-General Kevin Bergner told a news conference in Baghdad. "Despite the gains of the past few months we unquestionably have additional work to do." The US military has sought to curb violence in Iraq to give Iraq's political blocs time to pass legislation seen as important for national reconciliation. On Wednesday, Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a member of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, one of the most powerful Shi'ite parties, proposed amendments to a provincial powers law which he vetoed last month after it was passed by parliament. The law, which determines the relationship between the Baghdad government and provincial councils, is seen as paving the way for holding more representative provincial elections by October. Mahdi's party favours giving provinces more powers. His suggestions for revision included removing the right of the central government to remove the provincial governor and dissolve the provincial government. He also called for the provincial government to have greater say in matters concerning oil, gas and heal
