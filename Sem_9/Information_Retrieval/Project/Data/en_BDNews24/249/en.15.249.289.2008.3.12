<TITLE> Overseas fraud hitting British bank cards </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Losses on British plastic cards have surged 25 percent, driven by a near doubling of fraud committed overseas, new figures show. Total card fraud losses rose to 535.2 million pounds in the past year, reversing a two-year decline, according to figures from APACS, the UK payments association. That was driven by a 77 percent increase in fraud committed overseas by criminals using stolen UK card details. That rose to 207.6 million pounds in 2007 from 117.1 million pounds in 2006. Fraud abroad, generally committed in countries that are yet to upgrade to chip and PIN technology, now accounts for 39 percent of total British card fraud losses. Counterfeit fraud -- driven by criminals stealing card details in the UK to make counterfeit magnetic stripe cards for use overseas -- has increased 46 percent in the past year. Card-not-present fraud -- that committed over the phone, over the Internet or by mail order -- is up 37 percent. However, chip and PIN continues to help cut face-to-face fraud committed in Britain. Over the past three years, losses on face-to-face transactions on the UK high street have fallen by two-thirds -- to just 73 million pounds last year from 218.8 million pounds in 2004 -- the data shows. Fraud on lost and stolen cards (at 56.2 million pounds) and mail non-receipt fraud (10.2 million pounds) are at their lowest levels for 10 years. Sandra Quinn, director of communications at APACS, said: "Although card fraud levels have now begun to go up again due to fraud abroad and card-not-present fraud losses, chip and PIN has proven to be an undoubted success in reducing card fraud on the UK high street. "And, as more countries follow our lead and upgrade to chip and PIN, the opportunities for criminals to use our stolen magnetic stripe details overseas will decrease."
