<TITLE> French prosecutor wants US airline to be charged </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A French public prosecutor has asked judges to bring manslaughter charges against US carrier Continental Airlines over the 2000 crash of a Concorde that killed 113 people, the prosecutor's office said on Tuesday. The prosecutor recommended similar charges be brought against a French engineer involved in the development of the now grounded supersonic jet, the former head of France's civil aviation authority and two Continental Airlines staff. A judicial investigation concluded after the July 2000 crash that a piece of metal left on the runway from a Continental flight caused one of the Air France Concorde's tyres to burst on takeoff and send debris into an engine. The plane crashed into a hotel outside Paris. A judge is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to accept the request filed by the Pontoise prosecutor's office, situated outside Paris.
