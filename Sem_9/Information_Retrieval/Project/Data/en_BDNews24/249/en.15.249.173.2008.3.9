<TITLE> Smith steers South Africa home </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  A blazing century from captain Graeme Smith Sunday powered South Africa to a convincing nine-wicket win over hosts Bangladesh in the three-ODI opener at Birshreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Smith hammered his seventh century to remain unbeaten on 103 along with Hashim Amla (9 not out) as South Africa cruised to 180 for one in 36.5 overs after wrapping Bangladesh up for 178. The 27-year-old batsman, who was lucky not to have been adjudged out by third umpire Akteruddin Shahin on 66, smashed 14 fours and one six facing 118 balls. Smith and his opening partner Herschelle Gibbs laid the foundation for a 143-run opening partnership despite a slow start in the face of some fight bowling from Syed Rasel and Abdur Razzak. The opening pair shrugged off the slow start after Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful brought changes as the Proteas batsmen had no trouble playing debutant Mosharraf Hossain Rubel, Shakib Al Hasan and Shahadat Hossain. Explosive Gibbs, fresh from his 102 in his last ODI match against West Indies, made 57 off 84 balls, his 34th ODI fifty, with the help of eight fours and one six before being trapped lbw by spinner Shakib. Rasel was more miserly with 33 runs in 10 overs while Razzak gave away 42 runs in his eight overs. Shahadat Hossain, who was withdrawn after conceding 25 runs in just two overs, eventually gave away 31 runs in three overs and Ashraful must have surely rued the decision to drop pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Mosharraf also was prohibitively expensive, spilling 40 in six overs, but he could have got his debut wicket had the TV umpire not ruled out a Smith catch taken cleanly by Shahadat in the third man area. Earlier, Bangladeshi batsmen once against failed to give a defendable total to their bowlers as there was no exception of Bangladesh's routine top order collapse, except a blazing knock from opener Tamim Iqbal. Tamim played a stroke-filled 82 after Shakib Al Hasan (6), Mohammad Ashraful (8), Shahriar Nafees (12) and Junaed Siddique (6) failed to justify their names after opting to bat first on slow and low track. The left-handed opener reached his fourth ODI fifty driving Johan Botha to long-off for a single and stuck to an end, but got hardly any support from others and was fifth batsmen out, leaving the side at 131 in 34.4 overs. Tamim holed out to long-on by Albie Morkel when he tried to send debutant left-arm spinner Paul Harris over the rope. Charl Lengveldt, Andre Nel and Albie Morkel made the inroads into the Tigers' batting line-up while spinners Johan Botha and debutant Paul Harris wrecked up the middle order. Bangladesh could never recover the slow start and eventually were restricted below 200-mark in the face of some tight bowling from the Proteas, with pacer Nel leading the attack with three for 24, picking two wickets in successive delivery in his 10th over. Harris, Morkel, and Lengeveldt chipped in with two wickets each for 30, 30 and 32 respectively. Bangladesh debutants Dhiman Ghosh (15 not out), Raqibul Hasan (15) and Mosharraf Hossain (8) faced an uphill task to accelerate the run-wheel after the recognised batsmen threw their wickets away. bdnews24
