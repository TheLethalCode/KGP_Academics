<TITLE> UK manufacturers' costs soar at record pace in Feb </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British manufacturers' costs are rising at the fastest rate since records began 22 years ago while factory gate inflation is holding at its highest level in more than 16 years, data showed on Monday. The figures highlight the Bank of England's dilemma as it juggles the risk of rising price pressures against a deteriorating growth outlook. Finance minister Alistair Darling is expected to revise down his forecast for GDP growth this year at his first budget on Wednesday. Bank Governor Mervyn King has already said this year looks like being the toughest for UK policymakers since the central bank won independence from government in 1997. "The Monetary Policy Committee will remain concerned about price pressures coming from food and energy, particularly given the surge in input costs this month," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. The Office for National Statistics said non-seasonally adjusted output prices rose 0.3 percent on the month in February, keeping the annual rate at 5.7 percent, the highest since July 1991. While analysts had predicted an even sharper increase, the fact that input prices are rocketing even more than expected will give little comfort to policymakers. Seasonally adjusted input prices rose by 1.7 percent on the month and by 19.3 percent on the year -- the fastest annual rate since records began in 1986. INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT SLUGGISH Britain's central bank cut interest rates in February to 5.25 percent and most analysts are still predicting another rate cut by the middle of the year as clearer signs of an economic slowdown emerge. Separate figures on Monday showed industrial production fell in January although manufacturing production unexpectedly rose for the first time since October. "January's industrial production data showed that output is not collapsing but nor does the sector appear in any shape to compensate for the slowdown in consumer spending," said Paul Dales at Capital Economics. Manufacturing production rose by 0.4 percent, beating expectations for an unchanged reading. Overall industrial production fell by 0.1 percent, but this was largely due to lower utilities output as January was unseasonally warm. The statistics office said revisions to the industrial production data for the fourth quarter of 2007 would, on their own, add 0.02 percentage points to the existing estimate for GDP growth. The Bank of England is charged with keeping consumer price inflation at 2 percent. But sharp rises in food and energy prices are increasing the risk of it staying well above that target, making it harder to justify interest rate cuts despite ongoing financial market turmoil. "The strength in input and output prices is likely to be reflected in further rises in consumer price inflation in coming months," said Michael Saunders at Citigroup. He said that even weak economic growth and squeezed margins were unlikely to prevent consumer price inflation rising above 3 percent in the coming months -- a level that would require Bank Governor Mervyn King to write a public letter of explanati
