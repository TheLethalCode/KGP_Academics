 Beijing, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has closed the north face of Mount Everest to expeditions until after the Olympic torch ascends its peak, an adventure Web site said on Wednesday, prompting protests from groups advocating Tibetan autonomy. The Expedition Web portal www.mounteverest.net carried a notice on its site from the Mountaineering Association of Tibet Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China asking climbers to postpone their ascents until after May 10. "Concern over heavy climbing activities, crowded climbing routes and increasing environmental pressures will cause potential safety problems in Qomalangma areas," said the notice, dated March 10. "We are not able to accept your expedition, so please postpone your climbing project until after May 10," it said. Everest is known in China by its Tibetan name, Qomalangma. Chinese troops invaded Tibet in 1950 and nine years later the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile after a failed revolt against Chinese rule. Tibet has since become a point of contention between Chinese Communist rulers and those who advocate independence or greater autonomy for the region, and the government fears the Beijing Olympics in August becoming a flashpoint for potentially destabilising protests. Earlier this week, Tibetans all over the world took to the streets to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the uprising. More worrying to China, an estimated 300 monks defied authorities by staging a rare protest in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. Radio Free Asia said armed police fired tear gas to disperse the gathering, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said was "an illegal activity that threatened social stability". The Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet said China, whose capital Beijing is host of the 2008 Olympic Games, was using the torch relay to bolster its territorial claim. "This is an ominous indication of the controls that China is likely to impose as the flame travels from the top of Everest through Tibet," ICT president John Ackerly said in a statement, referring to the moratorium on visas. The torch is to scale Mount Everest in early May, with the precise date to be determined by the weather. Tibet's status has already become a flashpoint for protesters ahead of the Summer Olympics, which open on Aug. 8. Last April, China deported five Americans after they unfurled "Free Tibet" banners at the base of Everest. A few months later, on the eve of the one-year countdown to the Games, China detained six people who staged a similar protest on the Great Wall.
