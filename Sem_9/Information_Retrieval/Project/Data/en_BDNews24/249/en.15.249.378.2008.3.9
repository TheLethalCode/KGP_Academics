 Cox's Bazar, March 9 (bdnews24.com)Deputy inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Haque said Sunday that the general perception of the police in Bangladesh was far from perfect, although efforts were being made to remedy the situation. "Most people in the country do not have a good impression of the police, in fact most people fear the police," said Haque at a community consultation on the draft police ordinance 2007 at Cox's Bazar Zila Parishad auditorium. "Efforts are being made to remedy the situation, and the 2007 draft police ordinance has been promulgated to assist in this," said the DIG of Chittagong range. Journalist Tofael Ahmed, based in Cox's Bazar, said the practice of 'crossfire', which has become euphemism for extrajudicial killings by the security forces, was inhumane and legal provisions must be enacted to eradicate the practice. Former Cox's Bazar Bar Association president and Awami League leader Sirajul Mostafa said the police had to be stopped from misusing Section 54 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 54 has been widely criticised for its abuse by the police, who have been accused of using it to arrest anyone they wish for the slightest infraction of the law. Muhammad Shahjahan, the district Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer, said the police should be given ethical training. Representatives of the local community who attended the discussion called for exemplary punishment to any member of the police found to have wrongfully arrested or taken a bribe from an innocent person. A call was also made at the consultation to ensure the 2007 ordinance becomes effective as soon as possible in light of the outdated 1861 Police Act, which remains the bedrock of existing police legislation. bdnews2
