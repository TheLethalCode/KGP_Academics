<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Monday said the government 'completely failed' to contain the runaway prices and went on to accuse it of not doing enough to put brakes on skyrocketing prices. Acting president Zillur Rahman made the remarks receiving relief for Sidr-battered people from Abu Dhabi Projonmo Bangabandhu at his Gulshan home in the afternoon. Asked whether the blame lay squarely on the Awami League as it said it was supporting the caretaker government, he said, "We support the roadmap announced by the government. We sympathise with people for the sufferings caused by the price hike. However, time will say what to do." The acting party chief urged the government to arrange immediate dialogue 'without killing time'. "We have all along been speaking for dialogue. Election date should be announced at least four months before the voting. Elections will be held in December. But if the date is announced now doubt will disappear." Asked whether his party would boycott the local government elections if they are held before the Jatiya Sangsad elections, Zillur said they would make a decision after discussion in the party forum and with the 14-party alliance. "The national election has to be held first. The elected representatives will hold the local elections." The party's policymaking presidium member Abdur Razzak at a talk show on state-run Bangladesh Television had recently commented that local elections could be held before the parliamentary polls. Pressed for comment on the issue, Zillur said, "It is not the party decision." To another question, he said, "There is no need for a national security council." On detained party chief Sheikh Hasina's treatment, Zillur said, "I would urge the government to release our leader as per the doctor's advice and give her the opportunity to receive treatment at the United States." Asked about the discussion they had with US charge d'affaires Geeta Pasi Sunday on Hasina's treatment in the US, Zillur said, "The US has no objection [to Hasina being treated in that country]." Zillur also said they did not have any discussion with the government on Hasina's going abroad for treatment. bdnews
