<TITLE> Court acquits Imelda Marcos of salting away cash </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Manila, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Philippine court acquitted former first lady Imelda Marcos of 32 counts of illegally transferring money abroad on Monday due to insufficient evidence. "This court cannot in all conscience convict the accused on the basis of mere hearsay and on the basis of documents which were not authenticated and proved in the proper manner," Judge Silvino Pampilo said in his judgement. "The accused has the constitutional presumption of innocence." Marcos, renowned for her extravagant shopping trips and huge shoe collection, clasped her hands when the ruling was announced. "I am so happy and I thank the Lord that the 32 cases have been dismissed," Marcos, dressed in a green traditional Philippine dress with a gemstone brooch and matching earrings, told local television. "This will subtract from the 901 cases that were filed against the Marcoses," said the widow of late Ferdinand Marcos. The Marcoses, their relatives and business cronies were accused of looting up to $10 billion from state coffers during his 20-year rule but Imelda has been cleared in most of the cases against her due to insufficient evidence. Only about $1.8 billion has been recovered and many of the tycoons suspected of benefiting from courting the Marcoses remain in control of their companies. Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in an army-backed popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. Imelda returned to the Philippines in 1991 and is a regular sight in Manila, where a new generation of Filipinos look on her as a well-coiffed eccentric.
