South Africa needed 188 runs in 10 overs  double the runs of the combined squad  to win the match. The children of Sir Salimullah Orphanage were over the moon, having had the opportunity of a lifetime to spend time with South African cricketers. South African coach Mike Arthur played in the game while pacer Morne Morkel stood in as a umpire and adjudged one of his teammates run-out giving in to the demand from the orphans from the gallery. Sajib, an orphan, took a wicket with his medium-pace bowling as hundreds of orphan children cheered their side on from the gallery.
