<TITLE> New Zealand will maintain positive attitude - Bracewell </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand will continue to attack and play the second test against England in just as positive a manner as they did the first, coach John Bracewell said on Monday. New Zealand beat England by 189 runs in the first test at Hamilton's Seddon Park after they bowled the visitors out for just 110, while chasing 300, on the final day on Sunday. The home side adopted a positive approach to their batting, scoring 470 in the first innings and shuffled batsmen around the order in the second to try and up the scoring rate and set a target in excess of 300. "I don't think we know anything different," Bracewell told reporters when the team arrived at Wellington airport. "We have very few draws in test cricket these days because of the way we play our cricket. "We make no apology for that. It's the saviour of test cricket that there are results and intrigue over the last couple of days. "You never defend the scoreboard. We're looking to compete in every match, we've just got to get the skill base to compete over long periods of time." Bracewell also praised the performances of bowlers Chris Martin, Kyle Mills, Daniel Vettori and Jeetan Patel as the best effort he had seen since he became national coach. "I don't think it's ever been surpassed, it's the best I've seen," he said. "We lost probably three overs in the match where we went away from our plans, collectively it was one of the outstanding bowling performances." The second test begins at Wellington's Basin Reserve on March 1
