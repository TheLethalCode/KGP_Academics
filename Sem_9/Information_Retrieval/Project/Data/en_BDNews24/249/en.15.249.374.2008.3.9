 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)Communications adviser Ghulam Quader said Sunday that he was not in favour of holding the national polls under the state of emergency. But the elections could be possible in a state of emergency if certain rules are relaxed, the former major general said. The adviser told reporters in his office that the country's most credible elections were held in 1970, and that "those had taken place during a state of emergency". The adviser in fact referred to the December 1970 elections under the martial law of Pakistan. The adviser said the caretaker government has specific plans on whether the state of emergency will be withdrawn, although he failed to elaborate on the matter. Most political parties in the country have been calling for the emergency powers rules to be lifted prior to the elections. The Election Commission also requested the caretaker administration to lift the state of emergency to create a favourable atmosphere ahead of the polls. On Feb 14, law adviser Hassan Ariff said the emergency powers rules were not a bar to voting, although they did prohibit electioneering and political rallies. For these to take place, the law adviser said, the emergency rules have to be relaxed. Later on Feb 28, Ariff said: "The emergency should be withdrawn prior to the national elections. Discussions are underway in this regard." bdnews24.c
