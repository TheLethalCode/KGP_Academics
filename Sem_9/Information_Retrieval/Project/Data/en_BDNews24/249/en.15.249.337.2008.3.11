<TITLE> Demanding CEC's resignation will derail elections: Hafizuddin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed Tuesday said demands voiced recently for the resignation of the chief election commissioner would put the elections in jeopardy. "Such controversy will only push the election toward uncertainty. It's not right," Hafizuddin said during a press briefing at his Banani home. He said the briefing was arranged to call upon all standing committee members to try to "see the two BNP currents flowing as one". "Let's end stringing conditions, passing comments and delivering statements and sit together to establish joint leadership instead," he said. "We want to see the two BNP currents flowing as one to make the party strong and united," Hafizuddin said. "To that end, Saifur Rahman has contacted Khandaker Delwar (Hossain) on several occasions, but in vain." "We think the unification will be smoothly executed once we sit without attaching any conditions as we all accept Khaleda Zia as our leader," the acting secretary general said. Putting forward arguments for the validity of the Oct 29, 2007 standing committee meeting that appointed BNP's 'reformist' leaders to key positions in the party, Hafizuddin said: "That meeting sat to discuss ways of conducting party activities in the absence of its chairperson." "Saifur Rahman being the second senior-most leader in the party naturally acted as the chairperson in charge on the occasion." He said the meeting did not approve of the manner of last year's expulsion of BNP's former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan from the party, which was illegal according to the party constitution. Replying to reporters' questions, he said Khaleda was innocent. "She will certainly emerge free and acquitted of all charges, as no specific charges have so far been levelled against her." He said the party had failed in the past to practice democratic norms, as meetings of the standing committee and executive committee did not take place for considerable periods. "Reform proposals were tabled to facilitate groundwork for democratic practices and to address the inconsistencies within the party," he clarified. He called upon the government to hold the elections according to the election roadmap or even earlier, by September, if possible. Other party leaders were also present at the briefing. bdnews24.
