 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)US Charg d'Affaires Geeta Pasi said Sunday the US desired to see "free, fair and fully participatory" elections by the end of 2008 as promised by the caretaker government. Full Story The US envoy underscored the important role the political "parties will play in this process", in her separate meetings with acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman and former BNP finance minister M Saifur Rahman. The twin meetings were also attended by other leaders of both parties. "Ms Pasi intends to meet with other political leaders over the next few weeks," the US embassy in Dhaka said in a statement. Pasi discussed a wide range of issues, focusing on the current political situation in Bangladesh and the status of implementation of the electoral roadmap, set by the Election Commission. Pasi noted the importance of dialogue between the political parties and the government to establish the proper conditions for holding elections. "With regard to those imprisoned on corruption charges, Ms Pasi underscored the need to observe due process. She noted that the US is closely monitoring the trials of those accused of corruption, including the two former prime ministers (Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia)," the statement said. The US Embassy had requested permission to send observers to the trial of Hasina, according to the statement. The US wants the elections in Bangladesh to be held no later than the end of December, Pasi told reporters after the meeting with Zillur Rahman of the AL at his Gulshan home. "I had started meetings to exchange views on the current political situation. We had a very productive discussion (with the Awami League leaders), and we discussed a number of issues." "I think that we all share common view that we want elections to be held no later than the end of December 2008," she said. "We also discussed some of the issues that the Awami League is focused on. One of the points I would like to underscore for all of you is, this meeting underscores, I think for all of us, how important the dialogue is." Pasi referred to the demand for dialogue between the government and political parties, which she said would be an important step forward. Later, AL's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "We talked in a very cordial atmosphere. The discussion has been very successful." The US believes there will be no deviation from the elections promised by year-end, he said. Replying to a question, Ashraful said: "We want the Jatiya Sangsad election ahead of local government elections." Ashraful also said: "She (Pasi) is worried about the health condition of Sheikh Hasina. She wants proper treatment for her at home or abroad. She said human rights must not be violated in any way in the trial of Sheikh Hasina." Pasi also held a one-hour meeting with BNP reformist leader Saifur Rahman at his Gulshan home on dialogue with the government. After the meeting, Saifur told reporters: "I had discussed the political situation and election process with the US envoy." "We told her that parliamentary elections should be held in September before the local government elections," Saifur said. "If the elections are delayed, the situation will deteriorate due to the price hikes of commodities and economic slowdown." "The situation may become normal if power is handed over to an elected government as soon as possible," he said. bdnews24.
