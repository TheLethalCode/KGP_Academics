 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brit Insurance Holdings Plc reported 2007 profit ahead of analyst expectations and announced a special dividend, but its shares fell on worries over its exposure to the subprime crisis. Pretax profit of 191.2 million pounds ($385.2 million) was ahead of analyst expectations of 180.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates, with forecasts ranging from 169 million to 195.4 million. It made 186.3 million in 2006. Its earnings were helped by the lack of US hurricane claims, a foreign exchange gain, higher investment income and reserve releases. But the shares fell as much as 4 percent in early trading on Monday and were down 3.4 percent at 214.25 pence at 0840 GMT, due to continued anxieties about its subprime exposure. Brit has been dogged by worries over its exposure to claims from the subprime mortgage crisis. Its shares have fallen 38 percent since July, during which time they have underperformed the UK non-life insurers index by 29 percent. Brit said it had set up a reserve of 62.5 million pounds, net of reinsurance, to pay for claims from the saga. "There is a concern about subprime that is still there and which will continue to drag on the shares," said UBS analyst Jon Firkins. He said the 25 claims notifications the company had so far received, which may or may not turn into claims, were well ahead of the number received by its peers. "The numbers are okay and I'm sure they've been as cautious as they can be, but there's considerable uncertainty over subprime," said Firkins. Brit CEO Dane Douetil told Reuters in a telephone interview he hoped its shares would recover after reassurances it had given over its exposure to the crisis. "Hopefully the statement today will make it clear that on the asset side we have no exposure and that on the liability side it's entirely understandable and containable." The company recommended a final dividend of 7.4 pence per share, plus a special dividend of 7p. Brit said it was confident about the future despite the downturn in the global economic outlook and said the stabilisation in UK motor rates towards the end of 2007 gave it hope the market should start to improve later this ye
