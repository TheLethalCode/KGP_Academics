 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh has been invited Tuesday to play five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match against Pakistan in April. "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has invited Bangladesh to take part in a 5-match ODI Series and a Twenty20 International in April, 2008, and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has agreed in principle to the Tour of Pakistan," said a press release Tuesday. The statement said the tour details were being worked out and would be announced soon. Australia Tuesday postponed their planned tour of Pakistan in March-April, citing the safety of their players, which may have prompted the PCB to invite Bangladesh to Pakistan. "We knew that Australia pulled out of their tour, and we are also concerned over the security," BCB media committee chairman Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobi told bdews24.com by phone Tuesday. "We believe the PCB will provide enough security for our players during the proposed tour," said Bobi. A BCB official, not wishing to be named, said: "The timing of the tour might be changed as the Bangladeshi cricketers will be passing a busy time in domestic cricket during April." The world champions were due to visit Pakistan at the end of this month for a 30-day tour but put the trip on hold after a spate of suicide bombings following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto late last year. bd
