<TITLE> Asia stocks rally on Fed liquidity injection </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rebounded on Wednesday, with major indices gaining around 2 percent, after the US Federal Reserve and other central banks teamed up to inject liquidity into strained credit markets. The US dollar was unable to sustain the strong rally that had seen the currency rebound from record lows against the euro on Tuesday, with many sceptical that the liquidity steps will solve the fundamentals problems faced by credit markets. Expectations the dollar may soon resume its slide stopped a decline in oil prices, keeping US crude futures within touch of a record high near $110 a barrel, while gold edged higher after its recent retreat from a peak hit last week. "The Fed's decision to get funds for credit markets has soothed investor sentiment since this eliminates the danger of another lender getting short of cash," said Hwang Geum-dan, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. "Fundamentals remain grim, and questions about where the global economy and inflation are headed still remain unanswered," she added. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan rose 2.3 percent as of 0402 GMT. The benchmark hit a seven-week low on Tuesday, and is still down 13 percent so far this year on fears of U.S. recession and more writedowns in the global financial sector coming at the same time when the region is grappling with rising inflation. Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.8 percent, helped by revised data showing the economy grew a surprisingly strong 0.9 percent in the last quarter of 2007, confounding expectations the figure would be revised sharply down. Stocks in Australia rose 2.6 percent, reversing steep declines over the previous three sessions. Singapore shares firmed more than 2 percent, while stocks in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan shares rose more than 1 percent each. Financial stocks across the region such as South Korea's Kookmin Bank led gainers, while Japanese exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp also rallied as the dollar's firmer tone against the yen would boost export earnings. DOUBTS REMAIN The rise in Asian stocks came after major central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, teamed up to get hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh funds into cash-starved credit markets. The moves will allow financial firms to use securities backed by mortgages as collateral for central bank loans. But there still plenty of risk factors that could prevent further gains, analysts warned. A survey on Wednesday showed Australian consumer sentiment slumped to its lowest in more than 14 years in March on the back of rising interest rates and falling share values. Retail sales in China held steady in January and February at 20.2 percent, but Shanghai shares fell 0.5 percent as investors fear tightening measures after the country posted on Tuesday its highest consumer price inflation in nearly 12 years. Japan is facing headaches of its own, despite the stronger-than-expected final estimate for the fourth quarter. Analysts warn of a slowdown in the country's economy early this year, while the world's second-biggest economy faces a potential void atop the Bank of Japan at a time when central banks are working together to help stem a global credit crisis. Opposition lawmakers on Wednesday vetoed the Japanese government's pick for central bank governor, Toshiro Muto, leaving the country with no successor to Toshihiko Fukui one week before he retires. DOLLAR SLIPS The dollar edged down 0.4 percent to 103.00 yen reversing into its biggest one-day rise versus the Japanese yen since August 2007 struck on Tuesday. The US currency hit an eight-year low of 101.40 yen on Friday. The euro edged up 0.1 percent from late US trade to $1.5352 not far from a record high of $1.5496 hit on Tuesday. "To many, the latest (central bank) measures merely address the symptoms and not the cause of the credit crunch problem," analysts at DBS said in a research note. "Like measures in the past, this exercise is seen as another attempt to buy time." U.S. crude futures steadied at $108.71, stopping a drop that had seen prices retreat from a record $109.72 hit on Tuesday, before the Fed announced its liquidity measures. Gold firmed to $974.30/$975.10 an ounce, up from around $971.40 in late trade in New York on Tuesday, and again approaching the record $991.90 on March 6. Japanese government bond futures steadied from earlier sharp falls, with June 10-year futures down 0.07 point at 139.43, recovering from an intraday low of 138.
