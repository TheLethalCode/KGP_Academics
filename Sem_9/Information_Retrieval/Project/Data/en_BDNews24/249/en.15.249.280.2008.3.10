 KAMPALA, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ugandan rebels said their lawyers were to meet International Criminal Court officials on Monday to push the court to drop charges against their leader, which are a sticking point in talks to end the 21-year war. Despite rapid progress in the past month at peace talks in Sudan, the Lord's Resistance Army rebels insist any final deal with Uganda's government be conditional on the ICC dropping war crimes' charges against leader Joseph Kony and two deputies. Uganda has rejected guaranteeing immunity to international prosecution until the signing of a final deal, which it wants tied up by March 28 to bring an end to one of Africa's longest-running and most brutal wars. "We have an appointment to hold a landmark meeting with officials from the ICC registry to whom we're going to hand our application for deferral of the indictments," rebel chief negotiator David Nyekorach Matsanga told Reuters by telephone.

In late February, Uganda and the LRA signed the last in a series of documents paving the way for a final deal to end an insurgency that has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 2 million, devastated north Uganda, and spilt into neighbours. A mediator said last week that Kony -- whose group is notorious for hacking off body parts and abducting children for soldiers and sex slaves -- was set to emerge from hiding to sign a final deal. But it was unclear if he would be prepared to leave his hiding place in remote eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) before he receives guarantees on the ICC.
