<TITLE> Hasina to undergo range of medical tests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina is "doing well", with doctors at Square Hospital preparing the former prime minister for a range of medical tests, hospital and prison officials said Wednesday. "Doctors collected necessary samples from Sheikh Hasina today for medical tests," John Gomes, the managing director of Square Hospital, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "An eye specialist will see her tomorrow and an ultra-sonogram may be required following that," said the hospital official. He said the former prime minister also has skin complaints and raised blood pressure and that specialists would be attending her soon regarding those ailments. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters as he left the hospital Wednesday that Hasina was doing well and her tests were being carried out in phases. However, two of Hasina's 'personal physicians' complained that they had been unable to meet their patient at the hospital on the day despite seeking permission. The DIG of prisons told bdnews24.com that he was unaware that any of Hasina's doctors had been refused access to their patient. "Dr ABM Abdullah phoned me, and I told him that I would let him know when he should go to the hospital," Siddiqui said. The hospital's managing director said that they would not bar any external physician from seeing her, although any decision would have to be endorsed by the prison authorities. Gomes said a nine-member team of physicians, headed by Prof Sanwar, was now investigating the AL chief's health problems. Doctors Syed Modasser Ali and ABM Abdullah went to Square Hospital at midday but said they failed to see Hasina. The two doctors told reporters on leaving the hospital that they were kept waiting for one-and-a-half hours before they gave up, and the prison officials had not bothered to tell them what was going on. "We don't know why we weren't allowed to see Sheikh Hasina," Dr Modasser Ali told reporters. "When we arrived at her cabin in the hospital the security staff there advised us to speak to the DIG of prisons." "They produced a list of doctors which included the name of Dr Millat (another of Hasina's personal physicians), but our names did not appear there," he said. The doctor added that prior to being admitted to the hospital Hasina had categorically said that her personal physicians were to treat her. "But now they are not even allowing us in. I don't know if she knows about it," he said. The AL president was transferred from the special jail located in the Sangsad Bhaban complex and admitted to Square Hospital Tuesday morning. bdnews24.com/ahd-ehb/mrf
