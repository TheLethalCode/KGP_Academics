<TITLE> Right to Information Ordinance receives mixed reception </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)The draft of the "Right to Information Ordinance 2008" will not ensure better access to information as promised, Dhaka University law professor Mizanur Rahman said Tuesday. "It seems that though we are being deprived of information for lack of a right to information act, we will continue to be deprived of the right after enactment of the law," he said at a roundtable meeting organised by the information ministry. Prof Mizanur said the draft has been prepared to protect government interests. "It seems that those who prepared the draft of the ordinance had a dishonest purpose. It has been prepared very carefully as to appear valid. It smacks of bureaucratic attitude." He said that the draft ordinance states that an information officer will decide which information can be accessed and which cannot. "But an individual cannot have such a right. The law should say which information can be given and which cannot." The law professor questioned: "If this is a pro-people law then why does it reserve the right not to give some information under the guise of 'national security' and 'public interest'?" He further questioned how the ordinance can be implemented keeping the Official Secrets Act effective. The information ministry organised Tuesday's roundtable discussion at the LGED Bhaban for airing of public opinion about the draft ordinance. Lawyers, politicians, academics, journalists and representatives of civil society took part in the discussion moderated by Transparency International, Bangladesh executive director Iftekhar Zaman. Editor of The Daily Star Mahfuz Anam said: "Cultural secrecy prevails in this country. Governments have not been accustomed to accountability." On the doubts aired by the likes of Prof Mizanur, The Daily Star editor said: "There are many loopholes in the section mentioned." He added that the words "against the public interest" should be dropped from Section 8 of the draft ordinance. Anam said further extensive discussion should be held on the draft, and it should be put into effect soon. "There are many hindrances to this ordinance," Anam said. "However, it is better that at last such an ordinance is to be promulgated." Lawyer and Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain also applauded the efforts to pass such a law, saying the right to information is a fundamental right. "Right to information does not mean that everybody can seek information on all matters," he pointed out. "The initiative is very important. Nothing prepared by human beings can be flawless. I congratulate all for this initiative." Economist and CPD chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan echoed the sentiments: "Though belated, the initiative for the right to information ordinance is good one." "Politicians should also be consulted on the matter as the next parliament will approve it. If the parliament does not approve it, the whole effort will be in vain." Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha chief editor Jaglul Ahmed Chowdhury also welcomed the initiative for such a law, "even if belated". Editor of The Bangladesh Observer Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury said journalists were most involved with the right to information. "But no representative of the media was consulted during formulation of the draft." Chowdhury said the draft makes provision for giving information within 20 days from the date of applying. "But this cannot be applicable for journalists. If it comes into effect journalists would be deprived of whatever information they have access to now." Chowdhury also suggested redrafting Section 8. Other leading representatives of the print media, including Associated Press Dhaka Bureau chief Farid Hossain and Dainik Manavjamin editor Motiur Rahman Chowdhury voiced doubts about the controversial section, saying there was scope for debate on the article. Journalist Mizanur Rahman Khan said the draft should be quickly withdrawn "as many things have been wrongly translated and incorporated in it," while National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud said opinions should have been taken before preparing the draft. Former minister MK Anwar said there is always reluctance to provide information from the government side, while Reazuddin Ahmed, News Today editor, said the Information Commission (proposed in the ordinance) is going to be a "toothless tiger" like the Press Council. bdnews
