 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) -- New legislation for the national identity card project has been prepared, which will make use of the ID cards mandatory in a range of situations, an official said Tuesday. Members of the public will be required to produce their national ID cards for 22 different purposes including applications for passports and driving licences as well as admission to educational institutions. Further areas where the ID cards will be required are registering for examinations, opening bank accounts and taking water, electricity and gas connections. Taking a loan from any organisation, buying land, buying and selling vehicles and filing legal cases will also come under the purview of the proposed ordinance. The proposed law will also see those found guilty of providing false information, concealing information or collecting more than one ID card liable to imprisonment and a fine, said the official. The responsibility of preparing the new national ID cards now lies with the Election Commission, although it will pass to the home ministry in future. At present only those eligible to become voters are receiving national ID cards, although all citizens are ultimately to be brought under the scheme in phases. The EC prepared the draft national ID ordinance with the planning commission before sending it to the home ministry for scrutiny last year. Sheikh Abdur Rashid, additional secretary at the home ministry, told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "The National Identification Registration Authority Ordinance is being formulated with the aim of giving ID cards to all citizens in the country." "The draft of the ordinance is now waiting approval of the council of advisers," said Rashid. According to the proposed ordinance, any person violating the law will be liable to a maximum of six months simple imprisonment or a fine of up to Tk 50,000 or both, said Rashid. The additional secretary said the draft ordinance had provided the government with the power to suspend some provisions of the proposed law. Election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com: "The EC has already given specific suggestions for the draft of the national ID card ordinance." The draft was presented at a meeting of the EC in July 2007. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda presided over the meeting. The work of preparing voter lists with photographs and the national ID card project started in June last year. The UNDP and other donor agencies are providing Tk 345 crore towards the project's costs. Md Asaduzzaman, public relations officer at the EC secretariat, told bdnews24.com that more than 4.45 crore voters out of estimated eight crore voters had been registered throughout the country by March 7. National ID cards for 8,262,705 of the voters have been prepared, while ID cards have been distributed among 5,491,798 individuals, said Asaduzzaman. bdnews
