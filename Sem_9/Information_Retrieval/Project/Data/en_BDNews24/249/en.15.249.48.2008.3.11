 London, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose to a record high for the fifth day in a row on Tuesday, boosted by investor flows into oil and other commodities partly to hedge against inflation and the weak dollar. US light crude for April delivery was up $1.40 at $109.30 a barrel by 1233 GMT, after touching a record $109.72 a barrel. London Brent crude was up $1.30 at $105.49, after a record high of $105.82. "Concerns about inflation are very strong. Hedge funds are selling stocks and buying commodities, especially oil and gold, because the US dollar is weakening," said Takeda Makoto, an analyst at Bansei Securities. The euro was at an all-time high against the struggling US dollar, anticipating more interest cuts by the Federal Reserve to boost the flagging economy in the United States, the world's top energy consumer. Oil prices had dipped slightly after the International Energy Agency said world oil demand would be less than expected this year because of slower economic growth in industrialised countries and record prices. But the agency also said only a severe recession would push oil back below $60 a barrel. "We are in an era of higher oil prices and so if we look at $100 oil we have to do so with an understanding that prices are unlikely to return to levels seen in the early part of the decade," said the IEA, which advises 27 industrialised countries.. Oil has set a string of record highs as a bullish long-term supply outlook for oil and other commodities has continued to suck in investment flows looking for alternatives to equities and bonds that are overshadowed by the credit market crises and fears of a US slowdown. "Looking at the big picture, we believe that the recent price surges in the commodity sector have been for the most part triggered by large capital inflows from institutional investors, hedge funds above all," said fund manager Tiberius Asset Management in a research note. Goldman Sachs warned oil was at risk from substantial fund liquidation due to cyclical fundamental weaknesses in the next few months, but the investment bank remains constructive on energy for the long-term. "We believe that the combination of low economic growth in the United States and high oil price inflation will have its strongest impact on demand in the first half of the year," the investment bank said in a research note. The latest update on fuel supplies in the United States, due on Wednesday, is forecast to show a 1.9 million barrel rise in crude oil inventories last week, according to a preliminary Reuters poll
