 MIAMI, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spinners Sulieman Benn and Amit Jaggernauth were called-up to the full West Indies squad for the first time on Tuesday and could make their debuts against Sri Lanka later this month. Trinidadian off-spinner Jaggernauth and Barbados orthodox slow left-armer Benn have been included in the 15-man squad for the first test against Sri Lanka which will be played at the Providence Stadium in Guyana from March 22. Another spinner, Barbados all-rounder Ryan Hinds, is recalled to the side for the first time in nearly three years. Hinds' last appearance for the regional team was against South Africa in April, 2005. As expected, Ramnaresh Sarwan is back in the squad having recovered from injury and will strengthen a batting line-up that will be led by captain Chris Gayle. Jamaican Marlon Samuels is included in the squad but will only be able to bat as he is serving a suspension from bowling in international cricket due to what authorities have called an illegal action. Batsmen Brenton Parchment and Runako Morton, who were part of the team that toured South Africa, are dropped. All-rounder Darren Sammy and batsman Daren Ganga were two other members of the South African touring squad to be left out. Squad: Chris Gayle (Captain), Dwayne Bravo, Sulieman Benn, Sewnarine Chattergoon, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Pedro Collins, Fidel Edwards, Ryan Hinds, Amit Jaggernauth, Darren Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Marlon Samuels, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Devon Smith, Jerome Taylo
