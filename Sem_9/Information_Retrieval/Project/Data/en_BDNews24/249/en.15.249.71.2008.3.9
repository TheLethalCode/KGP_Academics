<TITLE> Pakistan's Sharif to join Benazir party in coalition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BHURBAN, Pakistan, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif said on Sunday he would join the late Benazir Bhutto's party in a coalition, raising the prospect of a government hostile to President Pervez Musharraf. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won the most seats in a Feb. 18 general election but not enough to rule alone. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), or PML (N), party came second and while it had promised to support the PPP, Sharif had not previously confirmed his party would join the PPP in forming a government. "It was ... agreed that the PML (N) shall be part of the federal cabinet," Sharif told a news conference after talks with Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, who took over as PPP leader after she was assassinated on Dec. 27. The agreement would appear to dash any hope that U.S. ally Musharraf might have had that the party that backs him, the Pakistan Muslim League, which came a poor third in the election, might join a coalition. Analysts had previously said Sharif might have wanted to stay out of a PPP-led government, which is going to have to take some unpopular economic decisions, in order to be in a better position to win power in the next election. In an ominous sign for Musharraf, Sharif and Zardari agreed to restore judges who Musharraf dismissed when he imposed emergency rule in early November, through a parliamentary resolution within 30 days of the formation of the government. The dismissed judges, including the Supreme Court chief justice, were seen as hostile to Musharraf's October re-election by legislators for a new five-year term as president while he was still army chief. The judges are likely to take up legal challenges to Musharraf if they are restored. Western allies and Pakistan's neighbours, concerned about instability in a nuclear-armed state already reeling from suicide bombings by al Qaeda-inspired militants, fear more political upheaval if new leaders seek confrontation with the president. Hundreds of lawyers across the country launched a week of protests on Sunday to press for the restoration of the judges. It was a year ago on Sunday that Musharraf suspended the then chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, touching off protests. "PEOPLE'S VERDICT" Sharif, who the then army chief Musharraf ousted in a 1999 coup, has been calling for the unpopular president to step down, and on Sunday said Musharraf had to accept the people's verdict. "Musharraf and his cronies have been saying it's a hung parliament. Even if it is, it's against dictatorship," Sharif told the news conference in the hill town of Bhurban. "This is the people's verdict against him .... he should accept the facts and he should not create hurdles and rifts." Zardari, asked about his attitude to Musharraf, was more conciliatory, saying he did not believe in "personal agendas" and believed in the office of the president. Musharraf has advised a new government to focus on fighting terrorism and sustaining economic growth rather than politics. He has said he will back the incoming government so long as it chooses political peace. Musharraf said last week it would be a week or two more before the new national and provincial assemblies were convened but Sharif called for them to be convened immediately. The PPP has yet to nominate a candidate for prime minister but Sharif said he had agreed the prime minister should come from the PPP. Zardari is not eligible as he did not stand in the election and is therefore not a member of parliament. Zardari's deputy chairman, Makhdoom Amin Fahim, has been regarded as the likely choice for the job but a delay in nominating him has led to doubts. Another candidate is Ahmed Mukhtar, a former commerce minister in Bhutto's cabinet. Another small party expected to join the coalition is a secular, ethnic Pashtun nationalist party from the northwest. The leader of the Jamiat-e-ulema-e-Islam religious party, Fazl-ur-Rehman, has also agreed "in principle" to jo
