Buchanan, who guided Australia to two World Cup titles in 2003 and 2007 before stepping down in April last year, was unveiled as coach of the Ganguly-led Kolkata in the eight-team franchise Twenty20 league due to start on April 18. Ganguly dealt Buchanan's Australia a surprise defeat when he captained India to a memorable comeback test series win in 2001. Each team franchise was sold for millions of dollars. The "Kolkata Knight Riders" were bought for $75.09 million by a consortium that includes Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan. Young Indian paceman Ishant Sharma ($950,000), West Indies opener Chris Gayle ($800,000) and New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum ($700,000) were among the main picks by the team at a high-profile auction last month which saw 75 players snapped up. Another 18 players were added in a second and final auction on Tuesday.
