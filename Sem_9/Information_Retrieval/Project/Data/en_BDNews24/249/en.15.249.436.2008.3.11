 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Monday approved a plan to change the weather signalling system, a government spokesman said. The government fixed an eight-point warning system for seaports instead of previous 11 points, and four points for river ports instead of previous six. Bangladesh now uses signal 10 for all but the most severe storm and signal 11 is saved for the worst situation when all communications are cut off. The International Tropical Storm Tracker uses a five-point scale, with five for the most severe. The decision came months after weather experts asked if any earlier and simpler warning system could have saved more lives in the Nov 15 Cyclone Sidr that struck Bangladesh coasts killing about 3,000 people in its wake. Monday's meeting decided that Bangladesh Meteorological Department would carry out an extensive publicity campaign to make the messages popular to people. bdnews24.com/
