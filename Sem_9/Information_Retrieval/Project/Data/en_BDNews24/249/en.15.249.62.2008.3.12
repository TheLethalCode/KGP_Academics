 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved an IPO prospectus for a Tk 100 crore mutual fund aimed at non-resident Bangladeshis. The decision to approve the country's largest ever mutual fund, the ICB NRB 2nd Mutual Fund, came at a meeting Tuesday, SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Grameen Mutual Fund One is currently the biggest mutual fund valued at Tk 17 crore. The new fund id being floated by ICB Asset Management Company, a subsidiary of the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh. "NRB investors will be allowed to buy Tk 60 crore worth of shares, while Tk 20 crore of the fund will be available for the domestic market," said Farhad. Sponsors of the fund will hold Tk 10 crore worth of shares and the existing mutual funds will be offered the remaining Tk 10 crore, as a 10 per cent quota is reserved for the funds, according to the SEC director. Fifteen mutual funds are listed on the stock exchanges at present. ICB and its subsidiaries have floated 12 mutual funds, while Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha (BSRS) and private sector companies AIMS and Grameen manage one each. Tuesday's meeting also widened the deadline up to June 30 for submitting bank certificates for existing beneficiary owner accounts, Farhad said. He said existing BO account holders must fulfill the condition of supplying bank certificates within six months of issuance of the order in October last year. Farhad also said that banks have recently received a circular from Bangladesh Bank regarding the requirement of the certificates: "We have extended the deadline for the convenience of BO account holders." The market watchdog has decided to confiscate all shares that cannot be transferred to a BO account after IPO allotment due to expiry or closure of the account. The decision, effective from the next IPO, was taken in a bid to stop the use of fake and fictitious BO accounts during IPO subscriptions. Farhad said it was found that many IPO allotments could not be transferred to the BO accounts due to their closure. In those cases, the SEC transferred had the primary shares under special arrangement. "From now on, if an IPO allotment cannot be transferred due to the closure of the BO account, the commission may confiscate the primary shares," Farhad said. bdne
