 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  The cost of import has increased abnormally, depleting the foreign exchange reserves to $5.32 billion from $6 billion, according to the central bank. Bangladesh Bank needed to pay record $733.17 million in import bill to Asian Clearing Union (ACU). BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed said the import cost increased to such extent mainly because of huge import of staple: rice and wheat. Last year's two spells of flooding and a devastating cyclone hugely damaged crops forcing the country to import a huge amount of foodgrains to ward off a possible food crisis, the governor had said Thursday. He said the country had enough money to pay the bill and "there would be no problem". According to the BB's foreign currency policy special research cell, on the last day of the last week Thursday the foreign currency reserves were more than $6.02 billion. On the day, $73.32 crore for two months (Jan-Feb) was paid in import bill to the ACU. After adjusting the amount, the reserve came down to $5.32 billion. According to statistics available, the bill of $46 crore were paid to the ACU in Nov-Dec and $48 crore in Sep-Oct. For Jan-Feb last year only $25 crore were paid to the ACU in import bill. Rice worth $15.05 crore was imported in Feb. During the corresponding period in 2007 the import bill for rice was only $1.20 crore. In Feb this year wheat worth $5.85 crore was imported while it was only $30 lakh in the same month last year. In the first eight months (July-Feb) of the current fiscal year, rice worth $59.91 crore was imported while the bill of rice for the same period in last fiscal year was $5.47 crore. In July-Feb of this fiscal year a total of 17.05 lakh tonnes of rice has been imported while 11.94 lakh tonnes of wheat entered the country. The statistics showed that various commodities worth $1507.75 crore had been imported in July-Feb of the current fiscal year against previous year's $120.57 crore. bdnews24.
