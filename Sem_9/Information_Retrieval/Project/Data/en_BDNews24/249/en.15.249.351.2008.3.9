 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com) - The prosecution Sunday outlined charges against Sheikh Hasina involving alleged corruption in allowing three floating power plants during her term but the former prime minister said in the court that she would not get justice in the case. Sunday's proceedings were part of framing charges against Hasina in the Special Judge's Court-1 on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Judge Firoz Alam ended hearing the argument by the prosecution Sunday and adjourned the proceedings until March 13 to hear defence. Hasina from the dock repeated that she would not get justice in the case since she believed the proceedings were "close to in-camera trial". Her tirade came after she learned that some of her relatives and lawyers could not enter the court because of the intervention by security officials. "Preventing my relatives and lawyers from entering the court proves that it is an in-camera trial," Hasina said after entering the court in the morning. The defence later sought the attention of the judge who ruled that legally there had been no bar for relatives to attend the court proceedings. "If it involves security measures, I can't do anything," the judge said. He later asked the defence to provide a list of the relatives who wished to attend the court. Later, some relatives came in and talked to Hasina for half an hour after the court proceedings. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon police against eight people including Hasina. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. State counsel Sharfuddin Ahmed Mukul Sunday outlined the charges and told the court that they had "sufficient evidence" to prove the offence the former prime minister allegedly committed. He asked the court to begin the proceedings for formally charging Hasina and other accused in the court. Detailing his version, Mukul said Hasina took Tk 3 crore from two business groups, Summit Group and United Group, to award contracts to Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium for building three floating power plants. Summit and United were the representatives of Wartsila, a Finnish manufacturer of large diesel engines and power plants. Mukul said Wartsila got the job for building the power plants, technically known as barge-mounted power plants, although it was not the lowest bidder. He said New England Power Company was the lowest bidder to set up the plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. He argued that everything had been done through financial benefit, and the then Hasina administration allowed Wartsila to launder foreign currency in the name of importing oil. Mukul alleged that the then power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi assisted Hasina to proceed the deal with Wartsila while the then Power Development Board chairman Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal completed the process. The prosecution said Mahmud Kamal arranged "everything" under orders by Hasina and under pressure from Elahi. The state side said the amount was paid through eight bank cheques and pay orders, transacted between Oct 24, 1996 and Nov 24, 1997. It further said that the money was spent to buy a one-storey building with 19 kathas of land for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust on Oct 8, 1997. Summit and United paid Tk 2 crore to the owner of the house at Road No. 32 (old) in two phases in 1997. Hasina on Oct 11, 1997, approved the deal with Wartsila, and on Nov 24, the house owner got another Tk 1 crore. bdnews24.com/p
