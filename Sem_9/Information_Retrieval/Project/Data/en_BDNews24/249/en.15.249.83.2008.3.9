<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)The medical condition of Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, who is receiving treatment at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, remains in check. Jalil told bdnews24.com Sunday by phone: "I am doing fine." But he said his kidney failure meant that excess water was stored in the body. "No treatment can be done until the water is removed," Jalil said, asking his countrymen to pray for his recovery. The AL leader was released on one month's parole on March 2 and left Dhaka for Singapore amid tight security the following day, accompanied by his wife. The recommendation for Jalil's treatment abroad came after doctors treating the detained party leader at LabAid Cardiac Hospital said his medical condition was "critical" and "unstable" due to kidney failure. The doctors supported his family's wishes to take Jalil to Singapore for better medical treatment, including a possible kidney transplant. A separate medical board including doctors from the Combined Military Hospital and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University also recommended such treatment be sought abroad. The government approved Jalil's parole for overseas treatment following a top-level meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office with law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and home adviser MA Matin present. bdnews
