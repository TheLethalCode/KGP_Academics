 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League presidium Tuesday demanded that the government release party chief Sheikh Hasina and send her to the US for medical treatment. The party's highest policymaking body passed a resolution on demand for Hasina's medical treatment in the US, which will be sent to the Chief Adviser's Office in a couple of days, AL leaders said. After the meeting held at the Gulshan home of acting AL president Zillur Rahman for about two hours from 6pm, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam briefed reporters on the decisions taken by the senior leaders. Hoping for permission for Hasina's treatment in the US, Ashraful Islam said: "We are hopeful that our leader is going abroad for treatment." "We have made strong demand for immediate and unconditional release of our leader and necessary steps to send her to the US for treatment," he said. Asked when he thinks Hasina could go abroad, the AL leader said: "Let the leader be sent abroad as soon as possible. The government will take similar steps as it did for Mr Jalil (AL general secretary Abdul Jalil)." The AL also demanded complete withdrawal of a ban on indoor politics across the country and the state of emergency, he said: "Constitutionally the responsibility of the caretaker government is to hold elections. And the government should concentrate on it." On the Election Commission's roadmap, the AL leader alleged that nothing had gone successfully as per the roadmap. "The Election Commission is lagging six months behind the roadmap." Later, AL deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haq read out the resolution of the party presidium meeting. The resolution expressed concern that Hasina had long stayed in an unhygienic condition in solitary confines. Zillur Rahman presided over the meeting, also attended by other presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury. bdnews
