 Hong Kong, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks hit their lowest in nearly seven weeks on Monday, while the dollar was near a record low against the euro and an eight-year low against the yen after weak employment data fuelled US recession fears. Malaysian stocks were among the region's biggest decliners, falling as much as 7.6 percent to a seven-month low after the ruling coalition suffered its worst election result in decades. Inflationary pressures remain a concern around Asia. Data on Monday showed South Korean producer prices rose 6.8 percent in February from a year before, the biggest gain in over three years, while Chinese producer prices were up 6.6 percent. Oil prices remained near a record high despite the worsening global economic outlook, held up by cold weather in parts of the United States, while gold moved back above $975 an ounce. "We keep hearing bad news, and expect to receive more unfavourable sets of data and figures for some time. Markets will continue to test the bottom in the meantime," said Kim Joong-hyun, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in Seoul. The MSCI measure of Asian stocks outside Japan was down 2.4 percent by 0338 GMT after hitting its lowest since Jan. 23. The prospects of a U.S. recession and worsening global credit conditions have hit Asian stocks hard this year, with the MSCI index down 14 percent as of last week, worse than the 12 percent fall in the Standard & Poor's S&P 500 or the 10 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Exporters such as Sony Corp, which depend on U.S. consumers, dropped after data published on Friday showing U.S. employers unexpectedly cut jobs last month at the steepest rate in nearly five years. Financial firms fell on concerns about more writedowns worldwide after U.S. housing loan provider Thornburg Mortgage Inc said on Friday it could not meet its own lenders' demands for $610 million of cash or collateral. "The subprime problem is a creeping disease. It initially infected relatively few people, but the contagion has spread to a much greater portion of the credit market," MF Global analyst Edward Meir said. Japan's Nikkei average hit its lowest level since September 2005 and was down 1.6 percent at 0418 GMT. Shares in China, Taiwan and Singapore were down more than 2 percent, while stock markets in South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia were down nearly 2 percent. China Railway Construction made a weaker-than-expected Shanghai debut after raising a combined $5.4 billion in a dual listing with Hong Kong in the world's largest initial public offering this year. MALAYSIAN STOCKS DROP Malaysia's main share index slumped 6.9 percent, at one stage hitting its lowest since August 2007, after opposition Islamists and leftists won control of five of the country's 13 states and just over a third of the federal parliament. "The political stability of the country becomes a question mark," said Pankaj Kumar, chief investment officer at Kurnia Insurance. Despite a surprisingly big jump in Japanese machinery orders -- a notoriously volatile series -- and the South Korean finance ministry's confidence in its 2008 economic growth target of around 6 percent, the weakness of the U.S. economy remained the dominant theme for investors. The dollar continued this year's slump, falling around 0.4 percent from Friday to 102.34 yen, near an eight-year low of 101.40. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.5381, near a record high of $1.5465 hit in electronic trade on Friday. The falling value of the world's dominant currency has been a major factor behind this year's surge in commodity prices. Oil prices edged lower on Monday, with U.S. light crude for April delivery down 24 cents at $104.91 a barrel, but that was still within sight of the record $106.54 hit on Friday. Gold moved back up above $975 an ounce from around $972 in late Friday trade in New York, while platinum firmed to around $2,065 an ounce from $2,020/$2,030. Asian bonds extended gains, with Japanese government bond futures climbing to a 2-1/2-year high. March futures rose 0.38 point to 139.43.
