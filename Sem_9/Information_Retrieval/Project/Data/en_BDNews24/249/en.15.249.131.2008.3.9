<TITLE> Hasina risks total hearing loss: doctor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina's personal physician Dr Pran Gopal Dutta said Sunday that the former prime minister ran the risk of total hearing loss if she was not immediately treated. He said that the hearing aid planted in the ears and run by software made in the United States was almost ineffective and that the software was not available elsewhere. The hearing aid she is using has to be tested every five to six months, the doctor added. But she did not go to the USA after June 24, 2004. He told reporters that he had advised immediate formation of a medical board and arrangement of treatment for her. He said briefed the waiting reporters Sunday after examining Hasina at the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad premises. Eye specialist Dr Modasser Ali and heart specialist Dr MH Millat were present at the time. The Awami League chief's personal physician went to the special jail about 12:15pm and came out at 2:30pm. Dr Dutta said Hasina was totally deaf in her left ear and heard 'very little' in the right. At times she tried to understand what was being said by reading the lips. He said Hasina had told him that now she heard sounds like microphone and high tide. "Before us four other doctors saw the former prime minister. These seven doctors need to sit together and take a decision regarding Sheikh Hasina's treatment. For this a sitting may take place today without wasting time." Dr Modasser Ali said, "I have examined Sheikh Hasina's eyes. She has allergy in the eyes and the pressure has increased. I have advised her to use eye drop. "But her overall condition suggests that the drop will not be of much help There is no use applying balm on the skin." Replying to a question, Dr Ali said, "Three of us have examined the former prime minister and none of us recommended her hospitalisation since she is averse to the idea of getting admitted to hospital for treatment. "However, it would have been good for her if she was admitted to hospital for tests. There is no lack of sincerity on the part of jail authorities to get her admitted into hospital." Dr MH Millat said doctor after doctor was seeing her but nothing was happening as far as her treatment was concerned. She needed treatment on an emergency basis, he added. Asked whether Hasina agreed to go abroad, Dr Millat said, "Sheikh Hasina said she would follow doctor's advice." Deputy inspector general (DIG), prisons, Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, referring to the jail code, said, "As per the jail code there is no scope for arranging [her] treatment abroad. The jail code provides for treatment inside the country." He said the seven doctors who had seen Hasina decided to sit together and nothing further could be said on the matter now. Whatever would happen would happen according to the law, he added. Dermatologist MU Kabir Chowdhury and medicine specialist ABM Abdullah on March 6 examined Hasina. A day earlier, heart specialist Baren Chakravarty and medicine specialist ABM Abdullah together went to the special jail. In the morning gynaecologist Shahla Khatun also saw her. The grenade explosions at the Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004 temporarily deafened Hasina in the ear and she had been having difficulty hearing since. bdnew
