 ZAGREB, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Monday his ruling HDZ party was in favour of suspending full enforcement of a fisheries zone in the Adriatic, which threatens to sink its European Union membership talks. Sanader has called a meeting of all parliamentary parties for Tuesday to discuss if Croatia should give up applying its ecological and fisheries zone to EU countries, a key requirement to advance its stalled EU bid.

Analyst believe most parliamentary parties will back Sanader's drive to suspend the zone's full enforcement and salvage the EU talks, which the former Yugoslav republic hopes to conclude in mid-2009. The main problem remains the conservative Peasant Party, the most vocal advocate of the zone, which is his main coalition partner. However, a Peasant Party source told Reuters the party just might be mollified. "We don't want to abolish the zone completely, but the enforcement could be discussed. What really matters is that everyone knows this is our sea, our heritage". Croatia, which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, has made joining NATO and the EU its top strategic goal, which should boost its economic prosperity and ensure political stability after the turbulence of its Yugoslav pa
