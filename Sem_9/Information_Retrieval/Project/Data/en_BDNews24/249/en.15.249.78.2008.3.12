<TITLE> New Yorkers think governor should quit: Poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most New Yorkers say Gov. Eliot Spitzer should resign because of allegations he was a customer of a high-priced prostitute, a poll found on Tuesday. Seventy percent of those surveyed by the WNBC/Marist Poll said the Democratic governor should quit while 22 percent disagreed. The rest were unsure, said the poll conducted on Tuesday by telephone of 624 New York state registered voters. Spitzer faced growing pressure to step down after a report on Monday that he hired a high-priced prostitute. The scandal erupted after The New York Times said he hired the $1,000-an-hour prostitute and was caught on a federal wiretap arranging to meet her at a Washington hotel. Spitzer apologized on Monday for what he described as a "private matter" but said nothing about resigning. He neither confirmed nor denied the report. New Yorkers were split on what should happen to Spitzer, with 49 percent saying he should face criminal charges and 47 percent saying he should not, the poll said. While prostitution is illegal in most U.S. states, clients typically are not charged. However, the Spitzer case is in the hands of federal, not state, authorities, and he could face charges of structuring, which entails payments of money made in such a way as to conceal their purpose and source. If Spitzer does not resign, 66 percent said the state legislature should impeach him, the poll said. A majority, 56 percent, said they would like to see New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg run for governor in 2010. Bloomberg had been touted as a possible independent candidate for the U.S. presidency but he has said he will not run. Should Spitzer resign, Lt. Gov. David Paterson complete his term, which ends in 2010. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
