 BAGHDAD, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iranian delegation failed to meet US officials in Baghdad for talks on security in Iraq and was forced to go home last week without meeting the Americans due to a mix-up over dates, Iraq's foreign minister said. Observers who closely follow the talks were left puzzled after Iran said they would start on March 6, the United States ambassador said no date had been set, and Iraq's deputy prime minister said only that they would take place within the week. Speculation veered between a deliberate snub by the Americans, who are at odds with Tehran over its nuclear programme, or a more likely breakdown in communication. In his first comments on the mix-up, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said on Sunday that "confusion in communication" was to blame. The Iranians had proposed March 6, he said, but the Americans had not actually accepted the date before the Iranian delegation was sent from Tehran. "It was a misunderstanding ...

Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Kazemi-Qomi, told Reuters on Sunday that his country was still committed to holding further talks, despite insisting that the March 6 date had in fact been proposed by the Americans. The US embassy has referred all queries on the Iraq-hosted talks to the Iraqi government. "We are very keen to help the Iraqi government regarding security. This will not affect the Iranian stance towards talks with the Americans," Qomi said. US military spokesman Rear Admiral Greg Smith told a news conference in Baghdad on Sunday that the United States was "looking forward" to a new round of talks. Smith said there was clear evidence that "elements from inside Iran" were still backing militias in Iraq, saying captured fighters had confirmed their accusations and US forces regularly found caches containing Iranian-made weapo
