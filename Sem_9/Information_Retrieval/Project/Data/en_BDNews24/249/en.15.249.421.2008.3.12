 London, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Financial bookmakers expect to see major European indexes rise by as much as 1.4 to 1.8 percent on Wednesday after a 3 percent rally on Wall Street triggered by joint central bank action to unblock the credit markets. London-based spreadbetters expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open 70 to 77 points higher, or as much as 1.4 percent, Germany's DAX to open 90 to 108 points up, or as much as 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 to open 73 to 84 points up, or as much as 1.8 percent. Major U.S. indexes rose by 3.6 to 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 registered a 1.2 percent gain.
