<TITLE> IEA sees slower oil demand, cheap crude era dead </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World oil demand will be less than expected this year because of slower economic growth in industrialised countries and record prices, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. The latest monthly report from the Paris-based IEA adds to evidence that a slowing economy in the United States and oil prices above $100 a barrel are denting fuel consumption in some of the world's biggest economies. But the agency also said that demand remained buoyant in China and the Middle East, and only a severe world recession would send oil below $60 for a sustained period. Oil has climbed from below $20 in early 2002. "We are in an era of higher oil prices, and so if we look at $100 oil we have to do so with an understanding that prices are unlikely to return to levels seen in the early part of this decade," it said. World consumption will average 87.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2008, 80,000 bpd less than the previous forecast, said the IEA, adviser to 27 industrialised countries. Demand in the OECD was cut by about 190,000 bpd. "There's quite a big downward revision to demand in industrialised countries," Lawrence Eagles, head of the IEA's Oil Industry and Markets division, told Reuters. "Some of that weakness is related to slightly milder weather. There is also an effect from economic weakness and high prices." Oil hit a record high of $109.72 a barrel on Tuesday, boosted by investment flows into commodities partly to hedge against inflation and the weak U.S. dollar. STEADY DEMAND GROWTH The IEA kept its forecast for growth in world consumption this year little changed at 1.72 million bpd because it also cut its figure for 2007 demand. Its forecast remains higher than those of some others. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries expects world demand this year to rise by 1.23 million bpd. The IEA also pointed to a rise in oil inventories in January and forecast a further increase in coming months following OPEC's decision last week to leave supply unchanged. Inventories in member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development rose by 32.6 million barrels in January from an upwardly revised figure for December, the IEA said. OPEC supply will be 960,000 bpd higher than demand in the second quarter following its decision last week to leave output unchanged and assuming steady Iraqi supply, the IEA said, allowing inventories to rise further. World oil demand usually slows in the second quarter as consumers in the northern hemisphere use less heating fuel. In previous years, that slowdown has sometimes prompted OPEC to cut production in the spring. OPEC rebuffed calls from consumers led by the United States for more oil at its meeting last week in Vienna, arguing current output was enough to keep consumers well supplied. The 13-member group pumps more than a third of the world's oil and produced 32.1 million bpd in February, 120,000 bpd less than in January, the IEA said. Analysts said the IEA report indicated that consumers have enough oil. "Based on the IEA's numbers, the market is well supplied," said Mike Wittner, analyst at Societe Generale. "Given the politics out there, the question of whether OPEC was right not to raise output depends on where you are sitting.
