<TITLE> Standard Life profit up 43 pct, beats forecasts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Insurer Standard Life posted a forecast-beating 43 percent rise in 2007 operating profit on Wednesday, despite a 249 million pound ($501 million) charge as UK customers continue to cash in policies early. Standard Life, beating its closely watched 9-10 percent return on embedded value (RoEV) target, said operating profit, on an embedded value basis, totalled 881 million pounds. Nine analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had seen operating profit of 680 million pounds on average, with forecasts ranging from 579 million to 752 million pounds. Standard had said earlier this year it expected to take extra provision for the cost of customers leaving early, after it took a 266 million pound lapse charge in 2006. It took a 249 million pound hit from UK customers leaving early in 2007, but that was offset by positive changes in Canada, which left the group lapse charge at 219 million. The insurer said it would pay a dividend of 11.5p per share.
