<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah has written a letter to the party's disputed acting chief M Saifur Rahman, which aims to reunite the splintered party. The former finance minister Sunday acknowledged receipt of the letter, but rejected the likelihood that the Oct 29 decisions would be cancelled. Briefing reporters after a meeting with US Charge d'Affaires Geeta Pasi, Saifur said: "Hannan Shah yesterday (Saturday) gave me a letter in which he said unity is possible if the decisions of the Oct 29 meeting are cancelled." "If the decisions have to be cancelled what is the necessity of discussion then?" Saifur quipped. The meeting was held to decide guidelines for running the party in the absence of the detained party chief, Saifur said. "The letter does not say anything about how the party will be run and how reforms will be carried out," he said. Saifur, acting chairman appointed by the party standing committee, blamed the divide in the party on a handful of people, more specifically, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, who was appointed by Khaleda as secretary general. "I rang Khandaker Delwar Hossain several times, but he doesn't want to speak. So how unity is possible?" The BNP standing committee on Oct 29 last year appointed Saifur as acting chairman and retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed as acting secretary general. Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, BNP's joint secretary general loyal the Delwar faction, told bdnews24.com: "I don't know anything about the letter. But I do know a draft for a unity plan has been prepared." bdnew
