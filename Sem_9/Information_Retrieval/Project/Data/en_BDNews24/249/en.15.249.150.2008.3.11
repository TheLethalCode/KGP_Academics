 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Australian High Commissioner to Bangladesh said Tuesday elections could be held under any circumstances, even under emergency, when the people were willing. Douglas Foskett made the remark while speaking to reporters after meeting the chief election commissioner (CEC). Asked if an election under emergency rule was truly feasible, the Australian envoy said elections could be held in any situation, if the people were willing. Douglas, however, was reluctant to elaborate on the issue. On his meeting with the CEC, he said they had discussed the upcoming elections and relevant issues such as voter registration with photographs. The Election Commission was quite hopeful about holding a free and fair election within the year, the high commissioner said. According to the EC voter registration and other related activities were progressing as expected, Foskett said. bdne
