 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will once again rely on the spinners in the must-win second one-day against South Africa to at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Wednesday. "If we want to do something against them then we have to do so riding on the spinners on the slow and low wicket," Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful told reporters Tuesday on the eve of the crucial tie. "Perhaps the team management thinks the spinners have something to give to the side and they have pinned their hopes on us. We feel no pressure about delivering to the expectation," said leading spinner Abdur Razzak. After the retirement of spinner Mohammad Rafique, Razzak now leads the spin attack. He thought it would have been nice had Rafique still been around, but said the absence would not affect the team. The wicket of Sher-e-Bangla seems a flat one and the team management picked three other spinners in Abdur Razzak, Mosharraf Hossain Rubel and Shakib Al Hasan. Razzak, Rubel and Shakib together conceded 111 runs in 22.5 overs in exchange for just one wicket in the series opener. South Africa's pace trio of Andre Nel, Charl Lengveldt and Albie Morkel had taken seven wickets among them on the flat wicket in Chittagong. Bangladesh has brought two changes to team that played the first one-dayer with pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and uncapped Nazimuddin coming in for paceman Shahadat Hossain and opener Junaed Siddique. Explaining the exclusion of Junaed Siddique, Ashraful said, "In last four matches, three against New Zealand and one against South Africa, he helped lay good opening partnerships, but failed to justify himself. He might be low on confidence and we have just rested him." Tamim Iqbal will now open the innings with Shahriar Nafees, who batted in Chittagong at number three for the first time since the left-handed batsman made his debut as an opener against England in 2005. "Mashrafee has been picked as he is an experienced bowler and he also can bat well in lower order," said Ashraful. Shahadat who had replaced Mashrafee in the first one-dayer gave away 31 runs in just three overs. Ashraful was confident of levelling the series by winning the second tie. But he believed the batsmen would have to do enough to put on a healthy total between 230 and 250, something they had not been able to do lately. The 23-year-old captain himself has been going through a lean patch and thought he was a bit unlucky not to get runs. He however said captaincy did not put any pressure on him. Squad: Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Nazimuddin, Roqibul Hasan, Dhiman Ghosh, Mosharraf Hossain Rubel, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel. bd
