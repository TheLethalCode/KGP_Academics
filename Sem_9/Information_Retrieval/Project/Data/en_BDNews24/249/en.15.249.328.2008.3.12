 LONDON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index extended gains by midday on Wednesday, up 1.8 percent, following Tuesday's joint move by major central banks to inject cash into strained credit markets, as banks and miners rallied further. By 1113 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 103.2 points at 5,793.6 after advancing 1.1 percent in the previous session and ahead of British Finance Minister Alistair Darling's budget speech at 1230 GMT. Standard Life jumped more than 10 percent to top the gainers' list on the FTSE 100 after it posted a forecast-beating rise in 2007 operating profit, despite a 249 million pound charge as UK customers continued to cash in policies early. Peers Old Mutual and Legal & General were up 6.8 and 4.3 percent, respectively. The UK benchmark index is still down 10 percent for the year, with investors rattled by fears of the credit crisis pushing the United States into recession. "We are all nervous about the durability of this rally as we have seen before. There is still quite a degree of nervousness about the situation," said Darren Winder, equity strategist at Cazenove. "There is still plenty of things for people to worry about ... I don't think that's going to change," he said. Beaten-down banks were buoyed by the move by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. Barclays advanced 5 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 4.2 percent, Lloyds TSB climbed 3.1 percent and Standard Chartered gained 2 percent. But HBOS lost 2 percent after going ex-dividend. Hedge fund Man Group added 3.3 percent after it said the net asset value of its main AHL Diversified Futures fund rose 1.7 percent last week. US stock indexes rallied 3.6 to 4 percent on Tuesday after the Fed said it would add up to $200 billion to unblock credit market strains in a coordinated effort with other central banks. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average ended up 1.6 percent on Wednesday. Miners rebounded after sharp losses in previous sessions and tracking firmer metal prices. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, Lonmin, Kazakhmys and Vedanta Resources gained between 2.1 and 7.8 percent. Oil shares were also in demand, with BP up 1.8 percent and Royal Dutch Shell tacking on 1.1 percent. AstraZeneca was up 2.1 percent after the drugmaker said a US court would hear its patent case against Teva and Sandoz, which are seeking to make a generic version of schizophrenia drug Serquel, from Aug.
