 Washington, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The largest of the International Space Station's laboratories will be Japan's Kibo, which means "hope." Here's a look at the complex, the first part of which will arrive at the station on board the space shuttle Endeavour: Kibo, which is about the size of a double-decker bus, is so big it needs three shuttle flights for launch and assembly. In addition to the main pressurized laboratory, Kibo has its own storage room and an outdoor porch that will have robot arms to tend to experiments in the vacuum of space. Areas of research include materials sciences, fluid physics and biomedicine. Japan is considering mounting a high-definition television camera outside the complex to beam pictures of Earth to the ground around the clock. Kibo will host cultural activities, such as art and orbital dance, in addition to serving as a workplace for science. Japan spent 20 years and more than $2.4 billion developing the complex.
