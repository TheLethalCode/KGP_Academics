 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell early on Monday led by miners as fears of recession in the United States increased, though HSBC and potential bid target Friends Provident rose. By 0843 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 46.0 points, or 0.8 percent, at 5,653.9, after losing 3 percent last week. The UK benchmark index has fallen 12 percent so far this year. Miners were the worst hit on concerns of slowing global growth. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata and Vedanta Resources were down between 1.4 and 5 percent. Major European indexes were also weaker in early trade, while European credit spreads widened. U.S. stocks fell on Friday to close at their lowest in 19 months after a report showed that employers unexpectedly shed jobs at the steepest rate in nearly five years, while Japan's Nikkei average lost 2 percent on Monday to hit a two-and-a-half-year closing low. HSBC rose 1.8 percent after reports the global banking group would try to raise its stake in China's Bank of Communications beyond 20 percent once regulations allowed it. HSBC declined to comment. The news lent some support to the beaten down sector. Royal Bank of Scotland and Alliance & Leicester were up between 0.5 and 0.8 percent. "We need a bit of good news ...

"It's just the state of the market, as fear is a very toxic sentiment," he added. Friends Provident put on 1.9 percent after the Sunday Express newspaper said private equity group JC Flowers was gearing up to launch a 3.5 billion pound offer for the life insurer, which could come as early as this week. Standard Chartered advanced 0.3 percent after the Middle East Economic Digest magazine said the Asia-focused bank was considering buying RBS's 40 percent stake in Saudi Hollandi Bank in a bid to secure a presence in the world's largest oil exporter. Oil major BP added 0.3 percent and Royal Dutch Shell was up 0.2 percent, tracking firmer oil prices. Energy companies were also under pressure after the Financial Times said Finance Minister Alistair Darling would announce plans to stop energy firms making an alleged 400 million pounds in excess profits from Britain's poorest customers. Darling is due to announce his budget on Wednesday. Centrica, Scottish & Southern Energy, United Utilities and International Power eased between 0.4 and 0.9 percent. Wm Morrison was up 0.5 percent after weekend newspapers said Britain's fourth-largest food retailer was set to unveil a share buyback of up to 1 billion pounds over the next two yea
