<TITLE> Most Austrians want end to debate on Nazi past: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most Austrians feel it is time to end debate about the country's Nazi past, according to a poll released on Tuesday amid commemorations of its annexation by Hitler's Germany 70 years ago. Wednesday's anniversary of the 1938 "Anschluss" has sparked renewed political and media discussion about the extent to which Austrians were victims of Nazism or were willing accomplices in the 'Third Reich'. Austrians were well represented in the upper echelons of Hitler's regime and the country was slow to recognise any responsibility or make reparations in the decades after the war. Sixty percent of 509 people polled wanted the debate to end, unchanged from an earlier survey in 2000, while 36 percent felt it should continue, up from 32 percent, social research institute SWS said. Otto von Habsburg, 95, son of Austria's last emperor, called the country a victim at a commemorative meeting held by the conservative People's Party, part of the governing coalition. "No state in Europe has a greater right than Austria to call itself a victim," newspapers quoted Habsburg as saying. A 1943 Allied declaration that Austria shared responsibility was "hypocrisy and lies", he said. He likened the crowd that packed Vienna's Heldenplatz (Hero's Square) to welcome Hitler back to his homeland to high-spirited soccer fans. Wolfgang Schuessel, a top conservative and former chancellor said Austrians were also perpetrators and that the Heldenplatz throng "was not so harmless as one at a football match". On Monday, Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer opened an exhibition showing how Jewish employees of the State Opera were purged under Nazi rule and few were reinstated after the war. Later on Tuesday, Vienna's Jews planned to formally reopen the Hakoah sport club complex 70 years after it was seized by the Nazis. Hakoah was a major force in pre-war European sport and trained a number of Austrian athletes for Olympic games. On Wednesday a candle-lit vigil will be held at Heldenplatz, silence replacing the jubilation that greeted Hitler
