 CAIRO, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition group, said on Monday only 50 or 60 of its members have been able to register as candidates for local elections next month, out of thousands trying to stand. Saad el-Katatni, the leader of the Islamist organisation's parliamentary group, said the authorities had prevented the others from submitting their papers, clearing the way for the ruling party to sweep up most of the seats. "This is a new system. In the past people could campaign and stand as candidates ... and they would rig the result at the voting stage. The new policy is to stop them at the source," he told a news conference held in the street outside parliament. "The (ruling) National Democratic Party and its government are incapable of honest and fair competition. They continue to push the country towards disaster," he added, reading from an opposition statement. Since government offices opened to receive nomination papers last Tuesday, Brotherhood members in the provinces have repeatedly complained of obstruction by the local authorities. In some cases thugs have prevented them from entering government offices, or officials have refused to deal with them, or they have told them to come back and then found police waiting to detain them when they returned, they say. The Interior Ministry, which runs the police force, said it had no information about the allegations. Since the middle of February police have detained, usually without charges, more than 300 Brotherhood members who were planning to stand or who were helping with campaigning. Muslim Brotherhood officials said on Monday that the movement planned to field about 7,000 candidates for the 52,600 seats at stake in the elections on village, town, district and provincial councils across the country. The Brotherhood seeks an Islamic state through non-violent, democratic means. The government calls it a banned organisation but allows it to operate within limits. The authorities will not let it form a political party so members stand in elections as independents. Egypt postponed local council elections for two years in 2006 after the Brotherhood performed better than expected in a parliamentary election in 2005, winning about one fifth of the seats in the lower house. The local councils where seats are at stake hold little real power, but seats could be important nationally if the Brotherhood wants to qualify to field an independent candidate for the presidency in the futu
