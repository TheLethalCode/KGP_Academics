<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)Chairman of the Jatiya Party HM Ershad said Monday that his party has no objection to participating in the local government elections ahead of the national polls. The JP is also holding talks with various parties regarding the formation of a new alliance, rather than rejoining the previous Awami League-led alliance, Ershad told reporters following a meeting at the party's Banani office. "It is true that we were part of the grand alliance," he said. "However, they broke that alliance." "There is now doubt whether it exists any more." "We will now form a new alliance," he said, adding that he had recently spoken with Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury regarding this. "We are also holding talks with some other parties," said Ershad. The former president urged the caretaker administration to take emergency measures to control the spiralling cost of essentials. Regarding the recent announcement of an amendment to the inheritance law, Ershad said: "No law should be formulated which is inconsistent with religious norms." The JP chairman added that he hoped the general election would be held in line with the Election Commission's roadmap. bdnew
