 OLYMPIA, Greece, March 10 (bdnws24.com/Reuters) - Tibetan activists staged a torch-lighting ceremony outside Olympia on Monday for the start of a global torch relay to protest against decades of Chinese rule over the Himalayan region.

China says it has spent billions of dollars developing the impoverished Himalayan region, and raised its living standards. And it has repeatedly said that it wants to keep politics out of the August Games. The International Olympic Committee has been under mounting pressure as criticism over China's human rights record grows less than six months before the Games. The IOC has rejected a Tibetan request to field a team for next year's Beijing Olympics. The Tibetan team currently comprises some 30 athletes, all exil
