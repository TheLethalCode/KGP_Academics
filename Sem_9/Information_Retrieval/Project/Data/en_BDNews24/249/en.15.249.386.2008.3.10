 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has drafted a new ordinance that intends to ensure public access to most information within 20 days of a formal request in a move to ensure greater freedom to information. The draft of the Right to Information Ordinance 2008 states that a citizen must be provided with information from any governmental or private organisation within 20 days of an application. The draft, however, allows certain information that could impact "the safety of the state and economic system or public interest" to remain out of bounds. The proposed ordinance also recommends a provision to penalise individuals providing incorrect information. Government officials say the draft will be finalised and turned into law following discussions with representatives from different professional groups. An applicant to any information under the proposed ordinance will be required to pay a fixed fee and any organisation wishing to reject an application must do so within 20 days. A further clause states that information relating to an individual's death or release from jail must be provided within 48 hours of the application in view of its importance. Instances where the right to information has been restricted in the ordinance include state security, sovereignty, foreign policy and defence matters. The draft also keeps cases where the relationship with a foreign state or organisation may be put at risk out of public domain. Information may also be withheld where trade, strategic or scientific interests are involved. Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique of Dhaka University's mass communications and journalism department said the public has a right to all information. "The conditions in the draft are not right. The people are the owners of everything in the state. State security means their security. So they should not be kept in the dark on any information," Siddique told bdnews24.com Monday. "The situation now does not warrant keeping defence matters secret. Powerful states can find out most information from satellites. The argument that the economy will be hampered is actually a shield." "The 21st century is the age of the information society. Nothing can be kept secret now," said Siddique. An official at the Press Information Department told bdnews24.com that a view-exchange meeting on the draft will be held with representatives from different professions on March 11. The government will also form an information commission to monitor the ordinance, the official said asking not to be named. The Official Secrets Act 1923 will remain in place, although the new ordinance will carry precedence. bdnews2
