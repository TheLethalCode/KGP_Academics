The tour will include major gigs like the Glastonbury Festival in Britain on June 29, where he could be performing to a crowd as large as 150,000 people, to the more intimate Opera House in Manchester. It includes dates in Toronto and Montreal and a series of concerts across Europe. The last confirmed date of the tour is Vienna on Aug. 29, although more dates are expected to be added, organisers said. "For many this tour will be the once in a lifetime opportunity to see the legend that is Leonard Cohen," said Rob Hallett from AEG Live, the company promoting the tour.
