 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  Seven persons including film director Kazi Hayat and his son Kazi Maruf Sunday got bail in a case filed by film actress Apu Biswas. The court, however, ordered assistant film director David into jail as there were specific allegations against him. Dhaka No. 3 additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani gave the order after the accused persons surrendered to the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for Dhaka at 3:15pm. The other accused who got bail are director Nazrul Islam Khan, assistant director Raj, director Jafar Al Mamun, and actors Habib and Asif. Plaintiff Apu Biswas in the case filed with Tejgaon Police Station on March 5 alleged that while she was taking makeup at a room of the Bangladesh Film Development Corporation at 3pm on Mar 4, the accused under orders of Kazi Hayat had entered the room and sworn at her. They also asked her why she would not work with Kazi Maruf. She also alleged that the accused beat her and her mother and knocked them down with force by pulling them by the hair. At one stage the accused tried to strip the actress of her clothes, she claimed. David snatched her necklace and Kazi Maruf her cell phone set, Apu Biswas alleged. Actor Amit Hasan rescued her and her mother, she said and added David had threatened them while when they had been leaving that if Apu tried to enter the FDC acid would be thrown on her. In the hearing the lawyers for the accused said a vested quarter filed the "false" case against Kazi Hayat and others in a bid to tarnish his professional reputation. bdnew
