 LONDON, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Work on entering a second underground chamber at the former care home in Jersey at the centre of a child abuse inquiry is due to begin on Monday, police said. A first chamber has already revealed a blood-spattered stone bathtub, apparently corroborating evidence given by people claiming they had been abused in the cellar at Haut de la Garenne. Forensic tests are being carried out on the tiny blood spots, invisible to the naked eye, to determine whether they are human. About 160 people have said they were abused at the home between the 1950s and 2003. So far only one person has been charged, though more than 40 suspects have been identified and more arrests are expected. The second underground chamber is thought to be three times as large as the first. Police have carried out a painstaking operation to prepare the structure, and forensic teams will enter from above. "Examining it properly in the search for evidence will take some time," police said in a statement. Jersey Deputy Police Chief Lenny Harper said his officers did not know what they would find. Officers from Northern Ireland arrived on Monday to help in the investigation. The first chamber, which had been bricked up, had to be dug up, and forensic teams worked in cramped and dusty conditions. Police are still waiting for analysis on a fragment of a child's skull found at the home under a layer of concrete by a sniffer dog. It remains unclear whether the child's remains are connected with the incidents that led to the police inquiry. Bones found in the grounds during the past few days are also being tested. "It is probably going to be, I would imagine, two weeks before we get the preliminary findings on that," Harper told BBC radio. "The bulk of the bones we took out of the ground are quite obvious animal bones. There are some that the staff engaged in the search are not sure about. He said there was no actual evidence that any unlawful killings had taken place, but there is some concern that there may have been serious injury or even death. He described media reports of attempts by former police officers or associates to block the investigation as "stupid people behaving in a silly fashion". "There is no suggestion that these people are child abusers or involved in covering up," he said. "But their behaviour is causing us to divert time from what otherwise we would be doing in the inquir
