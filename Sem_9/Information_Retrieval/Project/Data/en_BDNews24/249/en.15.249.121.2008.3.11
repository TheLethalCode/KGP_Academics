 Washington, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US space shuttle Endeavour lifted off on Tuesday with the first segment of Japan's contribution to the International Space Station. Here's a look at what's planned during the 122nd shuttle flight, the second of six missions scheduled for this year: Deliver and install a storage compartment stuffed with computers and gear for Japan's Kibo laboratory, the main part of which is due to arrive on NASA's next shuttle mission in May. Assemble a two-armed, Canadian-made robot named Dextre to be attached to the space station crane, effectively doubling its reach and giving it the ability to work with small items. Replace French astronaut Leopold Eyharts with NASA's Garrett Reisman, a first-time flier who is due to become the sole American on board the orbital outpost when two new Russian cosmonauts arrive in April. Test a technique to repair the space shuttle's heat shield should it be damaged by debris during launch or while in orbit. Use a power converter to tap electricity from the space station so that the shuttle can stay docked for 12 days.
