US and Iraqi officials in Baghdad said they hope to reach an agreement by July, well before the next US president is elected on Nov. 4. "These negotiations will continue until they are finalised in the summer of this year," the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said. US forces operate in Iraq under a United Nations mandate that expires at the end of 2008.
