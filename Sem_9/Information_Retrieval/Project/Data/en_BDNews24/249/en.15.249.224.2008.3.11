 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League and the Communist Party of Bangladesh asked the government Tuesday to immediately announce the schedule for national elections slated for December. The top leaders of the two parties held a meeting at the Gulshan home of acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman. The two parties agreed to work on "common issues", with one party leader commenting that it was "irrelevant to speak of a coalition with Gano Forum and Bikalpadhara". In a post-meeting briefing AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed and CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim said they had agreed on a number of issues, even though the parties held different ideals and views. Both parties said the caretaker government should not carry out any activity that hampers the parliamentary elections. The leaders also expressed concern over detained AL chief Sheikh Hasina's health condition. Asked whether there was a possibility of their forming an alliance ahead of the elections, Selim said: "The CPB and the Awami League remain in the same position on forming an alliance." "We will work together on common issues," he said. In reply to further questions, the CPB leader said: "It is irrelevant to speak of a coalition with Gano Forum and Bikalpadhara (Bangladesh)." Tofail asked the government to lift the state of emergency as early as possible. "The caretaker government has taken an oath in line with section 58 of the constitution." "As per section 58 the government should hold elections immediately," he said. The AL leader claimed the government had "failed to accomplish anything, so far, in line with the roadmap." "We hope the government will announce the schedule of the polls as soon as possible and will give priority to work related to the holding of elections." However, in reply to a question, he said the government should "take proper measures against the parties backed by war criminals, anti-liberation war forces and extremists." bdnews24.
