 London, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British testing and inspections company Intertek Group Plc posted a 16.5 percent rise in annual profit, beating forecasts, and said it was well placed to withstand a global economic slowdown in 2008. The company, which tests products ranging from toys to crude oil, said profit before tax and goodwill rose to 111.3 million pounds ($224.2 million) last year and revenues increased by 16.7 percent to 775.4 million pounds. "We are very well diversified, both geographically and across industry sectors, which would help mitigate any impact in the event of an economic downturn," Chairman Vanni Treves said in a statement on Monday. Analysts had forecast adjusted profit to be within a range of 105.7 million pounds and 109.8 million pounds, according to a Reuters Estimates poll. Shares in the company were up 1.6 percent at 910 pence in early trade, valuing the business at about 1.43 billion pounds. The London-based firm, which ensures products as diverse as Levi jeans and Sony Ericsson phones conform to industry standards, said revenues benefited from both increased global demand for crude oil and recalls of Chinese-manufactured toys in the summer of 2007. "The global demand for minerals is accelerating ... This growth leads to increased demand for testing services at the point of extraction and inspection," Chief Executive Wolfhart Hauser said in the statement. "Product recalls received considerable publicity in the second half of 2007 and this prompted customers to increase the volume of testing provided by independent service providers," Hauser added. Intertek proposed a full-year dividend of 18 pence a share, up 21.6 percent.
