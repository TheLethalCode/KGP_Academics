<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The ministries of shipping and religious affairs are at loggerheads over reintroduction of ships to carry pilgrims for hajj from the next season, after a lapse of a quarter decade. The last time Bangladeshi pilgrims travelled to Saudi Arabia by sea for hajj was in 1985. Officials of the religious affairs ministry said given the present manpower it is not possible for them to arrange resumption of hajj service by sea next season. But shipping ministry officials said there is enough time ahead for necessary preparation. An inter-ministerial meeting, presided over by shipping minister Shajahan Khan, on Feb 8 decided to reintroduce hajj ships after a lapse of 25 years. The meeting formed an 11-member committee, with shipping ministry joint secretary Abdus Kuddus as its head, to implement the decision. Acting secretary of religious affairs ministry Abdur Rob Howlader told bdnews24.com on Monday: "Infrastructure for hajj service by sea doesn't exist any more, as it has been suspended for 25 years. At the same time, we lack the necessary manpower for reintroduction of the service." Committee chief Kuddus, however, expressed the hope that sending of hajj pilgrims by sea would be possible from next season. He told bdnews24.com: "The government wants to reactivate the sea routes. Carrying hajj pilgrims by ships is part of the whole plan. Private shipping lines will carry the pilgrims and the government will only build the infrastructure." He said performing hajj by sea would halve the cost of journey. The shipping minister told reporters after the Feb 8 meeting that 18,000 pilgrims would be sent for hajj next season by ships. He said the decision followed a proposal made by Eden Shipping Lines, a local agent for an Italian shipping company, for transport of Hajj pilgrims by ships. As per the proposal, Eden will carry 18,000 Bangladeshi pilgrims next season to and from Jeddah. The return trip will cost $850 per pilgrim and take 6/7 days to reach Jeddah from Chittagong.
