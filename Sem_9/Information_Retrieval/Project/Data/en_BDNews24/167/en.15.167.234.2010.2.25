<TITLE> Tendulkar better than even Bradman: Nasser Hussain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Former England captain Nasser Hussain is convinced that Sachin Tendulkar is the greatest batsman the game has ever seen, better than even the iconic Don Bradman, reports PTI. "I have never liked comparisons between great players, but after Wednesday's incredible game it must be said -- Sachin Tendulkar is the greatest batsman of all time," Hussain wrote in his column for The Daily Mail. Tendulkar became the first batsman to crack a double century in the four-decade-long history of One-day cricket against South Africa on Wednesday and Hussain felt that should settle the debate on who is the greatest batsman ever.

"What else is left for Tendulkar now? Well, it is sometimes said that he has not played enough match-winning innings on the really big occasion for India. "What better, then, than to score a hundred in the World Cup final against Australia -- or maybe even England -- on home soil this time next year," he said. "That would be the full stop that would enable Tendulkar to ride off into the sunset with everything achieved in his career," said the Englishman. Doffing his hat to Tendulkar and referring to maverick soccer coach Jose Maurinho's famous moniker, Hussain said, "My admiration for him is total.
