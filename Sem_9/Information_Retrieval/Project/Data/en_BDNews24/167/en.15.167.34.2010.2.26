 Khagrachhari, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  A curfew was imposed in Khagrachhari Thursday for the third consecutive night despite a successful initiative of the district authorities to have hill people and settlers hold an "all community " peace meeting and rally. The indigenous and Bengali communities of the town brought out the joint peace procession on the city roads after two days of violent clashes between the two commuites. Nonetheless, a curfew was again in force beginning 8.00pm and will remain till 6.00am Friday. The procession began from Rajyamani Para at midday and after parading though the important city roads ended in front of the deputy commissioner's office. Deputy commissioner of Khagrachhari Mohammad Abdullah, said, "The authorities are trying to bring the situation under control. In line with the disciplinary committee, peace committees are being formed at every ward." He urged everyone to inform the administration of any unwarranted situation and said that the Section 144 clampdown on unofficial public gatherings would continue. Abdullah said that the clampdown and curfew would be withdrawn once the situation became normal. Jatindra Lal Tripura, chairman of Chittagong Hill Tracts taskforce on refugees said that there would be legal measures against the provocateurs. "Some criminal elements, both indigenous and Bengalis, have already been identified. Jamaat leaders and BNP MP Wadud Bhuiyan may also have been involved," he alleged. Khagrachhari district town has been under overnight curfew since Tuesday. One Bengali settler was killed, more than 20 people injured and several houses torched in Tuesday's clashes, which in turn were sparked by similar troubles between the locals and Bengali settlers at Baghaichhari in Rangamati that left two hill people dead and scores of indigenous homes torched last week. The district administration of Khagrachhari distributed relief to 121 families of victims on Thursday. Each of the families received 500 kg of rice, Tk 5000, two sarees and dry food. BLOCKADES TOO Meanwhile, two organisations of settlers had enforced dawn-to-dusk road and river blockades in the three districts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts on Thursday in protest against killing of one and, they claim, abduction of five Bangalis as and "attack on army" by indigenous people. Witnesses said road and river communications of the districts  Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban  with other parts of the country were cut off. Tourists visiting the three hill districts were stranded due to the blockade. Offices, shops and other establishments were also closed, but the situation remained calm, they said. Parbatya Chattagram Samaadhikar Andolon (Chittagong Hill Tracts Equal Rights Movement) and Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad enforced the programme following a series of violent settler-tribal clashes at Baghaichhar in Rangamati and Khagrachhari town in recent days. The blockade supporters picketed at different places. But no incidents of clashes or ransacking occurred. Samaadhikar Andolon's Khagrachhari unit convenor Hafizur Rahman accused UNDP, European Union, and donor agency Danida of instigating the tribal-settlers clashes. He demanded that the government stop the outsiders' activities in hill districts immediately. bdnews24
