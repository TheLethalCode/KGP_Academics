 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  India will launch a special train service linking West Bengal with Bangladesh to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore in May next year. Indian railway minister Mamata Banerjee announced the launch of the special service across the Bangladesh-India border while presenting the rail-budget for 2010-2011 in the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the India's Parliament, on Wednesday. "Tagore is the only poet in the world whose poems have been adopted as National Anthems by two countries  Amar Sonar Bangla for Bangladesh and Jana Gana Mana for India. Tagore lived and produced many of his literary jewels in undivided Bengal," Banerjee told the House. "In homage to this great savant and to strengthen the maitree (friendship) between Bangladesh and India, it is proposed to run a special train in consultation with the Government of Bangladesh across the border so that the two countries share the opportunity of celebrating his 150th birth anniversary jointly," she added. India and Bangladesh already run the Maitree Express, a passenger train linking Kolkata and Dhaka, launched in 2008. Officials of the Indian railway ministry said that the new train could be named the 'Sanskriti Express: Epar Bangla Opar Bangla". The decision to jointly celebrate the 150th birth anniversary Tagoreborn on 25th Baisakh according to the Bengali calendar, in 1861was made during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi last month. According to the joint statement issued at the end of her visit, Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh had recalled "the shared legacy of the great poet laureate" and agreed to oversee the joint celebrations next year. During her India visit, Hasina also had a separate meeting with Banerjee and discussed bilateral cooperation in the rail-sector. Banerjee on Wednesday referred to the proposed rail-link between Akhaura in Bangladesh and Agartala in northeastern Indian state of Tripura. "This link would also provide a shorter rail route between West Bengal and the north-eastern region (of India) via Bangladesh," the minister said. Hasina and Singh agreed that the construction of the Akhaura-Agartala link would be financed by a grant from India. They agreed that a joint team of the railway authorities of the two countries would identify the alignment for connectivity. Singh offered a line of credit of $1 billion to Bangladesh after the delegation-level meeting with Hasina in New Delhi. A large chunk of the credit line is meant for railway infrastructure projects in Bangladesh as well as for supply of Broad Gauge locomotives and passenger coaches from India. Banerjee on Wednesday also said that India would open its training facilities for railway employees from Bangladesh and other South and South-East Asian countries. She also offered the facilities of the Indian Railway's premier Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) for cooperative research and standardisation undertaken through the Asian Railways' Association.
