 Appeals to PM to ensure 'fair probe' Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Indigenous leaders, the international CHT Commission and local rights groups appealed separately Monday for justice and a "fair probe" in the wake of violence in a remote area of Rangamati hill district in which indigenous villages were torched and two people killed. Bagaichhari upazila nirbahi officer ASM Humayun Kabir was withdrawn from duty, the establishment ministry said in a notice, just three days after the severe clashes over land between the Pahar (hill) people and 'Bengali' settlers. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) submitted a memo to the prime minister and called for a parliamentary probe into the events in Baghaichhari Upazila on Feb19-20. Two bullet-ridden bodies were recovered following army intervention in the clashes at Baghaihat between the indigenous and settler communities. Tribal leaders claimed at least six indigenous villagers were killed as the army opened fire on them. PCJSS, the indigenous people's organisation that signed the CHT Peace Accord with the government in 1997, submitted a memorandum to the prime minister on Monday through the Rangamati deputy commissioner after a demonstration at the district town. PCJSS vice-chairman Lakshmiprasad Chakma, addressing the rally, blamed army personnel for the violence and deaths of villagers and demanded their pullout from the area. The organisation demanded prompt punishment for those responsible for the violence. Other demands included compensation for and rehabilitation of those whose homes were torched, relocating 'Bangali settlers' in the region to cluster villages and full implementation of the 1997 peace accord. Buddhist monks also took part in the demonstration and submitted a separate memorandum to the prime minister demanding an "independent investigation" into the incidents. Locals said over 1,000 PCJSS leaders, members and supporters along with Buddhist monks from the area joined in the protest rally and procession from Rajbari area of the town through Banarupa to the deputy commissioner's office. Meanwhile, Parbatya Chattagram Bangali Chhatra Parishad, an organisation of settlers, brought out a separate demonstration in the town blaming the hill people for the violence. CHT COMMISSION 'DEEPLY CONCERNED' The Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission, an independent international organisation committed to the CHT peace process, also wrote to the prime minister Monday. "The commission is very deeply disturbed at allegations of the involvement of the army in the killings of at least two Pahar villagers in 'brushfire'," it said. The commission also expressed its worry on an allegation that a Buddhist temple had been looted during the clashes. The CHTC refuted the claim of "certain political quarters" that the violence occurred due to army withdrawal from the hill tracts. Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP had voiced such a concern the previous day. "The commission in its various field visits to the CHT has not found any evidence of the army presence being withdrawn from the area in question; indeed, the army has long had, and continues to have, a garrison in Baghaihat which is in close proximity of the Pahari villages that were attacked," the commission said. "It has been alleged by affected people that, prior to the firing by the army, a planned arson attack was carried out by Bangali settlers in collusion with the Army and other security forces," the letter added. RIGHTS GROUPS CALL FOR 'PROPER PROBE, ACTION' Six human rights and civil society organisations in Bangladesh also demanded "proper legal actions through neutral investigation" against those responsible for violence. Expressing concern over the situation there, the organisations in a joint statement on Monday questioned how such violence could occur "when an army camp is situated near the area". The organisations, Ain O Salish Kendra, Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust, Association for Land Reform and Development, Nijera Kori, Brac's Legal Aid Programme and Transparency International, Bangladesh, also called for emergency provision of food and medical services for victims of the violence and their full rehabilitation. Quoting media reports, they said many tribal people are struggling to find food and shelter in remote areas. They urged authorities to restore normalcy in the region, and activate the CHT Land Commission to reinstate land rights to the indigenous population. bdnews2
