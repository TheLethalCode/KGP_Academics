<TITLE> Security boost for Khaleda, but no SSF </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  The prime minister has ordered greater security for BNP chief Khaleda Zia, but opposition leader will not get protection from the elite Special Security Force as demanded by her party's senior leaders. Khleda, a three-time elected premier, will be provided with greater security than she now receives, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters on Saturday. He said, "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina ordered home minister Sahara Khatun to increase the opposition leader's security." "Khaleda Zia gets three times more security than Sheikh Hasina used to get when she was the opposition leader," Ashraful said. SSF for Khaleda Zia is a long-time demand of BNP. The main opposition party, after a meeting of its highest policy making body two days ago, renewed the demand in wake of two small blasts in front of Khaleda's political office at Gulshan earlier in the week. Ashraful, with regard to the demand, said Saturday, "The opposition leader doesn't get SSF security under law." The BNP standing committee, however, after its meeting Thursday, vented its concerns about the recent explosion of two handmade bombs targeting Khaleda and demanded passage of new laws if the existing laws do not approve special security for the opposition leader. According to the existing law, only the president and prime minister receive SSF security. But during the last interim government's tenure, both Hasina and Khaleda received this special protection for a time. bdne
