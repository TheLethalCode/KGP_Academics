<TITLE> HC rejects Moeen plea to drop defamation suit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has rejected a petition filed by former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed for dismissal of a Tk 100 crore defamation suit. The bench of justices Abdul Awal and M Moazzam Husain gave the order on Wednesday clearing the way for case proceedings to go on. Former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku filed the suit against Moeen in July last year for defamatory statements made against him by the general. On Mar 27, 2007, Gen Moeen at a gathering was reported to have made allegations of "massive corruption" in the power ministry when Tuku was state minister there. Moeen had reportedly said "at least Tk 20,000 crore" was siphoned out of the country from the power sector alone during the BNP government. Tuku is claiming Tk 100 crore in damages, for the defamatory statements by the then army chief at what was a reception for freedom fighters in March 2007. Moeen moved the High Court for dismissal of the case after the third joint district judge's court rejected a similar motion on Jan 10. His lawyer Kamrul Haq Siddiqui told reporters that they would move the Appellate Division seeking the suit's dismissal. Moeen was appointed army chief in 2005, during the term of the BNP-led government; the subsequent caretaker administration extended his tenure by a year. bdne
