 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank has set banks and non-banking financial institutions a target to disburse around Tk 24,000 crore loans to the SME sector during the current calendar year, a senior executive of the central bank said. "This is the first time the central bank has set a target to disburse loans to the SME sector in the country. We've earlier asked the banks to set their respective targets," Sukomal Sinha Chowdhury, general manager of Bangladesh Bank's SME and Special Programme Department, told bdnews24.com. He said the country's 48 foreign, state-owned and private banks and 24 non-bank financial organisations will disburse the loans. According to Sukomal, outstanding loans to the SME sector stood at around Tk 52,000 crore and the number of loanees at about 4.4 lakh at the end of 2009. He said if the 2010 target is achieved it would be the highest-ever loan disbursement to the sector in a single year. Acting managing director of SME Foundation Momtaj Uddin, however, termed the figure less-than-requirement. Referring to a research finding, he told bdnews24.com that around Tk 18,28,000 crore is needed throughout the SME sector. He said the targeted loans should be properly disbursed to the entrepreneurs on easy terms. Most of the previous loans were restricted to the urban areas, he added. Rural people, particularly women must be given SME loans, he said, adding that increased loans should go for the production sector. Asked which sub-sector would get priority, Sukomal said: "Undoubtedly it's the export-oriented manufacturing sector." "We'll offer 100 percent refinancing facility if loans are given to production and service sectors but maximum 50-60 percent refinancing facility will be given in case of business loans," he said A recent BIDS study revealed that banks and non-banking financial institutions disburse loans mostly to the business sector. It also revealed that the financial institutions gave loans to around 3.91 lakh small and medium entrepreneurs until September, 2009. Of them, around 3.35 lakh are trading houses, 54,000 manufacturing and remaining service-sector firms. BIDS research recommended formulation of a guideline for giving collateral-free SME loans as the number of loan defaulters in the sector is negligible. The study conducted on branches of 14 banks revealed that SME loan recovery rate ranges between 80 percent and 100 percent. Bangladesh Bank has undertaken different plans to boost SME sector by increasing flow of money. Sukomal said: "A booklet containing guidelines and programmes on SME will be released soon." On top of that a road-show will be arranged on SME next month, he added. He said different areas of the country will be earmarked as SME zones where specialised banks will finance the sector.
