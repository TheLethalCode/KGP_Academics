 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  A senior BNP leader has pointed finger at the government over the last year's BDR mutiny, in which around 70 people including 57 army officers were killed. "Anti-state accords have been signed to make the country a market for a neighbour The Pilkhana carnage was plotted as part of making Bangladesh a failed state and market for others," the party's national standing committee member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain told a discussion meeting on Thursday. He said: "Mystery of the killings is yet to be revealed. It's mysterious why the then army chief had not come forward to save lives of his officers. Silence of the prime minister and the government is unacceptable." Jatiya Ganatantrik Party organised the discussion titled "365 days of bleeding: Pilkhana tragedy-target Bangladesh" at the National Press Club. The BNP leader rejected a statement of the BDR director general that the "Dal-Bhat Programme" that the force ran during the previous caretaker government was the root-cause of the carnage. He said the main reason of the mutiny has not been reflected in the investigation reports
