 NEW DELHI, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The government should start fiscal consolidation beginning in April by reforming spending, eliminating its revenue deficit, and putting a cap on government debt, a finance ministry report said on Thursday. The ministry's economic survey for the 2009/10 financial year urged a calibrated exit from fiscal stimulus, which cushioned India's economy from the worst of the global downturn but pushed the fiscal deficit to a 16-year high of 6.8 percent of GDP. The report, presented in parliament ahead of Friday's general budget, forecast economic growth at 8.25-8.75 percent in 2010/11, accelerating to over 9 percent the year after, compared with projected growth of 7.2-7.5 percent in the current year. It also highlighted the possibility of the economy achieving a double-digit growth within the next four years, underscoring the view that the economy is on a firm footing. The report said a top government panel had recommended capping total federal and state debt at 68 percent of GDP by 2014/15. Now, the combined central and state debt runs at 80 percent of GDP. Strong growth along with supply-side inflationary pressures are pushing up inflation in India. High food prices, which rose over 17 percent in January, could spill over into general inflation, the report said. With the economy picking up steam, the finance minister is widely expected to start phasing out fiscal stimulus in his budget for the new financial year and reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.6 percent of GDP, a recent Reuters poll showed. "Lasting fiscal consolidation could accrue with reforms in the design and delivery of planned schemes, outcome focus of expenditure and institutional reforms," the report said. The government is financing its fiscal gap for the current fiscal year by a record 4.51 trillion rupees ($97 billion) of market borrowing and analysts fear high government borrowing in the next fiscal year runs the risk of crowding out private credit demand and hurting the economic recove
