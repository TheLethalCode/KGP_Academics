<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com) -- Seasoned all-rounder Abdul Razzaq has emerged as a surprise candidate to lead Pakistan in the ICC Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies, reported PTI. Well placed PCB sources said Razzaq is being considered for the captaincy and the matter could be discussed at the governing Board meeting in Lahore on Monday. "There is still some doubt within the board after the ball tampering incident of Shahid Afridi in Australia and at this stage he is not a certain choice to lead the team in the T20 World Cup," one source said. "Afridi has already been penalised by the ICC for his ball tampering indiscretion and the inquiry committee could recommend more penalties," the source added. PCB chairman Ijaz Butt has already said that the Board would implement any recommendation made by the inquiry committee, formed to look into the team's poor performances in Australia.

"This leaves Afridi as the prime candidate but now there is a lobby within the board pushing for Razzaq, given his experience and recent performances," he said. Razzaq, 30, has scored 4590 runs 254 wickets in 237 one-day internationals and in 11 T20 internationals he has made 178 runs and took 11 wickets. The all-rounder also has 1946 runs and 100 wickets in 46 Tests. The PCB will announce the captain for the T20 World Cup on March 8 after receiving the inquiry committee report. Interestingly, Razzaq has refused to play for his native Lahore Lions team in the National T20 Championship which begins from Sunday in Karachi. Razzaq is unhappy with the Lahore cricket association, which ignored him for the captaincy this year, and has chosen to play for the powerful Sialkot Stallions which is led by Pakistani teammate Shoaib Malik. Razzaq confirmed that he has decided against playing for Lahore because the local association did not give him a valid for taking away his captaincy. "I asked them give me a proper reason why I should not be captain considering my past performances for them and my experience. But they said they don't need to explain things to me and their decision is final so I decided to play for Sialkot," Razzaq said. The all-rounder led Lahore Lions to the final of the T20 championship last year and also led them in 2006. The Lahore association has appointed Test opener Salman Butt as captain this
