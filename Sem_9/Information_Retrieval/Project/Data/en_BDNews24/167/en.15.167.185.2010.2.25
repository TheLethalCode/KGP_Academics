 CHICAGO, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US prosecutors preparing to try a Pakistani-born Chicago businessman on charges he aided the 2008 Mumbai attackers invoked a secrecy law on Wednesday to control evidence disclosures in the case. Defendant Tahawwur Rana looked on during a federal court hearing where Patrick Fitzgerald, the US attorney in Chicago, and other prosecutors asked the judge for a private hearing to lay out the government's classified evidence.
