 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday rejected five petitions for fresh demarcation of Dhaka wards before city corporation polls. Sazzad Hossain, a resident of capital's Pallabi filed the most recent petition on Feb 7 demanding demarcation the DCC wards based on the latest city census. Four others, Abdul Kuddus, Shamim Mollah, Sayed Mahiuddin and Babul Sheikh, had filed similar petitions in past weeks. The HC bench of justice AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and justice Borhanuddin after consecutive hearings rejected all five petitions, clearing the way for the commission to announce the schedules for the upcoming polls. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told bdnews24.com, "We want to hold the city elections very soon." The pending city corporation polls are due in March. The High Court on Feb 15 ordered the Election Commission not to declare any election schedule until a ruling on the petitions. The commission was also asked to explain why it should not demarcate the DCC wards based on the latest population census. EC's lawyer Shahdeen Malik, after the HC verdict, told bdnews24.com, "The commission now has no embargo on holding the polls as the court has rejected the demand of fresh demarcation." Barristers Raifkul Haque, Roknuddin Mahmud, Amir-ul-Islam and advocate Mahbubur Rahman represented the plaintiffs while Dr Shahdeen Malik stood for the commission. Additional attorney general Murad Reza was present on behalf of the government. He was assisted by deputy attorney general Akram Hossain Chowdhury, assistant attorney general Zesmin Sultana Samsad and Samarendra Nath Bishwas. bdn
