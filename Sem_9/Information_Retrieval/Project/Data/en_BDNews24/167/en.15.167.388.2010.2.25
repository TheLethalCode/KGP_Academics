<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has urged Islamabad to settle the issue of formal apology for war crimes committed by its army in 1971. The minister made the call as newly appointed Pakistan high commissioner Ashraf Qureshi saw her at the foreign ministry Thursday afternoon. The foreign minister also told the high commissioner that Bangladesh would go ahead with the trial of the local war criminals that collaborated with the Pakistan army in killing an estimated three million people during the country's nine-month liberation war. "The foreign minister has raised the issue seeking formal apology by the Pakistan government and the trial of the war criminals," a senior foreign ministry official attending the meeting told bdnews24.com. "The high commissioner termed the issue of trying war criminals an 'internal issue' of Bangladesh", the official said. Quereshi also said the matter of a formal apology by Islamabad was addressed by a tripartite agreement after the war. "Our government's position is there in the 1974 tripartite agreement between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and that addresses the issue," Qureshi told bdnews24.com after the meeting "We stand by and abide by it," he said replying to a further question on his government's stance on war crimes. The agreement was signed on April 9, 1974 by the then Bangladesh foreign minister Dr Kamal Hossain, Indian external affairs minister Saran Singh and Pakistan's state minister for defence and foreign affairs Aziz Ahmed. The reconciliatory agreement says, "The Pakistan government condemned and deeply regretted the crimes that may have been committed". As per the agreement, the Pakistan prime minister should appeal to Bangladeshis to "forgive the mistakes of the past". It also said Bangladesh prime minister, following the Pakistan prime minister's apology, should urge Bangladeshis to forget the past. But no Pakistan prime minister ever made a formal apology to Bangladesh. Ashraf Qureshi said he and Dipu Moni discussed the probable visit of Pakistan prime minister to Bangladesh. "Our prime minister can come here or the honourable prime minister of Bangladesh can visit Pakistan," he said. The envoy said the date of such a visit would be fixed through diplomatic channels. The Pakistan army launched a massive crackdown on Bangladeshis on March 25, 1971 to silence the liberation movement of its Eastern wing, which came into being as independent Bangladesh on Dec 16 same year. "Dipu Moni expressed hope that the two countries would soon be able to resolve outstanding issues like formal apologies by the Pakistan government for the atrocities committed in 1971, repatriation of stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh, division of assets etc," a foreign ministry press statement on the meeting said. The ruling Awami League, which led the war of independence, is proceeding with its election pledge of trying 1971 war criminals.
