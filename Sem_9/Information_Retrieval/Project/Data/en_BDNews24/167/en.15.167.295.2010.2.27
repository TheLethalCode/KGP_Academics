 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Saturday accused BNP founder Ziaur Rahman for creating the indigenous-Bengali conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, which has erupted again violently in recent days. The minister also claimed that the Awami League, during its first tenure from 1996-2001, had brought calm to the hill districts in the south east of Bangladesh, particularly after signing of the peace accord in 1997. "Ziaur Rahman created this situation by encouraging Bengalis to settle in the Chittagong Hill Tracts," Ashraf said. The LGRD minister, also spokesperson for the ruling Awami League, was talking to reporters at a press briefing after a central working committee meeting of the party. Ashraf claimed that immediately after independence of Bangladesh there were no conflicts in region. "But a civil war erupted after Bengalis settled in the area." He blamed the BNP-Jamaat alliance for being against the accord and creating discord in the region even now. At least two indigenous people and one Bengali settler has been killed, scores of people injured and whole villages torched during clashes this month in the hill districts of Rangamati and Khagrachhari. Khagrachhari district town was under curfew for three nights last week in the wake of violence. Long-standing animosity exists between hill people and Bengali settlers in the hills where the army has been deployed for decades to battle insurgency. Tensions surfaced again with the incumbent government's move to start implementing the 1997 CHT Peace Accord after a long gap. bdnews2
