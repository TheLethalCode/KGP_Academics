 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition BNP has demanded the elite Special Security Force for Khaleda Zia on Friday. The senior party leaders came up with this demand at a meeting of BNP's highest body on Thursday night. Standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan said: "We are deeply concerned about the two recent bomb attacks on BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. BNP standing committee demands deployment of SSF to secure her life." He also demanded passage of new laws for the deployment if necessary. "A law was passed stipulating the government to provide the prime minister and her family members with protection by Special Security Force. Therefore, a similar law should be passed to provide security to the three-time elected premier Khaleda Zia," Khan said. When asked if the bomb attacks were staged by the BNP itself, the opposition policy-maker said that such proposition were part of the Awami League's propaganda. "They are spreading the rumors for they do not want to offer Khaleda Zia any security." BNP has decided to form 19 central teams to enhance and strengthen party activities. "These teams will arrange assemblies at all the districts within April 7 and recruit party activists," Khan said. The standing committee expressed its grief over the death of garment workers in Gazipur and demanded necessary cooperation and compensation for the deceased. It also demanded punishment of the provocateurs involved in the BDR rebellion of Feb 25-26 last year. The top party leaders also demanded reinstatement of army in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and expressed their worries regarding the recent violence. The senior leaders crticised the government for not providing Khaleda Zia with due protocol, Khan told reporters. bd
