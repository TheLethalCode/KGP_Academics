<TEXT>
 MILAN, 21 Feb (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AS Roma reinvigorated the Serie A title race by beating Catania 1-0 on Sunday and cutting the gap with leaders Inter Milan to five points. Champions Inter had their third straight draw when they were held 0-0 by Sampdoria on Saturday after having two players sent off and second-placed Roma made sure they took advantage despite some late nerves. Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic, up front alone with Francesco Totti suspended and Luca Toni injured, prodded in an 18th-minute corner to overcome the lowly visitors. Claudio Ranieri's side, who lost for the first time in 21 matches in Thursday's Europa League defeat at Panathinaikos, have stormed up Serie A after a sticky start and host Inter in late March in one of their 13 remaining games. Asked if the title race had been reopened, Ranieri told Sky TV: "No, no. Honestly no. You still can't say it, but we move forward. Our mind is on the Europa League campaign. Inter are a great side." AC Milan, 10 behind Inter in third with two games in hand, visit Bari in the late game (1945 GMT). CANDREVA WINNER Juventus moved up to fourth after a patchy 2-1 victory at Bologna, their third win in a row under Alberto Zaccheroni. Brazilian playmaker Diego, criticised by fans and media for his poor form, sliced through the Bologna defence on four minutes and slotted home after his first effort had been saved. Fabio Cannavaro was again left on the bench with Juve playing three at the back but their defence was exposed when Antonio Busce bundled in the equaliser after first hitting the post with keeper Gianluigi Buffon nowhere. Substitute Antonio Candreva settled matters midway through the second half after an excellent pass from Alessandro Del Piero, while Felipe Melo had a third goal ruled out for offside. Bologna had chances to level before Andrea Raggi was sent off late on. Napoli and Palermo are one point behind Juve after the Naples club were held 0-0 at bottom side Siena and the Sicilians easily beat coach Delio Rossi's former club Lazio 3-1. Cagliari lie two further back following a 2-0 victory over Parma while Alberto Gilardino headed the winner in inconsistent Fiorentina's 2-1 comeback win over third-from-bottom Livorno. Toothless Atalanta lost 1-0 at home to Chievo to stay in the drop zone
