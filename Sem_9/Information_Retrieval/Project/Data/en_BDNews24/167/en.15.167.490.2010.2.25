 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's border force is set to undergo structural and cosmetic changes and will be administered by a new law that sets death as the maximum penalty for mutiny, one year on from the carnage at Pilkhana. But the question lingers, as military authority is set to remain intact, whether the underlying reasons for the revolt, will be addressed. The erstwhile Bangladesh Rifles is being renamed, reclothed and reconstituted, but the border force's chief, Major General Moinul Islam, has hinted that the changes may not address the long tendency of overlooking problems of the rank and file. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder told bdnews24.com Wednesday the final draft of the new Border Guard Bangladesh Act will be sent to the cabinet "within a week." The Bangladesh Rifles has a rich history of valour and courage in not only protecting Bangladesh's borders but also for their role in the Liberation War. The BDR since independence defended the country's borders numerous times, often against a larger and better-equipped opposition, protecting Bangladesh's sovereignty. But like its change of name, which is felt to have been tainted with the mutiny, the top posts among the border guards are also perceived to carry a stigma since the revolt. The draft law suggests a new organogram abolishing the rank of DAD, the highest among the rifles men. It was a deputy assistant director who was accused of leading the mutiny. The new law will also toughen promotion for guardsmen to equivalent positions. The deputy director general of the border guards, Brig Gen Md Obaidul Haque told bdnews24.com on Wednesday: "There are proposals to change some ranks like deputy assistant directors." "Promotion to such ranks will have more requisites and conditions attached. The rifles men used to get promoted to these ranks before quite easily. But not in future." Once put in force, the current Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) Order of 1972 and Bangladesh Rifles (Special Provision) Ordinance 1976 will be annulled and the force renamed as Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB). Home secretary Shikder said the proposed law also would introduce new regional headquarters directly under the central Pilkhana headquarters but above the sector headquarters in order to consolidate and further streamline the border guard's command structure. There are also proposals to create more Border Outposts and swell the force's ranks. There are also proposals to increase penalties for crimes committed by border guards. Shikdar said the new law has a provision for death penalty for mutiny, or disobedience on the battlefield, for BGB members. Under the current BDR law, the maximum sentence by a special court is seven years in prison for breaking discipline, deemed insufficient for murder, rape, looting as well as arson that the Pilkhana mutineers have been accused of. The act stipulates that photographs and recorded conversation will be accepted by the special courts as evidence, he added. The force is being reformed in line with the suggestions made on May 27 last year by an investigation committee, formed after the rebellion. A separate committee, headed by the BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, formulated the draft and submitted it to the home ministry. 'LONG IGNORED PROBLEMS' One year since the border guards took up arms against their officers, killing scores and holding hundreds of families hostage for two horrifying days, the BDR chief has conceded that long ignored problems caused the revolt. In an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com on Feb 1, Gen Mainul candidly admitted, "We have a tendency to sweep the dirt under the carpet." Suggesting that the problems had piled up to unsustainable proportions, the BDR chief said, "Only after the carpet was bloodied by 58 fallen officers, did we find out that there was too much dirt under it." Mainul, appointed after his predecessor was executed by rifles men on the first day of the two-day mutiny that shocked the nation, admitted openly that it was indeed a reflection of failure of huge proportions. Referring to the prime minister's visit to Pilkhana on the occasion of BDR Week last year, the general said, "The prime minister herself had visited there the day before." "The rebellion occurred the next day. That it was a failure of huge proportions does not need to be elaborated." Gen Mainul pointed out that when Bangladesh Rifles came into being after independence it simply followed the East Pakistan Rifles model. He said there will not be any major changes in that model even now, hinting that long-held frustrations between border guards and their army officers might remain. Trial of the mutineers is now underway but official probe reports are yet to be submitted and made public and the murder probe lags on. Almost a year later, the wounds have yet to heal. Investigators have grilled nearly 8,000 people and arrested 2,200 over the past twelve months in the criminal case being prepared to try the killers. The CID's Abdul Kahhar Akhand, investigation officer in the case, in a press conference Wednesday, said the probe was "near closure". Akhand said that until now the reason behind the mutiny was found to be "dissatisfaction" among the BDR ranks. Before the mutiny, reports of the rifle men's simmering resentments and anger against their army officers had come to light. There were allegations of corruption among army officers, repression of BDR personnel and arbitrary punishment by officers. Special courts under BDR law are now trying the charges of mutiny, and rebellion that spread to other outposts, under BDR law. But the killings, rape and arson that occurred at Pilkhana, being investigated by CID, will be tried under criminal law in order to carry maximum penalty, up to death, under the penal code.
