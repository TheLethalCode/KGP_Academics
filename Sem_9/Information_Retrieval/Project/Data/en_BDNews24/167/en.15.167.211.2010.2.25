<TITLE> Obama conciliatory ahead of healthcare summit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House sounded a conciliatory note on Wednesday before a high-level meeting to break a healthcare impasse in the US Congress, but an opinion poll found a vast majority of Americans predicted failure. The healthcare plan offered by President Barack Obama on Monday was not the last word on the issue, the White House said, promising to work to find common ground with wary Republicans at a televised summit on Thursday. "It is important to understand that this proposal isn't meant to be the final say on the legislation," Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, said in an email. The summit will bring together leaders of both parties in a last-gasp effort to revive a sweeping healthcare overhaul that has stalled in Congress amid broad public dissatisfaction and unified Republican opposition. Healthcare bills passed by the Democratic-controlled House and Senate last year were designed to reshape the $2.5 trillion healthcare industry by cutting costs, regulating insurers and expanding coverage to tens of millions of Americans. But efforts to merge them and send a final version to Obama collapsed in January after Democrats lost their crucial 60th vote in a special US Senate election in Massachusetts. Americans have low expectations for Thursday's gathering to revive the overhaul, with about three-quarters of respondents in a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll believing both sides will leave the day-long session without agreement. One in five thought they would reach a deal. The poll found 49 percent of Americans oppose the sweeping Democratic-backed bills passed last year by the House of Representatives and the Senate, with 43 percent backing them. Republicans, who have demanded Democrats scrap the bills and start over, criticized Obama for signalling he would consider ramming the bill through Congress using a procedure that would bypass the need for Republican support. "In light of all these behind-the-scenes efforts to get around the will of the people, it's hard to imagine what the purpose of Thursday's summit is," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. Republicans said they would focus at the summit on a scaled-back approach that would boost competition across state lines and curtail medical malpractice lawsuits. But if Republicans insist Democrats should scrap the existing bills and start over "then there is nothing to talk about," Democratic Senator Chris Dodd said. DEMOCRATS PRESSURE INSURERS Democrats turned up the pressure on the health insurance industry on Wednesday with a hearing on a recent premium increase by insurer WellPoint Inc and a House vote to repeal the industry's antitrust exemption. Democrats called the recent premium increases for some Anthem Blue Cross customers in California a function of greed rather than need and said they highlighted the importance of reform. "Unless Congress and the administration act, Americans across the country will continue to experience large premium increases and will be priced out of the market," said Representative Bart Stupak, head of the House Energy and Commerce oversight panel. The House voted for 406-19 to approve a measure that would remove the federal antitrust exemption for the insurance industry, which Democrats said would increase competition and help shine a light on industry practices. But health insurer stocks shrugged off the blows, with the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index up 0.7 percent in late afternoon trade. Shares of WellPoint were up 1.7 percent in late afternoon trade. Negotiations for the summit have touched on everything from the list of attendees to the shape of the table. The meeting will be broken into sections to discuss controlling costs, insurance reforms, deficit reduction and expanding coverage, the White House sa
