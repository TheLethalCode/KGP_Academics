 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com) -- The government is going to make provisions for compensating deaths caused by attack of wild animals. A proposed guideline for such compensation envisages that if anybody is killed by attack from an animal his or her family would receive Tk two lakh. If any person is maimed from such attack he or she would get Tk one lakh and if injured would get Tk 20,000 as well as free treatment at hospitals. Environment and forest secretary Mihir Kanti Majumdar told bdnews24.com, "The process is on to finalise the draft guideline spelling out provisions for compensating casualties by wild animals." The draft would later be sent to the cabinet for approval, Mihir said A person would be entitled to such compensation if he or she is exposed to attacks by tiger, elephant, crocodiles and python in the permissive areas of any forest. A survey conducted in 2004 by an organisation concerned with conserving nature and wildlife revealed that wild elephants killed 39 people and damaged property worth Tk 2.92 crore in one year. According the survey wild animals claimed 162 human lives from 1997 to 2002 while 22 elephants were killed by men during the period. Conservator of forest directorate (wildlife and nature conservation circle) Tapan Kumar Dey told bdnews24.com that a total of 193 people were killed by tigers from 2000 to 2009 while men killed some 23 tigers during the period. Professor Jakir Hossain of Dhaka University Zoology Department said forests are being destroyed because of rapid growth of population and urbanization. The initiative for paying compensation is undoubtedly a good move but public awareness should be raised to drive away stray wild animals back to the forests, he said. Hightlights in the proposed guidelines: The family losing one member will receive Tk two lakh as compensation. A maimed person will get Tk one lakh and an injured victim Tk 20,000 apart from free treatment in hospitals. Forest department will pay Tk 2,000 for damaged crops, Tk 10,000 for damaged homesteads and market value for the dead domesticated animals. Information on casualties and estimated loss of moveable and immovable properties will have to be reported to the forest range office within seven days. Compensation claims will have to be made along with medical certificates after filing a general diary. Divisional forest officer will hand over to wards of the victims the compensation money on the basis of assessment report submitted by a probe committee to be led by a forest department official. bdnews24.c
