<TITLE> Argentina claims regional support in Falklands row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Argentine President Cristina Fernandez said Latin American leaders backed her objections to oil exploration in the British-controlled Falkland islands, as the first well began drilling on Monday. Argentina lost the islands, called the Malvinas in Spanish, in a war with Britain in 1982 but still claims the territory and says the oil drilling by British firm Desire Petroleum is a breach of sovereignty. "There continues to be systematic violation of international law that should be respected by all countries," Fernandez told the opening session of a regional summit near the Mexican resort town of Playa del Carmen. "In the name of our government and in the name of my people I am grateful ... for the support this meeting has given to our demands," Fernandez said. Venezuelan Hugo Chavez addressed Britain's Queen Elizabeth directly on his weekly television program telling her to return the Falklands to Argentina. He repeated his claims late Sunday when he arrived in Mexico for the summit. "We support unconditionally the Argentine government and the Argentine people in their complaints," Chavez told reporters at the airport. "That sea and that land belongs to Argentina and to Latin America." Escalating the dispute, Argentina formally objected to British-led drilling plans near South Atlantic Islands, and said it would require all ships from the Falklands to obtain permits to dock in Argentina. While the Falklands are not an oil producer and have no proven reserves, oil companies are betting offshore fields may hold billions of recoverable barrels of oil. Desire Petroleum (DES.L) said it broke ground at a well on its offshore "Liz" prospect, which could contain up to 400 million barrels, although there is a possibility the exploration will recover nothing.
