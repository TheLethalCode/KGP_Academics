 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  The president, ministers, chiefs of the three armed services and Bangladesh Rifles paid homage to the army officers killed during the Pilkhana mutiny, on Thursday, the first anniversary of the bloody incident. Home minister Sahara Khatun and state minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku placed wreaths at their graves at Banani in Dhaka at 9am.

Chief of army staff Gen Md Abdul Mubeen, chief of naval staff Vice Admiral Zahir Uddin Ahmed, chief of air force staff Air Marshal Shah Mohammad Ziaur Rahman and BDR director general Brig Gen Mainul Hossain also placed wreaths at their graves. A munajaat, or special prayer, was arranged to seek salvation of the departed souls. Imam of central army mosque Moulana Mahamudul Haq conducted the prayer. Family members of mutiny victims were present there. The mutineers killed over 70 people at Pilkhana during the bloody events of Feb 25-26 last year, 58 of them army officers deputed to the border force. One year on since border guards at the BDR's Dhaka headquarters took up arms against their officers, killing scores and holding hundreds of families hostage for two horrifying days, a special court at Durbar Hall, the scene of the crime, launched the Pilkhana mutiny trial this weekbut the murder probe lags on. Special courts are trying the charges of mutiny, and rebellion that spread to other outposts, under BDR law. But the mkillings, rape and arson that occurred at Pilkhana, being investigated by CID, will be tried under criminal law to carry the maximum penalty, up to death, under the penal code.
