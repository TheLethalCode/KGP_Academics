<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Construction work on the courtroom, custodial cells and related offices for the special tribunal to try 1971 war crimes has been completed, over one year since the government started preparing for the trials. "A major part of the work is accomplished now the infrastructure of the court has been completed," law minister Shafique Ahmed said while inaugurating the tribunal premises. "Now appointments of investigators, prosecutors, tribunal chairmen and members can begin." Home minister Shahara Khatun, who was also present, said investigation agencies would be appointed "soon", though the government has been saying the same for some time. Pressed for a specific timeline for appointment of prosecutors and tribunal members, the minister said, "I hope trial of war criminals will begin in April after completing all the formalities in March." Sector Commander Harunur Rashid called for speedy trial of war criminals as important evidence of war crimes was disappearing everyday. "Around 3,000 freedom fighters died just last year. With the passing of days, evidence as well as crucial facts of war crimes is being wiping out." Planning minister AK Khandaker, state minister for law Kamrul Islam, state minister for liberation war Tajul Islam, among others, were present at the inauguration ceremony. The one-storey establishment for the war crimes tribunal is situated at the Old High Court Building in premises which were earlier used as offices of the law commission and judicial commission. Before Bangladesh's independence in 1971, it was the chamber of the chief justice of the then East Pakistan. The ground floor of the building now has areas to house the chief prosecutor, chief investigator and registrar. It also has a custodial room, records room, IT room, media room and a reception room. The custodial room can accommodate twenty accused. The 'International Crimes Tribunal' is on the first floor with a bench, a dock and seating space for defence and prosecution lawyers and journalists. Behind the bench, there are chambers for the tribunal chairman and two tribunal members. b
