<TITLE> Civilian deaths complicate Afghan mission </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The latest civilian deaths in Afghanistan may threaten the new US strategy, boost Taliban recruitment and complicate efforts to get public support for the war from Afghans, Europeans and Americans. The deaths also spotlight the delicate balance of getting the job done on the battlefield in the eight-year-old war while not isolating local populations whose support is ultimately needed to win against the Taliban. "It's tough terrain. It's tough to know. And these are split-second decisions that commanders in combat on the ground have to make," Admiral Mike Mullen, the top US officer as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the latest civilian deaths. But analysts caution that incidents like the one on Sunday, in which a NATO airstrike in central Afghanistan killed 27 civilians, endanger the counterinsurgency strategy drawn up by US General Stanley McChrystal, "This (civilian deaths) could be in many ways the number one greatest vulnerability we have as a coalition," said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution, a Washington thinktank. "Future days like this are one of the few ways I could see us losing this war," O'Hanlon said. "He (McChrystal) knows better than anyone how serious of a blow this is in our efforts to make progress with the Afghan people." Aside from Afghan anger, there could be fallout politically in Europe and the United States, where President Barack Obama is struggling to keep his own Democratic Party on board in supporting the war and the public wants to see quick results in Afghanistan. "Another battle for this war is trying to maintain popular support," said Bruce Riedel, who led the Obama administration's review last year of Afghan and Pakistan strategy. POLITICAL FALLOUT? In Germany, there were repercussions after a NATO airstrike last September in the northern province of Kunduz killed at least 30 civilians. Germany's defence minister at the time stepped down and it became a major domestic issue. In the Netherlands, the government collapsed over the weekend after the Labour Party pulled out, saying it could not support a NATO request to extend the Dutch mission in Afghanistan past this year. Riedel predicted there could be a domino effect after the Dutch withdrawal, with the Canadians possibly next, and this could create a perception that NATO support was being downgraded for the mission in Afghanistan. Civilian deaths also serve to boost Taliban recruiting efforts, making the war effort even more difficult. "It is certainly the consensus view among NATO intelligence that the inadvertent killing of civilians is one of the two or three things, along with corruption and favouritism perhaps, that most help the Taliban in recruiting," said O'Hanlon. Civilian casualties also expose the limits of a counterinsurgency strategy based on the idea of a "friendly" war to separate civilians from insurgents. The messy nature of war makes it difficult not to call in air support, as happened in the latest civilian deaths. "These kinds of things, in many respects, are inherent in a war," US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said on Monday. "It's what makes war so ugly." Other recent civilian deaths include the 12 people or more killed in a poorly targeted rocket strike the day after Operation Mushtarak -- seen as a test of Obama's new war strategy -- started this month in Marjah. Military analyst Anthony Cordesman said no matter how careful US troops were, there would be civilian casualties. "You are making bad trade-offs all the time and this is why it is called war," said Cordesman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In the quest to avoid civilian casualties, he said, there could be a loss of "tactical momentum" with more casualties down the line as battles took longer. "So rather than actually reducing casualties, they are extending them over time," said Cordesm
