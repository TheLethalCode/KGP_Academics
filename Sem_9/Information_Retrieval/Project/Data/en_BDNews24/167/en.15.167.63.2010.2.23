 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  A countrywide anti-adulteration drive to check purity of food products on the market will start in a week, the state minister for local government said on Tuesday. "The decision has been taken to ensure pure food and protect the people against harmful adulteration. The programme needs further strengthening and a national movement against adulteration will have to be developed," state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak told reporters after a meeting of the national food security advisory council. The council, in its first meeting in five years ago, instructed the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute (BSTI) to conduct the drive. BSTI has been instructed to ensure proper standards of both imported food products, including children's food, and produce of the country, including powdered and liquid milk, said Nanak. He said BSTI would lead the anti-adulteration drive around the country. "No matter how influential, no adulterer will get leeway," the minister warned. He also urged all concerned officials to perform their duties responsibly and strengthen the city corporation's regular drives against adulteration. The national food security advisory council was formed according to section 4 of the amended Bangladesh Pure Food Act 2005. The first meeting of the council was held on the day of its formation, Sep 27, 2005, presided by the then LGRD minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. The second meeting at the LGRD ministry was attended by industries secretary Jakir Hossain, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder among others. bd
