 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has accused prime minister Sheikh Hasina of violating her oath of office by renaming Zia International Airport "as an act of vengeance". A senior opposition leader said the prime minister herself admitted to such an act. "The prime minister said publicly that her government changed the name of Zia International Airport vindictively as she wanted to 'teach BNP a lesson'," BNP standing committee member Khondakar Mosharraf Hossain said on Monday. "In these circumstances, she has no right to stay in power." The BNP leader was addressing a protest meeting in front of the party's Paltan headquarters. He also warned the government his party would launch a tough movement against any suppression on opposition activities. The prime minister last week said Dhaka's international airportnamed after late president and founder of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Gen Ziaur Rahmanwas re-named "to teach BNP a lesson". Criticising the government for its move to rename establishments bearing Ziaur Rahman's name, Hossain said, "Awami League is doing so for they are afraid of Zia and BNP." He urged all "nationalist forces" to join under the leadership of BNP chief, and Zia's widow, Khaleda Zia. "They (Awami League) have surrendered all Bangladesh's interests to India. People of Bangladesh are not secure under their rule," he alleged. BNP vice-president Abdullah Al Noman and standing committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy and Abdul Moyeen Khan were present among others at the meeting
