 Sirajganj, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Locals have blamed makeshift REB wiring for the death of a mother and her three month old daughter in a fire at Char-Chhonagacha village in Sirajganj in the early hours of Thursday. The fire, erupting from an overhead electric cable, burned down the entire homestead of Nazrul, a handloom worker, including two tin rooms and a thatch house. All their valuables including furniture and livestock were turned to ashes. Locals said as the fire caught above one of the tin roofs and spread through the presmises, Nazrul's wife Shukhi, 24, and two daughters, Naima, 3, and three-month-old Sajin, were sleeping in one of the rooms. Of the trio, only Naima survived with burn injuries and was admitted to Shirajganj General Hospital. Locals said the Rural Electrification Board disconnected the line in the morning, nine hours after the incident. Chhongachha union's AL unit president Md Shahidul Alam alleged that the rural electrification authorities took no steps after Nazrul informed them of the dangerous cable, 15-16 days before the fire, which was coming in contact with the tin roof and an adjoining eucalyptus tree. He also said locals had seen sparks coming from the cable. Alam said other homes and establishments face similar risk from badly maintained REB cables but the board has taken no steps to repair the faulty lines. Mamunur Rashid, deputy general manager of Sirajganj REB's Shiakol office, claimed that he had switched off the connection overnight immediately on hearing of the fire. But, he added, the source of the fire could not be confirmed without investigation. The upazila nirbahi officer Mohammad Hossain visited the site at around 10am. bdnews24
