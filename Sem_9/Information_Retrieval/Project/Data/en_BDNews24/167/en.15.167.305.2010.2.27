 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  At least 70 shanties were burnt to a shell in less than hour as a fire raged through the sprawling 'Bihari slum' in Mirpur's Section 11 on Saturday. Director general of the fire brigade, Brig Gen Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah said, "The fire was completely out around 9pm. Primary estimates indicate 70 shanties were burnt in the incident. No one was hurt or killed." Locals, however, said over 100 homes were razed. Kazi Sufia, an official of the fire brigade control room told bdnews24.com the fire broke out around 7.20pm. "Fire fighters managed to bring the blaze under control by 7.55pm but scores of shanties were razed to the ground in that time." She said seven fire vehicles went to the scene. bdnews24.com's reporter at the site said the fire was fully extinguished just after 9pm. Police and locals said the slum consists of around 1000 shanties. Residents of the slum alleged the fire was deliberately started by local gang members. Abdul Halim, a slum resident, told bdnews24.com, "A gang of thugs beat up a boy from the slum on Friday. A meeting of elders to judge the incident was to be held at 8pm." "The gang members were threatening the slum-dwellers about the incident through the day and have set fire to the slum in the evening." However, the fire chief said, "The source of the fire can only be confirmed after proper investigation." Local MP Ilias Uddin Mollah told bdnews24.com that locals had captured one of the men accused by the locals, named Hasan, and handed him to the police.
