 MELBOURNE, 23 Feb (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bernard Tomic is set to become Australia's youngest Davis Cup player after being named in the squad to face Taiwan in a regional group tie next month. The 17-year-old had been selected along with Peter Luczak, Carsten Ball and doubles specialist Paul Hanley for the March 5-7 Asia Oceania Group One tie at Melbourne Park, Tennis Australia said in a statement on Tuesday. "I'm very pleased with the make-up of our team and believe we have a good balance of experience and youth," team captain John Fitzgerald said in the statement. The U.S. Open junior champion Tomic is considered the heir apparent to Australia's top-ranked player and Davis Cup regular Lleyton Hewitt, who has been sidelined following hip surgery in January. Tomic impressed in his second Australian Open in January, pushing semi-finalist Marin Cilic to five sets in their second-round match, a year after becoming the youngest man in professional tennis to win a match at the tournament last year. John Alexander, who was also 17, holds the record for Australia's youngest Davis Cup player but Tomic will be 42 days younger if he competes in the singles against Taiwan. Australia reached four finals in five years from 1999 but has struggled in recent years due to a lack of depth in quality players with only Hewitt (24) and Luczak (75) currently ranked in the top 100. The 28-times winners lost a world group play-off against Chile in 2008 and the following year's campaign ended off the court when the team forfeited a regional group tie against India due to security concerns
