 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP has pointed finger at Awami League leader and parliament whip Mirza Azam over Tuesday's bomb explosion in front of its chairperson's Gulshan office in Dhaka. "Mirza Azam was seen moving on a road adjacent to the (BNP) chairperson's office three times immediately after the explosion. Hundreds of people saw him," party's senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told a hurriedly convened press conference on Wednesday at BNP Paltan office. He, however, answered in the negative when asked whether he accused Azam of the incident. "He was seen there immediately after the blast. You all know about his past deeds," he said. Alamgir demanded a neutral probe into the incident and an immediate arrest of the persons involved in it. "We believe a neutral investigation will reveal the truth." Two bombs exploded in front of the BNP chairperson office at around 10:30pm on Tuesday, leaving Abdul Hamid Paban, son of party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, injured. The BNP leader said the bomb explosion was targeted at killing of their 'popular chairperson' and mentioned that earlier bombs were planted in front of her office. Police on Feb 15 recovered two suspect packages, thought to be crude explosive devices or 'cocktails', in front of the same office. Alamgir said the government is not paying heed to their request for arranging 'adequate security' for the opposition leader. He came down heavily on the government for "ruling party activists' attack on BNP's demonstration" at upazila and thana level. He said BNP activists came under attacks of Awami League supporters at different parts of the country, including Jessore, Narayanganj, Nator, Munshiganj, Madaripur, Bhola, Barisal, Chapainawabganj districts, during the demonstration. Alamgir also condemned the attack on a female student and her relatives by pro-ruling Chhatra League activists. BNP leaders Zainal Abdin Farroque, also opposition chief whip, and Rizvi Ahmed, Fazlul Haq Milion and Khairul Kabir Khokon were also present at the press conference.
