<TITLE> DMP to renew traffic control efforts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Shahidul Haq on Monday blamed drivers for failure in establishing a proper lane system in the capital. "I saw drivers running red lights here just yesterday. They are going by laws only in presence of police, otherwise not," he said while visiting the Sheraton Hotel intersection. DMP's efforts to introduce a three-lane system in Dhaka began in December last year. The DMP chief said his force was renewing efforts to ensure drivers' compliance with traffic light and lane rules. Thirteen police teams will now work through the city. A deputy police commissioner will lead each team. Representatives of transport owners and workers will also accompany them. Anyone who violates lane or traffic light rules will face a Tk 1,000 fine, said Haq. He rejected allegations against traffic police of taking advantage of greater scope for corruption and bribe-taking with the new rules and fines. "We have not found any specific proof of that," the police commissioner said. Dhaka City Corporation has also been blamed by drivers for not yet marking the lanes along all the city's roads. bd
