<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's former personal assistant, and the plaintiff in his murder case, AFM Muhithul Islam has been made deputy director of the government's relief and rehabilitation department on a one-year contract. Muhithul, 54, was the assistant director of the department before the past BNP-led government sacked him after coming to power in 2001. An order from the establishment ministry on Tuesday said that Muhithul will have to free himself from all other working commitments to other organisations and institutions to take up his new post at the department. His appointment will be valid from the day of his joining. Muhithul Islam told bdnews24.com: "I have been appointed as the deputy director of the department. I worked there before. The BNP coalition government sacked me. My contemporaries have become directors now." Sheikh Mujib was assassinated along with family members on Aug 15, 1975 at his Dhanmondi residence. Muhithul was the president's receptionist and resident personal assistant at the time. He filed the murder case, which came to a conclusion last month with the execution of five of his convicted killers, although another six who were found guilty and sentenced to death in the case remain fugitives. b
