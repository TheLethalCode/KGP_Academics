 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet on Monday approved in principle a draft of the proposed Climate Change Trust Fund Act-2010 and two other laws. "Bangladesh is one of the most precarious countries facing climate change. People of this country must be protected from its consequences. Therefore, we are moving forward on this law," Abul Kalam Azad, press secretary to the prime minister's office, told reporters after the cabinet meeting. The government has already allocated Tk 7 billion to build this fund, Azad said. The two other laws approved in principle were the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act-2010 and Animal Slaughter and Meat Quality Control Act-2010. "The first of these laws aims at putting a stop to violence in the home. Such law exists in at least 89 countries," Azad said. "The prime minister termed it as a timely law. If violence on women and children is not stopped at the family level, it will also affect the nation." Regarding the Meat Quality Control Act, Azad said: "The way animals are butchered in our country is not helpful to control the quality. We can look at exporting meat to many countries if we can maintain quality." The cabinet sent back a Right to Information (Amendment) Bill for further modification, Azad said. bdn
