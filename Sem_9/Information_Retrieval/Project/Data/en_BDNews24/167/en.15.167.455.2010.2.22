 Jessore, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  A local council chairman, Prakash Chandra Shaha, was stabbed and shot dead in Monirampur Upazila, Jessore, police said on Monday. Prakash was the acting chairman of Haridashkathi union parishad and a local Awami League leader, Monirampur police chief Lokman Hakim said. The victim got a call on his mobile phone from another man, named Islam, from the neighbouring village of Kazir, at around 10pm on Sunday. But he failed to return home that night, the local police chief said, quoting his family members. Local residents found his body lying beside a shallow irrigation machine the following day and informed police, who recovered the body and sent it to Jessore General Hospital morgue. Doctors said he his body bore stab wounds and the victim had been shot in the head. Police have already arrested two suspects, although the alleged mastermind Islam and others are still on the run. Wife Chandana Shaha filed a case with Monirampur police in this regard. Locals said Haridashkathi union is a Hindu-majority area with members of the Hindu communityMukul Chandra Mandal, Dulal Chandra Mandal, Bimal Chandra Roy and Tareq Chandra Mallikhaving been elected chairmen in the past. But, they alleged, local BNP leader Nazrul Islam in fact took their place and the Hindus were chairmen "in name only". The immediate past chairman, Mukul Chandra Mandal, faced various corruption cases during the last caretaker government regime. RAB captured him, he was sent to jail where he later died. Prakash Chandra Shaha later took over as chairman through a court order, locals said. The locals, preferring not to be named, suspected that Prakash might have been killed because of prior enmity. They said the man named 'Islam' who called him Sunday night is close to the local BNP leader Nazrul Islam. Jessore deputy commissioner and superintendent of police visited the scene and asked police to find the killers and others involved. bdn
