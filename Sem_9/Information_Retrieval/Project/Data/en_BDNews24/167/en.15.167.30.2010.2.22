 Rangamati, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  PCJSS is demanding a parliamentary probe into the recent violence at Baghaichhari Upazila in Rangamati hill district during which settlers reportedly torched indigenous villages and the army is accused of shooting and killing at least two tribal people. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), an organisation of hill people that signed the CHT Peace Accord with the government in 1997, submitted a memorandum to the prime minister through the Rangamati deputy commissioner after demonstration at the district town on Monday. Buddhist monks also took part in the demonstration but they submitted a separate memorandum to the prime minister demanding an "independent investigation" into the incidents. Locals said over 1,000 PCJSS leaders, members and supporters along with Buddhist monks from the area joined in the protest rally and procession from Rajbari area of the town through Banarupa to the deputy commissioner's office. PCJSS vice-chairman Lakshmiprasad Chakma, addressing the rally, blamed army personnel for the violence and deaths of villagers and demanded their pullout from the area. Two bullet-ridden bodies have been recovered following army intervention in the clashes between the indigenous and settler communities that erupted overnight Friday (Feb 19) and continued into Saturday (Feb 20). Tribal leaders claim at least six indigenous villagers were killed as the army opened fire on them. Satyananda Mohathero, general secretary of a local Buddhist monks association, on Monday demanded a fair and neutral probe into the incidents and punishment to those responsible. PCJSS also demanded prompt punishment for those responsible for the violence. Other demands put forward by them included compensation for and rehabilitation of those whose homes were torched, relocating 'Bangali settlers' in the region to cluster villages and full implementation of the 1997 peace accord. Parbatya Chattagram Bangali Chhatra Parishad, an organisation of settlers, brought out a separate demonstration in the town blaming the hill people for the violence. Meanwhile, tribal people again demanded withdrawal of a Section 144 clampdown on public gatherings at Baghaichhari that was imposed on Saturday during the violence there.
