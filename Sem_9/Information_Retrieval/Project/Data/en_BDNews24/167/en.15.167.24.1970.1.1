 STUTTGART, Germany, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zlatan Ibrahimovic's second-half equaliser earned holders Barcelona a 1-1 draw at VfB Stuttgart in their Champions League last-16 first leg on Tuesday. Brazilian-born German international Cacau headed the mid-table Bundesliga team in front in the 25th minute as they outplayed the visitors in a pulsating first half. Stuttgart had chances to increase their lead as they put the champions on the back foot but Lionel Messi also hit the post for Barca just before halftime.

Stuttgart then had a let-off when Lehmann allowed a Messi shot to slip through his hands, only for the ball to hit the post and bounce into the arms of the grateful keeper. Barca were on target soon after the restart when a Pique header found Ibrahimovic and he converted from close range at the second attempt. The Sweden striker almost grabbed a winner when his shot was deflected over by a defender after Lehmann completely missed a corner. Stuttgart coach Christian Gross was frustrated his side were only 1-0 up at halftime. "I think we could have had another goal but things changed in the second half," said Gross. "They (Barca) didn't create so many chances. "It was a great first half but we couldn't keep it up for the second. Not many teams take points off Barcelona so this makes me ha
