 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Australia completed a memorable unbeaten home series of internationals against Pakistan and West Indies with another consummate victory on Tuesday, reports BBC Sport. Openers David Warner (67 from 29 balls) and Shane Watson (62 not out off 33) easily reached their target of 139 in their final Twenty20 international. West Indies were restricted to 138-7 in Sydney, and Australia needed just 11.4 overs to secure an eight-wicket win. All-rounder Daniel Christian, 26, took 2-29 on his senior Australia debut. The right-arm seamer, who is the second player of Aboriginal heritage to play for Australia in the modern era after Jason Gillespie, also had the honour of hitting the winning boundary. Australia's bowling attack, featuring five seamers plus the spin option of Steve Smith, looked set to bowl the tourists out for barely 100 when Denesh Ramdin was caught behind off Shaun Tait in the 17th over to make it 98-7. Narsingh Deonarine (36 not out) and Darren Sammy (26 not out) injected some much-needed acceleration over the last three overs, but the target was not nearly enough to cause the confident home team any headaches at all. Openers Chris Gayle (12) and Travis Dowlin (31) were the only other Windies players to reach double figures. But in Australia's reply, Warner hit seven sixes in a brutal display of hitting as he and Watson put on 99 in the first 7.4 overs of the run chase - from which there could be only one result. Paceman Kemar Roach endured a particularly bruising experience, with his two overs costing 33 runs. Constantly on the go since 26 November, Australia have recorded 17 wins, a draw and a no-result in their 19 matches against West Indies and Pakistan as their post-Ashes renaissance continues to show no signs of ceasing. But Twenty20 captain Michael Clarke warned they would not be overdoing the celebrations. "We fly to New Zealand tomorrow morning and have a couple of big games going into the ICC World Twenty20. "Our attitude over the last few days has been fantastic, we have been positive and played great cricket with both bat and ball." Windies captain Gayle said: "It has been a tough summer. We have been hammered into the ground and have lost fair and square. "Hopefully we can treat it as a learning experience as it was a young team. We senior players are not going to be around for ever and these guys are the future. "It was a good opportunity for them to stand up against a big team, get some runs and take some wick
