 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Australia cruised to a leisurely six-wicket win in Wellington after bowling New Zealand out for 118 in the first of their two Twenty20 internationals on Friday, BBC Sport reported. James Franklin top-scored with 43 as only three Kiwis made double figures, while Mitchell Johnson took 3-19. The visitors reached 38-0 before losing three quick wickets for one run.

The final five wickets fell for only nine runs as the Kiwis registered their lowest Twenty20 total against their neighbours. The Australian openers started their chase at a pace, with Shane Bond and Daryl Tuffey's opening overs disappearing for 10 and 18 runs respectively.

Watson followed, before Bond bowled Johnson for one to check the Australian progress. But they were soon back in their stride with Hussey battering five fours as Clarke held up the other end with a solid 18 not out. The second and final match of the series takes place in Christchurch on Su
