 JAIPUR, India, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa tail-ender Wayne Parnell was run out from the final ball to hand India a thrilling one-run victory in the first one-day international at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Sunday. South Africa, chasing 299 to win, were struggling until Parnell brought the tourists back into contention with a sparkling 49, sharing a 65-run stand for the ninth wicket with new-ball partner Dale Steyn (35).
