<TITLE> Let there be no confusion about war crime trials: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The war criminals will be brought to justice at any cost and there should be no confusion about the present government's commitment to do so, law minister Shafique Ahmed said Monday. "No criminals will be spared. Those who committed crimes against humanity, will be brought to justice," said the minister. The minister was talking to reporters when Monayem Sarker, director general of Bangladesh Foundation for Development Research and Agam Publishers proprietor Osman Gani handed over a handwritten copy of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the minister at the secretariat. The minister was asked whether the trial process of the war criminals would affect relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan. "This is totally an internal issue of Bangladesh. No other country should interfere in this," Shafique told reporters. "No country can hamper other country's initiatives towards establishing rule of law," he said. Regarding the Constitution of 1972, Shafique said, "The appellate division upheld a previous High Court decision terminating the Fifth Amendment. Everything depends on when we get the copy of that verdict." "We will make amendments according to the verdict, which will be reinstated in line with the directions from Law Commission." The original Constitution of 1972 had declared to establish a 'socialist' Bangladesh. When the minister was asked about whether they would reinstate the term, Shafique said, "Actually Bangabandhu wanted to build a welfare state, where the state will meet the fundamental demands of its people." The minister refuted a contention that the Constitution does not acknowledge rights to the indigenous people and said, "The Constitution says that it is possible to make rules for the undeveloped portion of population. The government has formulated new laws for them. So, it is not so that they are not recognised. b
