 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The case of the 2002 murder of model Tinni has resurfaced after a gap of eight years, as a Dhaka court set a hearing date on Monday. Court official Kamal Kumar Paul told bdnews24.com that Dhaka district and sessions judge Krishna Devnath fixed Mar 14 for a hearing on whether the court would accept the case against former MP and 'student leader' Golam Faruk Ovi, who is now absconding. Paul told bdnews24.com that the court, if it took the charges into cognizance, would transfer the case to an additional district judge for charge framing and trial. The case caused a sensation when the body of model Syeda Tania Mahbub, popularly known as Tinni, was found under the Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge over the Buriganga on Nov 10, 2002. Assistant commissioner of CID police pressed murder charges against former Jatiya Party MP Ovi on Nov 8, 2008. The court also issued a warrant of arrest against him but police have been unable to track him down since he went into hiding. Investigators say Ovi is a fugitive in Canada. b
