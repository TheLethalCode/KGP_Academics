 Golam Mortuza Antu and Abul Hossain bdnews24.com correspondents Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) Even deaths do not serve the wakeup calls! There was lack of ventilation. The main exits, allege workers, were lockedwith no real fire escape. And, according to officials, the fire-fighting equipment were "virtually useless". This was the second time in just six months that a fire claimed lives in this same factory. As a bdnews24.com team probed the Thursday night fire tragedy, findings were startling. The deaths of 21 garment workers at Garib and Garib Sweater Factory, Gazipur, were basically down to the lack of ventilation. None of the bodies at the morgue bore any burn marks. But there were traces of dark ash around the nostrils and mouths. The fire had broken out on the first floor of the factory near one of its two stairwells, where there was a large stock of acrylic sweaters, said factory workers. They said most of the workers who died were actually working on the upper floors of the seven-storey factory. A former director general of the fire service, Selim Newaz Bhuiyan, said that the highly flammable acrylic used in sweaters gave off a thick and extremely toxic smoke. "The deaths were primarily due to inhalation of that smoke." The workers alleged that the main exits were locked, which prevented a quick evacuation while a fire official said the fire-fighting equipment were completely useless. The absence of a proper fire escape only added the last nail in the coffin. Abdul Mannan of the factory's sampling section was working on the second floor on that fateful night. He said the factory's main power switch had been turned off and it became pitch dark inside. "We could not see anything. But I could feel that smoke was filling the room and I could hardly keep my eyes open or breathe." Mannan had to be rescued through a grilled window. So were several others. "I really don't know how I managed to get out of that place," said Mannan, still traumatised. He said the locked main stairwell denied many others escape from the hell. The other smaller stairwell at the other end of the factory was narrow and apparently full of smoke. The workers said that stairwell was the designated fire escape. A director of the company, Chowdhury Qudrat Elahi, brushed off the allegations and claimed that the factory fully 'compliant'. The only problem that he identified when speaking to bdnews24.com was that the 'window grilles were too strong'. But no one offered any explanation why the exits through even the makeshift escape route on the third, fourth and fifth floors were locked. Apparently, 17 women on the factory's sixth floor died from the toxic smoke when they tried to come out through the 'emergency escape' route. Former fire chief Selim Newaz explained to bdnews24.com that typically factories do not have sufficient ventilation and in case of fire they turn into gas chambers. "That is what must have happened in this factory too." USELESS EQUIPMENT A fire official at Gazipur was scathing about the quality of fire equipment. "Although there were hosepipes on every floor, they were virtually useless," said Abu Zafar Ahmed, the fire station officer. "There was no water in the factory's reserve tank!" The fire official said that they used the dirty water of the factory's washing plant and two pumps. "We also took water from a nearby pond," said Ahmed. The large fire trucks could not go up close to the factory site because of narrow alleys, he said. Director Elahi, of course. had his own version. "There were adequate fire extinguishers, hosepipes, fire blankets and emergency exits on every floor," claimed Elahi, speaking to bdnews24.com. He said it would be impossible for a few workers present at the factory building to douse the fire given that the large stock of acrylic sweaters would burn quickly. "I told them to leave the building immediately." The factory's director said there were only 32 workers in the building when the fire broke out. He said that some workers got trapped on the second floor trying to put out the flames. "There were some women on the sixth floor who panicked and eventually suffocated to death." As recently as August last year, Ahmed said, another fire had killed a fireman and a worker in his factory. bdne
