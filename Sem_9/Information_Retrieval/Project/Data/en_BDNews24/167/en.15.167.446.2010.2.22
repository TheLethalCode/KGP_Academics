 Chapainawabganj, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested a Chhatra Shibir activist from Shibganj in Chapainawabganj district on Sunday in connection with murder of the same student organisation's Rajshahi city leader Hafizur Rahman Shaheen. Shibganj police station chief Fazlur Rahman said Md Faruque (26) was picked up from his Shyampur village in the evening as "there are evidences that he was involved in the killing of Shaheen." Faruque, son of Ismail Mondol, is management department student of Chapainawabganj Govt College. Shaheen, a leader of Rajshahi city unit of Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Chhatra Shibir and accused in murder of Rajshahi University Chhatra League activist Faruk Hossain, was killed in Chapainawabganj on February. Shibir, however, accused police of murdering Shaheen. Faruk Hossain was killed and scores of students were injured during overnight clashes on Feb 8-9 between Awami League-backed BCL and Chhatra Shibir activists.
