 Khagrachhari, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  At least one person was killed in Tuesday's clashes between the indigenous and settler communities in Khagrachhari district town, which wore a deserted look on Wednesday following the imposition of an overnight curfew. Residents stayed indoors and shops and businesses remained closed in the morning despite the end of the curfew. The streets remained empty apart from presence of a large number of police and BDR personnel as well as army troops seen patrolling the town in the morning. Tuesday's violence had erupted when activists of United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) and Parbatya Chattagram Bangali Chhatra Parishad staged demonstrations in the town over the Baghaichhari incidents. One Bangali  Anwar Hossain (28)  was killed, more than 20 people injured and several houses torched in Tuesday clashes, which in turn were sparked by recent troubles between hill people and 'Bangali settlers' at Baghaichhari in Rangamati that left two dead and scores of indigenous homes torched. Officials of the district administration said state minister for home affairs Shamsul Haq Tuku would visit Khagrachhari town and Baghaichhari upazila in Rangamati on Wednesday to see the situation. Anwar's body was sent to Khagrachhari General Hospital. bdne
