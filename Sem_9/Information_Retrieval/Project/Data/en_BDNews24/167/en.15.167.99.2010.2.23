It's a regular on menus in Tokyo and Beijing, but it's also on to the agenda in Brussels, where the European Commissioner for the Environment's announced proposals to protect the fish. European Commissioner for the environment Janez potocnic saying, "Stocks of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna are now in such bad shape that the commission considers it qualifies for inclusion in Appendix 1 of CITES, the Convention on international Trade in Endangered Species."

Currently, eighty per cent of the Mediterranean Bluefin Tuna catches are exported outside of the EU, mostly to Japan. EU fisheries commissioner Maria Damanki said the industry needs to accept the impact of a ban in order to ensure the species long term future. EU Fisheries Commissioner MARIA DAMANKI Saing, "We have to do something and what we really need to do is to accept the short term sacrifices. There will be short term sacrifices." Japan, who consume two thirds of the global Bluefin Tuna catch from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are against the ban, along with Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Malta.
