<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tiger Woods' image may be tarnished after admitting to marital infidelities, but most Americans would support him representing the country on a US Olympic golf team. Sixty-nine percent of Americans polled by Seton Hall University said they would have no problem with Woods, on an indefinite leave from his sport, trying to win a medal for the United States when golf becomes an Olympic sport.

TIGER DUMPED BY ANOTHER SPONSOR Meanwhile, Woods was dumped by sports drink brand Gatorade on Friday, becoming the third major corporate sponsor to abandon him since details of his adulterous affairs surfaced late last year. "We no longer see a role for Tiger in our marketing efforts and have ended our relationship," a spokeswoman for PepsiCo's Gatorade said. "Our partnership with the Tiger Woods Foundation will continue. We wish him all the best." Gatorade decided before the sex scandal that it would drop its "Tiger Focus" d
