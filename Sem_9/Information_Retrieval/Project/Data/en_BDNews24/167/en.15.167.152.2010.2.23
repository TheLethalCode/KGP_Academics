 Khagrachhari, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Army troops were deployed in Khagrachhari and residents asked to stay off the streets as hill people and settlers clashed in the district town on Tuesday, leaving at least a dozen injured and houses torched, just days after similar violence broke out in neighbouring Rangamati. People have been asked to remain indoors, authorities said. They said army personnel were deployed at around 2:30pm, firing rounds into the air to disperse the clashing crowds. "The town turned into a battlefield as the two groups fought at different points including Shantiniketon, College Para and Moha," Khagrachhari Sadar police chief Md Shahriar Khan had told bdnews24.com earlier in the day. The violence erupted around 10am when activists of United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) and Parbatya Chattagram Bangali Chhatra Parishad staged demonstrations in the district town over the Baghaichhari incidents, he said. Several houses and a textile mill were set alight, the police chief said. At least three journalists were injured during the clashes - NTV senior reporter Talat Mamun, Desh TV's Khagrachhari correspondent Mangsatun Marma, Dilip Chowdhury of Channel i. Khan said additional police forces had first been deployed. But he expressed concern that the situation "could get out of control". Authorities imposed a Section 144 clampdown on public gatherings at around 2pm and soon after army took positions at key points of the town. Tuesday's demonstrations came in the wake of troubles in the remote Baghaichhari upazila of Rangamati hill district. The night of Feb 19-20 saw indigenous villages there torched with two bodies being recovered the following day, reportedly killed by army fire. Long-standing animosity exists between indigenous communities and 'Bangali settlers' in the restive region where army have been deployed for decades to battle insurgency among the hill tract population. Tensions have risen to the surface again recently with the government's move to start implementing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord after a long gap. bdn
