 LONDON, 22 Feb (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City's Carlos Tevez should be back from Argentina in time to play Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday, his advisor Kia Joorabchian said on Monday. Joorabchian moved to allay the fears of City manager Roberto Mancini who said earlier he had no idea when the 26-year-old striker was going to return to England after going home to Argentina on compassionate leave following the premature birth of his second daughter. However, Joorabchian said the striker should be fit to play at Chelsea but would not be ready to face Stoke City in an FA Cup fifth round replay on Wednesday. Joorabchian also denied the player had not kept his club informed of his plans. "The club have been informed on a daily basis -- Carlos Tevez has given 100 per cent to the club since the day he arrived," Joorabchian told Sky Sports News. "When your child is in intensive care it's a very serious matter. "He hopes to be back for the Chelsea game. He hopes things will get better, for his daughter's sake and because he wants to get back and play. "When these things happen you have to deal with them. Obviously he's having to go through a very difficult period but he's dealt with them before and will continue to do so." Joorabchian continued: "The signs are very positive in terms of his daughter's recovery and we are all hoping this is the case. He added Tevez was maintaining his fitness with the national side. "He's training daily with the national team of Argentina out there and spending one-and-a-half to two hours there. He is a professional. He understands that side of it." Mancini said after Manchester City's 0-0 draw with Liverpool on Sunday, he was not sure of his Tevez's plans. "I don't know where Tevez is -- I think he is in Argentina," Mancini told reporters. "It's a big problem for us because we have an important week and we don't have Tevez. For me it is no good. Carlos has been eight days at home and I don't know if, while in Argentina, he has been working. "I hope Carlos, within the next two days, can come back here because we need him. Maybe he is on the plane. "I spoke to him three days ago. He had some problems with his family but now it has been resolved and I hope he comes back. I need him." Mancini is without suspended midfielder Patrick Vieira and injured winger Martin Petrov while Roque Santa Cruz has a knee injury
