<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  One year on since border guards at the BDR's Dhaka headquarters took up arms against their officers, killing scores and holding hundreds of families hostage for two horrifying days, a special court at Durbar Hall, the scene of the crime, launched the Pilkhana mutiny trial this weekbut the murder probe lags on. Investigators have grilled nearly 8,000 people and arrested 2,200 over the past twelve months in the criminal case being prepared to try the killers. The CID's Abdul Kahhar Akhand, investigation officer in the case, in a press conference Wednesday, said the probe was "near closure". Special courts are trying the charges of mutiny, and rebellion that spread to other outposts, under BDR law. But the killings, rape and arson that occurred at Pilkhana, being investigated by CID, will be tried under criminal law. In the event of a guilty verdict by the special courts, the maximum penalty for mutiny or rebellion is seven years in jail. The killings at Pilkhana, however, will carry the maximum penalty, up to death, under the penal code. Akhand said around 3,700 pieces evidence had been collected to date, enough to charge 900 persons implicated in the killings. The mutineers slaughtered 74 people at Pilkhana during the bloody events of Feb 25-26 last year, 54 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Around 3,700 weapons were used during the uprising, and 64 pistols, five rifles, one small machine gun and 199 grenades are yet to be recovered, investigators say. Akhand mentioned that until now the reason behind the mutiny was found to be dissatisfaction among the BDR ranks. "Even though no proof of political influence has been found behind the mutiny so far, further investigation into that angle is underway," the chief investigator said. However, he clarified, some politically influential persons were "individually involved in the incident." Elaborating further on this, in answer to a question, Akhand said former BNP MP Nasiruddin Pintu and AL leader Torab Ali "knew about the dissatisfaction of BDR members" prior to the mutiny. Investigators have questioned 7,974 individuals in connection with the events, including members of BDR, army, RAB, police, journalists, fire brigade and affected families. The majority of them, 6,435, were BDR members. Akhand said 2,205 have been arrested in connection with the criminal case. Of them, 2,169 are BDR members. Of these, 569 have given confessional statements in the criminal case. Meanwhile, the Special Court-5, set up at Durbar Hall, charged 86 border guards in connection with the mutiny on Wednesday. Plaintiff in the case Subedar Major Shah Alam Bhuiyab read out the charges, which included direct participation in the mutiny, not resisting the mutiny, and not informing the higher authorities of the mutiny. The court heard how the mutineers held a meeting just before the Bangladesh Rifles Durbar on Feb 25 last year, which they stormed with guns launching the bloody two-day revolt. Forty of the accused aimed guns at their officers on the first day of the two-day mutiny while the other accused were on the scene but did nothing to stop them, the charges read. Bhuiyab spoke of atrocities, which "cannot be fully described in words." The court heard how one officer "at the point of death" wrote an SMS to his unborn baby and how the mutineers killed two officers by flinging them from third floor windows. The mutineers not only killed their officers but also tried to burn their bodies, the court was told. Akhand told reporters Wednesday criminal charges will be pressed "within days" for the brutal killings. "Nearly two hundred members of the Criminal Investigation Department have been working tirelessly over the past year towards this end." b
