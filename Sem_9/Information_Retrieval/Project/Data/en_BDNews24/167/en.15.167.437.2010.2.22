 PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from last month's devastating earthquake in Haiti could jump to 300,000 people, including the bodies buried under collapsed buildings in the capital, Haitian President Rene Preval said on Sunday. "You have seen the images you are familiar with the pictures.

Looking ahead to a meeting with international donors to determine the overall shape of rebuilding plans, Preval suggested Haiti should decentralize away from Port-au-Prince, which suffered the heaviest damages. "We will not try to reconstruct but rather to refound the country, where we don't concentrate ourselves in one capital," Preval said. He encouraged Latin American countries to step up investments in industry to help Haiti free itself from dependence on international a
