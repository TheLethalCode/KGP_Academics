 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Chhatra League activists beat up a young girl and her companions on Dhaka University campus on Sunday as they were returning after placing flowers at the Central Shaheed Minar, witnesses said. The attackers were reportedly BCL activists of Jasimuddin Hall, Bangabandhu Hall, SM Hall and Mohsin Hall, other students on the campus, who witnessed the incident, said. They said two teenage girls and four boys were walking past the vice chancellor's residence on Fuller Road at around 3.30pm. One of the Chhatra League activists, identified as 'Setu' of Jasimuddin Hall by a witness who was a student of the same hall, first approached one of the girls, and began teasing her when she would not speak to him. The witness, not wishing to be identified for fear of repercussions, said Setu began pulling at the girl's urna , or scarf. The girl screamed out and her companions came to assist, along with other bystanders. The Chhatra League activists reportedly turned on them and began beating them. Witnesses said other BCL activists came from nearby halls and joined in the attack on the group. Including the girl's companions, five people were injured, said another witness, a student of Mohsin Hall who was also reluctant to be named. Dhaka University assistant proctor Amzad Ali told bdnews24.com: "A university student and a girl whom he knew had some argument on the campus. At one point there was a tussle between the girl's companions and the students." BCL's Jasimuddin Hall unit president, Abdur Rahman Jibon, also said there was a "tussle" on the campus, but he blamed "outsiders" for the incident.
