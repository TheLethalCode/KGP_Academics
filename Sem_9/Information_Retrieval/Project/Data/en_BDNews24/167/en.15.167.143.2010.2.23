<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23(bdnews24.com)----The Pilkhana mutineers held a meeting just before the Bangladesh Rifles Durbar on Feb 25 last year, which the mutineers stormed with guns launching a bloody two-day revolt at the border force's headquarters, a special court heard on Tuesday. The court began hearing charges in the Pilkhana mutiny trial almost a year to the day since the rebel border guards took up arms against their officers, killing scores and holding their families hostage. The court heard how one officer "at the point of death" wrote an SMS to his unborn baby. It also heard also how the atrocities which took place "cannot be described in words." Proceedings began at noon, at the very site of the uprising, amid tight security in and around the sprawling Pilkhana compound. Plaintiff in the case Subedar Major Shah Alam Bhuiyab read out the charges, against 86 accused, including direct participation in the mutiny, not resisting the mutiny, and not informing the higher authorities of the mutiny. He said 40 of the accused aimed guns at their officers on the first day of the two-day mutiny while the other accused were on the scene but did nothing to stop them. BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam presided over the Special Court-5, set up under the Bangladesh Rifles Order-1972. Two other senior officers  Lt Col Golam Rabbani and Maj Sayeed Hasan Tapash  were also on the judges' panel. Bhuiyab said a group of 15-16 mutineers held a meeting just one hour before the Durbar began and then divided into two groups to procure arms. During the mutiny one group was firing and shouting "Jago! (Wake up!)", while the other looted more arms and ammunition from BDR stores, Bhuiyab said. The two groups would then exchange places and arms, he added. Narrating the very first moments of the mutiny, Bhuiyab said, as the then BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed was addressing the Durbar, Moin, a sepoy of 13th Rifles Battalion, entered the hall and brandished arms at the director general. Senior officers disarmed him, Bhuiyab said. But the situation turned chaotic as other jawans present at the Durbar Hall jumped up and began shouting out "Jago!". The director general asked them to take their seats, saying that he would listen to their grievances, the court heard. Defying the order, BDR members of Dhaka sector and others took active part in the rebellion, the plaintiff said. Later the mutineers started looting and killing, the court heard. Specific charges against individuals on Tuesday named 12 jawans, including Havildar Ramijul Islam, who are accused of taking active part in the rebellion at Pilkhana after looting arms and ammunition. Nayek Subedar Waliullah allegedly helped other mutineers in carrying the bodies of slain army officers in a government vehicle into a park, the court heard. Subedar Major Fazlul Haque was accused of doing nothing to stop the mutiny. Bhuiyab said if Haque had complied with director general's order and attempted to quell the rebellion as it began, it would have been possible to save the lives of the BDR chief, sector commanders, other officers and their family members. The court heard that the mutineers killed two officers by flinging them from third floor windows. They not only killed them but also tried to burn their bodies, the court heard. "It is not possible to fully depict the atrocities which took place in words," Bhuiyab said. Prosecutor Major Matiur Rahman broke down with emotion as he related some of the events. He told the court: "Standing at the point of death, Colonel Nafiz wrote an SMS text to his unborn baby asking it to take care of its mother." Demanding punishment for the mutineers, Rahman said, "The children, wives and parents of the dead are looking to the court for a fair verdict." The Pilkhana mutineers killed over 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force, during the events of Feb 25-26 2009. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. The government formed six special courts under BDR law last year, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts will only try the charges of mutiny and rebellion. Trials of the other serious crimes, including the killings, rape and arson, will be held in civilian court. The first of the mutiny trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers. Trials are also being held in Feni, Satkhira and Thakurgaon. The Special Court 4 in Rangamati is due to hand down the first verdict, in connection with the BDR mutiny and rebellion, on May 2. In the event of a guilty verdict by the special courts, the maximum penalty for mutiny or rebellion is seven years in jail. The killings at Pilkhana will carry the maximum penalty under civil law. b
