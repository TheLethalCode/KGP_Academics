 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka University authorities on Thursday suspended five pro-government student activists on allegations of beating up a girl and her companions on campus on Feb 21 as they were returning after placing flowers at the Central Shaheed Minar. DU vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique disclosed the decision to reporters at a press briefing Thursday. The attack occurred in front the vice chancellor's residence on Fuller Road. The attackers were reportedly Bangladesh Chhatra League activists of Jasimuddin Hall, Bangabandhu Hall, SM Hall and Mohsin Hall, according to students who witnessed the incident. The expelled students are: Ashiqul Islam Setu (studying first year marketing, of Jasimuddin Hall), Apel Mahmud Biplob (studying first year Islamic studies, of Mohsin Hall), Shams E Noman (studying first year social welfare, of Zahurul Haque Hall), Morshedul Islam (studying first year social sciences, of Zahurul Haque Hall) and Akramul Haque Nitol (in second year public administration, of Mohsin Hall). The DU administration also served show-cause notices to four other BCL activists asking them to explain why they should not be expelled. bdnew
