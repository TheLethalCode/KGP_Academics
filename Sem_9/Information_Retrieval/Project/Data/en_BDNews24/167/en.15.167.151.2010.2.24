 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Present and former REB officials, regulators, lending agency officials and consultants have blamed 'political interference' as one of the impediments to efficient power distribution and better service. They made the observations at a workshop on strengthening rural power supplier was jointly organised by the Power Cell of the government's power division and SMEC International, an Australia-based consulting group, at Sonargaon Hotel. Former chairman of the Rural Electrification Board, Touhidul Islam said, "Political interference has been an obstacle to smooth operations of the organisation." Alluding to politicians as 'external forces' he said they often gave express orders about where to build new transmission lines without any regard for the agency's plans. Zinnatul Huq, a member of the rural power board, said the organisation should be free from political meddling. He said that the government, instead of pandering to certain partisan interests, should instead facilitate the agency for ensuring better service to the poor in rural areas. Also seemingly referring to political involvement, Qudrat-e-Khuda, a director of the Dhaka Electricity Supply Company, said the rural power agency would operate well without government interference. Robert Schenck, project team leader of SMEC, said, "Political interference, although universal, is not good." Corruption and lack of adequate manpower were also major factors behind the poor performance of the Rural Electrification Board (REB), said participants at the workshop on Wednesday. REB chairman Bhuiyan Shafiqul Islam stressed on reforming the rural power distributor, adding that it should be run in line with the master plan. "At its current state of image crisis REB's constraints need to be addressed." The chairman stressed on a cost-based tariff system and observed that otherwise the agency would soon become a 'losing concern'. Lead energy specialist of the World Bank, Mac Cosgrove-Davies, however, said that rural electrification projects should not be seen from a commercial point of view. He said that the primary responsibility of the agency was to provide service to the poor people of the rural areas. Almost all the REB officials, both of former and present, asked for rasing tariffs, while a DESCO official differed saying that since REB was a utility service provider, especially for the poor, a cost-based tariff should not be imposed upon its customers. Md Mokhlesur Rahman Khandaker, member of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, said the tariff should be fixed considering the social condition of the people. With distribution lines of 2,19,242 km, REB and its 70 associations cover nearly eight million consumers throughout the country.
