<TITLE> Mutiny was 'double attack' on national security: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's standing committee was meeting to discuss the political situation of the country on Thursday, the first anniversary of the BDR mutiny, while party leaders had earlier alleged the mutiny was instigated on behalf of foreign forces as a double attack on national security. "Both the army and BDR were targeted to make the country a failed state for the benefit of others," said a standing committee member, who added the ruling party itself had a hand. The opposition party slated prime minister Sheikh Hasina's handling of the mutiny, saying her meeting with rebel border guards during the uprising was "mysterious", and her government's role "questionable". The urgent standing committee meeting, called by party chairperson Khaleda Zia, began at 9pm at her political office in Gulshan. Earlier in the day, BNP arranged a gathering at the National Press Club in remembrance of those who died at Pilkhana a year ago. BNP leaders demanded the full reports of the three separate probes into the events of Feb 25-26 last yearwhen mutineers killed over 70 people at Pilkhana, 58 of them army officers deputed to the border force, to be made public. BNP standing committee Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain rejected BDR chief Mainul Islam's view that the BDR mutiny had occurred over dissatisfaction among border guard ranks over their officer's handling of the Dal-Bhat programme. CID's Abdul Kahhar Akand, the investigation officer in the Pilkhana killings case, has also said their probe had so far found "dissatisfaction" as the cause for the mutiny. But Mosharraf said there were other far-reaching causes. "It could not only centre on the Dal-Bhat programme. It is irrational. We reject this." The mutiny was planned "to catch two birds with one stone", to destabilise both the border force and the army, and so undermine national security, the BNP leader said. "Anti-state accords have been signed to make the country a market for a neighbour The Pilkhana carnage was plotted as part of making Bangladesh a failed state and market for others," he said. "The mystery of the killings is yet to be revealed. It's mysterious why the then army chief had not come forward to save lives of his officers. Silence of the prime minister and the government is unacceptable." Referring to India, he said, "It is they who would be benefited by undermining our security." He called in to question Hasina's "mysterious" meeting with the mutineers during the uprising and alleged that the government itself had colluded with foreign forces in the events. Hannan Shah, a fellow standing committee member, said the prime minister failed to deal with the crisis. The BNP leaders alleged the meeting with the rebels encouraged more killings. Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com the press briefing on Thursday night's standing committee meeting would be held at the party's central office on Friday morning. bdnew
