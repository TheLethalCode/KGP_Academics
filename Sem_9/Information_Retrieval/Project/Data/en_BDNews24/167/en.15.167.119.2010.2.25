 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)The India Trade Fair-2010, the first such joint initiative of Bangladesh and India, kicked off Thursday in Dhaka with a vision to further boost trade between the two countries. Finance minister AMA Muhith inaugurated the three-day fair at the Sheraton Hotel where over 50 stalls and pavilions of both the countries will participate, organisers have said. The fair, organised by the India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (IBCCI), is supported by the High Commission of India. The fair will mainly focus on the potential of trade in the north-eastern Indian states, where Bangladesh has already been engaged in exporting products, IBCCI president Abdul Matlub Ahmad told a press briefing in the capital on Wednesday. "This will help achieve our target export of $1 billion to India by 2011 and will also help attract 100 joint venture investments into Bangladesh by the next three years," Matlub said. The event will also include conclaves where ministers from both the sides, senior government officials and businessmen will participate. TATA 'NANO' The TATA Nano, India's popular small car, will also be show-cased in the fair to judge interest of the Bangladeshi buyers. Matlub, who owns the TATA dealership in Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com, "If we find the demand significant, we'll market the car here. "We'll manufacture 60 percent of the car parts in Bangladesh," he said. The four-seat 624cc small car was first launched commercially in India on Mar 23, 2009.
