<TITLE> India railway funding plan hints at tighter govt budget </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's railway budget set $9 billion of infrastructure investments but left government funding flat and cut borrowing, pointing to tighter government spending which analysts said may be reflected in Friday's general budget. They said a cut in freight rates of grains and kerosene, aimed at helping tame persistently high inflation, could be followed by more measures in the main budget. India's fiscal deficit is projected to reach a 16-year high of 6.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009/10 and the gap has been met through heavy borrowing in the market. A top government panel has warned this is unsustainable and the deficit had to be cut by managing spending. Market watchers expect Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on Friday to begin withdrawing stimulus measures, and the Reserve Bank is seen raising rates by April to stave off inflationary pressures as economic growth accelerates. "I think this is consistent with the overall tightening across the public policy spectrum," said N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. "The rail budget has showed streaks of tightening ... and I suspect the central budget will also follow suit." The government panel had also said the spending cuts should not come at the cost of developing India's overstretched infrastructure, needed to boost growth. BURSTING AT THE SEAMS India's railway carries over 18 million passengers and 2 million tonnes of freight each day on 17,000 trains that travel over a 64,000-kilometre-long network spanning the country from the icy heights of Kashmir to the balmy beaches of Kerala. But the world's oldest railway network is bursting at the seams and suffers from obsolete technology and infrastructure. In 2009, one rail accident happened on average every two days, data showed. Much of the railway's plans, which include building over 1,000 kilometres of track and adding 18,000 wagons, would be funded through higher private participation and through savings, budget documents on Wednesday showed. Government funding for the plan was flat at 158.75 billion rupees ($3.44 billion), while borrowings in the year to March 2011 were projected to fall 4 percent to 91.2 billion rupees. Rail Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday told parliament India had failed to attract private investment into the railways and this had to change. Budget documents indicated the government was projecting private investment into rail projects to rise 8.5 times to 8.58 billion rupees in 2010/11. Analysts expressed scepticism whether the government would be able to raise the hoped-for funds. "The spending will boost infrastructure but the big question remains how they plan to fund it," Arun Kejriwal, director at research firm KRIS. "It looks a huge challenge." Markets largely ignored the budget, with the benchmark stock index closing down 0.19 percent and the yield on the most actively traded government bond flat on the day at 7.79 percent. COMBATING INFLATION Banerjee cut freight rates for grains and kerosene by 100 rupees ($2.2) per wagon and kept passenger fares unchanged, adding to measures designed to help tame persistently high inflation. Food prices are up 18 percent on the year, while fuel has risen nearly 10 percent. The government has been under pressure to act and parliament was shut down in its first sitting on Tuesday over opposition protests over prices. "In an inflationary situation any increase in fare and freight rates would have led to inflationary spiral," said D.H. Panandikar, head of think-tank RPG Foundation. "I think it sets the tone for Friday's general budget. "One can expect the government to take some measures like increasing the personal income-tax exemption limit to provide some relief to the people at the margins from rising inflation." ($1=46.2 rup
