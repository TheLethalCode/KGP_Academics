 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP has welcomed entry of Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, into Bangladesh politics. "We congratulate Sajeeb Wazed Joy for formally joining politics by getting enrolled as a member of Awami League," said Nazrul Islam Khan, a member of the party's national standing committee, the highest policy forum, on Friday. Joy was enrolled as a primary member of Awami League from Rangpur, his native district, on Thursday. Nazrul hoped that he would bring positive changes to AL's political culture. "We hope as a modern person Joy will change AL's prevailing political culture of suppressing and torturing the opposition. We hope he will initiate positive politics in his party," he said. He said BNP is welcoming Joy for his formal joining politics. "But when our leader Tarique Rahman entered politics AL didn't welcome him... When Joy and his wife visited Bangladesh during the four-party alliance government, they were greeted with bouquets sent by Tarique Rahman." When asked about allegations of corruption against Joy, the BNP leader said: "We're not saying that Joy is corrupt. The allegations that are there will have to be answered by him." Nazrul said by getting enrolling as a member he would now be known as a political leader. "However, as the son of the prime minister he was an important person from before. Many leaders greeted him at the airport when he visited the country." b
