 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government should step down, admitting its failure to run the country, BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia said on Saturday. "The country is not functioning, all institutions are inoperative. The caretaker government has taken the country 20 years back and it will further go back if Awami League stays in power," she said. "They must step down in the interests of the country," she said. The opposition chief was speaking at her political office in Gulshan after meeting family members of Dhaka University student Abu Bakar, who died on Feb 3. Khaleda handed Tk 1 lakh in cash to mother Rabeya Begum. Father Rustom Ali and elder brother Abbas Ali of Bakar were also present then. Abu Bakar lost his life after being injured during factional clashes of pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League at F Rahman Hall of Dhaka University. He was a student of Islamic history. Bakar's fellow student of Islamic history Siddiqur Rahman Khan expressed his gratitude to the opposition leader for standing beside the family. Criticising the government, he said, "It is really unfortunate that no one of the government has stood beside the family of Abu Bakar." After condoling the family and wishing peace for the departed soul, Khaleda said, "The ruling party student organisation is not only committing crimes on Dhaka University campus, but at all educational institutions across the country." She also alleged that Dhaka University had shown utter failure in protecting the campus atmosphere. "The universities are working like ruling party administration." Referring to the current state of the country, she said, "Price of commodities, on one hand, are rocketing increasing, while crime is also on the rise." The three-time former prime minister also said the country is facing unrelenting crises of gas, power and water. "There is no investment and the economy is also in chaos." She said Awami League had not kept their promises to people and termed the AL-led government "invalid" and a "failed one". Among others, BNP senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, advisory council member Ahmed Azam Khan, Jatiyatabi Chhatra Dal president Sultan Salauddin Tuku were present. b
