 Khagrachhari, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Khagrachhari district authorities on Wednesday declared a second overnight curfew on the district headquarters and its adjoining areas from 10pm to 7am the following morning, to avert any unwarranted situation, with reports of more homes torched as night fell in the troubled hill town. bdnews24.com Khagrachhari correspondent Chai Thoai Marmar said the house of his neighbour Hiralal Nath, in the city's Rajyamani Para, was set on fire by "unidentified people" at around 9pm. The house was gutted, though police and fire fighters reached the spot within about 15 minutes. The flames was doused just ahead of the curfew. It was unclear whether there were other similar incidents as the 10pm curfew placed a bar on further reporting. Khagrachhari deputy commissioner Mohammad Abdullah told bdnews24.com that his office reached the decision to impose curfew for a second successive night after taking into account the overall situation of the district. Curfew was declared in the town the previous night following clashes Tuesday that left at least one dead. The authorities also kept a clampdown on public gatherings in place throughout Wednesday. The Section 144 clampdown was also imposed on Tuesday during the clashes between hill people and 'Bangali settlers' in the district town. Khagrachhari wore a deserted look on Wednesday. Residents stayed indoors and shops and businesses remained closed in the morning even after the end of the curfew. The streets remained empty apart from presence of a large number of police and BDR personnel as well as army troops seen patrolling the town in the morning. Tuesday's violence had erupted when activists of United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) and Parbatya Chattagram Bangali Chhatra Parishad staged demonstrations in the town. One Bangali  Anwar Hossain (28)  was killed, more than 20 people injured and several houses torched in Tuesday's clashes, which in turn were sparked by recent troubles between hill people and 'Bangali settlers' at Baghaichhari in Rangamati that left two dead and scores of indigenous homes torched last week. bdne
