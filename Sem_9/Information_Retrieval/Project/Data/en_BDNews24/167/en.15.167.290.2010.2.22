 Rangamati, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  PCJSS is demanding a parliamentary probe into the recent violence at Bhagaichhari in Rangamati hill district during which settlers reportedly torched indigenous villages and the army is accused of shooting and killing at least two tribal people. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), an organisation of hill people that signed the CHT Peace Accord with the government in 1997, submitted a memorandum to the prime minister through the Rangamati deputy commissioner after demonstration at the district town on Monday. Buddhist monks joined the demonstration but they submitted a separate memorandum to the prime minister demanding an "independent investigation" into the incidents. Locals said over 1,000 PCJSS leaders, members and supporters and Buddhist monks from the area joined in the protest rally and procession from Rajbari area of the town through Banarupa to the deputy commissioner's office. bdn
