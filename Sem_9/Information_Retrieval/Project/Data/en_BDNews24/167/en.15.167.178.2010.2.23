 Chittagong, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Ship breakers in Chittagong demonstrated in the port city on Monday and submitted two memoranda to the prime minister protesting the government's decision to enforce more stringent environmental regulations on the industry. Over 2,000 workers and employees of ship breaking yards rallied in the port city for submission of the documents at the deputy commissioner's office. Safar Ali, international affairs secretary of the Jatiya Sramik League, and a city leader Shafi Bangali, were present during the submission of one of the memoranda. They demanded that workers and owners of ship breaking yards and a local MP should be included immediately in formulating the government's ship breaking policy. They added opinions from workers in place of NGO representatives should be prioritised in formulating the policy. Chittagong city unit of Jatiya Sramik League submitted the other memorandum to the prime minister with a 15-point list of demands. Among the demands were "steps to ensure safety of workers" and to include "workers' representatives" in formulating the ship breaking policy. There was no signature on behalf of workers on either of the memoranda. The prime minister has given directives in recent months for better regulation of the industry. The High Court last month also ordered authorities to ensure scrap ships are certified as free of toxic chemicals before entering Bangladesh territory. The court also directed the government to finalise the regulations for the industry. It asked the government to determine the terms and references for a high-powered committee formed to monitor the ship-breaking process in the country so that the committee could visit breaking yards and give its opinions. Of about 60,000 ocean-going ships around the world, 700-800 are decommissioned every year. Around half the world's scrap ships head to Bangladesh, being one of the most unregulated zones. The lucrative industry, which meets the need for raw steel in the country, is concentrated along the Sitakunda coast of Chittagong district and is flagged as highly hazardous for the environment and for the workers. A department of environment survey recorded 79 ship-breaking yards along the Sitakunda coast, of which 61 are in operation, employing around 30,000 workers. According to shipping ministry, around 500 workers have died and another 6,000 have been injured in the breaking yards since the industry began booming in the 1990s. Industrialists say the breaking yards, with an annual turnover of about $500 million, supplied over 1.5 million tonnes of scrap metal last year to steel re rolling mills and light engineering industries mainly producing spare parts and bicycles, saving the country from expensive imports. bdne
