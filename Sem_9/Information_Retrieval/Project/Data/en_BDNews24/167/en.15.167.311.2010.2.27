 Brahmanbaria, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Over 100 people were injured in clashes during a rally to mark Eid-e-Miladunnabi at Brahmanbaria's Sarail Upazila on Saturday. Police said the rally venue was also torched. Ahale Sunnat followers were holding a rally at the local cattle market at around 9am when Kawmi madrasa followers attacked them, which prompted the clash, Sarail police chief Subhash Chandra Saha told reporters. At least 125 people, including the upazila nirbahi officer Nazrul Islam and Sarail police sub-inspector Abdul Aleem, were injured in the clashes between the two groups, Saha said. The market was torched and two madrasas were also smashed during the violence, he said. Police fired 20 rounds of teargas shells to bring the situation under control, Saha said. Additional riot police were deployed in the upazila to keep the situation under control, he added. The incident halted traffic on the Dhaka-Sylhet highway for an hour. SECTION 144 AT B'BARIA EIDGAH Meanwhile, a Section 144 was imposed in the district town's Eidgah ground from morning as two rallies were called at the same venue to mark the religious day. Followers of Sunni Andolan and local Kawmi madrasa adherents announced separate rallies starting 9am at Brahmanbaria Eidgah. Hamidul Islam, officer-in-charge of Brahmanbaria Sadar Police Station, said the Section 144 clampdown beginning at 8am would remain in force up to midnight to prevent any "unwarranted situation". Extra police have been deployed at different points of the town since Saturday morning, he said. Nur-e-Alam Selim, the district president of Sunni Andolan blamed the Kawmi madrasa movement for foiling their rally. No comment was available from Kawmi madrasa-based leaders. bdn
