 KABUL, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least seven people were killed in a series of attacks in central Kabul on Friday, officials said, the latest brazen assault in the Afghan capital despite a renewed military push against Taliban insurgents. Police said a suicide bomber blew himself up near the entrance to Kabul's biggest shopping centre. At least two blasts and gunfire were reported in the area, which includes a hotel, guest house and some government buildings. Ahmed Zia Yaftali, a health ministry official, told Reuters at least seven people were killed and seven wounded. A Reuters cameraman said he saw two bodies being carried from the guest house but could not make out their identities. Police said gunmen had entered the shopping centre after the blasts and other attackers took up positions in nearby buildings. The Reuters cameraman spoke to one man inside the guest house who identified himself as an Indian named Kashif. "I was inside my room when I heard a loud explosion and then I could not see if people were killed or wounded because I locked my door," Kashif said. The assault appeared to be the biggest in the capital since Taliban gunmen launched a brazen attack on several targets in the centre of the city on Jan. 18. US and other NATO-led foreign forces have pushed back against the Taliban after violence across Afghanistan last year hit its worst levels since the Islamist militants were ousted by US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001. CLASHES CONTINUE Television reports suggested sporadic clashes were continuing between police and gunmen in some of the buildings but details remained sketchy. "I heard a big blast," witness Quaree Sameh told Reuters. "The glass shattered. The attackers were throwing grenades and shooting," Sameh said. The attack shattered the early morning calm in the capital at the start of the Afghan weekend. Broken glass littered the street on a wet, dreary day as Afghan security forces wearing bullet-proof vests rushed to secure the area, some taking up positions in doorways and others crouching behind concrete barriers. Thick smoke could be seen rising above the neighbourhood. Earlier this month, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force launched a big offensive in southern Helmand to drive the Taliban out of their last major stronghold in Afghanistan's most violent province. The Taliban over the past 18 months have spread out of their strongholds in the south and the east to formerly more peaceful areas in the north and west, sometimes reaching the capital despite a dramatic increase in the number of foreign troops. The latest operation in Helmand is an early test of US President Barack Obama's plan to add 30,000 troops to win control of Taliban bastions and hand them over to Afghan authorities before the start of a gradual US troop withdrawal in 20
