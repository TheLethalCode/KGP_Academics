 KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of American soldiers killed in Afghanistan has reached 1,000, an independent website said on Tuesday, a grim reminder that eight years of fighting has failed to defeat Taliban insurgents. Icasualties.org said 54 US troops were killed this year in Afghanistan, raising the casualties to 1,000, compared to eight in Iraq, where the total has reached 4,378.

Violence is at its highest level since the 2001 ouster of the Taliban. Last year was the deadliest of the war for civilians and foreign troops. Marjah is a prime example of the challenge facing US troops and their NATO allies. They have taken over key areas, but still face pockets of stiff resistance from the Taliban, who have littered roads with hidden bombs. The success of the operation hinges on whether they can keep Taliban fighters from re-capturing their stronghold and ensure Afghan forces can secure the area on their own. Ultimately Marjah can only be stable once the local government provides enough jobs and economic opportunities to keep the local population on its side, eradicating conditions that breed militancy, analysts say. Obama announced in December he was adding 30,000 more US troops to the Afghan war effort. He hopes to start bringing US troops home from Afghanistan in the middle of 2
