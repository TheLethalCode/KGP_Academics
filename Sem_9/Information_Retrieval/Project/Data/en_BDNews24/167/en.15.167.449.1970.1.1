 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Trial of the Pilkhana killings will start soon, home minister Sahara Khatun said on Thursday, on the one-year anniversary of the BDR mutiny. "The trial of mutiny has already begun. Criminal charges for the killings are set to be pressed. Their trial will start immediately after the charge-sheet is submitted," she said. Sahara was talking to reporters after attending a milad mahfil arranged at BDR headquarters at Pilkhana for the army officers slain during the two day armed revolt last year. While a special court at Durbar Hall has launched the Pilkhana mutiny trial, the murder probe lags on. CID special superintendent of police Abdul Kahhar, who is investigating the Pilkhana killings, told reporters Thursday that the probe had neared completion. He said around 900 BDR personnel might be charged in the criminal case for the murders. BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam along with other high-rank officials of the border force and family members of the mutiny victims also attended the milad mahfil at the central mosque in the BDR headquarters. The BDR chief said land-plots have already been allotted to the families of the mutiny victims. The mutineers killed over 70 people at Pilkhana during the bloody events of Feb 25-26 last year, 58 of them army officers deputed to the border force. bd
