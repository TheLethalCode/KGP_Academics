 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Two organisations of settlers enforced dawn-to-dusk road and river blockades in the three districts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts on Thursday in protest against killing of one and, they claim, abduction of five Bangalis as and "attack on army" by indigenous people. Witnesses said road and river communications of the districts  Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban  with other parts of the country were cut off. Tourists visiting the three hill districts were stranded due to the blockade. Offices, shops and other establishments were also closed, but the situation remained calm, they said. Parbatya Chattagram Samaadhikar Andolon (Chittagong Hill Tracts Equal Rights Movement) and Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad enforced the programme following a series of violent settler-tribal clashes at Baghaichhar in Rangamati and Khagrachhari town in recent days. The blockade supporters picketed at different places. But no incidents of clashes or ransacking occurred. One Bangali  Anwar Hossain (28)  was killed, more than 20 people injured and several houses torched in Tuesday's clashes, which in turn were sparked by recent troubles between hill people and 'Bangali settlers' at Baghaichhari in Rangamati that left two dead and scores of indigenous homes torched last week. Khagrachhari district town has been under overnight curfew since Tuesday. Samaadhikar Andolon's Khagrachhari unit convenor Hafizur Rahman accused UNDP, European Union, and donor agency Danida of instigating the tribal-settlers clashes. He demanded that the government stop the outsiders' activities in hill districts immediately. PEACE MARCH In another development, members of the tribal and settler communities took out a procession at Khagrachhari town in the morning demanding measures to restore peace in the district. They demanded the district administration take urgent measures to reopen the offices and business establishments. Our Khagrachhari correspondent reports the "all community meeting" was held at Rajyamoni Buddhist temple at the town in the morning before taking out the peace procession. Khagrachhari municipal corporation mayor Joynal Abedin, former chairman and Awami League leader Zahidul Alam, Sadar upazila chairman Md Shan-e-Alam, district general secretary of Mohila Awami League Crosaing Marma former union council chairman Mongmong Chi, among others, were present at the meeting.
