<TITLE> A volatile week for DSE </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  A volatile week for the market saw Dhaka stock's benchmark index started the week registering the largest single-day fall in the bourse's history. The market was closed on Sunday (Feb 21) due to a public holiday. The week's first trading session on Monday saw the prime bourse's general index or the DGEN plunging 137 points, 2.39 percent, due to price correction along with a credit bar imposed on Grameenphone (GP). The regulatory move caused GP, the most weighted shares, to drop by almost eight percent  the largest fall since its debut last November, contributing to the slide. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an attempt to halt the spiralling price of the country's lone telecom issue, sent it to the spot market with no margin loans and suspended netting facility of the issue. Brokerage officials said that GP fell because investors couldn't buy the shares on credit. The regulators also sent beauty products manufacturer, Marico to the spot market as they felt the issue's price hike was abnormal, which also suffered significant losses. The day saw other bellwethers of the market, namely banking, lose on average by 0.82 percent. The fall in banking was one of the reasons behind the DGEN's historic fall as the financial houses account for more than half of market capitalisation. Meanwhile market experts felt that the price correction was imminent. "It was a massive price correction and it was overdue," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. On Tuesday, the indices edged down, but both GP and Marico managed to gain despite all the restrictions. GP rebounded by 2.76 per cent to while Marico shook-off losses to gain 3.41 per cent. The day saw the market switching between profit and loss several times as the benchmark index lost about 40 points in the opening bell. Then it bounced back by 50 points in midday but ultimately closed lower. Volatility was on the driving seat of Tuesday's session as investors were uncertain about the price stability of the major market movers, brokerage officials said. The day saw almost all the sectors declining except general insurers and telecoms. The market bounced back on Wednesday on the back GP shares along with insurers, breaking out from the losing streak of three straight sessions of losses. The general index saw a rise of 1.49 percent or 83 points while GP gained 7.23 percent, once again pulling the indices up. Most of the other sectors including banks, lease financers, pharmaceuticals and energy declined. The closing day of the week, Thursday, left Dhaka stocks ending slightly lower with the driving factor, GP gaining by less than 1 percent. The banking sector ended mixed with 11 out of the 29 scrips gaining while most of the lease financers lost. The day turned out to be a bad one for power and energy shares while insurers lost on profit taking following gains for the last three sessions. The total market capitalisation of Thursday stood at Tk 2,317 billion, a 1.22 percent cut from the previous week's closing. Meanwhile, the daily average turnover of the week lost by 28.56 percent from last week's average, amounting to Tk 10.60 billion. Beximco, Lanka Bbangla Finance, Bex Tex, GP and Summit Power were the week's turnover leader
