<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) -- England opened their Bangladesh tour with an easy 112-run victory over a Bangladesh Cricket Board XI at Fatullah on Tuesday. Put into bat, the tourists racked up imposing total of 370-7 in 50 overs after centuries from Craig Kieswetter and Paul Collingwood. The home side managed just 258-9. Cricinfo adds: Craig Kieswetter confirmed his rich promise as an opening batsman, and ensured he will be making his England debut in the first ODI against Bangladesh at Dhaka on Sunday, while Paul Collingwood continued his fine recent form, as both men cracked rapid centuries in England's first outing. Kieswetter launched an impressive batting display by slamming a brutal 143 in 123 balls in his maiden appearance for the senior team, before Collingwood climbed onto the offensive in the closing overs of the innings, as he reached his own hundred from just 66 deliveries. In reply, the BCB XI were never in contention after Graeme Swann claimed 4 for 44. Kieswetter, who was born in Johannesburg, qualified to play for England exactly a week ago. He had not originally been part of England's one-day squad for the tour of Bangladesh, but was added to the party at the last minute following a series of impressive performances for the England Lions in the UAE, including a match-winning 81 in a Twenty20 contest against the senior squad in Abu Dhabi last Wednesday. On Tuesday he all but doubled that tally with a brilliant display of power-hitting, including four sixes. He opened the batting alongside England's stand-in captain, Alastair Cook, who made a brisk half-century in a 127-run stand for the first wicket, and though he was fortunate to survive four dropped catches, Kieswetter reached his century from 101 balls before powering on at two runs a ball for the remainder of his stay. Two of his lives were donated by the left-arm seamer, Shafaq Al Zabir, who spilled a pair of caught-and-bowled opportunities in the first hour, and he was later dropped on the boundary's edge on 80. At the other end, Cook was trapped lbw by Alauddin Babu shortly after reaching his half-century, who removed Kevin Pietersen for a duck with his very next delivery, albeit to a marginal decision. Luke Wright then survived three chances in a brisk 25, as Collingwood powered along to 109 from 74 balls before becoming one of three late victims for the former Test seamer, Tapash Baishya. Ajmal Shahzad, who enjoyed a dramatic entry into international cricket with two wickets in his first over against Pakistan in Dubai on Saturday, once again made the first breakthrough of the BCB's reply, as the Test opener, Shahriar Nafees, was bowled for 8 in the fifth over. Swann then followed up with his habitual early wicket, as Mahmudul Hasan picked out a diving Wright for 22, before Nasiruddin Faruque and Raqibul Hasan dug in to carry the BCB reply past 100. But after a change of ends, and an ineffective first foray from the off-spinner James Tredwell, Swann returned to pin Faruque lbw for 37 (107 for 3). Naeem Islam went the same way for 40, and Swann completed his haul with the scalp of Ariful Haque, after being hoisted for two big sixes. With the match drifting to a predictable conclusion, Wright claimed his only wicket of the innings, before Liam Plunkett bagged two in the final over, including the top-scorer, Sharifullah, fo
