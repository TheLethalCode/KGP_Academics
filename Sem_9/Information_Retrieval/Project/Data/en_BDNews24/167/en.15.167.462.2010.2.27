 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh play England in the first of the three-match Beximco one-day international series at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. The day-night match begins at 2:00pm. "We will try to win at least one game," said skipper Shakib Al Hasan, the world's number one all-rounder according to the International Cricket Council ratings. "Hopefully we can win two to win the series but we will target our first match and then go step by step. "If we play to our ability, it's possible. Obviously when playing at home we know we are a very good team, with home advantage. We are definitely a better team at home." The hosts head into the series without one of their most talented batsmen after former captain Mohammad Ashraful asked to be rested following a poor run of scores. Uncapped all-rounder Sohrawardy Shuvo is set to make his debut at his expense. "I spoke to Ash at the end of the New Zealand series," said coach Jamie Siddons. "He said he wanted a rest and I thought I'd talked him out of it, so I'm not sure what's happened in last three or four days. But he's made his decision and I respect it, but I'd love to have him at 3 and 4 in our Test and ODI teams. He's the little diamond in the rough we are looking for, that we need to step up along with Tamim, Mushfiq [Rahim] and Shakib. Those guys have really stepped up, so if Ash can fill the gap, we're a formidable batting team." But they will welcome back fast bowler Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who has been out of action since last July following knee surgery. He got through eight overs in England's second warm-up in Fatullah, and Siddons is ready to put his faith in the medical bulletins, and his own observations from Friday's nets session. "I saw him running, I wouldn't say he's 100 percent fit but he's pretty close," he said. "He was bowling beautifully, and saw a little footage of him from the other day and he looked quite good with the new ball. My only concern is how he comes back in the middle overs, but he's a key part of our side when he's fit. So we'll probably roll the dice a bit and give him a game, and hope he comes up trumps with the new ball." Alastair Cook wanted to put England's warm-up victories to one side and focus on picking up a first series win as England captain. Cook, handed a first tour of duty as skipper in Bangladesh, has presided over a trouble-free opening week in the job. He has picked up two brisk half-centuries in convincing back-to-back wins over a Bangladesh Cricket Board XI and has no injury worries to deal with. Cook is keen to avoid placing too much significance on the practice victories, during which he announced his return to 50-over cricket with confident knocks of 56 and 52. "It's been a good week so far. We've played some very good cricket in the warm-up games and improved in the areas we wanted to," he said. "But that doesn't count for anything before the first international game so we have to come out firing and play the cricket we have been playing for the last eight months. The tourists are likely to give South Africa-born Craig Kieswetter a debut. The Somerset opening batsman and wicketkeeper, 22, only qualified to play for his adopted country on Feb 16. Kieswetter, who will open the innings with Cook, hit an impressive 143 in his first England appearance, a warm-up match against the BCB XI in Fatullah on Tuesday. Siddons hoped England's decision to rest captain Andrew Strauss "bite them on the bum". Asked about Strauss' absence from the tour, Siddons said: "People have their own choices to make, and organisations have their choices to make about whether they come here or not. "My thoughts are that I hope it bites them on the bum at the end of the series, that the opener they've brought in isn't good enough, and that they fail at that part of the game." Bangladesh have recorded victories over all of the Test-playing nations except England, whose record is 8-0 in ODIs and 4-0 in Test matches, but Siddons believes Cook's side will need to be on peak form to extend that record. Cook, however, bridled at suggestions that England were deliberately fielding a weakened side. "From our point of view that's not the case at all," he said. "Jimmy Anderson is injured and he needs the rehab time and Andrew Strauss' situation we've talked enough about before. Apart from that it's a full-strength side."
