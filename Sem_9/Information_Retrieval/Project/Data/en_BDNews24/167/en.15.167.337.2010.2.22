 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Six human rights and civil society organisations have demanded "proper legal actions through neutral investigation" against those responsible for the recent violence at Baghaichhari Upazila in Rangamati hill district. The remote Gangaram Mukh area of the upazila erupted in violence on the night of Jan 19, during which indigenous villages were torched and tribal people were shot dead Expressing concern over the situation there, six organisations in a joint statement on Monday questioned how such violence could occur when an army camp is situated near the area. The organisations are Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust (BLAST), Association for Land Reform and Development (ALRD), Nijera Kori, Brac's Legal Aid Programme, and Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB). They also called for emergency provision of food and medical services for victims of the violence and their full rehabilitation. Quoting media reports, they said many tribal people are struggling to find food and shelter in remote areas. They urged authorities to restore normalcy in the region, and activate the CHT Land Commission to reinstate land rights to the indigenous population. HILL PEOPLE DEMAND JS PROBE Earlier in the day, Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) called for a parliamentary probe into the events at Baghaichhari on Feb19-20. Two bullet-ridden bodies have been recovered following army intervention in the clashes at Gangaram Mukh between the indigenous and settler communities. Tribal leaders claim at least six indigenous villagers were killed as the army opened fire on them. PCJSS, the indigenous people's organisation that signed the CHT Peace Accord with the government in 1997, submitted a memorandum to the prime minister through the Rangamati deputy commissioner after a demonstration at the district town on Monday. Buddhist monks also took part in the demonstration but they submitted a separate memorandum to the prime minister demanding an "independent investigation" into the incidents. Locals said over 1,000 PCJSS leaders, members and supporters along with Buddhist monks from the area joined in the protest rally and procession from Rajbari area of the town through Banarupa to the deputy commissioner's office. PCJSS vice-chairman Lakshmiprasad Chakma, addressing the rally, blamed army personnel for the violence and deaths of villagers and demanded their pullout from the area. Satyananda Mohathero, general secretary of a local Buddhist monks association, on Monday demanded a fair and neutral probe into the incidents and punishment to those responsible. PCJSS also demanded prompt punishment for those responsible for the violence. Other demands put forward by them included compensation for and rehabilitation of those whose homes were torched, relocating 'Bangali settlers' in the region to cluster villages and full implementation of the 1997 peace accord. Parbatya Chattagram Bangali Chhatra Parishad, an organisation of settlers, brought out a separate demonstration in the town blaming the hill people for the violence
