 DUBAI, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixth seed Marin Cilic thrived in sweltering conditions to power past Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-2, 6-4 in the first round of the Dubai tennis championships on Tuesday. "The first set wasn't that great. I didn't have a big percentage of first serves, but also he didn't push me and I won my service games pretty easily," the tall Croatian told reporters. "I can still improve." Cilic, who has won two ATP events this year, will play qualifier Stefan Koubek in Wednesday's second round and the world number nine will not take his opponent lightly after the Austrian beat twice Dubai runner-up Feliciano Lopez on Monday. "He won't be easy, he can be dangerous and I have to focus to serve good and try to play as aggressive as I can," said Cilic, who was unfazed by the heat. "There were perfect conditions -- I like to play in the sun," said the 21-year-old, who dropped only five points on his serve in the first set. The second set was tougher going and Clement, 32, saved two break points at 2-2 but then hit a double fault to gift the game to the 2010 Australian Open semi-finalist. Cilic won the next game with a 201-kph ace to lead 4-2 and then put Clement's serve under pressure but the Frenchman saved another break point to pull back to 4-3. Cilic eventually served out the match, saving five break points in the final game and clinching victory with an ace, his 13th of the contest. Indian qualifier Somdev Devvarman beat Switzerland's Marco Chiudinelli 6-4, 7-5 to set up a meeting with Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in the next round. On Monday, world number four Andy Murray overcame a gutsy display from Russian Igor Kunitsyn to win 6-2, 6-3 in a floodlit first-round encounter. After defending champion Novak Djokovic eased into Wednesday's second round with a straight-sets victory, the Briton started slowly in his first match since losing the Australian Open final to Roger Federer, surviving two break points in the opening game. The Russian's high-energy approach disturbed a rusty Murray in an epic 24-minute second game which included 14 deuces. Murray's right knee was wrapped in an ice pack before the game and the Scot visibly slumped after failing to convert an eighth break point, but won at the ninth attempt for a 2-0 lead. "It was really tough -- that was probably the longest game I've ever played on the tour," Murray said in a courtside interview. Murray will next play Italy's Andreas Seppi or Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia. Djokovic survived a late scare to defeat Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-4, 6-4. The crowd favourite was 5-0 ahead in the second set, before a determined Guillermo fought back to 5-4. "It was all my fault," Djokovic told reporters. "I was playing well all the way up to 5-love and then just lost it. It's my first game outdoors since Australia, so (I'm) still getting used to the conditions." His win set up all an all-Serb second round clash with childhood friend Victor Troicki, who beat Rainer Schuettler 6-3, 6-4. Food poisoning could not stop Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis from defeating eighth seed Gilles Simon 7-6, 6-4. Spain's Feliciano Lopez, twice a finalist here, suffered a shock 7-6, 6-4 first-round defeat to Austrian qualifier Stefan Ko
