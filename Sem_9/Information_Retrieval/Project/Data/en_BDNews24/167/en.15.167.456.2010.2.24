 TOKYO, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan has verified the existence of a 1969 agreement with the United States that would allow Washington to deploy nuclear weapons in southern Japan in the event of an emergency, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday. The agreement could put Japan's government in a bind by forcing it to choose between scrapping the pact with its top security ally and watering down its self-imposed ban against the possession, production or import of nuclear arms.

But Tokyo also benefits from the shelter of the US nuclear umbrella, and many in Japan would be reluctant to see the United States' nuclear deterrent significantly weakened in the face of a resurgent China and threats from North Korea.
