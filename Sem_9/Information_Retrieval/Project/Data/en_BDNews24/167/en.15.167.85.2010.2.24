 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce minister Faruk Khan was served a legal notice on Wednesday accusing him of contempt of court for "obstructing" local authorities in carrying out a High Court order for demolition of illegal structures on the banks of the Sitalakhya river. Advocate Manzil Morshed on behalf of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB) served the notice. "The notice asks him to explain within 24 hours why he should not be accused of contempt of court," Morshed told bdnews24.com. "If he doesn't answer within the deadline, we will file a contempt of court petition against him." The notice cited the High Court ruling on June 25 last year asking the government to demolish all illegal structures encroaching on the four rivers surrounding Dhaka citythe Buriganga, Turag, Sitalakhya and Balu. On Jan 24 this year, another High Court ruling ordered the government to begin demolishing the illegal structures built on the banks of the four rivers within February. In line with the order, the Narayanganj district authorities on Feb 9 asked the City Group of Industries to withdraw their jetties set up on the bank of Sitalakhya at North Rupashi village at Rupganj thana. On Feb 22, the notice said, commerce minister Faruk Khan sent a letter to shipping minister Shahjahan Khan requesting him to prevent demolition of the jetties. The HRPB notice also said that the commerce minister's actions amounted to "direct interference" against the High Court's ruling and therefore contempt of the court. The High Court on Feb 23 rejected a petition by City Group challenging the demolition order on its jetties. The Group sought to appeal the High Court decision. Appellate Division chamber judge BK Das on Wednesday fixed Mar 1 for a hearing. bdn
