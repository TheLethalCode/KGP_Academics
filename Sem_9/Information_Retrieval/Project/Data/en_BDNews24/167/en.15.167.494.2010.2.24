 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Eighty-four accused in BDR Pilkhana mutiny case were produced before the special court on Wednesday, the second day of the trial that began at Durbar Hall of the force's headquarters on Tuesday. The court ordered giving copies of the charges to the accused before adjourning the proceedings till Apr 15 at around 11:45am after one-hour hearing. Two of the 86 accused in the case  jawans Maksudur Rahman and Nurul Alam  remained fugitive. BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam presided over the Special Court-5, set up under the Bangladesh Rifles Order-1972. Two other senior officers  Lt Col Golam Rabbani and Maj Sayeed Hasan Tapash  were also on the judges' panel. The Pilkhana mutiny trial began on Tuesday almost a year to the day since the border guards took up arms against their officers, killing scores and holding their families hostage. Eight-three accused were taken to the court on Wednesday from jails and one from hospital. Ordering copies of the charges to be handed to the accused for preparation of their defence, the court told them that they could seek legal advice from BDR officials or appoint their own lawyers. "But the officials or lawyers cannot speak in court. Their activities will remain confined to giving advice. The accused have to stand for their defence," it said. The court said trial would go on against the two absconding accused, against whom warrants of arrest were issued on Tuesday, until they are arrested or surrender to the court. But in the meantime, a circular would be published in national newspapers asking them to surrender. The special court accepted charges against the 86 accused the day before, including direct participation in the mutiny, not resisting the mutiny, and not informing the higher authorities of the mutiny. Plaintiff in the case Subedar Major Shah Alam Bhuiyab read out the charges. He said 40 of the accused aimed guns at their officers on the first day of the two-day mutiny while the other accused were on the scene but did nothing to stop them. He said the Pilkhana mutineers held a meeting just before the Bangladesh Rifles Durbar on Feb 25 last year, which the mutineers stormed with guns launching a bloody two-day revolt at the border force's headquarters. The court also heard how one officer "at the point of death" wrote an SMS to his unborn baby. The Pilkhana mutineers killed nearly 60 of them army officers, deputed to the border force, during the events of Feb 25-26 2009. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. The government formed six special courts under BDR law last year, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts are only trying the charges of mutiny and rebellion, under BDR law. Trials of the other serious crimes, including murder, rape and arson, being investigated by CID, will be held in civilian court. The first of the BDR trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers. Special courts are holding similar trials in Feni, Satkhira and Thakurgaon. In the event of a guilty verdict by the special courts, the maximum penalty for mutiny or rebellion is seven years in jail. The killings at Pilkhana will carry the maximum penalty under civil law. bdn
