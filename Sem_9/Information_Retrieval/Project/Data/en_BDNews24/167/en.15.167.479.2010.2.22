 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  England open their tour of Bangladesh with a limited-overs practice match against the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah on Tuesday. The tourists have drafted in Craig Kieswetter, a 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman, who impressed during the second string England Lions' tour in the UAE. He scored a hard-hitting 81 that secured a five-wicket win over the senior side in Abu Dhabi. "The call-up definitely came out of the blue for me, I wasn't expecting it at all," Kieswetter told reporters at the team hotel in Dhaka. "I found out on the bus on the way back from training and felt really ecstatic about it, and chuffed, but there are butterflies and nerves going around. But I'll be trying to do the best that I can in training and hopefully in the matches too." Kieswetter, born in Johannesburg, only completed his four-year qualification period last week. His mother is British and he spent long periods of his childhood in her Edinburgh home. The Somerset player, however, will not keep wicket in this match. Meanwhile, the BCB XI named their team, which will includes all-rounder Naeem Islam and batsman Raqibul Hassan. Alok Kopali pulled himself out due to medical reasons. Shahriar Nafees will lead the side. The match starts at 9:00am. BCB XI: Shahriar Nafees (captain), Imtiaz Hossain, Nasir Uddin Faruque, Raqibul Hassan, Shahin Hossain (wicketkeeper), Naeem Islam, Mahmudul Hasan, Shafaq Al Zabir, Tanvir Haider, Ariful Hoque, Alauddin Babu, Tapash Baishya, Shamsur Rahman, Md Sharifu
