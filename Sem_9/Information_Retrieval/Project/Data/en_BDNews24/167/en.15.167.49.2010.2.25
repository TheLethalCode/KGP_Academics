 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's opposition Conservatives will seek to sharpen their election message at a party meeting this weekend after polls showed ruling Labour whittling away their lead weeks before an election. The centre-right Conservatives, in the political wilderness for 13 years, will focus on the economy and the health service to try to shore up support when delegates gather in the southern city of Brighton. Polls this month have put the Conservative lead over Labour as low as 6-7 points, raising the spectre of a hung parliament in which no party wins an outright majority. That prospect alarms financial markets which want a clear verdict and action to reduce a record budget deficit set to exceed 12 percent of GDP this year. Conservative leader David Cameron, who closes the spring forum with a speech on Sunday afternoon, will be under pressure to tell activists how to sway wavering voters. "What they have got to do is to come up with a message that can be sold on the doorstep but not go back to Thatcherite simplicities," said Tim Bale, senior lecturer in politics at Sussex University in Brighton. "There is some concern that they have overshot when it comes to the age of austerity rhetoric," added Bale, author of a recent book "The Conservative Party from Thatcher to Cameron". The Conservatives say they will cut spending harder and faster than Labour but Cameron has recently toned down his message amid concerns it was frightening voters. VOTERS "BATTERED AND BRUISED" Cameron said this week that voters were "battered and bruised" by a scandal over lawmakers' expenses and what he said was the failure of Labour to live up to its promises. He said his party had to restore voters' faith in politics. "I am convinced that over the next 75 to 80 days we can do that, we can say that change is possible, this is a different team of people who do things differently, we can get our economy going, we can mend the broken society," he told Sky News. "But we have got a lot of work to do to convince people that change is possible, right now I think they find that hard to believe." Mike Freer, who is standing for the Conservatives in former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's constituency in north London, says there is no panic despite the polls. He believes that he is on course to capture the seat from Labour and that colleagues in the closely fought "marginal constituencies" are similarly confident ahead of an election expected to be held on May 6. "I think national opinion polls are very different from what is happening in the marginals," he told Reuters, adding the state of the economy, quality of life and a feeling that taxes were too high were the main complaints he heard on doorsteps. Freer said he believed that talk of a hung parliament, in which the small opposition Liberal Democrats could hold the balance of power, would concentrate the minds of voters. "My personal view is that when people think that there will be a hung parliament it will force them to choose between the two main parties. They want a government not a hotch-potch cobbled togeth
