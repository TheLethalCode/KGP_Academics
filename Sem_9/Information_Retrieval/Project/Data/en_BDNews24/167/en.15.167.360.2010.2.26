 Khagrachhari, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  After three consecutive days, curfew was withdrawn at Khagrachhari district town on Friday evening. The curfew and a daytime section 144, preventing people from gathering at one place in large numbers, had been in force for the last three days due to widespread violence in the hill district. The deputy commissioner, Mohammad Abdullah, told bdnews24.com that the section 144 would still be in force. The police have arrested four prominent politicians of the main parties including those from the ruling Awami League, opposition BNP and its main ally the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. The arrested are, local Jamaat chief Maybubul Haque Selim, former municipal chairman and former president of district BNP, Md Abul Kashem, district AL leader Md Islamuddin and PBCP organising secretary Md Anwar Hossain. Khagrachhari's acting police superintendent Md Amir Zafar confirmed bdnews24.com of their detention at about 10.00pm. Authorities fearing that the violence between indigenous hill people and the Bengali settler might go out of control imposed the curfew and deployed a large number of military and police personnel. The violence in Khagrachhari, that claimed one life, came in the wake of another ethnic clash at Baghaichhari sub-district of Rangamati, another hill district in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the south east of Bangladesh. Seven people were killed in Baghaichhari in clashes where according the United Nations' reports, the army were involved in subduing the locals. bd
