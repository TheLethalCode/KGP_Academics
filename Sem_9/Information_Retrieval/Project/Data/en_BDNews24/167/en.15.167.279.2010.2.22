 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday exonerated Jamuna Future Park owner Shamim Islam from a contempt-of-court charge brought by Rajuk for misinterpreting a High Court ruling on demolition of the shopping mall. The bench of justice AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and justice Borhanuddin gave the order as the respondent sought unconditional apology from the court, Rajuk lawyer AFM Mezbahuddin told journalists. Rajuk, the capital development authority, filed the suit against Shamim, managing director of the mall's owning company Jamuna Builders Ltd, on February 6 accusing him of misinterpreting the High Court ruling that had dismissed a Jamuna Group appeal against a demolition notice served on the mall being constructed near the Baridhara diplomatic enclave. After filing the suit, Mezbahuddin had told reporters that Shamim appealed against the High Court ruling where he mentioned "I filed the appeal as per the direction of the court". "But in reality there was no direction for appeal in the High Court ruling Such a wrong presentation of the ruling is a contempt of court," he said. Rajuk initially served the demolition notice on January 17 on Jamuna Builders asking it to knock down unauthorised top floors of the sprawling shopping mall within seven days. Jamuna Group immediately petitioned the High Court, challenging the notice but the court dismissed the petition on February 4. A day after the dismissal Rajuk began demolishing the unapproved top floors. The demolition work came to a halt as Jamuna Builders immediately sought to appeal against the High Court's dismissal of the earlier petition. The Supreme Court on February 11 dismissed the appeal, clearing the way for carrying on the demolition work. Rajuk resumed works to knock down the unauthorised floors on February 18. b
