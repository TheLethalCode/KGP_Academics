<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Pilkhana mutiny trial will begin on Tuesday at Durbar Hall, almost a year to the day since border guards at the BDR's Dhaka headquarters took up arms there against their officers, killing scores and holding their families hostage. A special court will begin the proceedings at noon in the meeting hall, which was the centre of the bloody uprising on Feb 25 last year. BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam will preside over the Special Court-5, which has been set up under the Bangladesh Rifles Order-1972. Two other senior officers will flank him. A representative, nominated by the attorney general, will be present to give legal assistance to the court "About 80 accused might be produced before the special court on Tuesday," additional director general Brig Obaydur Rahman told bdnews24.com on Monday. The Pilkhana mutineers killed over 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force, during the events of Feb 25-26 2009. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. The government formed six special courts under BDR law last year, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts will only try the charges of mutiny and rebellion, BDR officials had said earlier. Trials of the other serious crimes, including murder, rape and arson, will be held in civilian court. The first of the mutiny trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers. Trials are also being held in Feni, Satkhira and Thakurgaon. The Special Court 4 in Rangamati is due to hand down the first verdict in connection with the BDR mutiny on May 2. In the event of a guilty verdict by the special courts, the maximum penalty for mutiny or rebellion is seven years in jail. The killings at Pilkhana will carry the maximum penalty under civil law. bdnews2
