<TITLE> Garment factory fire equipment was 'useless' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  Fire-fighting equipment at the Garib & Garib sweater factory were of no use, said a fire official at Gazipur. Abu Zafar Ahmed, Gazipur fire station officer said that there was no water in the factory's reserve tank. "Although there were hosepipes on every floor, they were virtually useless." A raging fire originating from a large stock of acrylic sweaters giving off thick toxic smoke killed 21 workers, including 16 women, at the factory in Gazipur, about an hour's car ride from Dhaka on Thursday night. Witnesses said, the bodies did not have burn marks and presumably died of suffocation. The factory authorities have said that the accident had happened despite adequate preparation and fire-prevention measures. Apparently the workers trained during fire drills could not act their roles because the fire quickly went out of control. The fire official said that they resorted to using the dirty water of the factory's washing plant and two pumps. "We also took water from a nearby pond," said Ahmed. The large fire trucks could not go up close to the factory site because of narrow alleys, he said. "There were adequate fire extinguishers, hosepipes, fire blankets and emergency exits on every floor," claimed Chowdhury Qudrat Elahi, director of the factory, to bdnews24.com. But there were no visible fire escapes outside the factory's concrete structure. Elahi said it would be impossible for a few workers present at the factory building to douse the fire given that the large stock of acrylic sweaters would burn quickly. "I told them to leave the building immediately." The factory's director said there were only 32 workers in the building when the fire broke out. He said that some workers got trapped on the second floor trying to put out the flames. "There were some women on the fifth floor who panicked and eventually suffocated to death." But Elahi brushed off possibilities of sabotage. This was the second time that a fire in this same factory claimed lives. Ahmed said that last August, another fire had killed a fireman and a factory worker at the same place.
