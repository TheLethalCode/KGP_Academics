 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two goals for Roman Pavlyuchenko and two own goals helped Tottenham Hotspur advance to an FA Cup quarter-final meeting with Fulham after a 4-0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in their fifth-round replay on Wednesday. Aston Villa, Stoke City and, for the first time in 87 years, Championship (second division) Reading, also went through to the last eight after a dramatic night of penalties, extra time and a red card.

Ryan Shawcross headed in a Rory Delap long throw in extra time and Tuncay Sanli completed the win that takes Stoke, who knocked Arsenal out earlier in the competition, into a quarter-final meeting with holders Chelsea. It will be their first appearance in the last eight since 1972 but that looks like yesterday in comparison with Reading, who ended a drought going back to 1927. They looked to be going out when they trailed 2-1 into stoppage time at fellow Championship side West Bromwich Albion only for Brian Howard to equalise in stoppage time before Gylfi Sigurdsson thumped in a long-range winner to secure a home quarter-final against V
