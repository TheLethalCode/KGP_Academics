 ISLAMABAD, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's main opposition leader Nawaz Sharif reiterated on Monday a call for the transfer of presidential powers to the prime minister and parliament, highlighting an issue that could bring political turmoil. US ally Pakistan is fighting indigenous Taliban militants attacking the state and is expected to play a role in efforts to bring peace to neighbouring Afghanistan, where US forces are spearheading a big offensive against the Taliban. Any sign of instability distracting Pakistan's government from security can unnerve the United States and other Western powers embroiled in Afghanistan and can unsettle investors. Former military leader and president Pervez Musharraf accumulated powers to the presidency during his rule, including the power to dismiss parliament. Musharraf stepped down months after a 2008 general election won by the Pakistan People's Party of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto, and the leader of Pakistan's other main party, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, had in 2006 agreed on a Charter of Democracy aimed at transferring powers back to the prime minister and restoring a parliamentary system. Sharif called again on Monday for the full implementation of the charter in talks with Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, a close Zardari ally. "We want the Charter of Democracy to be immediately implemented ... the 17th amendment should immediately be repealed," Sharif said referring to an amendment introduced by Musharraf giving the president power to dissolve parliament. "The parliament should be sovereign and there should be an independent judiciary," he told reporters with Gilani after their talks in the city of Lahore.

But critics say he is reluctant to turn himself into a ceremonial leader and has been dragging his feet. Gilani said a parliamentary committee was working on reforms and he promised good news on the charter. Sharif can mobilise supporters for big protests, especially in the politically most important province of Punjab, which could plunge the country into crisis. While some party members have raised the possibility of a street campaign if the reforms are not introduced, Sharif issued no such ultimatum on Monday. He has been largely supportive of the government in recent months but last week denounced Zardari as "the biggest threat to democracy" after Zardari got into a dispute with the judiciary over the appointment of judges. The dispute blew over after the government backed down. Polls show Sharif is Pakistan's most popular politician and his party looks well placed to win the next polls, due by 2013. Analysts say he does not want to incite turmoil which could bring military intervention and block his return to po
