 WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US envoys head to Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo on Tuesday to discuss how to bring North Korea back to talks on its nuclear program but have no plans to meet North Korean officials, the US State Department said. North Korea promised to abandon its nuclear programs in 2005 but later backed away from the agreement, twice testing nuclear devices and refusing to resume "six-party" talks with South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. US special representative for North Korea policy Stephen Bosworth and Sung Kim, the US envoy to the talks, leave Washington on Tuesday to follow up on recent contacts, notably between Pyongyang and Beijing, the State Department said without providing a detailed itinerary. North Korea's chief nuclear envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, visited China earlier this month. There are no clear signs, however, that the North plans to return to the talks and no plans for the US officials to visit Pyongyang or meet North Korean officials elsewhere on the trip, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters. "There have been meetings recently with North Korean officials and we are going to be consulting to see where we stand," Crowley said. Asked if there was anything to suggest the six-party talks might resume, Crowley replied: "We are looking for a signal from North Korea and we are still waiting for that signal." US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meet her South Korean counterpart, Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan, in Washington on Friday, Crowley add
