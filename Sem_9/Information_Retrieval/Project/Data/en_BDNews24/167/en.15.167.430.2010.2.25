 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Former Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful was the notable absentee from the squad named for the first ODI against England at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. The Bangladesh Cricket Board on Thursday named a 13-member squad for the three-match series that includes fast bowler Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and uncapped all-rounder Md Sohrawordhi. Chief selector Rafiqul Alam said Ashraful himself wanted a rest. "Ashraful said he needed a break and we also felt the pressure on him to the extent that his confidence was suffering. We believe that a gap from international cricket would be beneficial for him and he will come back strongly soon and do justice to his calibre," he told reporters. Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons was highly critical of Ashraful during the tour of New Zealand, hinting the Bangladesh cricket establishment's patience for the batsman may have reached its end. "Ashraful had a terrible tour and he kept making the same bad decisions. We might have to reassess him when we get back," Siddons said. Referring to the inclusion of Sohrawordhi, Alam said he was a capable player with bat and ball. He was someone who had progressed step by step through the development system. Mashrafe makes his return to international cricket after spending seven months recuperating from a knee surgery. Apart from Ashraful, the national selection committee also kept pacers Nazmul Hossain and Shahadat Hossain out of the squad, who were in the squad in recent New Zealand tour. Squad: Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (vice-capt/wk), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Aftab Ahmed, Mahmudullah, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Md Sohrawo
