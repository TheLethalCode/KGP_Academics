<TITLE> England cannot win World Cup without Rooney: Shearer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's chances of winning the World Cup in South Africa are 100 percent reliant on striker Wayne Rooney avoiding injury, former captain Alan Shearer said. Shearer, one of England's most prolific strikers of recent times, believes that without Rooney's goalscoring prowess, it will be impossible for Fabio Capello's team to bring home the trophy for the first time in more than half a century.

"If England don't win the tournament, I'm sure the accusations will fly around but it will be down to lack of ability or bad luck. I don't think what has happened will harm England's chances or affect John Terry's game. "John Terry is still a great leader but England have others in Rio, Steven Gerrard and Rooney. "Besides, there's enough time between now and the World Cup. I can't comment on whether Fabio Capello was right to sack John Terry. What I can say is that the manager will be a big player for England in terms of the group mental
