 TRIPOLI, Feb 22, (bdnews24.com/Rreuters) - Libyan police surrounded the Swiss embassy in Tripoli on Monday after issuing a deadline for Switzerland to hand over two nationals who were sheltering in the building or face retaliation, a Reuters reporter said. The reporter said one of the Swiss businessmen at the centre of the diplomatic row, Rachid Hamdani, came out of the building and was driven away by Libyan officials.

Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa summoned European Union ambassadors on Sunday night to hand them the ultimatum, Jana news agency said. The agency quoted the minister as saying that by giving Goeldi refuge in its embassy in Tripoli, Switzerland was in violation of international conventions on diplomatic immunity. "Procedures will be taken in the event that the embassy does not implement what is required of it by the deadline," the news agency reported. No details were given of what action the Libyan authorities plan to take. Both men have been barred from leaving Libya since July 2008, soon after Swiss police arrested a son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at a luxury lakeside hotel in Geneva and charged him with mistreating two domestic employees. The charges were later dropped and Libyan officials have denied any connection between the arrest in Geneva and the prosecution of the two business
