 Syed Nahas Pasha, London London Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)The number of student visas issued by the UK leapt by more than 30 percent in 2009 compared to the previous year. Home Office figures released Friday also show a record number of migrants became British citizens last year. Britain issued nearly two million visas to foreign nationals in 2009. It was also an increase of 2 percent compared with the previous year. Home office figures released this week show overall number of visas issued was 1,996,500 in 2009 up from 1,954,830 in 2008. Of the 2009 total, 1,718,110 were issued to primary applicants and 278,385 to dependants. The number of student visas issued was 273,610, an increase of 31 per cent compared with 208,800 in 2008. The number of people given citizenship in 2009 jumped by almost 60 per cent to a record 203,865 in comparison to 129,375 the previous year. It is also more than five times the number compared with when Labour came to power in 1997. Back then the figure for the year was 37,000. Overall, 1,530,000 migrants have become British citizens since 1997. According to Home Office officials, the surge in new citizens is because of changes in the law coming into force later this year. Migrants will have to spend a time on probation in future before becoming a citizen. The British government is also proposing to link the granting of citizenship to the awarding of points based on age, educational and other qualifications. The number of asylum applications, excluding dependants is down 6 percent. In 2009, application was 24,250 compared to 25,930 in 2008. Last year 64,750 persons were removed or departed voluntarily from the UK, 5 percent lower than the previous year. Figures show that applications for asylum have dropped in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 4,765 - a 30 percent reduction compared to the same quarter in 2008 and the lowest level since the second quarter of 1992. Decisions on asylum cases have also risen 36 per cent compared to the same quarter in 2008 with the rate of granting asylum falling to 13 per cent. Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said: "Asylum applications for the last three months of 2009 were the lowest since the early 1990's. Net migration is down, and the new UK Border Agency is increasingly successful." "Our border has never been stronger, as shown by the fall in the number of asylum applications. "Our new flexible points based system also gives us greater control over those coming to work or study from outside Europe, ensuring that only those that Britain need can come. "We are making the UK a more hostile place for illegal immigrants by issuing foreign nationals with ID cards, checking those who apply for visas against watch lists and fining those who employ illegal workers."
