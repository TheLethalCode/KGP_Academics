 LONDON, Feb 26, bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Labour party is gaining ground on the Conservatives, and could even win more seats in an election due by June, according to an opinion poll published in the Daily Telegraph on Friday. An Ipsos-MORI poll of those who are definitely going to vote, found support for the Conservatives on 37 percent, while Labour was on 32 percent and 19 percent said they would back the Liberal Democrats. The survey of 1,533 people, carried out between February 19 and 22, gives the Labour party marginally more seats than the Conservatives, although no party would have an overall majority in the Commons. Labour needs a smaller percentage of the national vote than the Conservatives to win an overall parliamentary majority because its vote is concentrated in urban areas, which cover more constituencies. The projections are in line with other recent polls that have cut the Conservative Party's lead, which peaked at 28 points in an Ipsos-MORI poll in September 2008, to as low as 6-7 poi
