 CHENNAI, India, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's president Pratibha Patil and prime minister Manmohan Singh led the accolades to Sachin Tendulkar Thursday, a day after the batsman became the first player to score a double century in one-day international cricket. The 36-year-old, who scored 200 not out to help his side to a 153-run victory over South Africa in Gwalior Wednesday, was also lauded by television channels which ran special programmes while newspapers ran front page stories marking his feat.
