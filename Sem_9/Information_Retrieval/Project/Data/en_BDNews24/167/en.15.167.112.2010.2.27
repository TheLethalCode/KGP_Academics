<TITLE> Govt 'marshalling public opinion' for war crimes trials </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  The 1971 war criminals will be brought to justice in the present tenure of Awami League, which is working to "unify public opinion" ahead of the trials, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Saturday. "The process of war crime trials is set to begin very soon," said Ashraf. "We are now working to unify pro-liberation war forces and marshal countrywide public opinion ahead of the trials," he added. Ashraf said 86 percent of the total population wants trial of war criminals. But he did not disclose the source of the statistic. The minister, also general secretary of Awami League, the party that led Bangladesh to independence, was talking to reporters after an AL central working committee meeting at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, enrolled as a primary member of the Awami League from Rangpur, his home town, on Friday. Asked about the development, Ashraf said, "He is abroad now. He will decide (on his political role) after he returns. But to make him a party member was a long-time demand of the people of Rangpur." The minister was also asked for his comment on widespread allegations of extortion and tender mongering of the pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League activists. "Chhatra League is no more an associate body or wing of the Awami League. Sheikh Hasina is no longer its organisational head. Therefore, we cannot take any direct action against BCL," he said in reply. But, he added, "The prime minister had said no one involved in criminal activities will escape justice no matter which party he supports." Expressing satisfaction over the present law and order situation, Ashraf said: "There is nothing to worry about, though the prime minister has directed the home ministry to further improve the situation." The Awami League has finalised its programmes for March 7, the day of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's historic Paltan speech, his birthday on March 17, Independence Day on March 26, and Mujibnagar Day on April 17 and Pahela Baishakh on April 14, Ashraf and said. bdne
