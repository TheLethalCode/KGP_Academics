 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)Chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim called on lawyers Saturday to stop "dragging out cases". "The court is duty-bound to dispense justice in the shortest period of time; lawyers need to assist that process," he told a workshop at the CIRDAP auditorium in the capital on Saturday. The chief justice said quick verdicts save money for poor plaintiffs, adding: "We must change our mindsets." Lawyers should place arguments honestly for the court to decide on those presentations, he said. The workshop, on mediation mechanisms, was organised by Bangladesh Institute of Legal Advancements (BILA) with lawyers from around the country attending. Mediation encourages both the parties to reach an agreement, not to take revenge, the chief justice said. As a counseling tool, mediation is very effective in reducing the number of cases filed if disputes can be resolved before commencing to trial, he added. Karim spoke in favour of alternative disputes resolution (ADR) as an effective measure for reducing case jams. As of September 2009, there were a total of 1,870,883 cases pending in Bangladesh, from the lower courts up to the Appellate Division, according to data of the Supreme Court registrar's office. Abdul Baset Majumder, vice president of Bangladesh Bar Council, in his speech, expressed concerns that certain negative social traits hinder possibility of mediation. "Here no one keeps their word or listens to others," he said. Also terming most litigation as "politically motivated", the senior lawyer said, "Mediation doesn't work in these cases as both parties have strong backing." "However, mediation can be a very effective means for the poor and in family disputes," he added. He also urged the government to increase its efforts to popularise the idea of mediation among the people. Supreme Court judge, Justice Nizamul Huq, said to reach a settlement should be the goal for all rather than continuing with a case for years. He said mediation was first used in family-related disputes, which has now widened to other issues in villages, municipalities and even in money-loan courts. Another Supreme Court judge, Justice Mohammad Anwarul Haque, asked the government to revive pilot projects to promote ADR, which was first initiated in 12 district-level family courts in 2003, adding that it was "100 percent successful". The pilot projects stopped due to lack of available judges. "As a poor country, the long delay in cases coming to trial is not acceptable," Haque said. "Mediation, as a win-win solution, can serve interests of both sides in easing disputes," Haque said.
