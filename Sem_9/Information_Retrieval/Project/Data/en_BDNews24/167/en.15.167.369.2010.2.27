 AHMEDABAD, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers blasted unbeaten centuries to set up South Africa's 90-run win over India in the third and final one-dayer on Saturday. Stand-in skipper Kallis hit 104 and man of the match De Villiers lashed 102 in 59 balls, his second successive hundred, as the visitors amassed 365 for two after opting to bat first in the day-night game. India, who rested man of the series Sachin Tendulkar and fellow opener Virender Sehwag having taken a winning 2-0 lead in the series, were bowled out for 275. "We know we are a lot better than we have played in the series. If we play to our strength we are a very good one-day side," Kallis said at the prize-giving ceremony. "AB played a really special knock, taking the total from 300 to 360. We will all take a lot with us from here, we will be a lot better cricketers." South Africa openers Loots Bosman (68) and Hashim Amla (87) gave them a solid 113-run start, tearing into an inexperienced Indian pace attack that included debutant Abhimanyu Mithun. Kallis put on 79 for the second wicket with Amla and an unbroken 173 for the third wicket with De Villiers. TWO SIXES All-rounder Kallis reached his century with two consecutive sixes off paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. De Villiers, who scored 114 not out in Gwalior where Tendulkar became the first player to score a double century in one-day internationals, raced to his hundred thanks to a six and four off part-time spinner Rohit Sharma. India lost both openers cheaply before Virat Kohli (57) and Sharma (48) put on 95 for the third wicket. Fast bowler Dale Steyn then dismissed home captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (nine) and Kohli to reduce the hosts to 157 for five, a position from which they were unable to recover. Steyn and medium-pacer Lonwabo Tsotsobe picked up three wickets apiece. "If we had had somebody like Ashish Nehra or Zaheer (Khan in our pace attack) things would have been different," said Dhoni. "The kind of start they got, 340 would have been a decent total to restrict them
