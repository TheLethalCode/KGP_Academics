 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles is set to undergo cosmetic changes with military authority intact. Home affairs secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder told bdnews24.com Wednesday, "The final draft of Border Guard Bangladesh Act will be sent to the cabinet within a week." The new law besides proposing abolition of the rank of deputy assistant director, will also toughen promotion for guardsmen to equivalent positions, which apparently used to be easier before. The draft suggests a new oraganogram abolishing the post of deputy assistant director (DAD), the highest rank among the border guard soldiers apparently because one DAD Tauhid had allegedly led the bloody mutiny on Feb 25-26 last year. The erstwhile BDR is being reconstituted against the backdrop of a bloody rebellion at its Pilkhana headquarters on Feb 25-26 last year, in which about 70 people, including 58 army officers, were killed. Quite like its name that is perceived to have been tainted due to the mutiny, the position of the highest ranking riflesman is also likely to be changed apparently to rid them of the obvious stigma within the armed forces. The Bangladesh Rifles, has a rich history of valour and courage in not only protecting Bangladesh's borders but also for their role in the Liberation War. In fact 2 of the 7 men awarded Bangladesh's highest gallantry award, the Bir Sreshtha, were riflesmen of the then East Pakistan Rifles  lance nayeks Nur Mohammad Sheikh and Munshi Abdur Rauf  besides receiving about 150 more gallantry awards for their role in the 9-month war for freedom. The BDR men have since then defended the country's borders numerous times, often against a larger and better equipped opposition, protecting Bangladesh's sovereignty. The deputy director general of the border guards, brigadier general Md Obaidul Haque told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that there were proposals to change some ranks like assistant directors and deputy assistant directors. He said the new ranks would become harder to attain since promotion to such ranks will have more requisites and conditions attached. "The riflesmen used to get promoted to these ranks before, quite easily. But not any more." The positions would still be filled with guardsmen, as riflesmen filled them before, but they would go through a more rigorous screening process. Once put in force, the current Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) Order and Ordinance would be annulled and the paramilitary force renamed as Border Guards of Bangladesh (BGB). Shikder said the new law has a provision for death penalty for mutiny, or disobedience on the battlefield, for BGB soldiers. Under the BDR Order of 1972, any special court could give sentence of up to 7 years in prison for breaking discipline. A special summary court could give up to 2 year's imprisonment, and a summary court could discharge those found guilty. He said a special BGB court could decide the punishment of any offender on the basis of simple majority of the judges' panel but would require a two-thirds majority in case of death penalty. The act stipulates that photographs and recorded conversation will be taken into cognisance by the special courts as evidence, he added. Shikder said verdicts of BGB court could only be executed if endorsed by the governbment, the force's head or any other authorised official. The ones with the authority to endorse sentences will also be vested with the authority to grant clemency or lighten sentences without any condition and even grant release on parole. Shikder said the proposed law introduced the provision of a new regional headquarters directly under the central Pilkhana headquarters but above the sector headquarters in order to consolidate and further streamline the border guard's command structure. The force is being reformed in line with the suggestions made on May 27 last year by an investigation committee, formed after the rebellion, headed by former secretary Anisuzzman. A committee, headed by the BDR director general Major General Moinul Islam, formulated the draft and submitted it to the home ministry. The force's uniform has already been changed as part of the reforms. BDR succeeded the East Pakistan Rifles after the independence of Bangladesh. b
