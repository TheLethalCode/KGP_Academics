 JUBA, Sudan, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting between armed clan members and soldiers in southern Sudan killed at least 30 people over the weekend, southern army spokesman Kuol Deim Kuol told Reuters. "Seven from the SPLA (southern army) were killed and seven wounded," Kuol said, adding that 16 fighters from the Gok Dinka clan were found dead and at least 30 people were wounded. Seven Gok Dinka civilians were earlier killed by crossfire as armed Gok Dinka tried to raid an army weapons store for guns to retaliate against another clan that had recently raided them. South Sudan is awash with guns after a long civil war that ended with a 2005 north-south peace deal.

After the attempt to seize weapons, the armed Gok Dinka, a sub-clan of the Dinka, the south's largest tribe, carried out a spate of attacks on an army base in Cueibet town, Lakes State, which continued until Sunday. "Yesterday evening it became calm," Kuol said. The store the Gok Dinka tried to raid was full of arms collected during the south's latest forced disarmament exercise, the semi-autonomous government's main solution to inter-tribal fighting. Lakes State's deputy governor David Noc Marial said he had information from police that 24 people had been killed including seven soldiers from the southern army. Southern officials have accused Khartoum of arming militias to provoke conflict and demonstrate that the south cannot govern itself ahead of a 2011 referendum on independence from the north. Others point to poor prospects and poverty among the south's pastoralists and long-standing tribal rivalries. Analysts also say that some southern politicians, trying to beef up local support, may be to blame for some of the fighting. More than 2 million people died, mostly in the war-ravaged south, during the two-decade long war between the Islamic north and the south, where most are Christians or follow traditional religi
