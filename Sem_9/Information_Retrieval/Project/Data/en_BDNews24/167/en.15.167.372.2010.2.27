 Brahmanbaria, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Scores of people were injured in Eid-e-Miladunnabi clashes at Brahmanbaria's Sarail Upazila on Saturday, while a Section 144 was imposed in the district town's Eidgah ground from morning as two rallies were called at the same venue to mark the religious day. At least 50 people were injured in the clashes at Sarail between Ahale Sunnat and local Kawmi madrassa followers. Ahale Sunnat was holding a rally at the local cattle market at around 9am when the Kawmi madrassa followers attacked them, which prompted the clash, Sarail police chief Subhash Chandra Saha told reporters. They also torched the rally venue, he said. Police fired 10 rounds of teargas shells to bring the situation under control, Saha added. Meanwhile, followers of Sunni Andolan and adherents of a local Kawmi madrassa-based movement announced separate rallies starting 9am at the Brahmanbaria town Eidgah. Hamidul Islam, officer-in-charge of Brahmanbaria Sadar Police Station, said the Section 144 clampdown beginning at 8am would remain in force up to midnight to prevent any "unwarranted situation". Extra police have been deployed at different points of the town since Saturday morning, he said. Nur-e-Alam Selim, the district president of Sunni Andolan blamed the Kwami madrassa movement for foiling their rally. No comment was available from Kawmi madrassa-based leaders. bdn
