<TITLE> Dhaka, Delhi to remove 'all trade barriers': finmin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka and Delhi are moving to remove all barriers to mutual trade, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Thursday. Muhith, addressing the opening ceremony of the three-day long India Trade Fair-2010 at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, said that mutual investment too, not only trade, must be a focus to boost regional cooperation in South Asia. This is the first such joint trade fair of the two countries, having been arranged by the India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (IBCCI). Muhith hoped that such initiatives would help to expand ties between the two neighbours. He said that prime ministers of both India and Bangladesh, following Sheikh Hasina's visit to Delhi last month, asked their respective ministers and bureaucrats to "remove all obstructions" to two-way trade. NORTH-EAST 'SO NEAR' Chief minister of India's Meghalaya state, DD Lapang, also present at the opening ceremony, said, "It is a fact that Bangladesh was a part of Ancient, Classical and Colonial India. August 14th 1947 separated them. However, we all know that man-made boundaries cannot separate our bonds." Bangladesh imported products of more than $39.7 million in the 2008-09 fiscal year just from Meghalaya. India's total exports stood at $2.86 billion against Bangladesh's $ 270 million exports the same year. Lapang welcomed the opening of border markets. He also said Meghalaya has lots of minerals such as limestone, coal, clay and granite which Bangladesh can make use of. Earlier this month, however, the Indian Supreme Court issued an order to stop halt limestone mining by French cement giant Lafarge in Meghalaya. The order is expected to hit Bangladesh's Lafarge Surma $255 million state-of-the-art cement plant at Chhatak in Sunamganj district. Regarding the concerns, Lapang said, "We are working on the embargo. But it will be better if talks are arranged at the premier-level." Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Rajeet Mitter said Bangladesh can export products to north-eastern India at much less cost than to the Punjab or Bangalore. He also said the proposed border markets would start operating within the next few months. NANO ON SHOW Meanwhile, Tata's 'Nano', the small car that has caused a sensation in India, will also be show-cased in the fair to judge interest of Bangladeshi buyers, said IBCCI president Abdul Matlub. Matlub, who owns the TATA dealership in Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com, "If we find the demand significant, we'll market the car here. "We're also looking to manufacture 60 percent of the car parts in Bangladesh," he said. The four-seat 624cc small car was first launched commercially in India on Mar 23, 2009. bd
