<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Labour and employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has said that tough action will be taken against those in the management of the Garib Garib Sweater Factory if any negligence was proved in connection with the fire that claimed 21 lives two days ago. The fire broke out at around 9.30pm on Thursday at the sweater factory in Bhogra, Gazipur. The minister, visiting the factory in Gazipur on Saturday, said: "The government will make public the probe report and take actions accordingly." A bdnews24.com team made some startling findings as it probed into the fire. Workers alleged gross negligence by the factory authorities, including poor ventilation, main exits being locked and no proper fire escape. And, according to fire officials, the fire-fighting equipment at the factory was "virtually useless". It was also the second time in just six months that a fire claimed lives in the same factory. Most of the deaths appeared to be caused by toxic smoke coupled with lack of ventilation. The fire had broken out on the first floor of the factory near one of its two stairwells, where there was a large stock of acrylic sweaters, said factory workers. None of the bodies at the morgue bore any burn marks. But there were traces of dark ash around the nostrils and mouths. The labour minister said on Saturday a monitoring cell would be formed with top government officials and local representatives to avoid repetition of such tragic deaths in the industrial zones. The government has already decided to deploy industrial police, he added. Gazipur district authorities formed a three-member probe committee on Friday to investigate the sweater factory fire with Gazipur additional district magistrate Md Hasan Sarwar at its head. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) also formed a nine-member probe committee that started work on Saturday. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedy, who was also present there, said the big industrial zones would be monitored by special cells. Some 18 teams will be formed under safety and compliance laws to monitor the situation, he said. bdn
