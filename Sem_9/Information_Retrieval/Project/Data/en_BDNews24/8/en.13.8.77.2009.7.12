 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh survived a tricky seven-over period before stumps to leave the first Test against a West Indies at Kingstown, St Vincent in the balance on Saturday. By stumps on the third day, the home side's first innings lead of 69 had been cut to 43 with the Tigers on 26 without loss. Tamim Iqbal was batting on 11 and his partner Imrul Kayes 14 respectively. Their determination to see off the West Indies attack typified a spirited day's work at Arnos Vale Ground.

It was a disappointing end to a patient 177-ball stay that included just seven boundaries. Mahmudullah produced a double strike just an over before tea to allow Bangladesh to claw their way back into the game. Skipper Floyd Reifer put on 51 with Dave Bernard but a promising stand was cut short when left-hander Reifer was caught at slip trying to drive the off spinner. Wicketkeeper Chadwick Walton fell to Mahmudullah's next ball, glancing to leg slip. Bernard batted well for his 53, ably supported by Darren Sammy who was another victim of Mahmudullah's shrewd spin, bowled playing down the wrong line, out f
