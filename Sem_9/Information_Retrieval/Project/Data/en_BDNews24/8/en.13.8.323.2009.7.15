 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami will submit their permanent constitutions to the Election Commission by July 25, statements of both parties said on Wednesday. The Jatiya Party, a member of the ruling grand alliance, has formed a 49-member preparation committee ahead of its national council, scheduled for July 24, to approve its permanent constitution, a party press release said. The preparation committee includes presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed, acting party chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud and ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader as convenor. It will hold its first meeting on Thursday, said party officials. Jamaat-e-Islami, an ally of the main opposition BNP, said it was ready to submit its permanent constitution on time. "Our party's constitution is ready and we will submit it to the EC ahead of the July 25 deadline," said party secretary-general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid at a press briefing at the party's central office in Moghbazar. BNP secretary-general Kahandaker Delwar Hossain said Wednesday the main opposition party required five more months to approve their permanent constitution through council, and asked the Election Commission to extend the deadline for submission. The Election Commission amended electoral laws last year to make registration of all political parties mandatory ahead of the general elections, for the first time in Bangladesh. Thirty-nine political parties were registered ahead of last December's elections with draft constitutions. The EC gave them six months from the first day of parliament, which convened on Jan 25 this year, to ratify their permanent constitutions as the final condition of the registration process. bdne
