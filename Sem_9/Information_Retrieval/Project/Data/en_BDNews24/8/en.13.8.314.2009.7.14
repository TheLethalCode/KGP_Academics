 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  While the majority of the cricketing world may choose to undermine Bangladesh's first-ever away Test win on the pretext that it was against a makeshift West Indies side, former Bangladesh captains however hailed the Class of 2009 on their achievement. "It is not a question of whom against Bangladesh played as the result will go down in the record books as a Test win," former national captain Roqibul Hasan told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. "I feel proud as a former cricketer and want to congratulate each and every player." Bangladesh pulled off a 95-run victory against the hosts at St Vincent on Monday. It was also only their second Test success since defeating Zimbabwe by 226 runs at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong on Jan 10, 2005. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) hurriedly assembled a squad after their top players boycotted the Bangladesh series following a contractual dispute. The WICB was also forced to field seven debutants in the side, who provided a stiff challenge to the visitors. Former captain Gazi Ashraf Hossain thought that the Bangladesh players would not feel any pressure had the West Indies' main team played and the triumph was a deserved. "The players were under pressure to succeed against a second-string squad when the WICB failed to persuade their regular players to play. The boys kept their nerve to play consistently and they deserved this victory," said Ashraf, who is also a director of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "It was long overdue for us and we got it," said former captain Habibul Bashar, who led Bangladesh in the first Test win against Zimbabwe. "I have seen the players working very hard to be successful in Test cricket and there is no way to underate this success as they deserved it," said Bangladesh's most successful Test batsman. "Everybody can argue over this victory, but the truth is that Bangladesh won the match beating West Indies," said Bashar adding that it would have been embarrassing had the Tigers went down to this side. Bangladesh have good memories of touring West Indies in 2004 as they pushed the hosts hard and drew the first Test before going down in the second and final Test. "It is a matter of how we won the match playing better rather than with whom we had played and we are successful against the Test squad of West Indies," said former captain Khaled Mashud, who led Bangladesh in their first tour of West Indies.
