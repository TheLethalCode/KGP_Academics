<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Jul 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced several populist measures on Saturday to mark his first 100 days in office, and promised equal opportunities for all under his "1Malaysia" policy. The measures, aimed at "the man on the street", follow a series of announcements made since his appointment in April to attract foreign investment and to help avert the country's first economic contraction in a decade. "I am aware that Malaysians are feeling the impact of the current economic slowdown. My administration is committed to alleviating some of your burden," he told a huge crowd of people who had turned up for the celebration. Among the measures, Najib said pre-paid toll road users would be given a 20 percent discount if they swipe their cards 80 times or more a month, effective Sept. 1. On Friday, sources told Reuters the government was mulling a proposal to cut toll rates to ease growing public complaints about rising charges. Other measures include ensuring rural areas in the east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak have better access to water and electricity, and halving the cost of obtaining licences for small traders operating in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Last month, Najib unveiled a raft of measures to boost investment in the slumping economy, coming close to ending an affirmative action programme for ethnic Malays that critics say has stymied growth. Najib has also attempted to address ethnic and socio-economic issues by introducing an inclusive "1Malaysia" policy to promote improved relations between the majority Malays and ethnic Chinese and Indians
