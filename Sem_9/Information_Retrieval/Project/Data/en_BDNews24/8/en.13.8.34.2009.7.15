<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Wednesday the main opposition party required five more months to approve their permanent constitution through council, and asked the Election Commission to extend the deadline for submission. "We want to reorganise the party through a transparent process and hold an acceptable council, and we need an extension of the deadline to do that," Delwar told reporters at the party office in Naya Paltan. "The Election Commission can extend if they want to," he said. He said a BNP delegation would meet with the EC to discuss the issue, after which the party's standing committee would decide on further steps. Responding to a question, Delwar said the British High Commission in Dhaka had been directly involved in the declaration of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. "The people of the country know that to be true," said Delwar. British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans earlier in the day had said neither his predecessor Anwar Choudhury nor any of the diplomatic corps in Bangladesh had played any role in the '1/11' changeover. Evans also called on the BNP to return to parliament at a news conference at the Dhaka Reporters Unity office. The British envoy had said the UK wanted to see "stronger democratic institutions" in Bangladesh and asked the main opposition BNP to participate in the parliamentary sessions to 'properly challenge the government's policy decisions'. b
