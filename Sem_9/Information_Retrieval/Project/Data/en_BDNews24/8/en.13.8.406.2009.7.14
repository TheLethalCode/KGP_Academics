 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is sticking to its July 25 deadline for political parties to submit their ratified constitutions. Political parties will be issued 'show-cause' notices if they fail to submit their permanent constitutions within the deadline, election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hussain told reporters at his office Tuesday. But chief election commissioner will make a final decision on this issue Thursday after his return from the USA. Sohul said, "The parties have to submit their constitution by July 25 according to the Representation of People Order (RPO), as a condition of registration. The show-cause notice will ask why their registration should not be cancelled if they fail to do so." "There is no scope to violate the election law," the commissioner said. "We will accept any constitution if it is approved by parties' grassroots members," said Sohul. "But why should the matter of extension arise?" The Election Commission amended electoral laws last year to make registration of all political parties mandatory ahead of the general elections, for the first time in Bangladesh. Thirty-nine political parties were registered ahead of last December's elections with draft constitutions. The EC gave them six months from the first day of parliament, which convened on Jan 25 this year, to ratify their permanent constitutions as the final condition of the registration process. Election commissioners, however, had said the EC was open to extension of the deadline if parties applied formally. None of the 39 political parties have done so. On Sunday, election commissioner Sakhawat told reporters said the EC would still recommend to the government that an amendment be enacted to the electoral law if the parties apply for an extension of the submission date. "The EC doesn't enact laws and can't even modify them. The government has to take steps to amend the RPO," he said. The CEC, meanwhile, has been in the USA since June 20 and is expected to return Wednesday. On June 15, in a press conference, Huda said, "The EC will have to issue show-cause notices if the parties fail to submit their permanent constitutions by July 25. But deadline still might be extended if they apply." bdn
