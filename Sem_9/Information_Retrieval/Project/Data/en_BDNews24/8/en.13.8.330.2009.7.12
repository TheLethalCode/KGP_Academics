 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  Three more swine flu cases have been confirmed in Bangladesh, pushing the number of known infections in the country to 21, Mahmudur Rahman, IEDCR director, said Sunday. Rahman told bdnews24.com that the three new cases were confirmed last week in people who had recently arrived from the UK and Canada. Of the 21 cases, 12 have been among women and nine in men, ranging from ages 2 to 46, he said. However, those in the ages 20 to 22 years old have made up the majority of cases. Further, seventeen of the swine flu victims have fully recovered while four are continuing medical treatment, Rahman said. Nine of the cases identified by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research contracted the disease within Bangladesh and all were relatives of those infected people arriving from abroad. Also, the IEDCR said the outbreak of seasonal flu spread at an increasing rate in May. Experts have feared a new flu might create a mixture between seasonal flu and swine flu. However, this fear is diminishing as the outbreak of seasonal flu has, overall, decreased. The World Health Organization declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 1 while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. According to the WHO, approximately 89,000 cases have been detected, to date, in 125 countries worldwide, with 382 recorded fatalities. As a protection measure, incoming international passengers are being screened for symptoms at Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports, Chittagong and Mongla seaports and 11 land ports, reports officials. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the virus. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and to practice regular hand washing to curb the spread of the swine flu virus. bd
