 ST.GEORGE'S, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Bangladesh, fresh from their first overseas Test win, spun their way into a strong position on the first day of the second Test against a makeshift West Indies team in an almost empty stadium on Friday. With captain and seamer Mashrafe Bin Mortaza ruled out with injury, Bangladesh went into the game with three spinners and, after putting in West Indies, the trio collected three wickets each as the hosts were dismissed for 237.

After lunch, West Indies again showed their inability to deal with the slow turning ball  Reifer was trapped leg before to Mahmudullah and then Dave Bernard woefully sliced Shakib to Mohammed Ashraful at point. Enamul Haque Jr, brought in for Mashrafe, had Darren Sammy lbw and then had West Indies keeper Chadwick Walton with the worst shot of the day - a half-hearted mis-timed slog to Ashraful at mid-on. Dowlin got a little support from the tail but then brought a close to the innings, five short of his maiden Test century when he was superbly caught by Tamim Iqbal at cover off Shakib. Bangladesh lost opener Imrul Kayes, caught behind off Darren Sammy, as they moved to 35 for one in the ten over session before the c
