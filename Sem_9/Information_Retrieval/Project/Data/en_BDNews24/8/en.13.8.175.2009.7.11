 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Transparency International Bangladesh trustee Muzaffar Ahmad on Saturday defended the corruption watchdog's Parliament Watch report following remarks by prime minister Sheikh Hasina criticising the report. The TIB in the report published last week said over Tk 5 crore and 24 hours of the House's time were wasted during the first session due to quorum problems. Hasina, in a speech at the conclusion of the House's budget session on Thursday, termed the TIB report "one-sided" and "motivated". Muzaffar, former TIB chairman now a member of TIB's trustee board, told reporters on Saturday, "We think the prime minister's statement is not right." "TIB did not do anything motivated. It only revealed a study," he said. Muzaffar said of the 10 areas parliamentary affairs studied in the report they had criticisms on only two issues  the quorum crisis and standing committee meetings. He said the speaker himself had conceded that parliament sittings began late. "The report that eight parliamentary standing committee meetings were not held was also right," Muzaffar said. He said the organisation was working transparently. The deputy speaker was present at a programme that launched the report, said Muzaffar adding that all the issues were discussed in detail at the programme. Muzaffar had earlier attended a roundtable on 'Accountabilities and responsibilities of the NGOs: Recent experience' organised by Neeti Gobeshana Kendra at the National Press Club. The roundtable recommended an independent NGO Commission to ensure transparency and accountability of non-government organisations. It also recommended taking measures against fake NGOs, updating the existing legal structures and formulating separate laws for profitable schemes including micro credit programmes. b
