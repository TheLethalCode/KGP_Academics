 LONDON, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Marcus North and Brad Haddin recorded centuries during their Ashes debuts on Saturday in a daunting Australia first innings total of 674 for six declared on the fourth day of the first test. Ricky Ponting's declaration in the afternoon session left England needing 239 to make his team bat again. North finished on 125 not out while wicketkeeper Brad Haddin reached 121 before he was caught on the mid-wicket boundary attempting his fourth six. It was the first time Australia have scored four centuries in an Ashes innings following hundreds to Simon Katich (122) and Ponting (150). North, who resumed on 54 overnight, reached his second century in three tests just before the lunch interval. Haddin struck the ball to all parts of the ground, racing to his century from 138 balls. Each of England's five frontline bowlers conceded more than 100 runs.
