 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)--IIndia's BSF chief on Tuesday assured BDR of an end to killings of Bangladeshis on the frontiers. The Border Security Force director general M L Kumawat told a news conference on the concluding day of the three-day talks of the border guards in Dhaka that curfew was imposed in the Indian border areas from evening to dawn and that 85 percent killings took place at night. Major General Mainul Islam, director general of the Bangladesh Rifles, said the most residents of the border areas were innocent. They should be made aware of the curfew. Both the border forces signed a joint declaration before the news briefing after the talks begun on Sunday at Peelkhana, the site of a bloody mutiny in February. They said in the press conference that they had exchanged lists of terrorists, militants and separatists. The BDR chief said he had handed his counterpart a list of 1,227 militants and terrorists detained in Indian jails. The BSF chief, who headed a 18-member team, also handed a list of 77 people. The lists would be sent to the home ministries. United Liberation Front of Asom chairman Raj Khoya, its military chief Paresh Barua, general secretary Anup Chetia, who is currently detained in Bangladesh jail, Deb Borma and Jiban Singh are among the Indian terrorists. The Bangladesh list topped Mursalin and Muttakin, two militants currently detained in a Bihar jail, and Muhibul, Anisul and Jehad. The BDR chief who led a 24-strong delegation at the talks said that a BDR-BSF joint patrol proposed by India was being discussed. Joint patrol does not mean that the border forces will be patrolled together; it can be done by taking positions in the border areas of the respective countries, Mainul explained. It was the first conference on director general level after the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The BSF demanded that Dhaka take back 346 illegal migrants who are on hunger strike demanding repatriation to Bangladesh. Bangladesh has said India must prove their nationalities. The Indian side said all the hunger strikers, captured in the Bay of Bengal near the Andaman-Nicobar Islands earlier this year, spoke Bangla and have been claiming themselves as Bangladeshis. The BDR chief said the home ministry had confirmed only 149 of them as Bangladeshi. b
