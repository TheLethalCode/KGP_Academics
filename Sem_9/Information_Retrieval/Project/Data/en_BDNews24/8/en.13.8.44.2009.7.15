<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 15 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka Stock Exchange has blamed the recent downturn on the market intervention by the central bankan allegation the bank has refuted. DSE president Rakibur Rahman told reporters on Wednesday that the Bangladesh Bank had no business interfering with the market affairs. "The Securities and Exchange Commission is the regulator of the capital market which can intervene if necessary," he told reporters Wednesday. "None should go beyond jurisdiction." The central bank says it is not intervening in the market. "Since Bangladesh Bank is the regulator of banks, it can always ask banks for their stock portfolio details," said deputy governor Murshid Kuli Khan. The central bank had ordered all banks to submit monthly reports on their stock portfolios after a recent DSE investigation found irregularities in share trading. Rahman said that the measure would only stymie the market's growth. According to the central bank circular, banks have to send detailed monthly reports by categories of purchase, mortgage and deposit of stocks within seven days of the next month. The premier bourse authorities found out that two commercial banks recently made hefty profits from trading of certain underperforming scrip. The SEC also launched a probe into the issue.
