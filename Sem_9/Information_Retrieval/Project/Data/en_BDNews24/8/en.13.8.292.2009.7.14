 Feni, July 14 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka-Chittagong highway was closed for over an hour Tuesday when supporters of a local upazila chairman barricaded the road in protest against an attack on him earlier in the day. Supporters of Didarul Kabir Ratan, the Dagonbhuiyan Upazila chairman, blocked the highway from 3pm till 4:30pm leaving thousands of vehicles unable to move on both sides of the road. "Chhatra League activists loyal to former Awami League MP Joynal Hazari orchestrated the attack," Ratan told bdnews24.com following the incident. Ratan said the gang attacked him at around midday on SSK Road in Feni, after which he fled into a nearby branch of the Mercantile Bank seeking safety. The road-block was lifted after Feni deputy police superintendent Syed Abu Sayem promised a full investigation into the matter and prosecution of the guilty parties. "Russel Hazari, general secretary of the dissolved committee of Feni College Chhatra League, has already been arrested in connection with the incident," Ismail Hossain, sub-inspector of Feni Sadr Police Station told bdnews24.com. bdnews24
