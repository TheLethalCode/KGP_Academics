<TITLE> Iran executes Sunni rebels: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Tue Jul 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran hanged some members of a Sunni rebel group in a volatile southeastern area on Tuesday, but they were put to death in prison and not in public as initially planned, the semi-official Fars News Agency said. Fars had reported on Monday that 14 members of Jundollah (God's soldiers) would be executed in a park in the city of Zahedan, including the brother of its leader Abdolmalek Rigi. But Ebrahim Hamidi, who heads the judiciary in Sistan-Baluchestan province, said on Tuesday the executions took place in a jail instead and that Rigi's brother would be put to death later in the week. He did not say how many were hanged. Predominantly Shi'ite Muslim Iran says Jundollah is part of the Sunni Islamist al Qaeda network and backed by the United States, Tehran's arch foe. "This morning the executions of some members of the Jundollah terrorist group ... were carried out in prison," Hamidi told Fars. "The hanging sentence for Abdolhamid Rigi ... will be implemented by the end of the week." "Previously the hanging sentences for these convicts were supposed to be carried out in public, but based on final decisions the sentences were carried out in prison," Hamidi said without giving a reason. Jundollah says it fights for the rights of Iran's minority Sunnis. Most people in Sistan-Baluchestan are Sunni Muslims and ethnic Baluchis. Zahedan is the provincial capital. On Monday, Fars said the Jundollah members sentenced to hang were convicted of mohareb, or one who is waging war against God, and of killing innocent people. It did not mention a mosque bombing in Zahedan which killed 25 people in May. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television had reported that Jundollah claimed the bombing. On May 30, three people convicted of involvement in the mosque bombing were hanged in public. A day later clashes broke out between supporters and opponents of a Sunni cleric in Zahedan and six people died in an arson attack, media reported. Close to Pakistan and Afghanistan, the region has seen frequent clashes between security forces and heavily armed drug smugglers, as well intermittent attacks by Sunni Baluchi rebels. Murder, adultery, rape, armed robbery, apostasy and drug trafficking are all punishable by death in the Islamic state. The European Union earlier this month denounced Iran for a spate of executions, including the hanging of 20 drug traffickers on July 4 in a jail in a city west of Tehran. In late June, hardline cleric Ahmad Khatami called on the judiciary to charge leading "rioters" who took part in last month's post-election street protests as mohareb, a crime punishable by death. The human rights group Amnesty International has listed Iran as the world's second most prolific executioner in 2008 after China, and says Iran executed at least 346 people last
