 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has set July 21 for the next hearing on a petition by state prosecutors for further probe into the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. Speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain set the date on Tuesday. Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, lawyer for accused former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, opposed the prosecution appeal in the hearing. "It is irrational to petition for further probe. The petition was not filed with proper legal procedures," he said. The court on July 1 partially heard the lawyers for another defendant in the case, Arif Hossain Sumon. Sumon's counsel Aminul Goni Tito told the court on that day that the prosecution did not file the petition for further investigation in line with the law. The investigation officer was supposed to petition for further probe, not lawyers, he said. Chief state counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman filed the petition last month. The proceedings of the two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, are running concurrently. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 23 people were killed, including party central leader Ivy Rahman, and scores of people were injured, including Hasina, then the opposition leader, in the deadly grenade attack on Bangabandhu Avenue. CID assistant police superintendent Fazlul Kabir pressed charges in the cases on June 11, 2008. The BNP-led four-party coalition government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the bombing with false witnesses statements. The CID accused 22 people in its charge sheets including BNP leader Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier Maolana Tajuddin alias Taj, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. bdne
