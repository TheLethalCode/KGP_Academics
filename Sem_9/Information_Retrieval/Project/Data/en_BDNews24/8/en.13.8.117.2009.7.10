 July 10 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League is now preparing to hold its national council by the July 25 deadline set by the Election Commission, the ruling party's office secretary said on Friday. The party last week had announced it would ask the EC for six more months as it was unready for holding the council, to approve its final party constitution, within the deadline. "The Awami League is now taking preparations to hold the council within the scheduled time," party secretary Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters told reporters Friday after a presidium meeting at party president Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi office. "All that is needed is being done." Mannan said the party was forming nine district-level organisational committees in preparation for the council and the council date would be agreed at the next meeting of the presidium likely to be held within the week. "The draft constitution that was amended before the elections will be submitted to the Election Commission after a final approval in the council," said Mannan, also the state minister for housing and public works. The party's policymaking presidium on July 4 decided to appeal to the Election Commission for another six months to finalise its party constitution, according to electoral laws. Asked about the request for a time extension, he said, "Now it will be done earlier than planned." He said that a delegation composed of presidium members and others would discuss the issue with the Election Commission on July 16. The delegation would also try to know what the commission was thinking of other political parties' councils for approving their constitutions, he said. According to the Representation of the People Order, amended ahead of the December 2008 elections, all political parties should finalise their constitutions within six months of the new parliament's starting date. The ninth parliament convened on Jan 25. But the Election Commission has said it would allow more time if parties requested. Friday's presidium meeting saw deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury presiding and Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Kazi Zafar Ullah and Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser among those attending. bdnews
