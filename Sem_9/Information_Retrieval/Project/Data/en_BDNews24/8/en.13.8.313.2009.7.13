 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court granted bail to former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu in an assault case on Monday, a day after he was refused bail in the Peelkhana BDR mutiny case. "Despite bail being granted in the case, he [Pintu] is not getting out of jail because of the Peelkhana case," his lawyer, Sanaullah Mia, told bdnews24.com. The assault case was filed against Pintu by the Shahbagh Police Station on November 10, 2008, alleging that he beat one jailer and one jail guard in Dhaka Central Jail. Later, on December 14, he was freed on bail in the case, but he soon faced another arrest warrant for missing an earlier court appearance. On June 2, police arrested Pintu on charges of instigating the border guards' mutiny and assisting the mutineers. At that time, he was also shown arrested again in the assault case. bdnews
