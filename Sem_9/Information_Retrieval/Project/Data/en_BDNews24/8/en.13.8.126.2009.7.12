 Savar, July 12 (bdnews24.com)The trial of those responsible for the BDR massacre will be conducted according to the constitution and existing laws, commerce minister Faruq Khan said on Sunday. "The opposition leaders have made other suggestions," he said, referring to the demand of BNP leader Hafizuddin Ahmed for trial under martial law. Khan urged the opposition, who remained absent during parliament's just-concluded budget session, to propose their suggestions in the House. "The work of reforming BDR is ongoing and the government has finalised a new name and uniform. There is no place for interjecting politics in this respect," he told reporters following the closing ceremony of the 43rd foundation course at Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) at Savar. The minister also said the border force would be modernised. Later, the commerce minister distributed medals and certificates among the trainees. Iqbal Mahmud, establishment ministry secretary, was the special guest. The programme was presided over by Md Delwar Hossain, rector of BPATC.
