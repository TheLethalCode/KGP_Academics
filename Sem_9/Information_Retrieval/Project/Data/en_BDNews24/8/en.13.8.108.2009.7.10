 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain has warned of legal action if the parliamentary enquiry committee's suggestions, which he said were 'without any legal basis', were implemented. "The formation of the parliamentary corruption probe committee is illegal and outside the rules of procedures. Therefore, there is no legal base of the suggestions of this illegal committee," he told reporters at his Armanitola residence on Friday. He demanded that accounts of the money spent on preparing the report be made public. He said the report of the committee was politically biased and the committee itself was formed to harass the main opposition party, the BNP. An all-party parliamentary probe committee, headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, in a 784-page report placed in parliament on Thursday recommended legal actions against former speaker and now BNP MP Jamiruddin Sircar, deputy speaker Akhtar Hamid Siddiqui and Delwar, the former chief whip, for wasting public money during their eighth parliament tenures. It also suggested scrapping Sircar's membership for "misappropriation" of public funds. The report also suggested that they refund the public money they spent in violation of rules. "We have done everything following the code of conduct. The money has been taken according to the law," Delar asserted. "The committee does not have the jurisdiction to strip anyone of their membership of parliament." Sircar on Thursday said the recommendation to strip membership of parliament away from him is "unconstitutional", and that he will take legal action if the recommendation was acted on. Sircar told bdnews24.com after the report was placed, "If the government attempts to implement the committee's recommendation to cancel my membership, I will go to the Supreme Court to seek justice." "I think I will get protection from the court as the judiciary is free now." "Article 66 of the Constitution stipulates the conditions under which an MP is stripped of membership," said Sircar. b
