 TOKYO, Mon Jul 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese consumer confidence improved in June and a measure of companies' capacity utilisation rose for May, indicating the world's second largest economy may be past the worst of its deepest recession since World War Two. But stock and oil markets stumbled, with Japan's Nikkei falling for the ninth straight day on Monday, as concerns about company earnings and the potential for a sustained global economic recovery this year weighed on sentiment. "The market has been too optimistic about a global economic recovery later this year, but that now looks unlikely to happen, so oil prices are languishing," said David Moore, a commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Evidence began emerging around late March that the global recession was starting to bottom out, driving a second-quarter rally in share markets, but weak data in recent weeks has boosted fears that stock prices had run ahead of the prospects of a solid recovery in the second half of this year. Against that backdrop, investors will be focusing on key data and company results due later this week for a read-out on the strength of the world economy and corporate profitability. China, the engine of world growth in recent years, is expected to release second-quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday, making it the first of the world's major economies to report on growth through June. Economists polled by Reuters think China's GDP accelerated to 7.5 percent year-on-year from 6.1 percent in the first quarter. A slew of heavyweight U.S. companies are also due to report this week, including Goldman Sachs and Intel on Tuesday, JP Morgan Chase on Thursday and Bank of America on Friday. There was some positive corporate news on Monday from Dutch conglomerate Philips Electronics, which reported a second-quarter operating profit that beat analyst expectations and said sales might improve in the second half. MARKETS FALL In Japan, the capacity utilisation index rose 8.0 percent in May from a month earlier to 72.6, the third straight monthly gain for the index, which hit a record low level in February. Separately, a survey released by the Cabinet Office showed consumer confidence improved in June, marking the sixth consecutive month of gains for the index. The government kept its assessment unchanged, saying consumer sentiment remained severe but was showing signs of a recovery. But the Nikkei fell 2.6 percent to its lowest close in eight weeks, hurt by growing political uncertainty after news that embattled Prime Minister Taro Aso was set to call a general election for Aug. 30. MSCI's index of shares elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region dropped 2.7 percent. "People are trying to buy some time," said David Barrett-Lennard, a dealer at CMC Markets in Australia. "Markets are looking for companies to release their outlooks in the reporting season." Oil prices fell below $60 a barrel, extending last week's 11 percent slide to languish at a seven-week low, on concerns at the pace of the global recovery. "We believe oil prices will see a further correction to fall to around $55, before it bounces up when confidence on the global economy returns to the market," said Daniel Liu, an energy strategist at MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd. UBS AG was also in focus, after it and the US government asked a federal judge to delay the start of a closely-watched trial, as they seek to resolve their dispute over US demands for the identities of thousands of wealthy Americans suspected of using the Swiss bank to dodge taxes. The request, in a joint court filing, came as the clock ticked down to the trial set for 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) on Monday in Miami, where US authorities had been expected to move forcefully to pry the lid off Switzerland's much-vaunted tradition of bank sec
