 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)None of the country's 39 registered political parties have submitted their permanent constitutions or applied for an extension for the July 25 deadline, election commissioner Sakhawat Hussain said Sunday. Based upon the Representation of the People Order (RPO), there are only 13 days remaining for political parties to submit their permanent constitutions to the Election Commission. Shakhawat said the EC will recommend to the government that an amendment be enacted to the electoral law if the parties apply for a 'logical' extension of the submission date. At his office, Sakhawat told reporters, "The EC doesn't enact laws and can't even modify them. The government has to take steps to amend the RPO." "The EC can only recommend to the government to adopt such an amendment. We'll decide on whether to do this by July 25," he added. The incumbent Election Commission, formed during the last caretaker government, made the registration of all political parties mandatory ahead of the December general elections, for the first time in Bangladesh's history. Many parties sought additional time on the grounds that they needed it to fulfill all conditions for the registration. The commission accordingly registered the parties based upon their draft constitutions and the parties promised to amend their constitutions through later councils. They were given six months from the start of the new parliament, which convened on Jan 25 this year. The Liberal Democratic Party, alone among the registered parties, has informed the EC about approving their permanent constitution, Sakhawat added. The Awami League last month had decided to ask for an extension to amend their constitution. But after a party presidium meeting on July 10, they announced that they were preparing to hold the council by July 25 after all. Besides, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has questioned the validity of the Awami League's latest announcement. Delwar also said his party would talk to the EC about the party council and submitting their constitution. Sakhawat has said, "We expect the parties would help us implement the election law. Decisions will come as a result of applications from the parties and discussions with them. The law might need amendment by ordinance since the current parliament session has ended." Earlier in April, the EC prompted the political parties to submit their permanent constitutions on time. Sakhawat said an extension will even be granted if the submitted 'draft' is approved by the party's central committee as a 'permanent' constitution. The parties will be allowed to send letters informing the EC about approval of their constitution. However, the EC will review whether council and committee elections were held according to rules of the draft constitutions and if the other conditions of registration were fulfilled. NI Khan, the law officer of the commission and joint-secretary, confirmed to bdnews24.com that no registered party has officially submitted a permanent constitution. Awami League and BNP leaders have said they may sit with the EC this week. bdnews2
