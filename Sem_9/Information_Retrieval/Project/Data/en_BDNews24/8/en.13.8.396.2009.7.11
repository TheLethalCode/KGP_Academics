 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Mashrafe Bin Mortaza rescued Bangladesh from the brink of another batting capitulation against a depleted West Indies line-up in the first Test at Kingstown, St Vincent on Friday. The Bangladesh captain skilfully carved 39 off 52 balls to help nudge his side past the 200-run mark after at one stage seeing them slide to 121-6 before lunch on the second day. Mashrafe apart, the tourists' first innings total of 238 all out owed a great deal to contributions from the lower-order led by wicketkeeper-batsman Mashfiqur Rahim, who batted patiently and intelligently for his 36 before being run out and tailender Shahadat Hossain with 33 useful runs. The home side, missing all their first-choice players due to a strike, lost opener Dale Richards leg before to Shakib Al Hasan in the seven overs before the close, ending the day on 17 for one. Even so, the new-look attack had the Tigers on the ropes almost immediately. Resuming on 42 without loss, Bangladesh, who elected bat at the Arnos Vale ground, had added only three runs more when Tamim Iqbal edged paceman Tino Best to Floyd Reifer for 14. Four runs later, Imrul Kayes, batting fluently on 33, then misjudged a Darren Sammy delivery, shouldering arms but was given out lbw as the ball nipped back. And just as the Tigers seemed to have weathered the storm then medium-paceman David Bernard struck twice to remove Raqibul Hasan and Junaed Siddique for 14 and 27 respectively. Former skipper Mohammad Ashraful was expected to carry the fight to the hosts, but he fell cheaply with the score exactly on three figures. Before the teams had a lengthy lunch break due to the rain that allowed only 18.5 overs possible on day one, Shakib Al Hasan departed for 17 off Kemar Roach. The bowler took the only wicket in the second session of the day when play did resume, removing debutant Mahmudullah Riyad for 14 who was caught by Omar Phillips. Mashrafe and Shahadat put on a valuable 35 run partnership for the ninth wicket and even after Roach had the skipper caught behind, for his team's top score of 39, Bangladesh's tail wagged some more. Shahadat was joined by another newcomer Rubel Hossain and they put on 31 for the final wicket to set a respectable first innings total. The former was last man to go attempting a slog-sweep which only resulted in him being caught by the wicketke
