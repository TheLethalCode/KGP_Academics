 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com education correspondent Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The government's draft National Education Policy recommends uniform curricula for public and private universities, sliding scale fees according to students' financial status, and decentralising the National University. The draft policy suggested more emphasis on science, medicine and engineering in the country's higher education institutions. Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, the co-chair of the National Education Policy formulation committee, told bdnews24.com about the draft policy which is due to be finalised on July 21 and submitted by end-August. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid officially announced the formation of the National Education Policy formulation committee, headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury, on April 8. The 16-member committee includes writer-science teacher Dr Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and Kholiquzzaman, who is also the Bangladesh Economic Council chief. Regarding higher education, the committee's draft termed fees in public universities 'too low'. With a view to give more scope for poor students, fees would be determined by a sliding scale according to the financial status of guardians. It also backed provision of low interest bank loans for meritorious students. Regarding the National University, a major player in higher education, the report said its activities are hampered as it has too many responsibilities. The committee recommended urgent steps to establish NU centres in every division with a view to decentralise its activities. The committee said National University legislation points towards decentralisation, which had not been undertaken in past years, although the present government, coming to office in January, has taken initiatives to do so. It also recommended revising the existing private universities law and to establish an accreditation council for control of education quality. These measures are already partially underway. The report said children of the freedom fighters, tribal and other minority communities should continue to be given special assistance in admissions to higher studies. It also recommended the continuation of the existing four-year comprehensive honours course and one-year masters course. bdn
