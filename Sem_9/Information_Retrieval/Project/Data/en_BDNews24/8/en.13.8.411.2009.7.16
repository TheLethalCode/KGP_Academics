<TEXT>
 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Jul 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - On the eve of talks with his Indian counterpart, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said on Wednesday he hoped recent momentum in ties could push the rivals toward "comprehensive engagement". But Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in a comment clearly aimed at Pakistan, told a gathering attended by both leaders in Egypt that the "infrastructure of terrorism" must be dismantled. New Delhi has long called on Islamabad to disarm Pakistan-based militant groups, including one it blames for attacks last November in which gunmen killed at least 166 people in a three-day rampage in Mumbai. "There has recently been some forward movement in our relations with India. We hope to sustain this momentum and move towards comprehensive engagement," Gilani told delegates at a Non-Aligned Movement summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. "We believe durable peace in South Asia is achievable. It will be facilitated by the resolution of all standing disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir," he added, referring to the Himalayan region over which India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. Thursday's meeting will be the third high-level meeting between the two countries since last year's Mumbai attacks derailed any rapprochement. Progress could help improve stability across the region as far as Afghanistan. "NO SAFE HAVEN" But hopes for a thaw have been overshadowed by a row over what India sees as Pakistan's failure to take action against the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group blamed for the assault on Mumbai. "The infrastructure of terrorism must be dismantled and there should be no safe haven for terrorists because they do not represent any cause, group or religion," Singh said in a speech. "Terrorists and those who aid and abet them must be brought to justice," he told presidents and other top officials from the 118-member Non-Aligned grouping. The two states' foreign secretaries, India's Shivshankar Menon and Pakistan's Salman Bashir, met on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. "We do have difficult issues to address. But as far as we (India) are concerned, there's no way but dialogue to take these issues forward," said Menon after Wednesday's talks. India said the Mumbai assault was carried out by Pakistani militants who must have had help from Pakistani security agents. Pakistan has denied any involvement by state agencies and says it will prosecute militants suspected of involvement. Pakistan said at the weekend it had completed its investigation into five suspects and they were expected to be put on trial this week. It handed a fresh dossier on its probe to India on Saturday. Singh, who has said he is willing to meet Pakistan "more than half way" if it cracks down on militants, may be prompted to make a conciliatory gesture ahead of a visit to India by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, starting on Friday. The United States is keenly interested in resumption of talks between the two countries to ease tensions on Pakistan's eastern border with India, so it can focus on fighting Taliban militants on its western border with Afghanistan
