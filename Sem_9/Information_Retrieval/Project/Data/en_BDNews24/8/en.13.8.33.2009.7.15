 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)A senior officer of the Rapid Action Battalion said Wednesday that the ongoing drive against banned Islamist outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh had left the organisation unable operate effectively. "The JMB are trying to organise attacks, but the surveillance activities of RAB, the police and other law enforcers have brought them under control," Maj Sumon Ahmed, acting director of RAB-1, told reporters at his office. RAB arrested four suspected members of JMB from Kanchpur, Mirpur and Jamalpur on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Ahmed said the latest arrests are suspected members of a 'killing squad' previously under the direction of an explosives expert known as 'Bomb Mizan', who was arrested in Mirpur on May 14. RAB also recovered 38 inactive grenade shells, a knife and a quantity of Jihadi literature from the suspects. "During the primary interrogation, the suspects said they were members of a killing squad," said Ahmed. "They said before Mizan was arrested he had given them the grenade shells and asked them to remain at the ready." "They were told that other grenade making materials and a target would be given to them later," said Ahmed. He said they had not provided specific information about any planned attack. The suspected militants have been named as 28-year-old Kari Saidur Rahman, 25-year-old Akkas Ali Akash, 24-year-old Rokonuzzaman and one Saidur Mia. Ahmed also said the recently formed militant group, calling itself 'Islam and Muslim', was likely created following a schism in the JMB. bd
