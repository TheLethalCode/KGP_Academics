 ISLAMABAD, Thu Jul 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top US military officer arrived in Islamabad on Thursday for talks with Pakistani generals, as both sides seek to crank up pressure on Taliban fighters either side of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, had earlier visited Afghanistan, where just halfway through July the death toll for foreign troops in the eight-year-old war already matched the worst monthly total of 46. Mullen was due to meet army chief General Ashfaq Kayani and General Tariq Majid, the chairman of Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff. Within Pakistan's military hierarchy the army chief is the more senior of the two. The visit came a day after al Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahri, in an audio-recording posted on an Islamist website, urged Pakistanis to join a jihad against the United States and its allies within the Pakistani political and military leadership. Pakistan's Western allies were relieved in April when the army went on the offensive against Taliban militants spreading out of their stronghold in Swat valley to another valley just 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Islamabad. The Taliban's increasing boldness, along with a spate of high profile attacks, notably in the eastern city of Lahore, and doubts about the stability of President Asif Ali Zardari's government had heightened worries about the nuclear-armed state. Those fears were underlined by a suicide bomb attack on a bus carrying workers to a nuclear facility in Rawalpindi which killed one person and wounded 29 on July 2. WAZIRISTAN UNCERTAINTIES Mullen was expected visit a camp for some of the 2 million people displaced by the fighting in Swat later on Thursday, though authorities earlier this week began letting families go home. The army is in the final stages of the operation in Swat, and the government has given it orders to mount a campaign against the Taliban redoubt in Waziristan, a remote, mountainous tribal region bordering Afghhanistan. Air strikes and medium range artillery have been used to soften up the defences of Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud, and U.S. drones also have begun targeting Mehsud territory more frequently in recent weeks. Diplomats in Islamabad are speculating whether Pakistan wants to wait for the United States to deploy more troops on the Afghan side of the border before launching an all-out assault on Mehsud. President Barack Obama's administration has made Afghanistan its top military priority. US troop strength there is due to more than double from 32,000 to 68,000 this year, along with 36,000 troops from other Western allies. US officials say Mehsud has trained many of the suicide bombers attacking Western and Afghan forces, while Pakistan blames him for a wave of violence that has engulfed the country since late 2007. Mehsud is accused of being behind the assassination of Zardari's wife, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in December 2007, but the militant leader has denied responsibility and there are several conspiracy theories. The timing of an attack on Mehsud's stronghold has been complicated by Pakistani concern over whether Taliban factions from other tribes in the Waziristan region will come to Mehsud's assistance, or remain focused on fighting Western forces across the border in Afghanistan. Opening a campaign in Waziristan is a different prospect from the one in Swat, where there were around 5,000 militants present, of which only 2,000 were regarded as hard core fighters. Mehsud is reckoned to have between 20,000 to 30,000 fighters, while two other Taliban commanders whose support hangs in the balance have around 5,000 men each, according to an Islamabad-based diplomat with knowledge of military aff
