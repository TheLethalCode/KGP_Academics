<TITLE> Mosaid sues IBM for patent infringement </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TORONTO, Jul 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Patent licensing firm Mosaid Technologies Inc said on Monday it was taking IBM to court for allegedly infringing on six of Mosaid's US patents. Mosaid said the long-running dispute was over IBM's making and selling of microprocessor and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) products. The Ottawa-based company said it was granted the patents on its fundamental dynamic random access memory (DRAM) circuit inventions. "We are taking this action to protect our intellectual property because we have been unable to reach a reasonable settlement with IBM, despite many years of negotiation," John Lindgren, Mosaid's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "We believe that IBM requires a license to our patents for its microprocessor and ASIC products that contain embedded DRAM. Mosaid has licensed virtually 100 percent of the global commodity DRAM industry, including signing patent license agreements covering embedded DRAM products. The value of our patents is internationally recognized." Mosaid filed the suit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware
