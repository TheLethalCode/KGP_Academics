 Khulna, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  Khulna city councillor Shahid Iqbal Bithar was killed by unidentified gunmen in the early hours of Sunday. Forty-eight year-old Bithar, councillor for Khulna's Ward No 24 and Jubo League vice-chairman, was shot on his way home on a motorbike at around 12:30am, said police. "As he reached the city's Metropolitan Clinic intersection, another motorbike came from behind, the assailants fired shots at him and escaped the scene," Khulna Sadar police sub-inspector Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com. Bithar was rushed to nearby Garib-e-Newaz Clinic and transferred to Khulna Medical College Hospital in a critical condition, said Islam. Doctors declared him dead at around 2am, said the sub-inspector. Islam said Bithar may have been killed as he was leading an eviction drive against land grabbers. Bithar was the convener of a recently-formed committee to save 22 canals of the Khulna metropolitan and surrounding area from illegal encroachment. bdnews2
