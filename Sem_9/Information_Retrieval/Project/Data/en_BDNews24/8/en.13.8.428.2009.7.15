 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jul 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority banned Al-Jazeera television from operating in its territory on Wednesday and said it would take legal action over its broadcast of allegations against President Mahmoud Abbas.

Relations between the Palestinian Authority and Al Jazeera grew tense after Hamas Islamists routed Abbas forces in the Gaza Strip two years ago. The channel's correspondents have said that Abbas aides and security officials were inciting against them.
