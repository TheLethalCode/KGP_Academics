 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) The government is working to reduce the intricacies in land administration and management which are prone to corruption, the land minister has said. "The existing land registration system is intricate and corrupt-friendly," Rezaul Karim Hira told a regional consultation on the study titled 'Access to land and natural resources by the rural poor in the select Asian countries' at CIRDAP auditorium on Wednesday. He said the government was working to formulate new rules and regulations to reduce the complications in land administration and management created due to corruption and mismanagement since the British period to the last BNP-led alliance government. Karim said many government lands were gobbled up because of the failure of the past government. Without digital land management it is not possible to realise the dream of a digital Bangladesh by 2021, the minister said. CIRDAP director general Durga Prasad Paudyal and training director SK Singh, among others, spoke. bdne
