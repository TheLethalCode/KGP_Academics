 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)A citizen's group set out on a 400-kilometre march, from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar, on Saturday to protest against proposed leasing of gas and oil blocks in the Bay to foreign companies. The planned four-day march by the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mines, Port and Power, was launched with a starting rally and motorcade at Muktangon in the capital around noon. It is expected to end in the south eastern seaside town of Cox's Bazar on Tuesday. Academic and social activist professor emeritus Serajul Islam Chowdhury, addressing the rally, was optimistic of the march's success. "Foreigners simply want to plunder our resources. We have to raise public opinion against it. This road march will play a very important role," he said. The group, headed by leftist leaders and social activists, along with hundreds of supporters shouting slogans and carrying placards and banners "against foreign companies", arrived in processions from different parts of the city to the starting point at Muktangon. The protestors were also seen carrying placards in protest against India's contentious Tipaimukh Dam. bdn
