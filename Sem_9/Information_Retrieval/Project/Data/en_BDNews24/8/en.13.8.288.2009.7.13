<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Off-spinner Mahmudullah Riyad kept Bangladesh in the hunt with three quick dismissals to leave West Indies reeling at 87-5 in the second session of the final day of the first Test after the visitors set the home side a 277-run chase in St Vincent on Monday. David Bernard was batting on three with Darren Sammy on five. Chandwick Walton was the last wicket to go, trapped leg before by Mahmudullah for 10, with makeshift home side at 82-5 in 28.5 overs. The spinner had earlier caught Travis Dowlin at short leg by Imrul Kayes for a patient 73-ball 19 and trapped Floyd Reifer in front also for the score in his previous over. Opener Dale Richards started aggressively hitting Shahadat Hossain for two fours to pick up 10 runs in the opening over and then switched his assault to Rubel Hossain, who also conceded a boundary off his first delivery. Raqibul Hasan finally had Richards run out with a throw from gully off the first delivery of Shahadat's second over and the opener departed for a nine-ball 19 that included three fours. Omar Phillips, who struck 94 in the first innings, hit the two Bangladesh opening bowlers for a boundary each before stand-in-captain Shakib Al Hasan took the ball to and trapped Phillips leg before off the last delivery, leaving West Indies at 33-2 in seven overs. Phillips made an identical 14 off 20 balls studded with two fours. Earlier, Bangladesh having resumed the day on 321-5 lasted only 15.1 overs to add just 24 runs losing five wickets to finish on 345 all out as Darren Sammy and Kemar Roach shared all five wickets to clean up the tail. Paceman Sammy, who took two wickets on Sunday, caused the main damage sending back Shakib Al Hasan (30) in the fourth over of the day that also ended a 40-run sixth wicket stand with Mushfiqur Rahim and later removed injured Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (nought) and Rubel Hossain (1) to return five for 70. Medium-pacer Roach dismissed Mahmudullah Riyad (8) and overnight batsman Mushfiqur Rahim (37) to raise his tally to three for 67. It was a contrasting show on the final morning after Bangladesh batsmen showed maturity throughout the fourth day. If they were hoping for victory they had to push for quick runs before declaring, but only Shakib Al Hasan showed some urgency while the rest just plodded around. Shakib smashed a four down the ground before swatting a wide delivery from Sammy straight to mid-off. With his exit, all positive intent evaporated from the Bangladesh camp and allowed West Indies to climb all over them. Sammy, who bowled so well without much luck on the fourth morning, helped himself to a five-for with his steady bowling and Roach did his bit to hasten the end. Sammy had Mashrafe, batting with a runner, out flicking straight to backward square leg and trapped Rubel Hossain with a yorker. Roach removed Mahmudullah with a full delivery tailing in to get the lbw decision - the ball appeared to be missing leg stump, though - and bowled Mushfiqur Rahim with a superb inswinging yorker. With Mashrafe unlikely to bowl, it will be a battle between Bangladesh spinners and West Indies batsmen. Mahmudullah, the off-spinner, was the more successful bowler in the first innings as he, unlike Shakib, bowled a tad quicker on this slow track. It will be interesting to see how the two spinners operate in this innings. bd
