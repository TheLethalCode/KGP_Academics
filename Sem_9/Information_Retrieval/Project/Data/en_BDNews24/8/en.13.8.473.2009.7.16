<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh were set to hold their first bilateral talks in Sharm-el-Sheikh Wednesday evening, on the sidelines of the NAM summit, with the backdrop of Bangladesh's concerns over India's planned Tipaimukh dam and maritime boundaries. The meeting between the two prime ministers was scheduled a day after Bangladesh's foreign minister Dipu Moni charged India with being "very aggressive" over sea border claims. Hasina, who arrived in Egypt Wednesday morning, was also expected to raise the trade imbalance that exists between Bangladesh and India with Singh. This will be the first bilateral meet between Hasina, who returned to power in January this year, and Singh, in his second stint as Indian prime minister. Apart from bilateral issues, Hasina is expected to raise terrorism concerns and poverty reduction strategies with South Asian heads of state during the two day NAM summit. Singh himself spoke of the proposed meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the Indian capital before his departure for Egypt, saying, "During my stay in Sharm-el-Sheikh, I look forward to holding bilateral meetings with other leaders, including those of Bangladesh, Egypt, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam". Meanwhile, Dipu Moni, in sideline talks with Indian state minister for external relations Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday, urged New Delhi to change its sea border map immediately to reach an agreement on maritime boundary demarcation between the two nations. Bangladesh and India have overlapping claims on the waters in the Bay of Bengal. At sea border talks with Dhaka, in Delhi in March this year, India claimed a baseline for its sea boundary in such a way that it would make Bangladesh into a sea locked nation. India submitted a map of its sea boundary to the United Nations in May. India's planned Tipaimukh Dam over the cross-border Barak river, in the meantime, has raised environmental concerns for downstream regions, including Bangladesh. The Barak river supplies waters to two rivers in Bangladesh, the Surma and Kushiara, the main sources of water to hundreds of water bodies in Bangladesh's northeastern Sylhet region. India says the project is aimed at generating power and would not divert or hold up water from the river. A Bangladeshi parliamentary delegation is expected to leave on July 29 to inspect the planned dam site in the Indian state of Monipur. NAM summit gets underway The two-day Non-Aligned Movement summit got underway earlier in the day at the Egyptian resort city, with the global economic recession high on the agenda. More than 50 heads of state and government are attending the summit, which was declared open by last year's summit chairperson Cuban president Raul Castro. Castro said the global economic downturn has its origins in wealthy countries and in the disparities that continue to exist in international economic systems. "All countries of the world must find ways to resolve the global economic crisis," Castro told the gathering. "We must streamline the world financial system to take into consideration the needs of developing countries," he said. Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak took over as chairperson of this year's summit, and opened with a call for international solidarity and peace. Mubarak appealed for a more equitable international political, economic and trade system. The NAM grouping has struggled to stay relevant in recent years after its foundation during the Cold War by countries not considering themselves formally aligned with or against any major power bloc in the world. b
