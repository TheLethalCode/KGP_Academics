 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) Youngmen's Club Fakirerpool's hopes of playing in the professional football league was dashed as the Dhaka Senior Division champions failed to produce the necessary documents to the convening committee of B. League on Saturday. The committee headed by BFF vice-president Kazi Nabil Ahmed sat with the high-ups of four clubs Youngmen's Club, Narayanganj Shuktara Jubo Sangsad, Feni Soccer Club and Biyanibazar FC of Sylhet to justify their potential in the third edition of the league to kick off in the middle of November. "Youngmen's Club had only applied for playing in the league, but they failed to place any required documents today (Saturday) to meet the league's criteria. They also told us that they were not fully prepared for the professional football league," said Nabil after the meeting held at BFF House. "However, other three clubs said that they were ready for the B. League and produced all relevant documents we wanted," said Nabil, who is also vice-chairman of the B. League committee. Nabil said that although they had also some negative points, but hoped they would be able to overcome those. "We will further talk to them on Sunday before we take the final decision on them in the adjourned meeting of the B. League, which will resume on Monday," said the BFF vice-president hinting that they might recommend including all three clubs in the upcoming professional league. He informed that Biyanibazar FC had placed a estimated budget of over Tk one crore while Shuktara Jubo Sangsad and Feni Soccer Club had shown estimated budget of over Tk 70 lakh for the B. League. The committee has basically enquired whether the newcomers would be able to run their respective sides for seven to eight months as they play in the district league for one to two months in a season. It also scrutinised the clubs' infrastructure, financial condition, venue conditions, organising capacity, transport and accommodation facilities. bd
