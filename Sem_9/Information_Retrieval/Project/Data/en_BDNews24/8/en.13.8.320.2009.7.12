 BEIRUT, Jul 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new US administration has deluded Arabs and Muslims into believing it would chart a course away from the policies of the Bush era, one of the leading religious authorities in Shi'ite Islam said. Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who spoke earlier this year of the "sincerity" of US President Barack Obama's message to the Muslim world, criticised US policies across the Middle East and in Afghanistan and urged Arabs and Muslims to forget the US president's "foggy" words.

He gave a speech in Turkey in April, saying the United States was not at war with Islam, and another in Egypt in June, saying he sought "a new beginning" between his country and Muslims. In an interview with Reuters after the Turkey speech, Fadlallah said Obama "did not lack sincerity in what he is saying about Islam" and appeared to be a man of "human values". But he said Obama would be judged by his actions. In his statement, Fadlallah called on Arabs and Muslims "to forget the gentle or foggy words which the American presidential speech contained" and to "begin real preparation to confront the coming period, which might be the most difficult of peri
