 LONDON, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool have signed 18-year-old French left-back Chris Mavinga from Paris St Germain, while Moroccan winger Nabil El Zhar has agreed a contract extension with the Premier League club. Mavinga is a French Under-18 international and follows in the footsteps of striker David Ngog, who joined Liverpool from PSG last year. Liverpool also said on their website (www.liverpoolfc.tv.com) on Saturday that El Zhar, 22, had signed a new contract that would keep him at Anfield until 2012. He made 19 appearances last season, mainly as a late substitute, and follows Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt, Yossi Benayoun and Daniel Agger in committing his long-term future to the club.
