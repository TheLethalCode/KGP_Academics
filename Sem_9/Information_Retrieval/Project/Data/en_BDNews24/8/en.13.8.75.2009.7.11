 Sirajganj, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  The director general of the Water Development Board has blamed design or construction flaws for a massive breach in the Sirajganj flood protection barrier, while locals have accused the WDB of not maintaining essential repairs. He said damage to the structure could amount to Tk 332 crore. "May be there were flaws in the design or in the construction by the Korean company Hyundai," Md Abul Kalam Azad, director general of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, said on Saturday. "Or the violent current of the risen Jamuna river removed the concrete blocks or sand bags under the embankment," he said. The rain-swollen Jamuna, pushing heavily against its banks, started eating into the Sirajganj town protection embankment on Friday morning. From around 10am, about 600 feet along the 'hard point' of the embankment at Shashan Goila Ghat area, just two kilometres away from the district township, began rupturing at an alarming rate. Assisted by the local administration, the Water Development Board employees and locals dumped sand filled bags and concrete blocks to reinforce the embankment and stop further wear. Residents of Shashan Goila Ghat area, meanwhile, started dismantling and moving their movables including homes to safer zones. The locals accused the WDB of not undertaking essential repairs of vulnerable stretches of the flood protection barrier in time. An angry mob vandalised two WDB vehicles on Friday. Aminul Islam, WDB executive engineer for the district, faced the wrath of the people when he visited the area in the morning. Jamuna Bridge also 'at risk' Meanwhile, WDB chief Azad warned on Saturday the Jamuna Bridge was also under threat from the heavily rain-fed river. Visiting the site of the breached section of the flood barrier, he said, "The current and characteristics of the Jamuna river are quite unpredictable." "A 'hundred-year guaranteed' embankment has been breached at one of its strongest points," said Azad. "The guide embankment of the Jamuna Bridge is also under threat. The west bank of the bridge is at great risk." "The bridge will be out of action if the guide embankment is breached," he said. Aminul Islam said a 2.5 km long permanent embankment between Ranigram of Sirajganj Sadar Upazila to Moti Shaheber Ghat was built after the construction of Jamuna Bridge. But another 7.5 km from Moti Shaheber Ghat to the bridge's west bank guide embankment was left unprotected. "This part now at risk of erosion threatens to undermine the bridge's guide embankment," he said. bdne
