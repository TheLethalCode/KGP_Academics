 WASHINGTON, Tue Jul 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama indicated to Jewish-American leaders on Monday that the United States and Israel are making progress in bridging their differences on the issue of Jewish settlements. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have differed sharply on Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank. The United States wants a complete halt to settlement construction, a demand that has opened the most serious rift in US-Israeli relations in a decade. Israel has raised the possibility it might temporarily refrain from starting new building projects -- while continuing many under way -- in return for steps toward a regional peace agreement, including progress on Arab states normalizing relations with Israel.

He said members of the group urged Obama to visit Israel. Rabbi Steven Wernick, executive vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, said Obama stressed that he was also pressing the Palestinians to take steps necessary for peace. A spokesman for Stephen Savitsky, president of the Orthodox Union, said there was concern about what appeared to be one-sided pressure on Israel. The spokesman said Obama indicated that he intends in coming weeks to make more public what is being done to nudge the Palestinians as well. A White House statement said Obama "reiterated his unshakable commitment to Israel's security, and reiterated his commitment to working to achieve Middle East pe
