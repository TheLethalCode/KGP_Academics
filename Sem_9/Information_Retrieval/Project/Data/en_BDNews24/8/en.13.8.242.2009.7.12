 Barisal, July 11 (bdnews24.com)Twelve students were injured when a portion of a roof collapsed at Gerakul Government Primary School in Gouronadi, Barisal, on Saturday, just a week after a similar incident at a primary school in Old Dhaka. Two teachers were also hurt, said school officials. All the injured were admitted to the upazila health complex. Head mistress Nazma Begum told bdnews24.com, "Although the school building was built in 1995, it is now in a very bad condition." "We have long informed local authorities that the building is risky. We also applied for renovation funds, but all efforts have been fruitless." Upazila executive engineer Abul Monsur told bdnews24.com, "The district education and engineering departments were informed about the building in early February, when it was declared dangerous." Seven students were injured in a similar roof collapse incident at a primary school in the Tantibazar area of old Dhaka last week. The education minister directed officials of the ministry to carry out checks and submit reports on all old primary school buildings in the country. bdne
