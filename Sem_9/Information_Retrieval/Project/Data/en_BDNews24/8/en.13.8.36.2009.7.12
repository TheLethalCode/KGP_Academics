 Dhaka, Jul 12 (bdnews24.com)Markets closed mixed on the opening day of the week, with gainers almost matching losers on the country's twin bourses. Market observers said the day's trends showed no specific sector significantly ahead. "Shares both rose and fell due to profit-taking and buying on the basis of favourable prices," said investment consultant Bashir Ahmed. Banks, the market drivers, maintained their reduced pacewhich resulted in the markets' slight depression, he said. "Banks hold more than 50 percent of market capitalisation, so they obviously have an impact on the day's trends," said Ahmed, who works with brokerage firm Stock & Bond. Meanwhile, the day turned out well for non-bank financial institutions. Power shares remained almost steady, while most fuel and energy shares surged, except Titas gas, which lost on profit taking following gains over the last two days. ICT and mutual funds closed mixed, with insurers continuing their decline. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark lost 2 points, while the Chittagong Stock Exchange's key index dropped more than 150 points. Blue-chip shares on the bourses rose significantly. Analysts termed the day's trading as 'balanced'. "Index movement was quite edgy, with frequent rises and falls, but the market was balanced by both buying and selling," said Salahuddin Ahmed, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, turnovers witnessed a marginal increase from the previous day. Turnover on the country's premier bourse rose slightly to Tk 7.30 billion, from Thursday's Tk 7.12 billion.

The blue chip DSE-20 rose 23.21 points, or 0.15 percent, to end on 2353.84. Of the scrips traded, 123 gained, 109 lost and two remained unchanged.
