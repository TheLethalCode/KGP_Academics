<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  In a rare exhibition of batting excellence, Bangladesh set themselves up nicely to at least draw, if not, win the first Test against West Indies after completely outplaying the home side on the fourth day at Kingstown, St Vincent on Sunday. The architect behind the tourists manoeuvring the total  321-5 at stumps, which gave the Tigers a lead of 252, was opener Tamim Iqbal who scored a maiden Test century. Captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza will be hoping to extend the lead beyond 300 when Mushfiqur Rahim (28) and vice-captain Shakib Al Hasan (26) resume the battle on Monday.

Tamim, who comes from a cricketing family, followed in the footsteps of his older brother Nafees Iqbal, who hit a century against Zimbabwe in 2005. He was involved in a second wicket stand of 146 with Junaed Siddique who made a career-best 78. They pushed the score from 82 for one when fellow opener Imrul Kayes fell before lunch for 26. Tamim reached the landmark after being dropped twice either side of lunch pushing the ball between point and cover off Ryan Austin with the score on 176-1. His marathon knock eventually ended as he tried to smash David Bernard for consecutive fours but holed out to Travis Dowlin. Bangladesh were 228-1 at that stage. The 243-ball stay at the crease was studded with 17 fours. His dismissal slowed Bangladesh's momentum as they lost some quick wickets, but the damage had been done at the Arnos Vale Ground. Bangladesh scored 238 all out in their first innings and then dismissed the hosts for
