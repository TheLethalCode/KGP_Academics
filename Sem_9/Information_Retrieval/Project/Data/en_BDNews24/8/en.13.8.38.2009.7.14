 COLOMBO, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fawad Alam and Younus Khan shared a record 200-run partnership to guide a dominant Pakistan to 294 for two at lunch on the third day of the second test against Sri Lanka Tuesday. At the interval, Pakistan had extended their lead to 144, leaving the hosts with the prospect of a difficult last-innings run chase just 24 hours after Sri Lanka had appeared in complete control of the contest. Resuming on 178-1, the second wicket pair frustrated Sri Lanka's bowlers during the third morning, continuing a remarkable fightback that has put the tourists firmly on top despite being dismissed for a woeful 90 in the first innings. The partnership was a second-wicket record at the P Sara Oval, adding 17 runs to the 183 compiled by Australia's Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer against Pakistan seven years ago in a rescheduled test due to security concerns. Alam, playing as a makeshift opener on his debut, extended his overnight score to 164 not out from 240 balls with 14 fours and one six. The 23-year-old is the first batsmen from his country to score a century on debut in an overseas test and also owns the highest score by a Pakistan batsman in Sri Lanka, overtaking the 155 made by Salim Malik in 1997. Skipper Younus provided excellent support with 82 from 152 balls with seven boundaries. Sri Lanka did finally make a breakthrough shortly before lunch when Younus was caught playing an ugly premeditated reverse sweep off a low full toss from part-time spinner Tharanga Paranavitana. Sri Lanka won the first test in Galle by 50 runs.
