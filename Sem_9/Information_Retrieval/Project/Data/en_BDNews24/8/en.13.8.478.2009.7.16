 NEW YORK, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  David Beckham says he expects to find another half-year loan deal ahead of the World Cup next year to keep himself in England manager Fabio Capello's plans for the tournament in South Africa. Beckham spent the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season -- and the first part of this current season -- on loan at AC Milan in Italy and said he hoped to find a similar arrangement next year. "Leading up to the World Cup, the England manager has made it very clear to me that I need to be playing at a European level," Beckham told reporters ahead of his return match for LA Galaxy against rivals New York Red Bulls. "So I will do everything possible... I'll always regret it if I didn't do everything and to give myself a chance to be involved in that. "At the moment my priority is the rest of the season and also playing and keeping in every squad for England and representing my country... Going forward of course I want to be involved in the World Cup, I've not hidden that fact." Beckham's extended loan with Milan upset many at the Galaxy, with resentment spilling over into a public spat with team-mate Landon Donovan who questioned his commitment to the team. The pair have said their differences are water under the bridge, but the prospect of Beckham not starting next season with the team he is contracted to is unlikely to win over sceptical fans. COACH UNCONCERNED Galaxy coach Bruce Arena, however, said he was unconcerned about any disruption that might be caused by Beckham's movements.

And we were fully in agreement with it and signed off on it. We knew the pros and cons attributed with David leaving on loan," he said. "I've had a great 30 years coaching. This is a high point. Not a low point. It's fabulous to have a player of this calibre on our squad. I look forward to working with David the remainder of the season." Beckham, who previously stated he would like another stint with Milan, said re-joining the Serie A club would by no means lead to a place in the World Cup squad, were England to qualify. "At the moment all I'm concentrating on is being part of this team (L.A) and being successful with this team. Once the season is over, then I will decide and decide what I do from then on." Beckham said a six-month deal was necessary to be in top shape for selection, rather than a shorter January-to-March deal that would fit in the MLS off-season. "I think it would have to be (six months), obviously, leading up to the World Cup. But with the last loan, it worked out pretty well," he said. "I'm not going to sit here and say it was ideal and it was perfect, because at the end of the day it was great for mys
