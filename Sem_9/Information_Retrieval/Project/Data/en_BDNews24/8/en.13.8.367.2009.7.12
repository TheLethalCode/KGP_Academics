<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has deferred a hearing on a petition by state prosecutors for further probe into the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, as defence lawyers sought more time. Speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain set July 14 for the next hearing after lawyers for accused BNP former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu told the court for a second time this month that they were not ready to proceed. Pintu's lawyers had previously asked for more time on July 1, as the court held a partial hearing of lawyers for co-accused Arif Hossain Sumon. Sumon's counsel Aminul Goni Tito told the court on that day that the prosecution did not file the petition for further investigation in line with the law. The investigation officer was supposed to petition for further probe, not lawyers, he said. Chief state counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman filed the petition last month. The proceedings of the two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, are running concurrently. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 23 people were killed, including party central leader Ivy Rahman, and scores of people were injured, including the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, in the deadly grenade attack on Bangabandhu Avenue. CID assistant police superintendent Fazlul Kabir pressed charges in the cases on June 11, 2008. The BNP-led four-party coalition government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the bombing with false witnesses statements. The CID accused 22 people in its charge sheets including BNP leader Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier Maolana Tajuddin alias Taj, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. bdne
