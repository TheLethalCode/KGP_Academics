<TITLE> Australia seek to force win in first test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CARDIFF, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia seized the initiative in the opening Ashes test against England on Friday with some resourceful batting which put them in an excellent position to force a result over the remaining two days. Floodlights shone for the first time in a British test after a two-hour rain break and at the end of the day Australia held a first innings lead of 44 with five wickets in hand. The determination in the Australian camp shone through after Simon Katich (122) and captain Ricky Ponting (150) had ground out a second wicket partnership of 239 runs. Michael Clarke, Ponting's designated successor, played a series of delightful drives, including a lofted six over long-off, to reach 83 before he was caught behind attempting an injudicious hook after the rain break. He was complemented by Marcus North, who has improved his skills at five different English counties and who batted with cool professionalism to reach 54 not out. Clarke was not in the least bit downcast after failing to reach a maiden test century in Britain and instead enthused about his team's prospects of taking a 1-0 series lead. "For the team I would have liked to be out there for the end of the day's play but more than the amount of runs I was just disappointed to get out like that," he said. "Hopefully the rain will stay away tomorrow and we can continue batting and put the pressure back on England. "If the rain stays away we can get a result, if we can make another 100 or 150 runs I think that wicket on day five is going to continue to spin. "I think the bounce is going to be a little bit more inconsistent. Tomorrow is pretty important for us." Clarke will be one of three backup spinners for Nathan Hauritz, whose off-spin bowling in England's first innings 435 was superior to that of England's Graeme Swann, who conceded 86 runs from 28 fruitless overs. He said he would be practising before the start of play on Saturday along with North and Katich. "If we can get some more runs tomorrow then Nathan Hauritz and all the part-time spinners will definitely play a big part in those conditions," he said. "Hauritz bowled much slower than the England spinners and generally got a lot more spin and a lot more bounce. I do believe there is a lot of spin there in the right areas."
