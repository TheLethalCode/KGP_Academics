 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League will hold national council on July 24, party spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said on Monday. The council will take place a day before the July 25 deadline set by the Election Commission. The decision came from consecutive meetings of the sub-committee on draft constitution and declaration and the party presidium, both presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina at her party office in Dhanmondi. The meetings started at 5:30pm. The party last week had announced that it would ask the EC for six more months as it was unready for holding the council, to approve its final party constitution, within the deadline. On July 10, office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan said that the national council will be held before July 25. The party had earlier announced it would ask the EC for six more months as it was unready for holding the council, to approve its final party constitution, within the deadline. According to the Representation of the People Order, amended ahead of the December 2008 elections, all political parties should finalise their constitutions within six months of the new parliament's starting date. The submission of the constitution is mandatory for registration with the commission. The ninth parliament convened on Jan 25. But the Election Commission has said it would allow more time if parties requested. The RPO, amended twice, gave way to new electoral laws that say a political party will not qualify for registration if any discrimination regarding religion, race, caste, language or sex is apparent in its constitution, or if it threatens to destroy communal harmony or lead the country to territorial disintegration. The new law makes it mandatory for political parties to elect members of committees at all levels, including members of the central committee. It also enforces provisions in a party's constitution for fixing the goal of reserving at least 33 percent of all committee positions for women and successively achieving this goal by the year 2020. b
