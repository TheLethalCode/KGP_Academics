 MILAN, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pavel Nedved will not sign for Inter Milan or join the coaching staff at former side Juventus, the Czech winger said on Sunday. The 36-year-old quit Juve at the end of last season and hinted he was retiring but champions Inter have been trying to persuade him to make a shock move to the San Siro. "I cannot wear a different jersey to Juve's but I don't see myself working with this particular Juve group," he told Sunday's Gazzetta Sportiva, which said the 2003 European player of the year could end up playing in the United States.
