<TITLE> UK accused of breaking climate fund pledge: report </TITLE>

 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)The British government's offer of a fund to help victims of global warming in Bangladesh could break a promise to supply climate funds on top of existing overseas aid, the Guardian reported on Monday. The newspaper said the climate fund pledged by the UK government would be extracted from existing budgets inside the Department for International Development (DfID). Bangladesh's state minister for environment Mostafizur Rahman told parliament last month the UK had pledged $150 million to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund to be formed by Bangladesh to cope with the effects of climate change. He said formation of the fund was now at the final stage with countries and donor agencies promising the government necessary financial assistance. British prime minister Gordon Brown last month had called on rich nations to pledge up to $100bn each year to help the developing world cope with climate change, stressing that such funding should be on top of development spending, said the Guardian. Brown said the UK would contribute its "fair share to climate financing separately from and additional to our promises on aid". "The UK is very good at double counting. Although the money is new in the sense that this is the first time that money has been allocated for climate change, it's not new aid money," Saleemul Huq, senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, told the Guardian. The Guardian also said millions of pounds of the fund would not go to its intended recipients, but be "executed by the World Bank, as administrator". The World Bank will receive 4.9m of the fund to cover costs of administration, project appraisal and a management team in the bank's Dhaka office, according to a leaked document quoted by the paper. UK development charities said they were unhappy about the role of the World Bank in the multi-donor fund. Daleep Mukarji, director of Christian Aid, said he was "appalled by the prospect of the World Bank diverting more than $8m from a fund created to help Bangladesh". He told the British newspaper: "The money is urgently needed by poor people struggling with devastating cyclones, flooding and rising sea levels. For it to be devoted to the expensive administration services of the World Bank, even in Dhaka, would be scandalous." A DfID spokesman confirmed that the 60m Britain would pay into the fund was from existing aid budgets. He told the Guardian: "I can't see that this contradicts anything that the prime minister said." Brown said that, while the bulk of climate finance should be additional money, some 10% could come from within existing commitments. Climate change threatens Bangladesh with rising sea levels and more devastating disasters such as cyclones. A sea level rise of just a few feet could inundate a fifth of the country, destroying crops and livestock and leave some 30 million people homel
