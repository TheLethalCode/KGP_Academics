<TITLE> Govt to introduce farmers database: Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kurigram, July 11 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury said Saturday that the government is planning to introduce a comprehensive database containing all relevant information on the nation's farmers. She said the database would play a major role to make the country self sufficient in food production. "The government believes in transparency and accountability." "The new initiative is designed to reduce corruption in the sector," Motia said at a government food security programme in Kurigram to distribute agricultural equipment, fertiliser and seeds to marginal farmers affected by recent flooding. The distribution programme received financial assistance from the Islamic Development Bank. Motia criticised donor agencies for their promotion of deep tube wells, which she said posed health risks, including the possibility of arsenic poisoning. The Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation has initiated a 400 crore project to dig canals to ensure uncontaminated sources of water for the population, she said. Motia said fertiliser subsidies had been fixed at 50 percent, although the price of urea would not be subsidised until new gas fields were more fully exploited. Concluding her tour in Bogra in the afternoon, Motia told a meeting in the circuit house that the government was planning to construct more grain silos to mitigate grain storage shortfalls in the country. She said the government could not meet its rice collection targets, even though it had sufficient funds, due to the lack of silos as most of the storage facilities dated back to British times. "We have storage silos with capacities to meet the demands of only seven and half crore people, and most of those are unusable," said Motia. Motia, meeting with agricultural officers in Rangpur on Friday, had said the agricultural extension division had withered during the tenures of the BNP-led alliance and caretaker administration. "There was no monitoring during those periods, but steps have now been taken to reactivate the division," said Motia. She said the government would not tolerate any irregularities with the fertiliser distribution programme. bdne
