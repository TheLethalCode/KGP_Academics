 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)Patuaria and Daulatdia piers on Friday experienced severe traffic gridlock due to shortage of ferries, reduced navigability and strong currents, BIWTC officials said. Long tailbacks of more than 1000 vehicles hit the piers as it took more time to ferry vehicles, causing immense public sufferings, said Arpan Kumar Chandra, BIWTC assistant manager at Daulatdia pier office. A few hundred vehicles in Daulatdia were awaiting to be ferried, he added. The Manikganj correspondent said he saw around one-kilometre gridlock of a few hundred cargo trucks in Paturia at around 6:30pm.
