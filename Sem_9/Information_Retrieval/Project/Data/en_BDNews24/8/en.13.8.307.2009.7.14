<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman has appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division, raising to 11 the total number of judges in the highest appeals court hamstrung by the shortage. The new judges, who were the most senior at the High Court, are justices BK Das, ABM Khairul Haque, Mohammed Muzammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha. Their appointment, believed to expedite the resolution of several important cases, will come into force from the day they are sworn in to office. Law minister Shafique Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the long-drawn trial of the assissination of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman could now come to a conclusion with the latest appointments. The appointments were made under article 94 (2) of the constitution. The seven other justices of the appellate are chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim, Mohammad Tafazzal Islam, Mohammad Jainul Abedin, Mohammad Abdul Matin, Shah Abu Naim Mominur Rahman and Mohammad Abdul Aziz. After the Awami League-led grand alliance took office, the law minister had talked of the government's initiatives to settle the Bangabandhu murder case. Last week he said the final hearing of the case can be resumed after the appointment of the new judges. Due to a lack of sufficient justices, hearing of the regular appeal by the five convicts has been stalled for more than a year. The rules of the Supreme Court stipulate that a bench made of three judges from the Appellate Division can hear an appeal. Then again, a judge who had heard the case in the High Court cannot hear it any more in the Appellate Division. The administration headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib, had appointed two judges immediately after assuming office. The law minister had said that the office of the attorney general would be told to take initiatives to resume the case proceedings once the new judges were appointed. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president, was killed along with most of his family members on Aug. 15, 1975 in a military putsch. Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case, naming 20 as accused with Dhanmondi Police Station on Oct. 2, 1996, 21 years after the carnage. On Nov. 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul handed down death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused. High Court stayed the verdict as appeals were submitted. bdnew
