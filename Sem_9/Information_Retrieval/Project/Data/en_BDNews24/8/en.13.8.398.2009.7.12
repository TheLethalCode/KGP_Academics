 Dhaka, Jul 12 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court in a notice on Sunday asked former army chief Moeen U Ahmed why his Baridhara house should not be attached by authorities as security in a Tk 100 crore defamation suit filed by former BNP state minister for power Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku. Judge Saiful Islam of the Third Joint District Judge's Court in Dhaka asked Moeen to appear before it on Aug 16 to reply to the notice. The court rejected a plea by Tuku's lawyers for an interim ban on sale of the valuable Baridhara property. Tuku's lawyers Moudud Ahmed and Mahbubuddin Khokan had earlier filed the case, with the court, claiming Tk 100 crore in damages for defamation and requesting authorities to impound the Baridhara house. The case says Moeen on Mar 27, 2007 at a tea party in honour of the Freedom Fighters Contingent and in the presence of members of the media reportedly accused politicians of the past BNP government of massive corruption. The former army chief was quoted at the time as saying that a whopping Tk 20,000 crore was smuggled out of the country from the power sector alone. In the hearing, Moudud said General Moeen humiliated Tuku by giving false statement publicly. Moudud said during the caretaker government an anticorruption drive was conducted against the politicians. Many of them were arrested without any investigation and tortured physically and mentally. General Moeen was the instigator of these activities and now he fled the country, Moudud added. General Moeen retired on June 15 this year and, according to newspaper reports, left for the US last week with wife Nazneen Moeen. He was appointed as army chief in 2005 and promoted to the rank of general on May 24, 2007, under the 2007-2008 military-installed caretaker government. It is widely speculated that the armed forces led by Moeen played a major role during the clampdown of emergency on Jan 11, 2007, and the subsequent two-year caretaker government regime. Tuku, wife Rumana Mahmud and their two children were sent to jail on graft charges during that period. Convicted in a corruption case and facing a 10-year sentence, Tuku has since secured bail from the High Court, but could not run in the general election last year because of his conviction. Instead, Rumana won the Sirajganj-2 seat in the December polls and is now a BNP MP. The case statement said General Moeen's allegation of power ministry's Tk 20,000 smuggling was false and baseless, as the total budget for five years in the sector during the BNP-led four-party coalition government was around Tk 13,500 crore. The incumbent state minister for power in parliament also said that the four-party government's total budget in the power sector was Tk 13,500 crore, it said. Moeen's statement has damaged the reputation of Tuku at home and abroad, as the responsibility of alleged power sector money smuggling fell upon him as the state minister for power. The break-up of Tk 100 crore sought in damages in the suit is Tk 20 crore for his tarnishing his political image, Tk 20 crore for spoiling his family's image, Tk 40 crore for direct losses his business incurred and a further Tk 20 crore for the loss of goodwill his business suffered. On being freed from jail on bail, Tuku had been staying abroad for treatment, which is why he could not file the case timely, the case statement added. bdnews24.
