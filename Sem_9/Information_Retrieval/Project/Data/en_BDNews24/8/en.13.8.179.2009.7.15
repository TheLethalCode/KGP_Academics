 Aminul Islam Khan Rana Sirajganj correspondent Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The executive engineer of Sirajganj Water Development Board's BRE (Brahmaputra Right Embankment) department was relieved of active duty on Wednesday in the wake of last week's breach of the flood embankment under his charge. According to, executive engineer Md. Aminul Islam has been made officer on special duty and attached to the additional director general-2 with an order from the Bangladesh Water Development Board's office. WDB sources said Islam was transferred after a primary investigation pointed to "negligence" by the WDB's BRE officials for the 600-foot breach of the Sirajganj town flood barrier's Hard-Point. The Pirojpur executive engineer Md. Abdul Malek is supposed to be transferred to the vacant Sirajganj post within a couple days. Md. Aminul Islam acknowledged his transfer as OSD, but said, "It is an injustice as the Hyundai company is the one responsible for such sudden breach of the Sirajganj Flood Protection Embankment." The Korean construction giant gave a "hundred year guarrantee" to the BWDB on construction of the 2.5 km embankment, built between 1995 to 1999 at a cost of Tk 332 core. The government has formed a committee to look into the reasons behind the breach that occurred on July 10, threatening the town. The six-strong committee formed Monday, headed by Bangladesh Water Development Board additional director general Habibur Rahman, has been given 10 working days to report. Communication minister Syed Abul Hossain last Sunday accused local authorities of failing to make essential repairs to the vulnerable stretches of the town's flood defences and turning a blind eye to illegal extraction of sand near the embankment for the rupture. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, however, has also blamed the Korean company Hyundai for failure of its guarantee. The director general of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, Md Abul Kalam Azad, too had blamed "flaws in design or construction" for the breach in the flood barrier that threatened Sirajganj town.
