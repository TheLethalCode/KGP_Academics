 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Crime rates are down while killings by "unidentified assailants" are up, said Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Huq on Sunday. "Crime has shrunk in the capital. But we need to reduce it more, police officers have to work more efficiently," said Huq. The commissioner was presenting the city's crime statistics for May, June and July at a monthly crime conference at Rajarbagh Police Lines. Killings by unidentified attackers are increasing in the capital, according to the report published by Dhaka Metropolitan Police. It said 31 victims, along with a child, were killed in 29 incidents in June in the metropolitan area. Unidentified assailants killed nine people by strangulation and with sharp weapons in nine other cases. Also, twelve victims were killed in ten incidents in which guns were used. Though a few names were reported in these crime reports, most cases were filed anonymously. The murder of a seven year-old child was also committed by anonymous killers. Likewise, a rickshaw owner was killed by unknown criminals. Statistics said just four people were killed by known attackers in different incidents because of previous controversies. The names of those involved were included in the investigations. Moreover, statistics indicated that a drug addicted son was killed by his father, a manpower agent by a creditor and a thief was killed by a mob in June. Overall crime statistics showed a total of 6,024 people arrested, including those accused of murder, extortion, robbery, drug dealing and land grabbing. Regarding traffic problems, it was noted that traffic chaos was continuing due to a lack of sufficient police forces. Additional manpower was requested of the home ministry, the DMP commissioner said. In reply to a question on extortion incidents in the capital's transportation sector, Shahidul claimed, "Outsiders are doing involved." "We sat in a meeting with transport owners recently and formed a committee after discussions," he added. "We hope to eliminate extortion in this sector soon," Shahidul said. bdnews2
