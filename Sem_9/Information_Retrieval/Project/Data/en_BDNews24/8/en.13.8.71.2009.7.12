 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)A group of retail investors demonstrated in front of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Sunday protesting share losses that followed finance minister AMA Muhith release of an "outdated list" of loan defaulters in parliament on July 5. The controversy was sparked when Muhith released a list from the central bank's Credit Information Bureau (CIB) that labelled a number of big companies, including Beximco Group, as loan defaulters. The minister subsequently admitted the list contained outdated information, but not before media outlets, including Prothom Alo, published the names of companies mentioned in the list. The group demanded an end to 'conspiracies against Beximco Group' and also submitted a letter to the chairman of DSE regarding the issue. A statement released by the group said there was a deep-rooted conspiracy and ongoing negative propaganda campaign being conducted against the company. "The incident left almost 200,000 investors in deep financial crisis," said the statement, which was signed by one Waliul Bari Chowdhury. It also termed a DSE letter sent on July 5 to brokerage firms and institutional investors that requested transaction details for shares in Beximco Ltd and Bex Tex Ltd a "biased step". "The DSE letter caused or created the environment for shares in Beximco Group companies to lose value," said the statement. Beximco Group has five of its subsidiaries listed in the capital marketBeximco Ltd, Beximco Pharma, Bex Tex Ltd, Beximco Synthetics and Shinepukur Ceramics. On Saturday, Salman F Rahman, deputy chairman of the group said he would sue the country's top selling newspaper for what he alleges to be a vicious campaign against Beximco. "We have to take legal action against Prothom Alo for its malicious propaganda," Rahman told bdnews24.com
