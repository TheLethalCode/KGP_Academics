 Dhaka July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh achieved just their second win in Tests, and their first overseas, and their newly appointed captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who was off the field as a result of an injured knee, was all praise for his deputy Shakib Al Hasan for leading the team to victory in his absence. West Indies were set a testing target of under 277 on a turning track, and the spinners Mahmudullah Riyad, who took a five-for and finished with eight wickets in his debut Test, and Shakib shut them out of the game with ten overs left in the day. The spin duo took eight wickets between them - while ensuring Mashrafe's absence wasn't felt. "Special thanks to Shakib for handling the team very well," Mashrafe said at the end of the Test.

"Facing 240 balls is the main thing I have learnt," he said. "I haven't played as many balls before (in an innings) in international cricket, and having spent that much time in the middle will help me a lot in the future." Though the conditions were favourable for spin and that Bangladesh took full toll, Tamin admitted the pitch was easy to bat on. "It was a flat wicket, and if you concentrate hard and look to bat straight, it's a good track to score on. "I'm just 20 and have played only 11 Tests, I think there are a lot more (innings like these) to c
