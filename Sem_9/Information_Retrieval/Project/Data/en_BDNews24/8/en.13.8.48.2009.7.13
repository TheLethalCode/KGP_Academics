 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)One more swine flu case was confirmed on Monday, taking the tally of people infected in Bangladesh to 22, the IEDCR director said. Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com that a child, aged 4  years, was infected by another patient inside the country. Of the 22 cases, 12 have been men and 10 women, ranging from age 2 to 46, he said. Those aged 20 to 22 years account for the majority of the cases, he added. Further, 17 of the swine flu victims have fully recovered while four are under treatment, Rahman said. Nine of the cases identified by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research contracted the disease within Bangladesh and all were relatives of people infected abroad who arrived home later. As many as 13 returned home from abroad with the flu. Rahman said cases were confirmed in people who had recently arrived from the Britain, Canada and Australia, while the most cases were from the United States. "The situation is under control as of now. We have given instructions to the civil surgeons to take necessary steps," the IEDCR director said. The IEDCR said the outbreak of seasonal flu that spread at an increasing rate in May has eased now. Experts had feared that a new flu might create a mixture between seasonal flu and swine flu. The World Health Organization declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 1 while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. According to the WHO, approximately 94,000 cases have been detected to date in 125 countries worldwide, with 429 recorded fatalities. As a protection measure, incoming international passengers are being screened for symptoms at Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports, Chittagong and Mongla seaports and 11 land ports, according to officials. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the virus. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and wash hands regularly to curb the spread of the swine flu virus. bdn
