<TITLE> Tuku sues Moeen for defamation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  Former army chief Moeen U Ahmed has been sued by BNP's former state minister for power Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku, who is claiming Tk 100 crore in damages for defamation. The case says Moeen, on March 27, 2007, at a tea party in honour of the Freedom Fighters Contingent and in the presence of members of the media, reportedly accused politicians of the past BNP government of massive corruption. The former army chief was quoted at the time as saying that a whopping Tk 20,000 crore was smuggled out of the country from the power sector alone. Tuku's lawyers filed the case on Sunday with the third joint district judge's court in Dhaka. In addition to the compensation claim, the petitioner also requested authorities to impound Moeen's Baridhara house. Gen Moeen retired from the force on June 15 this year and, according to newspaper reports, left for the US last week with wife Nazneen Moeen. He was appointed as army chief in 2005 and promoted to the rank of general on May 24, 2007, under the past caretaker government. It is widely speculated that the armed forces led by Moeen U Ahmed played a major role during the clampdown of emergency on January 11, 2007, and the subsequent two-year caretaker government regime. Tuku, wife Rumana Mahmud and their two children were sent to jail on graft charges during that period. Convicted in a corruption case and facing a 10-year sentence, Tuku has since secured bail from the High Court, but could not run in the general election last year because of his conviction. Instead, Rumana won the Sirajganj-2 seat in the December polls and is now a BNP MP. bdn
