"At the moment they are being treated there," said the official with the local prefecture, adding that doctors were sent to the camp Saturday. About 10 other children at the camp, also from the Paris area, have no symptoms, he said. Friday, the French authorities said there were 434 confirmed cases of H1N1 in France, 383 of them in the capital, and that 309 of the cases had originated abroad.
