 TOKYO, Jul 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pressure mounted on Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso on Thursday after ruling party lawmakers called for a meeting to debate the party's ailing fortunes at which his critics are expected to seek his resignation. Aso's plan for an election on August 30 -- announced just a day after the opposition Democrats trounced the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a Tokyo metropolitan vote -- has sparked chaos in the ruling party. Surveys show the Democratic Party will win the national election, which must be held by October. That would end more than 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the business-friendly LDP and improve chances of resolving a policy deadlock caused by a divided parliament, where the opposition controls the upper house and can delay bills. A petition demanding the meeting of LDP lawmakers was handed to LDP Secretary-General Hiroyuki Hosoda, top government spokesman Takeo Kawamura told reporters. Under party rules, the meeting must be held within seven days, although Aso could dissolve the lower house first. Kawamura said Aso was ready to respond if the meeting was held, but would likely stick to his election plan. "Our term of office is fixed and the prime minister's choice of August 30 is close to the deadline," he added. "I don't think the prime minister will change his mind." Aso has come under fire for a series of policy flip-flops and gaffes at a time when Japan is suffering its worst recession in 60 years. In a further sign of disarray, Finance Minister Kaoru Yosano -- widely seen as the architect of the Aso administration's economic policies -- and Agriculture Minister Shigeru Ishiba are among those who signed the petition. The two met the premier on Wednesday to press home their views on the party's difficulties following the loss in the Tokyo assembly election. It was not clear, however, how many of those who signed the petition want to ditch Aso. ASO HANGS ON Aso has made it clear he has no intention of resigning and a majority of lawmakers at the meeting would be needed to bring forward a vote for the party leadership set for September. Only a handful of lawmakers have openly called for Aso to resign. Although there are potential alternatives within the party, including Health Minister Yoichi Masuzoe, analysts say a last-minute change of leadership ahead of the election would do little to boost the party's fortunes. "Among those who signed the petition, there are some who want to change the party leader, while there are also opinions that we need to review the outcome of the Tokyo election," former prime minister Yoshiro Mori told a television program on Thursday. "Some also want to have a place to discuss the manifesto." The Yomiuri newspaper said Yosano, whose own seat in parliament is at risk in the looming election, wanted Aso to step down, but the finance minister has not said so publicly. Aso plans to dissolve the lower house early next week ahead of the election. He needs agreement from all cabinet members on the dissolution, but can fire them and go ahead with the plan if they refuse. Yosano said on Wednesday he had not decided whether to sign off on the election plan, but one newspaper quoted a source close to Aso as saying the prime minister would sack him if he refused
