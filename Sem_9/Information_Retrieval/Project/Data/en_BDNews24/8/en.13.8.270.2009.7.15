 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)Exporters have called on the government to buy equipment to detect the presence of banned nitrofurans in frozen foods, after complaints from Europe caused Bangladesh to suspend prawn exports to the EU for six months from May. "We know nothing of the source of these nitrofurans, and have requested the government to buy testing equipment to uncover their origins," Md Musa Miah, president of the Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association, said at a meeting on Tuesday with commerce minister Faruq Khan. The BFFEA have asked for testing equipment to be installed in Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna. Bangladesh halted frozen freshwater prawn exports to Europe in May after detection of nitrofurans, a banned antimicrobial agent, had caused several 'Red Alert' notices to be issued by the European Union. Miah said Tk 200 crore worth of prawns had since been stockpiled in Bangladesh.

He said the BFFEA had asked the government for financial assistance for the beleaguered frozen foods sector. b
