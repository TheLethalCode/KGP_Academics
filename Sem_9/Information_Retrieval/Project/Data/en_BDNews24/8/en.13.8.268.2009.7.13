<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)India's Border Security Force has demanded that Dhaka take back 346 illegal migrants who are on hunger strike demanding repatriation to Bangladesh. Bangladesh has said India must prove their nationalities. The Indian side made the demands at the ongoing BDR-BSF talks in Dhaka saying all the hunger strikers, captured in the Bay of Bengal near the Andaman-Nicobar Islands earlier this year, spoke Bangla and have been claiming themselves as Bangladeshis. Maj Gen Mainul Islam, director general of Bangladesh Rifles, told bdnews24.com on Monday, "We have made it clear at the meeting that Bangladesh will not repatriate anyone unless their nationalities are confirmed as Bangladeshis." The BDR chief said the home ministry had confirmed only 149 of them as Bangladeshi. Islam said the Indian border force delegation, led by BSF chief ML Kumawat, told Bangladesh regarding the immigrants, "They say they are Bangladeshis and have been staging hunger strikes in West Bengal. You must take them back." But, Islam said, "The Rohingyas, fleeing Myanmar, also speak Bangla and may identify themselves as Bangladeshis. Staging a hunger strike alone does mean Bangladesh can recognise them as Bangladeshis." Indian coast guards captured the 346 illegal migrants from boats in the Bay of Bengal. They now reside in West Bengal jails. India at regular intervals presses Dhaka to repatriate illegal immigrants who are Bangla speakers, branding them as Bangladeshis. India has been asking Dhaka to take back thousands of Bangla speakers living in Indian cities for better economic opportunities. But in most cases, foreign ministry sources in Dhaka say, their identities cannot be confirmed as Bangladeshis as per addresses they provide. Bangladesh says it will take back its citizens only if their identities are proved. The three-day BDR-BSF talks began in Dhaka on Sunday. The 24-member Bangladesh Rifles side was headed by Maj Gen Mainul Islam while the Indian Border Security Force delegation was led by its director general ML Kumawat.
