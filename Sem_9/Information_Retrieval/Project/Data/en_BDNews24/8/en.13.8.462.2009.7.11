 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) The Indian Cricket League rebel cricketers have finally been permitted to use the facilities at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium as the BCB issued the letter on Saturday. Habibul Bashar, Shahriar Nafees, Manjurul Islam and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel have so far formally sought permission from the board on Thursday. "It is a good move and we have now no restrictions on practising at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium or use the facilities," said Nafees. Nafees said that the Mirpur Indoor would be open for them from 1pm to 3pm every day and there was no timeframe to use the main ground as well as the gymnasium. BCB acting CEO Nazimuddin said that the cricketers might have been in trouble if they did not take permission to use the facilities. As many as 14 cricketers scrapped their contracts with the ICL to return to mainstream cricket by the deadline of June 15 after the BCB announced a general amnesty to those rebel cricketers, who joined the ICL in September 2008 and subsequently were banned for 10 years. The rebel cricketers will be in a 'cooling period' till December next before being considered for international match
