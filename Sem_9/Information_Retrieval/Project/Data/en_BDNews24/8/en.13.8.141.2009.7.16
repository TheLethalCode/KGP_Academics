 Dhaka, July 15, 2009 (bdnews24.com)The government Wednesday launched a national action plan for the shrimp industry, which aims to revitalise the beleaguered sector after a self-imposed ban on exports to the European Union slashed foreign currency earnings. Bangladeshi exporters suspended shrimp consignments to the EU for six months from May after almost 100 shipments, over a four-year period, were subject to a 'Rapid Alert' notice, which circulates information on food safety problems among European nations. Between 2005 and June 2009, sixty consignments of frozen shrimp from Bangladesh were rejected by the EU due to contamination by nitrofuran, a banned antimicrobial agent. The rising number of complaints led Bangladeshi exporters, in consultation with the government and industry representatives, to impose the export ban on fresh water prawns. "Stringent quality control at every level of production is vital to maintain demand as the market is very competitive," fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas said at the launch of the plan . The action plan follows demands voiced Tuesday by shrimp exporters for the installation of equipment in Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna to detect the presence of nitrofurans in frozen foods bound for export. Dr Mahmudul Karim, executive director of the private research and advocacy arm of the Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, said at the meeting that the shrimp industry already faces huge challenges from repeated natural calamities. "Issues of food safety compliance are also increasing, and include heightened product traceability requirements and labour standards," said Karim. He said it was vital to buy laboratory equipment to clearly establish whether shrimp and prawns create nitrofurans naturally in their bodies, or if an outside contaminant was always involved. A national working committee comprising government officials with private sector and development partners prepared the 'The National Action Plan to Combat Nitrofuran Hazards, Develop Traceability System and Establish a Code of Conduct for the Shrimp Industry'. It was launched at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in Dhaka Wednesday. bd
