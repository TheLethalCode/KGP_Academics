 Dhaka, Jul 13 (bdnews24.com)Stocks fell Monday, with over 60 percent of scrips on the country's twin-bourses losing value, as investors sought to lock in profits. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark index shed 14 points, while the Chittagong Stock Exchange's key index dropped more than 50 points. Meanwhile, small investors continued the previous day's demonstrations in front of the DSE building protesting "conspiracies" against Beximco Group, which they say resulted in widespread investment losses. A statement released by the group Sunday said there was a deep-rooted conspiracy and ongoing negative propaganda campaign being conducted against the company. The group also termed a DSE letter sent on July 5 to brokerage firms and institutional investors that requested transaction details for shares in Beximco Ltd and Bex Tex Ltd a "biased step". Brokerage house officials said the day's trading was dominated by sellers. "Buying was very low today," an official of Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Some scrips nevertheless attracted investors, with large-scale ones winning on the basis of favourable prices, said investment consultant Bashir Ahmed. "Issues such as Beximco and Titas gas increased, although marginally," said Ahmed, who works for a brokerage firm.

Of the scrips traded, 140 declined, 85 advanced and ten remained unchanged. Beximco topped the turnover board, with shares worth Tk 563.105 million traded, edging up 0.75 percent to Tk 308.25. Titas Gas followed with a turnover of Tk 559.655 million, gaining 0.47 percent to end on 690. Bex Tex saw Tk 341.230 million worth of shares traded, rising 1.91 percent to close at Tk 63.80.
