<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The UK has urged Bangladesh to join the international community in its call for release of Myanmar's democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restoration of her human rights. Stephen Evans, the British high commissioner in Dhaka at a press conference Wednesday, said the military junta in Myanmar would listen to Bangladesh more than the UK and the European countries. "As a country where democracy has recently been restored, we hope that Bangladesh will be an advocate for human values and rights in other countries and, for instance, join the international call for Aung San Suu Kyi's release in Burma," Evans told reporters at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium marking his one year's stay here. The envoy said Suu Kyi's imprisonment was "unfair and unjustified" and had sparked "outrage" in the international community. "Please, raise your voices in this international campaign to ensure her human rights are respected and she is allowed to move freely," said Evans for release of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi whose husband was a British national. He said the UK and other western countries wanted to see Suu Kyi to be free. "I think the majority of the people in Bangladesh also want to see her free. "You are a neighbour...Arguably they will listen to you more closely than they will listen to the United Kingdom and other voices in Europe and in North America and elsewhere. "So, I think that what you say makes a difference," said Evans. Foreign ministry officials in Dhaka have declined to comment on Evans's request to Bangladesh as both foreign minister and foreign secretary were in Egypt to attend the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. The foreign policy of Bangladesh, which maintains good relations with reclusive Myanmar, is based on "non-interference" into others' internal affairs. Bangladesh considers Suu Kyi's imprisonment as an internal affair of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, which has been under ruthless military dictatorship since 1960s. "Calling for respect of human rights of Suu Kyi is no way interference," Evans told reporters replying to a question whether his request was against Bangladesh's foreign policy. The UK envoy said both Bangladesh and Myanmar were members of the UN and must be committed to protecting human rights.
