 BEIJING, Jul 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An oil tank blew up at a chemical plant in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang region, on Sunday morning, but local police ruled out a deliberate attack. "It was a natural explosion," said an officer at the Urumqi police station, declining to give his name. The fire at the 10,000 cubic meter storage tank has already been extinguished, said an official who answered the phone at the Urumqi fire department. No casualties have been reported.

The tank belonged to Urumqi Chemical Co, a unit of China National Petroleum Co, parent of PetroChina
