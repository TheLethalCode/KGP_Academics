 YANGON, Fri Jul 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The widely condemned trial of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi resumed on Friday, a week after the country's military rulers ignored a plea from the United Nations chief to drop security charges against her. Yangon's Northern District Court heard testimony from legal expert Khin Moe Moe, Suu Kyi's one remaining defence witness, legal sources said.

In a statement released on Thursday, the NLD said Ban met for only 10 minutes with representatives of 10 opposition parties, whom he told to put aside their differences and take part in next year's polls. Critics say the election, the final part of Myanmar's seven-step "road map" to democracy, will be a sham designed to give legitimacy to the regime and entrench nearly half a century of army rule in the former B
