 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh reached 42 without loss on a severely rain-curtailed opening day in the first Test against West Indies in Kingstown, St Vincent on Thursday. Only 18.5 overs were possible before another downpour brought proceedings to an early close at the Arnos Vale ground, which was virtually empty at the start of the game and although some fans did appear after lunch they saw little action. The left-handed opening pair Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes after dealing with a pretty good opening spell from Tino Best and the aggressive Kemar Roach, ended inseparable on 14 and 26 respectively. Although both openers eventually played each ball on its merits, Tamim had a lucky let off when slashing at a delivery that flew over second slip in the first over. Kayes was tested by sharp rising balls before he started to find his timing. After waiting until the eleventh ball before getting off the mark, he unleashed a couple of square-driven boundaries. In fact, only four fours, three from the bat of Kayes, were scored by the Tigers throughout the stop-start day's play on a pitch that was gradually offering no assistance to the bowlers. The attack started to look pedestrian with the medium-pacers Darren Sammy and Dave Bernard in operation. Reuters adds: new Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza won the toss and chose to bat after rain delayed the start until after lunch. West Indies have been forced to field an ad-hoc side after their first choice players boycotted the game in protest over contractual issues. Thirty six-year-old Floyd Reifer, who has not played in a Test match for over ten years, was named as captain of the team which features seven Test debutants. Bangladesh handed debuts to quick bowler Rubel Hossain and spinning all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad. Shortly after the toss, rain returned further delaying the start. Teams Bangladesh: Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah Riyad, Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain. West Indies: Floyd Reifer (capt), Dale Richards, Omar Phillips, Travis Dowlin, David Bernard, Chadwick Walton (wk), Darren Sammy, Nikita Miller, Tino Best, Ryan Austin, Kemar Roac
