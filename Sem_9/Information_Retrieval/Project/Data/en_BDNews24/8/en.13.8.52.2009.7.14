<TITLE> 'Impossible' for BNP to hold council by July 25: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said it is not possible for the main opposition party to hold council for ratifying its constitution by the July 25 deadline set by the Election Commission. "The BNP already submitted its draft constitution under the amneded RPO to the Election Commission before the elections," Delwar told reporters Tuesday at the party's central office in Naya Paltan. He said the BNP now wanted the Election Commission to create scope for them to hold council properly to complete its registration process. The Election Commission amended electoral laws last year to make registration of all political parties mandatory ahead of the general elections, for the first time in Bangladesh. Thirty-nine political parties were registered ahead of last December's elections with draft constitutions. The EC gave them six months from the first day of parliament, which convened on Jan 25 this year, to ratify their permanent constitutions as the final condition of the registration process. "What we should do next for completing registration will be fixed after talking with the Election Commission," said Delwar. "The BNP wants to ratify its constitution to make it permanent by holding its council in a fair way," he said. But, Delwar alleged, "The government and the Election Commission are acting in unison to cancel the BNP's registration." "The ruling Awami League firstly sought six more months for holding its council but later swiftly came to a decision to hold it on July 24." Delwar questioned the move. "The government has to halt such conspiracies and forget introducing one party rule in the country if it wants to continue the democratic process." He urged the Election Commission to avert any such "conspiracy" and allow BNP to hold council in a transparent way. He also claimed, "The grand alliance government is launching its persecution on the opposition party with one scheme after another." "They are persecuting us by trying to evict our leader from her home, refusing to withdraw political cases against us, committing false propaganda against opposition leaders and bringing other new and false charges." "Now they are trying to cancel our registration. They are committing their ill actions to finish off BNP." "But it will not work as people see this all." b
