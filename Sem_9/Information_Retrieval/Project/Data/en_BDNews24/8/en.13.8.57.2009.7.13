<TITLE> Building Tipaimukh dam may 'violate international law' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka University professor has said India's proposed Tipaimukh dam may be a violation of international law. Addressing a seminar on water security, Professor Asif Nazrul, of Dhaka University's law department, said, "The Vienna convention says that if two countries sign any bilateral agreement, it becomes an international law." The seminar was organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS) at the CIRDAP auditorium on Monday. Nazrul, whose area of interest is international river law, cited the Ganges water sharing treaty signed by Bangladesh and India in 1996. "Section 9 of this law, regarding sharing water from other rivers, states that the two countries will only sign further treaties that do no harm to its citizens." "If India starts the Tipaimukh project to use the water for its own purposes, it will violate the treaty," he said. Professor Nazrul continued, "According to the current Ganges Treaty and other international conventions, India cannot decide unilaterally to set up the dam. We expect that the government would speak for the national interest according to the treaties and laws, not only for opposing India." Nazrul also said statements by the Indian high commissioner were "wrong" when he earlier said no international law could stop the dam project. "I am not able to understand why he said so," he added. "No scope can be given to build the dam. Earlier, we have experienced the impact of the Farakka dam." Nazrul called the dam a project sponsored by the Indian elite class that includes some government officials and politicians, while supported by few Bangladeshi elites. Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, said water planning and its utilisation have become threats to the Bangladeshi population's existence. Further, water politics has become an Asian security issue, he added. "Any major river structure in Tipaimukh will harm Sunamganj and Sylhet regions. That is an earthquake-sensitive area. The huge water storage will increase the risk of earthquakes," Rahman said. Former editor of Bangladesh Today, Col (retd) Mahmudur Rahman, said the Tipaimukh issue must be raised at local and international forums, as experience says bilateral discussions could not resolve these problems. He said Tipaimukh is not only a hydropower project, but also a part of India's intra-river connection project. BIPSS president, Maj Gen (retd) ANM Moniruzzaman, said it is not clear what the parliamentary team would do without sufficient data during its upcoming visit to the site. bdn
