 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The deep-sea port at Sonadia Island in Cox's Bazaar is expected to handle 75 million tons of cargo a year by 2020 against just one million tons at the main seaport in Chittagong. The master plan of the port envisages this eventually rising to 325 million tons, KM Ahmed, coordinator of Pacific Consultants International, the Japanese consultancy agency for feasibility study, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin said earlier in the day that the first phase of the work at a cost of Tk 13,000 crore was expected to end by 2015. The port would be operational after the first phase of work, the minister said. The second segment will start between 2016 and 2017, Amin said. Ahmed said even the Chittagong port will be able to load and unload only two million tons of containers, even if modernised. Only 18 percent of the ships can enter the Chittagong port as the Karnaphuli River is of low depth, whereas Sonadia port will allow 80 to 90 percent ships. "The proposed port will help ease the high export-import cost. We have to transport goods by feeder vessels to and from Singapore, Colombo and Port Klang of Malaysia, which increases the cost and time too," Ahmed said. "For this, around half of the export of the garments sector is done by air." Sonadia Island was chosen from the eight preliminary spots due to the depth. Moreover, 80 percent of the land is owned by government, is sparsely populated and only 55 households will be needed relocation, he added. Salt is produced in major part of the island and the port construction will not harm the environment and biodiversity much, Ahmed said. The feasibility report says the port will not 'seriously harm' any resource other than the sea water. Fishes and birds will move to nearby areas. Destruction of the mangrove forest would be met up by plantation in some other places. The port will be built on 22 hectares of land. Akram Point of the Poshur River at Bagerhat, Saint Martins Island, Elephant Point at Cox's Bazaar, Moheshkhali channel, Kutubdia channel, Kutubdia point and Middle Island of Chittagong were also considered as the possible site. The port will be launched after the construction of five international and four domestic jetties by 2020 at a cost of Tk 13,000 crore. In the second phase, nine international and six local jetties will be constructed at a cost of Tk 26,000 crore by 2035. Further construction will be made according to the master plan by 2055 after considering the demand. Total estimated cost is Tk 60,000 crore for the project which is to be complete by 2055. Once operational, 14 to 16-metre draft ships will be able to enter the port. Ships of nine-metre draft now enter the Chittagong port. A 40-km access road and a 40-m railway line are needed to connect the port, which will cost nearly Tk 1358 crore, ($194 million). A residential area will be set up at a cost of about Tk 112 crore ($20 million). The port will consume 100 MW electricity and roughly Tk 1120 crore ($160 million) will be needed to establish a power plant. The master plan says the port will greatly help spur economic growth.
