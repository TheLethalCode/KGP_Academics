<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The government is changing the fertiliser distribution rules to make way for the appointment of an unspecified number of retailers instead of three sales representatives in each union to reach the essential commodity more easily to farmers. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that the new guidelines would cut harassment of the farmers in getting fertiliser. An inter-ministry committee has recently finalised an integrated guideline on appointment of dealers for fertiliser distribution, bringing changes to the previous policy prepared by the caretaker government. Previously, there was just one dealer and three sales representatives in each union but the new regulation introduces scope for unlimited retailers keeping one dealer per union. The retailers after registration can sell fertiliser on procurement from upazila-level fertiliser and seeds monitoring committees led by Upazila Nirbahi Officer. But a retailer cannot purchase or sell fertiliser at another upazila. The minister said the government wanted to maintain an open market policy and at the same time monitor the market so that farmers did not face any crisis. "We made the new regulation considering the two issues," she said. Because the retailers will be registered with the upazila committees it will be easy to supervise how much fertiliser they are procuring and selling, the minister said. There will still be one dealer for each union but this may be raised, if required, according to the new policy. According to agriculture ministry sources the new regulation will be effective from October 1. There are currently 5,109 dealers across the country. If the old dealers want to keep their dealerships they need to renew their licences from Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation. They, however, would not need recommendations from their district or upazila committee. Bangladesh Fertiliser Dealers Association chairman Salauddin Ahmed has welcomed the new regulations. He told bdnews24.com that the purchaser will be benefited if the number of salesmen was increased. The farmers need not worry about getting fertiliser due to creation of retail salesmen, Ahmed said. b
