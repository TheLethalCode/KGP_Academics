 NEW DELHI, Fri Jul 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's industrial output grew for a second successive month in May as strong domestic demand offset faltering exports, which analysts said added weight to a view the central bank would not cut rates further. Factory output in May rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier, higher than a downwardly revised rise of 1.2 percent in April and bettering forecasts for a 1.4 percent rise, bolstering hopes activity in big emerging economies was picking up. "We do believe that the worst is over, but there is a difference between the worst being over and getting back to robust growth," said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the government's Planning Commission. Output had fallen in December, February and March as Asia's third-largest economy was hit hard by a sudden liquidity crunch and the global downturn. The global slump is still choking exports, which fell an annual 29 percent in May, and hampering the broader recovery. "The most significant feature is the positive manufacturing growth number despite a strong decline in India's exports," said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities. "This just shows that the domestic demand situation is highly resilient." The benchmark stock index turned positive on the data and extended gains to be up 1 percent in afternoon trade. The yield on the most traded 2014 bond rose two basis points after the data, but then trimmed gains. Analysts said the better-than-expected data backed views the central bank will not cut rates further after slashing them by 425 basis points since October to 4.75 percent. "In our view the next move will be higher but perhaps not until April-June quarter of next year," said Robert Prior-Wandesforde, senior Asian economist at HSBC, in a note to clients. The central bank next reviews policy no July 28. India is among a handful of Asian nations, along with China and South Korea, to see signs of recovery emerging following the worst global economic contraction since the Great Depression. UPTURN SIGNS Manufacturing output, which accounts for about 80 percent of India's industrial production, rose an annual 2.5 percent in May compared with revised growth of 0.4 percent in April. And the Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed earlier this month that manufacturing activity expanded for a third straight month in June. Car sales have risen in annual terms for the past five months. They rose 7.8 percent in June, as buyers were attracted by a spate of new models and lower borrowing costs. On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund revised upwards India's growth forecast for 2009, even as world output is seen contracting more than earlier thought. The government expects the economy to expand by 7 percent in 2009/10, higher than the central bank's April estimate of about 6 percent, as stimulus steps and the impact of previous policy easing take effect. Lower factory and farm output dragged the country's overall economic growth to a six-year low of 6.7 percent in 2008/09 (April/March) from 9 percent the previous year. Industrial output rose 2.6 percent in 2008/09, sharply lower than 8.5 percent in 2007/08, as the global economic crisis and high interest rates hurt domestic demand and exports. On Monday, the government projected budget spending to rise more than a third in 2009/10, and offered tax relief to individuals to lift de
