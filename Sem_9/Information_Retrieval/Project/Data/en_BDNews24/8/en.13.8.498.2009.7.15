 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has acquitted five central Awami League leaders, including its voluntary front Swechchasebok League president Bahauddin Nasim, of corruption charges. The other four were assistant secretaries of the party's central sub-committee Shafi Ahmed, SM Kamal Hossain, Mohammad Shahe Alam and Iqbalur Rahim. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Muhammad Hakimul Hasan gave the acquittal orders on Wednesday upon a final report that found no definitive evidence in a corruption case filed on July 31, 2007. Businessman MM Waliz Mirza had charged them with demanding Tk 1 crore in bribe from Northstar Resources and Global Ltd in return for getting it a work order through tender. Of the amount, the firm paid the defendants Tk 75 lakh, Mirza alleged. The lawyer for the plaintiff, Kazi Mohammad Nazibullah Hiru, told reporters after the verdict that the case had been filed because of 'misunderstanding', and that both parties reached settlement. Mirza also told the court that he had no objection if they were cleared of the charges. bdne
