 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)The government has formed a committee to look into the reasons behind the breach of a 600-foot stretch of the '100-year guaranteed' Sirajganj town protection embankment on July 10, threatening the township. A press release of water resources ministry on Monday said the six-strong committee headed by Bangladesh Water Development Board additional director general Habibur Rahman has been given 10 working days to report. The other members of the committee are Taslimul Islam, deputy secretary at the water resources ministry, Md Monowar Hossain of Bangladesh University of Science and Technology, Emad Uddin Ahmed, executive director of IWM, Jasim Uddin Ahmed of Bangladesh Water Development Board and its executive engineer Md Motahar Hossain. Communication minister Syed Abul Hossain on Sunday accused local authorities of failing to make essential repairs to the vulnerable stretches of the town's flood defences and turning a blind eye to illegal extraction of sand near the embankment for the rupture. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, however, had blamed the Korean construction giant Hyundai for failing to live up to its contractual obligations and said it would face "legal action". The director general of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, Md Abul Kalam Azad, had earlier blamed "flaws in design or construction" for the breach in the flood barrier that threatened Sirajganj town. The embankment also reportedly had a '100-year guarantee". Both ministers, however, agreed that the Jamuna bridge, some 10 kilometres from the embankment breach, was safe. bd
