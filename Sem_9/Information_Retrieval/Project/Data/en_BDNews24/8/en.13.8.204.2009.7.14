<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Sahidul Huq Monday called for the creation of welfare committees in garment factories to ease tensions in the sector. Huq said he had also ordered his subordinates to take decisive action on all official complaints received from the garments sector, which has long suffered from industrial disputes and sporadic violence that flared up last month during three days of riots by workers in Ashulia. Speaking at a meeting with representatives of the BGMEA and BKMEA at police headquarters, the DMP chief said a high-level police panel had been created to advise on issues relating to the garment sector. The commissioner said greater understanding between garment factory owners and workers in the Dhaka metropolitan area was imperative. Abdus Salam Murshedi, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said a major problem in the sector related to the 'rag trade'. "Problems with rags traders are yet to be permanently resolved," said Murshedi. President of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufactures and Exporters Association Md Fazlul Huq also said violence in the semi-official rag trade remained a critical issue. bdnews
