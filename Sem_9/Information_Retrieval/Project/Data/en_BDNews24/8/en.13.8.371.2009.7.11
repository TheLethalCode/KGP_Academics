 Tangail, July 11 (bdnews24.com)Bhasani University in Tangail shut its doors indefinitely on Saturday following violent clashes between students and local traders that left at least 50 injured and 25 shops gutted by fire. "We had to shut down all our activities as we failed to tackle the situation," vice-chancellor M Nurul Islam told bdnews24.com. Police said the violence was sparked when an altercation between a student and fish trader at Santash Bazar spiralled out of control. "Police fired 10 rounds of rubber bullets in an attempt to bring the situation under control," officer-in-charge of Tangail Sadr Police Station Jasim Uddin told bdnews24.com. Sub-inspector of the police station, Mosharraf Hossen, said a group of students set fire to around 25 shops in the market. At least 50 people were injured during four hours of violence that began at around 10am. University authorities have told students have to quit their halls of residence by 6pm. bdnews24.co
