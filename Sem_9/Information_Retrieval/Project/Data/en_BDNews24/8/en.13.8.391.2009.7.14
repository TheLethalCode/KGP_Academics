 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed said Tuesday the appointment of four new judges to the Supreme Court Appellate Division would expedite the murder trial of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and other major cases. "The nation has been waiting for an end to the trial of the Bangabandhu murder case for many years, and these appointments will speed the process," said Shafique. "The attorney general has been instructed to include the case in the Supreme Court's cause list," he told reporters at the secretariat. Questioned by reporters on allegations that the new appointments had violated seniority, Shafique said: "They were made in the usual manner." President Zillur Rahman's appointment of the four new judges on Tuesday raises the total number of judges to an unprecedented 11 in the highest appeals court that has long been hamstrung by the shortage. The new appointees are justices BK Das, ABM Khairul Haque, Mohammed Muzammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha. Their appointment, to expedite the resolution of several important cases, will come into force from the day they are sworn in to office. The seven other justices of the appellate are chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim, Mohammad Tafazzal Islam, Mohammad Jainul Abedin, Mohammad Abdul Matin, Shah Abu Naim Mominur Rahman and Mohammad Abdul Aziz. Of major pending cases in Bangladesh, the Bangabandhu murder trial has yet to see a conclusion, 34 years after independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and family members were killed on Aug 15, 1975, by members of the army. The subsequent administration passed an indemnity ordinance in November that year, barring trial of the killers. The Awami League government cancelled the indemnity law in 1996 to clear the way for trial. Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station that year, 21 years after the murders took place. He named 20 individuals in connection with the case. In 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul handed down the death sentence to 15 convicted of the 20 accused. The High Court in 2001 stayed the sentences on appeals by five of the convicted, and the sentences remained suspended during the BNP-Jamaat alliance government. Six years later, in 2007, the Appellate Division admitted the appeals for hearings, which are yet to start. The lack of senior judges left the appeals pending. According to the Supreme Court's rules, only a bench of three Appellate Division justices can accept an appeal in such a case. The rules also state that a judge who heard the case in the High Court cannot hear the same case in the appeals division, if transferred. The Awami League government, headed by Sheikh Mujib's daughter Sheikh Hasina, also earlier appointed two justices on assuming power in January. bdnew
