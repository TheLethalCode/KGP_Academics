<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Monday that the government and Election Commission are in collusion to exclude the main opposition party from completing the registration process. "A plan exists to stop the BNP tendering its constitution to the Election Commission after holding its council," Delwar told reporters at the BNP's central office in Naya Paltan. He said the government's actions indicated they wished to establish a 'one-party system of rule' in the country. "They do not want any opposition party in the country," said Delwar. The BNP's policy-making forum decided Monday to send a delegation to the EC, which is expected to meet with the commission on July 16 to discuss an extension to the deadline for holding council. Electoral law gives parties six months from the start of parliament, or July 25, as a deadline for political parties to hold council and approve their constitutions as the final condition for the registration that began ahead of the December general elections. "It is the Election Commission's duty to ensure political parties can hold their councils in a fair atmosphere," said Delwar.
