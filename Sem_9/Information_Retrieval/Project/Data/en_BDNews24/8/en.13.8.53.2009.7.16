 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) - The law minister Shafique Ahmed said Wednesday the government would announce whether the BDR trial would be held under military or civilian law after the next meeting of an inter-ministerial committee on July 27. "Many aspects of the law have been analysed in a meeting today (Wednesday). Some complexities remain on some issues," Shafique said. "To further discuss those issues, today's meeting has been adjourned until July 27." Shafique was speaking to reporters after a meeting, of the inter-ministerial committee on the BDR trials, at the Secretariat. Asked whether the army was pressing to try the mutineers under martial law, he said, "No. Discussions have been held. Everyone has given their opinions under which law the trial should be held." "But it will be decided only after carefully analysing all."
