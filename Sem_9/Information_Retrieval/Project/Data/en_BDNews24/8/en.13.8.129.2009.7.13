 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Students' secondary level studies would extend over four academic years, nine to twelve, and the government scholarship exams would be taken at the end of class X in lieu of the SSC exams, the draft National Education Policy 2009 recommends. Final secondary level exams would be held at the end of the class XII. "We may take another 15-20 days before submitting the document, though the deadline is August 3. We might submit the draft policy formulated by the end of August," Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, the co-chair of the committee, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. The present secondary level spanning the classes VI-XII has three stagesthe lower secondary covering classes VI-VII, the secondary classes IX-X and the higher secondary classes, XI and XII. The draft policy labels classes IX-XII as the secondary level. The primary education level will encompass classes I-VIII. On April 8, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid officially announced the formation and kicking off of the National Education Policy formulation committee headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury. The 16-member committee, later co-opting two more members, includes writer-science teacher Dr Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and Kholiquzzaman, who is also the Bangladesh Economic Council chief. The committee met on a number of occasions prior to completing the draft policy. Muhammad Insan Ali, Bangladesh Government Secondary Teachers Association general secretary, told bdnews24.com that the bid to extend the secondary level up to class XII was a positive move. "Students attending the secondary level through a period of four years from class IX through XII should mature better," he observed. As effective steps to implement the recommendation, the committee has suggested the annexure of classes XI and XII to the present secondary schools and again annexing classes IX and X to the higher secondary institutions. Recruiting adequate numbers of qualified teachers as instructors for the higher classes at secondary schools has also been recommended. To evaluate students finishing class X, the draft policy recommends the usual annual tests to qualify which students advance to class XI. Special merit scholarship tests will also be held at the end of class X. A public examination styled 'secondary examination' has been recommended at the termination of class XII, the results of which will be expressed in the grading system. Similar to the primary education, curricula for specific subjects such as Bangla, English, mathematics, IT and vocational training at the secondary level has also been recommended to be kept similar for all the streamsgeneral education, madrasa-based religious education and technical education. All the streams, however, will include compulsory as well as elective subjects. The policy recommends higher mathematics to be made compulsory for all science students through the secondary level. Subject-wise teacher recruitment would be carried out annually by a Teaching Services Commission in a manner similar to the Public Service Commission through written and oral tests. The policy recommends basic training to the newly recruited teachers before they join their duty. Within a span of six to seven years, the teacher-student ratio will be around 1:30, the draft policy envisages. The policy recommends Bangla to be the medium of instruction. For foreigners, English medium education will be subject to approval, in which case a system of teaching Easy Bengali should be incorporated. b
