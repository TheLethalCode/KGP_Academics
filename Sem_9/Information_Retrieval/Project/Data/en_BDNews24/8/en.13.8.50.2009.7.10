 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)The government will appoint another 6,000 doctors to offset the crippling shortage of physicians at public hospitals, prime minister Sheikh Hasina has announced. "We have decided to appoint six thousand doctors considering the healthcare services for the people," she said at a reunion marking the 63rd founding anniversary of Dhaka Medical College in the capital on Friday. She said the doctors may be appointed on an ad hoc basis, and will be regularised, subject to their coming through the BCS examinations. In addition, she added, 3,000 nurses will also be taken on board. Hasina observed that no public interest work should be considered from a political standpoint. The prime minister laid the foundation stone of the 12-storey academic building of the country's premier public medical college and distributed crests among students with outstanding results. Health minister A F M Ruhal Haque, prime minister's health adviser Syed Modasser Ali, MP Rashed Khan Menon and Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin, spoke among others in the programme held at Shahid Dr Milon auditorium of the college. The programme was presided over by Nazmun Nahar, the president of DMC Alumni Trust. A colourful rally was held on the DMC campus to celebrate the occasion. Old and new students and teachers took part in the rally. Rich history Dhaka Medical College was launched in full swing on July 9, 1946, as the only medical college in the formerly East Bengal. Mitford and Sylhet Medical School were established earlier. In the undivided Bengal, only Calcutta had a fully fledged medical college. The member secretary of the publicity committee of DMC Alumni Trust and assistant professor, Monilal Aich Litu, said, "Behind the establishment former Dhaka University vice-chancellor Ramesh Chandra Majumder and civil surgeon of Dhaka GF Virgin played a very important role." The main building of DMC was built in 1904, which was used as the provincial parliament of former East Bengal and Assam. Later, after the establishment of Dhaka University, it was used as the medical centre and boys' hostel. In 1939, the university approved the establishment of a medical college for the Muslims of East Bengal. But then, the Second World War broke out and the US army used it as base hospital. Activities of the Dhaka Medical College resumed in 1946, and it soon attracted many teachers and students from Calcutta Medical College. There were only four departments when it was launched -- medicine, surgery, gynaecology and ENT (ear, nose and throat). Currently, 1050 students are studying in 12 departments under 176 teachers, Banglapedia statistics says. As many as 150 students can get admission every year in the college, which also offers scope of higher studies. bdnews24.
