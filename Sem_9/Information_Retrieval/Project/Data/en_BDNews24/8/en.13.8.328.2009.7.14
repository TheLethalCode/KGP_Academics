 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman on Tuesday said that farm loan will be disbursed in a transparent manner to check irregularities. The central bank chief made the remarks as he spelled out the agriculture loan distribution target and policy for 2009-10 fiscal year at a news conference. Rahman said that allegations were widespread all these years that farmers did not get farm loans and that loan disbursement irregularities galore. "So, this time loan will be disbursed before the local people by gathering them through drum beating.' The central bank this year has set the farm loan disbursement target for all banks at a record Tk 11,512.30 crore in the 2009-10 fiscal year. "In our economy, money usually travels from villages to towns and we want the trend to reverse now and keeping this in mind, the farm loan disbursement target has been fixed this fiscal year," Rahman said. Four nationalised banks and two specialised ones, Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank have been targeted to disburse Tk 8, 453 crore. For 29 private banks Tk 2, 594.40 crore has been earmarked and 10 foreign banks have been set to disburse Tk 464.90 crore. In the past 2008-09 fiscal year, agriculture loan distribution goal was at Tk 9,389 crore. Deputy governor Nazrul Huda and other central bank officials were present at the briefing. bdnew
