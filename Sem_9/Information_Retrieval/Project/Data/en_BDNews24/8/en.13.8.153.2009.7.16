 Dhaka, Jul 5 (bdnews24.com)Trees in their thousands are being illegally felled on the Sitakundu coast in Chittagong to make way for ship-breaking activities, leaving the area highly vulnerable to natural disasters, while the government awaits court orders before considering what steps to take. In less than 24 hours, from Friday night to Saturday noon, an astounding 15,000 trees on some 40 acres of land were felled to make way for more ship breaking yards, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. The latest incident of mass deforestation comes on the heels of the government's signing of a $5.4 million deal with the UNDP in April for a coastal afforestation project, a step intended to combat climate change. Experts say the International Maritime Organisation's controversial global treaty on ship breaking, signed in May by some 65 countries, will encourage ship breakers to flaunt local laws to build more breaking yards. "The forest at Sitakundu was created to mitigate natural disasters, but now ship breaking yards are being built on land formerly covered with trees," said Hasan, an award-winning environmental lawyer. "This is totally unacceptable. The High Court has ordered that environmental certificates must be secured prior to establishing any new ship breaking yards," she said. Hasan said cases have already been filed with the aim of stopping the destruction of forests in the area. Forest minister Mostafizur Rahman told bdnews24.com he first read the news in the papers, but it appeared that those involved had no permission to fell the trees. "They are now trying to establish that the land belongs to them," he said. "So far as I know, land raised from the sea is given to the forest department for forestation purposes," said Mostafizur. Locals say the forest was initially planted following their demands to protect the coast from cyclones and tidal surges. Forest officials said the forest department had started planting trees after receiving the go-ahead, but the process had stalled, giving local land officials scope to "allocate" the land to local businessmen. The species of trees felled include Keura, Babla and Bain. Environmental groups allege that SM Al Mamun, the son of local MP Abul Kashem Master, was behind the most recent felling of trees. Speaking to bdnews24.com Sunday, Mamun denied the allegation, saying: "I have a yard in that area but I have no connection to this matter." However, he said he did know "those involved." "Over the last three days I saw a lot of trees being chopped down. I've heard there will be five or six yards built in the area," said Mamun. Two cases have been filed for illegal tree-felling in the area against 15 people, including local businessmen Md Nurunnabi Bhuiyan, Md Adnan and Mohammad Salauddin, said M Abdul Khaleque Khan, divisional forest officer of Chittagong coastal forest division. Forests minister Mostafizur said the government will consider its next move after the court's directive is handed down in the case. bdnews24
