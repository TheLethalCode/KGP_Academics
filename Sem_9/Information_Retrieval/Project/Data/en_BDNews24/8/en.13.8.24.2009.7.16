 BUENOS AIRES, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Carlos Tevez has surprised himself with his success in English football, Manchester City's new signing said on Tuesday. "The truth is that when I signed for West Ham I wanted to leave after ten days," the Argentina striker said. "I never thought I'd achieve all the good things I've done in this country," the 25-year-old added in an interview with Radio del Plata. "At this stage of my life I only think of continuing to grow and progress. I want to be one of the best players in England," said Tevez, who had a season at West Ham United, helping them avoid relegation in 2006 before moving to Manchester United. "England is a high quality country, my wife is very happy and my daughter, who is four, too. This year she starts school here. I signed a contract for five years and I'm relaxed." Tevez, who said he was off to South Africa with City for the pre-season, added: "This season will be very important with very big challenges with the club and the (Argentine) national team. "So it will be essential to have good preparation this month for the whole year." City are trying to buy themselves into the Premier League elite while Argentina have struggled lately in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

He paid Boca Juniors 19.5 million dollars for Tevez in 2004 and City spent a reported 25.5 million pounds ($41.48 million) on the player's transfer.

"When we bought him for $20 million everyone said that was too expensive. But he's worth much more. "As a person he's incredible... For me, Carlitos has no price, not 50 nor 60 million. "It's an incredible story... He started playing football in a very poor area. He came out of Fort Apache," said Joorabchian referring to the dangerous shanty in which Tevez grew up. "We began (our liaison) with a title at Corinthians (in Brazil), he saved West Ham (from relegation) and won six titles (trophies) with United. "This is the start of a new project, starting from nothing, because City has nothing today, but Carlitos is a winner." Tevez's transfer fee was the second highest for an Argentine player after former Chelsea striker Hernan Crespo, who joined Lazio from Parma for 35 million pounds in
