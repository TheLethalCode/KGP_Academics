 Cox's Bazar, July 14 (bdnews24.com)At least 50 fishing trawlers and dozens of fishermen were missing, said locals, as a storm buffeted the Teknaf coast in Cox's Bazar on Tuesday. Locals claimed the small-engine fishing vessels had possibly sunk as they were trying to return to shore when the storm hit around noon. Around 200 fishermen succeeded in swimming to land, but dozens were still missing, they said. Chairman of Baharchora Union Parishad, Hafez Saifullah, said no fatalities were reported up to late afternoon. Red Crescent, with the help of the local people, were operating rescue activities, he said. All fishing boats and trawlers over the North Bay and deep sea were earlier advised to take shelter in a special weather bulletin as a monsoon depression was brewing over the northwest Bay and the adjoining area. Meteorologist Farah Diba told bdnews24.com that a low over the Bay had intensified into depression overnight and stormy weather would hit the maritime ports and the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The met office in its special bulletin Tuesday afternoon said the monsoon depression was centred about 570kms west-southwest of Chittagong port, 540kms west-southwest of Cox's Bazaar port and 390kms southwest of Mongla port. It was likely to intensify further and move in a northwesterly direction, said the bulletin. The maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla were advised to keep hoisted local cautionary signal number three. bdne
