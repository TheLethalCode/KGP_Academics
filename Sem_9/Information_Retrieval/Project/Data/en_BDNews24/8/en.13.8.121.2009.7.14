<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh sealed a first-ever Test victory on foreign soil after defeating West Indies by 95 runs at St Vincent on Monday. It was only their second win in the longer-version of the game since the 226-run win over Zimbabwe at MA Aziz Stadium on January 10, 2005. The shortcomings of West Indies' second-string line-up were harshly exposed on a historic fifth and final day at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown as they tried to chase the target of 277, but managed only 181 all out in 70.1 overs. Fittingly, acting skipper Shakib Al Hasan delivered the final nail in the coffin when he trapped Tino Best leg before for nine with a full toss and thus end any hopes of the hosts, missing all their regular starters due to a contract dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board, salvaging the game. David Bernard (52 not out) was the only batsman to provide any resistance. Shakib, deputising for the injured Bangladesh captain and pace spearhead Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, weighed in with three for 39. As soon as the final wicket fell all the Bangladesh players moved into a huddle of joy including a limping Mashrafe who hobbled to the middle to join in the celebrations. The destroyer-in-chief was Mahmudullah Riyad. The debutant off-spinner bagged 5-51 and a match-haul of eight wickets, however, Tamim Iqbal was named the man-of-the-match after scoring an impressive 128 in the Tigers' second innings total of 345. The only disappointing aspect of a thrilling Test was Mashrafe not being able to bowl due to a knee injury suffered on the third day and is doubtful for the second Test starting in St George's, Grenada on July 17. West Indies started the day well, removing the last five Bangladesh batsmen cheaply to set up a realistic target in 80 overs spread over three sessions. The tourists resuming on 321-5 added just 24 runs before Darren Sammy and Kemar Roach shared the spoils. Sammy, who took two wickets on Sunday, caused the main damage sending back Shakib (30) in the fourth over of the day that also ended a 40-run sixth wicket stand with Mushfiqur Rahim and later removed Mashrafe (nought) and Rubel Hossain (1) to return five for 70. Medium-pacer Roach dismissed Mahmudullah (8) and overnight batsman Rahim (37) to raise his tally to three for 67. Shakib smashed a four down the ground before swatting a wide delivery from Sammy straight to mid-off. With his exit, all positive intent evaporated from the Bangladesh camp and allowed West Indies to climb all over them. Sammy, who bowled so well without much luck on the fourth morning, helped himself to a five-for with his steady bowling and Roach did his bit to hasten the end. Sammy had Mashrafe, batting with a runner, out flicking straight to backward square leg and trapped Rubel Hossain with a yorker. Roach removed Mahmudullah lbw and bowled Rahim with a superb inswinging yorker. But the Caribbean side soon were in trouble before lunch, losing both opening batsmen. Dale Richards was dismissed in amateurish fashion, hit on the pads and waiting for an lbw appeal to be answered when he strolled out of his crease and was run out. Omar Phillips, who made a debut century in his first innings, was trapped lbw by the left-arm spin of Shakib to leave West Indies at 33 for two. Mahmudullah claimed the wickets of Travis Dowlin, Reifer, wicketkeeper Chadwick Walton and Roach. Shakib picked up the vital wicket of Darren Sammy when the all-rounder wildly slashed the ball to Shahadat Hossain at point. Bernard and fellow Jamaican Nikita Miller put on 32 either side of tea in a partnership that ate up 17.2 overs. But Mohammad Ashraful's part-time offspin made a decisive breakthrough when Miller snicked the ball to the wicketke
