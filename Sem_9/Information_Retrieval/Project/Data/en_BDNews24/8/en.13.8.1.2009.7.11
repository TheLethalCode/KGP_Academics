 LONDON, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia amassed four centuries in an Ashes innings for the first time on Saturday with debutants Marcus North and Brad Haddin joining Simon Katich and Ricky Ponting on the honours' board. North (125 not out) scored his second century in three tests during a sixth wicket partnership of exactly 200 with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (121). Both men were making their Ashes debuts. Haddin's dismissal caught on the mid-wicket boundary attempting a fourth six was the signal for Ponting to declare Australia's first innings closed at 674 for six, a lead of 239. England's hopes of saving the game then received a significant blow when Alastair Cook (6) and Ravi Bopara (1) were both dismissed lbw in the space of eight balls before tea. At the interval England were 20 for two with Andrew Strauss (6) and Kevin Pietersen (3) at the crease. Australia, 479 for five overnight in reply to England's 435, carried on much as they had on Friday with Haddin taking over from Michael Clarke as the aggressor and North playing the supporting role. North, 54 not out overnight, brought up his century just before lunch, playing with discipline and concentration. Haddin was far more flamboyant, striking Graeme Swann over mid-wicket for six to bring up the 600. He hit a straight six off Monty Panesar and raced to his hundred from 138 balls. A third six from Paul Collingwood's part time medium pace followed before he struck the same bowler to Bopara patrolling the boundary. England, who had looked increasingly demoralised with each of their five frontline bowlers conceding more than 100 runs, had a tricky 25 minutes to negotiate before the tea interval. They failed dismally as the sky darkened and the floodlights came on for the second time in the match. Cook played across a full-length delivery from Mitchell Johnson and Bopara was also culpable, attempting to flick Ben Hilfenhaus to leg. The rain which had been forecast to descend on Cardiff during the afternoon started to fall as the players left the field with England needing all the help they could get from the elements if they were to avoid defeat.
