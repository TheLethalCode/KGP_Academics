<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday declared illegal the charging of Value Added Tax to patients for medical prescriptions and diagnostic tests, although medical service providers will still have to pay the tax. Justices ABM Khairul Haque and Mohammad Momtaz Uddin Ahmed gave the ruling on a public interest petition filed by three Supreme Court lawyers. The petitioners had stated that health service consumers were being overcharged for adequate treatment as a result of the application of VAT. "Although service providers are supposed to pay VAT in line with Section 3 of the 1991 VAT Act, the tax was also being realised from patients," said advocate Manzil Morshed, council for the petitioners. "This is contrary to the constitution," he said.
