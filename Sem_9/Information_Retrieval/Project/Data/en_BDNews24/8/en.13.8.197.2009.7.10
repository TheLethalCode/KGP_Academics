<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 10 (bdnews24.com)Far fewer men use contraceptives than women, as the government grapples with booming population now officially at 144 million, the health minister said on Friday. "Only 5.2 percent are male among a total of 55.8 percent users of temporary and permanent contraceptives," A F M Ruhal Haque told reporters at the health ministry on the eve of the World Population Day to be observed across the country on Saturday. The minister said the rate of people who use family planning methods has climbed to 55.8 percent in 2007 from 7.7 percent in 1975. He said, "One important issue of our programme is to increase male participants in the family planning measures." Haque emphasized more programmes to encourage a greater number of men to use contraceptives measures. Despite demands, the government has failed to supply 17.6 percent couples with the contraceptive services, the minister said. He said fulfilling that demand is a must to meet the target of the government's HNPS Programme. The Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Programme targets increasing the family planning users to 72 percent by 2011.
