<TEXT>
 SOFIA, Thu Jul 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boiko Borisov, whose centre-right GERB party won Bulgaria's July 5 general elections, agreed on Thursday to be the Balkan state's next prime minister, promising to end a climate of impunity and prevent a prolonged recession. President Georgi Parvanov gave Borisov, the 50-year-old Sofia mayor and former bodyguard, a mandate to form the European Union member's new government in the next seven days. GERB garnered 40 percent of the vote but was five seats short of a clear majority in the 240-seat parliament. Borisov said his party aimed to form a minority government with the support of other rightist parties but without giving up any ministerial seats. "We will form a cabinet which will lead Bulgaria out of the crisis, guarantee stability and the rule of law," Borisov told reporters after receiving the mandate. The burly GERB leader has already won praise for his plans to bring Western-educated economists and reformists into his cabinet. Simeon Djankov, a World Bank economist, is likely to be finance minister. But observers say having a minority cabinet could raise the risk of instability and hamper GERB's agenda for radical reforms to restore the rule of law and stop the recession dragging on. "BLACK SHEEP" Borisov, a former bodyguard to late Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, reiterated plans to shut down some ministries and cut the administration to slash spending and avoid slipping into deficit that could put pressure on Bulgaria's currency peg. GERB's victory has alleviated worries about the peg but Bulgaria has little chance of quick recovery as its economy is expected to shrink 5-7 percent this year, economists say. A grouping of rightist parties known as the Blue Coalition, the far-right Attack party and the populist right-wing Order, Law and Justice said on Wednesday they would back a GERB government even if they were given no ministerial posts. But the Blue Coalition, previously seen as the most likely governing partner to GERB, indicated it could not guarantee its support for a GERB cabinet for its full four-year mandate. "A minority government ... in times of crisis is an experiment, which should not be undertaken," Martin Dimitrov one of the leaders of the Blue Coalition said on Thursday. GERB has offered the three groupings a memorandum for political cooperation, whose main priorities were restoring the trust of the European Union, punishing corrupt officials and taking anti-crisis measures. Angry Bulgarians punished the outgoing Socialist-led government for its failure to make politicians, magistrates and crime bosses accountable as well as prevent job losses. The poorest EU nation has turned into the bloc's black sheep after Brussels cut its access to over half a billion euros in aid last year over fraud. Failing to show results in the next six months would lead to more sanct
