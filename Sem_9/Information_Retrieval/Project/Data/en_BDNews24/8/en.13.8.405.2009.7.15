 WASHINGTON, Jul 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Asia July 17-23, visiting India to try to deepen US-Indian ties and then Thailand for a regional conference, the State Department said on Tuesday. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly ruled out the possibility of Clinton making any side trips to Afghanistan or Pakistan, where US forces and allies are battling the Taliban and al Qaeda. Clinton, who said last month US-India ties were "past due for an upgrade", is set to arrive in Mumbai on July 17 where Kelly said she would meet a cross section of Indian society and remember the victims of last November's attacks on the country's financial capital. Clinton will then travel to New Delhi on July 19 to meet government leaders, opposition politicians, scientists and youth, before going on to Thailand where she is set to attend a regional meeting of Southeast Asian nations, Kelly said. North Korea, which is at loggerheads with the United States and others over its nuclear program, is expected to be a key topic during the meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), held in Thailand's Phuket resort.
