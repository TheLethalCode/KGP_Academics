 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)Prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh held their first bilateral talks on the sidelines of the NAM Summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh on Wednesday,against a backdrop of Bangladesh's concerns over India's planned Tipaimukh Dam and maritime boundaries. Hasina, who arrived in Egypt on Wednesday morning, expressed the hope that all contentious issues including the construction of the Tipaimukh Dam would be resolved through dialogue with India. Singh assured Hasina that India would not do anything that would be against Bangladesh's interests. The first summit between Hasina, who returned to power in January this year, and Singh, in his second stint in office, took place just a day after foreign minister Dipu Moni charged India with being "very aggressive" over sea border claims. Dipu Moni had also raised the Tipaimukh Dam issue in a separate meeting with Indian state minister for external relations Shashi Tharoor the previous day. She said that New Delhi should not proceed further without a comprehensive study involving Bangladesh. India's planned dam over the cross-border Barak River has raised environmental concerns for downstream regions, including Bangladesh. The Barak supplies waters to two rivers in Bangladesh, the Surma and Kushiara, the main sources of water to hundreds of water bodies in Bangladesh's northeastern Sylhet region. India says the project is aimed at generating power and would not divert or hold up water from the river. A Bangladeshi parliamentary delegation is expected to leave on July 29 to inspect the planned dam site in the Indian state of Monipur. The meeting between the two prime ministers, at the Maritim Jolie Villa Golf Resort on Wednesday evening, also touched on other bilateral as well as regional issues. Hasina and Singh hoped that relations between the two countries would be further strengthened in the days to come. 'VERY AGGRESSIVE' Dipu Moni, in her talks with Tharoor on Tuesday, had called India's baseline claim for delineating its sea border with Bangladesh "very aggressive". She urged New Delhi to change its maritime map immediately to reach an agreement between the two nations "as both are in need of resources at sea". Bangladesh and India have overlapping claims on the waters in the Bay of Bengal. At sea border talks with Bangaldesh in New Delhi earlier this year, India claimed a baseline for its sea boundary in such a way that it would make Bangladesh a sea-locked nation. India submitted a map of its sea boundary to the United Nations in May. NAM SUMMIT GETS UNDERWAY The two-day Non-Aligned Movement summit got underway on Wednesday at the Egyptian resort city, with the global economic recession high on the agenda. More than 50 heads of state and government are attending the summit, which was declared open by last year's summit chairperson Cuban president Raul Castro. Castro said the global economic downturn has its origins in wealthy countries and in the disparities that continue to exist in international economic systems. "All countries of the world must find ways to resolve the global economic crisis," Castro told the gathering. "We must streamline the world financial system to take into consideration the needs of developing countries," he said. Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak took over as chairperson of this year's summit, and opened with a call for international solidarity and peace. Mubarak appealed for a more equitable international political, economic and trade system. The NAM grouping was founded during the Cold War by countries not considering themselves formally aligned with or against any major power bloc in the world. bd
