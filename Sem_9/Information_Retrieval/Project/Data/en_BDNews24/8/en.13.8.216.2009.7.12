 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com)The future of the region is at stake with India's planned Tipaimukh Dam setting a 'bad precedent' for future developments that might cause huge environmental damage to the area, according to Indian environmental activist Ramananda Wangkheirakpam. Arousing public opposition to protest the Indian government's move to build the dam in the north-eastern state of Monipur has become urgent for the Monipuris as well as the Bangladeshis, who will be affected most by the downstream impact, said Ramananda. Ramananda, coordinator of Citizens' Concern for Dams and Development, spoke out against the dam during a recent interview with bdnews24.com while he joined other environmental activists who had travelled to Dhaka at the end of June to attend an informational seminar on the planned Tipaimukh Hydro Electric Power Project, over the cross-border Barak river. "As far as we know, India is all set to erect the dam at Tipaimukh. The government gave its formal technical and financial approval for its construction years back. Environmental clearance was also obtained in early 2009," said Ramananda. "The forest department clearance has yet to be approved, to our knowledge, after which there won't be any official bar to beginning work on the project." About the current state of the site at Tipaimukh, he said, some activities limited to construction of an approach road and other minor preparatory work is ongoing. "Tipaimukh, generally, has been a neglected area where government services and amenities have been absent or extremely limited. Therefore, they will have to construct roads first to access the area," Ramananda said. 'Nothing to see' Regarding a proposed visit by a Bangladesh parliamentary team to Tipaimukh, Ramananda said it is not certain what the team's visit would accomplish since they would find nothing on the ground. However, what might matter most at this time was louder, sterner and persistent protesting as the advocates for the dam are only awaiting forest department clearance. "It's up to us, the people, to see how we can mobilise ourselves and put up resistance, which should appear formidable to the Indian government in the next months and maybe years. "India has to take note of the fact that many groups in Bangladesh have been protesting the building of the dam for a long time." Ramananda said he feared Bangladesh might reach some sort of understanding or agreement on Tipaimukh based upon sharing power or water, without having all the data. "Then we'll all be compromised. "Bangladesh shouldn't give in to Indian pressure under any condition because I don't think there exists any complete assessment on the downstream impact of such a dam on Bangladesh. 'Bad precedent' "Once Bangladesh agrees to India's building the Tipaimukh Dam, it will set a bad precedent because more than one hundred dams are planned for construction in the northeast, which also has cumulative implications for Bangladesh." He said, not only India, but China too has been building dams upstream in the Brahmaputra. "It would be a Himalayan blunder on the part of the (Bangladesh) parliamentary team if it decides on Tipaimukh without fully understanding and addressing the downstream impacts. "Farrakka is already a bad reference point. You have so many complaints and grievances piling up through the past decadesall caused by the Farrakka. "If you make another wrong move on Tipaimukh, that would be a reference point. Take care before making another mistake, leaving another bad example," Ramananda said. For instance, Tipaimukh was only a flood control dam when it was converted into a hydroelectric project in 1999, he said. He added that another issue needing to be addressed is the land issuewhich is very important. "Defining the land rights of the villages, sites should emerge as a most sensitive issue. There are already conflicts between the upstream communities," he added. 'People's protest' "The only hurdles remaining then are the protests from the people of Monipur and Bangladesh, which may prevent the Indian government from implementing its plan. "As you build up the pressure here, we'll also be doing the same across the border. It is crucial for the Monipur people to also raise their voices against the dam," said Ramananda. "India has to listen to you and resolve Bangladesh's concerns, because everybody here seems to be raising protests against Tipaimukh as a single voice, despite their different political followings. "I said it sounded like one voice because all Bangladeshis are against the dam. Now you just have to continue raising your voice without any respite and, only in that case, India will realise that they cannot pretend they have not heard the voices of the Bangladeshi people." The Citizens' Concern for Dams and Development (CCDD) was established in 1999 as a forum consisting of popular movements, NGOs, academics, professionals, leading citizens and individuals from various communities. It was formed to promote development in which people and the environment remain at the centre of development efforts. bdn
