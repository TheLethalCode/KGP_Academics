<TITLE> Turnberry's track record sets up for Tiger </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TURNBERRY, Scotland, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Tiger Woods goes into this week's British Open as heavy favourite to clinch his 15th major crown on a Turnberry layout which has consistently rewarded the game's top players. Tom Watson, Greg Norman and Nick Price won the previous three editions held at the par-70 Ayrshire links course, each of the trio doing so when at the pinnacle of the sport. "(They) were some of the best ball strikers," Woods said in the build-up to Thursday's opening round, referring to the victory by Watson in 1977, Norman (1986) and Price (1994). "At this golf course you can understand why. You really do have to hit your ball well here. You just can't fake it around this golf course. You have to hit good golf shots." Peter Dawson, chief executive of Open organisers the R&A, echoed the widespread feeling that Turnberry could become another successful hunting ground for Woods. "The three winners we've had in the past were arguably the number one player in the world each time," he said. "Whether that will be repeated this week remains to be seen but he (Woods) is the man to beat." Comfortably the greatest player of his era and possibly of all time, Woods is well versed in the art of winning majors. He has always been meticulous in his preparation and has long relished the challenge of links-course golf. A winner of three British Opens, he is looking forward to tackling the Ailsa course. "The course is fantastic and in great shape," Woods, 33, said. "The rough is up a little bit and we haven't had the big winds yet. "Any time you have a chance to lift the Claret Jug it's special. It's been special for me three times and hopefully I can do it again." Woods, who won his first British Open at St Andrews in 2000 before enjoying further success at the same layout in 2005 and at Hoylake in 2006, has been installed as a 9/4 favourite by British bookmakers William Hill. Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Britons Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood are next best at 28/1. RARE HAT-TRICK Irishman Padraig Harrington, although bidding for a rare hat-trick of British Open titles, is rated at 40/1 mainly because of a dismal run of form this season. While Woods always commands the attention of most of his rivals, Swede Henrik Stenson likes his own chances in the third major of the year. "Obviously Tiger's the number one player," said world number eight Stenson. "He's won so many championships and he's just a fantastic, strong player. "There have been times when he was definitely considered to be unbeatable and, if enough people consider it that way, it's going to be harder to beat him. "But he still can be beaten on any occasion, I think," added the winner of May's unofficial fifth major, the Players Championship in Florida. "I've seen him play ping pong, he's not superhuman. "There's definitely a number of names that could beat him and I hope to consider myself one of them." Turnberry is widely regarded as the most picturesque venue on the championship rota with the lighthouse behind the 14th green its landmark symbol. Eight of its holes hug the rugged coastline with the iconic Ailsa Craig, rising like some ancient sea monster from the murky depths, keeping close watch off shore with the Isle of Arran lurking further in the distance. "The rough is very lush at the bottom and if you hit it in there it's going to be a big struggle this week," said Harrington who has missed his last five cuts on the PGA and European tours. "It definitely suits somebody who's going to drive the ball very well. It's a long course, especially if there's a little bit of wind. You're definitely going to have to hit driver and you're going to have to hit it strai
