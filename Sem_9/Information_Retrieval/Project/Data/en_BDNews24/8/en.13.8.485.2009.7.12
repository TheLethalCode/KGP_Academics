 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)If a two-child per family goal can be sustained in the coming decades, Bangladesh could see a controlled population growth with dramatic shifts in the average ages of its citizens, and reduce burden on the land in one of the world's most densely populated countries, according to a recently released study. Professor MA Mabud of North South University's department of life sciences, also President of the Organisation for Population and Poverty Alleviation (OPPA), in a study unveiled last month, noted that Bangladesh currently has an estimated 148 million people squeezed into 55000 sq miles. Additionally, 2.3 million people are being born each year, further aggravating the human-land ratio and straining the labour market. However, projections for the next one hundred years paint a different picture. For instance, if Bangladesh can achieve the two-children family goal between 2015 and 2021, and sustain it over time, there would be a significant shift in the age of the population. For example, the population under five years and between five to 14 years would begin decreasing and the size of the working age population of 15-64 years, and the elderly population of 65 years and older, would increase. This would result in the size of the working age population, 15-64 years, to double as it grows from 74 million in 2001 to 149 million in 2051. Mabud revealed the statistics at a June 28 seminar at the university, attended by the prime minister's health adviser, Syed Moddaser Ali, vice chancellor Prof Hafiz A Siddiqui, and UNDP country director Arthur Erken. Bangladesh's population, claimed Mabud, could expect to stabilise anytime between 2068-2072 and would reach a zero population growth rate during 2075-2078, provided the country achieves the two-children goal by 2015-2021. Of note, said Mabud, is that the population density would be 4,500 persons per square mile in the middle of this century. Also, by the middle of the century, 50% of the population would be living in urban areas, as opposed to 27% at present. Mabud urged policies be set in place to encourage the development of peripheral towns and cities with all modern facilities to prevent a rural migration to the capital and port cities and ensure a balanced distribution of urban-rural population. At the same time, he believes it is necessary to relocate industry from larger cities and towns to minimize the congestion in cities, restrict car imports and encourage public transportation facilit
