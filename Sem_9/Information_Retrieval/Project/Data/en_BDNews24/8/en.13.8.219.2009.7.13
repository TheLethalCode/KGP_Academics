 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government is expected to decide soon on paying higher prices for sugarcane to encourage farmers, and will continue concentrating on increased ethanol production to make government-owned sugar mills profitable, industries minister Dilip Barua has said. "Root-level farmers have told me that they were discouraged since they were not getting the right prices. That's why we are going to procure at a higher price", Barua told bdnews24.com on Sunday. "A decision will be taken on this issue during the next month," he predicted. Sugarcane procurement costs during this past season were Tk 64.30 per maund. Fifteen government-owned sugar mills produced 80,000 MT sugar during the last season. However, sugar output had been more than double, at 163,000 MT during the season before last, according to sources within the industry ministry. The domestic demand for sugar is forecast at 1,400,000 MT this year The demand will be partially met from the government-owned mills along with 900,000 MT from four private sector sugar refinery plants. The remaining demand will be met from imports. Asked about the effect of higher sugarcane procurement prices on sugar prices in the market, Barua said, "We will see about that later." Currently, the price of sugar is Tk 33 per kg from government sugar mills. Meanwhile, greater distillery production is being mulled to make government-owned sugar mills profitable. Barua said, "Only Carews produces ethanol. We are considering ethanol production at the rest of the mills." However, this will be decided after a review, he added. bd
