 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jul 13 (bdnews24.com)The central bank is set to fix the agriculture loan distribution target for all banks at a record Tk 11,500 crore by creating new sectors in the 2009-10 fiscal year, the governor says. "The whopping amount will have an aim to make the country self-dependant in food through boosting farm produce," said Atiur Rahman, speaking exclusively to bdnews24.com on Monday He said that agriculture and rural loan regulations and the farm credit disbursement goal would be announced on Tuesday. "In the upcoming agriculture and rural loan regulations, a number of new sectors have been created new food storages under the loan coverage will be encouraged, sharecroppers will be allowed access to loan without deposit and loans for producing spices," the governor said. "Bangladesh Bank will strictly monitor if the banks are properly disbursing farm loans," the central bank chief said and added that there would be separate monitoring cells in each bank. In the past 2008-09 fiscal year, agriculture loan distribution goal was at Tk 9,389 crore, of which over Tk 8,350 crore was distributed in 11 months (July-May). According to the central bank figure, in FY 2007-08 banks had dispensed over Tk 8,580 crore loan, Tk 272 crore more than the target. Finance minister A M A Muhith in his budget speech on June 11, however, had said that the agro loan distribution goal would be set at Tk 10,000 crore. The idea of bringing the food storages construction under the loan distribution coverage was conceived to help farmers to store their produces and sell them at a favourable time, Rahman said. The banks will have the freedom to give loans for construction of food storages beyond farm loans, the governor said. "We are to import many items beyond food and a great deal of foreign currency is spent on importing spices. The new regulations will require banks to extend credit to the farmers so they can produce spices." According to the information of Bangladesh Bank agro loan and special programme department, around Tk 9,000 crore farm credit has been determined for state-owned commercial banks Sonali, Janata and Agrani and two specialised banks Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank. And the loan disbursement target for private and foreign-owned banks has been set at Tk 2,500 crore. The governor said the new regulations will ask the private banks that have not branched out in rural areas to disburse the farm loan through Bangladesh Krishi Bank or Rajshahi Krishi Unyan Bank or designated NGOs. Nearly Tk 7,780 crore had been fixed for three state-owned commercial banks and two specialised banks in agro loan disbursement goal in the FY 2007-08. For the private and foreign-owned banks it was Tk 1,600 crore. The central bank last year made it mandatory for all national and foreign banks to distribute farm loan. bdn
