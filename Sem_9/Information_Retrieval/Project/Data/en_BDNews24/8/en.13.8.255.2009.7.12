<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader Sunday announced a shake up in arrangements at all domestic and international airports in a bid to reduce hassles encountered by travellers. Quader ordered separate desks for customs and immigration and security and streamlining of the Green Channel. He also asked police to ensure the end of harassment of passengers outside the airport. "The government will not tolerate any negligence of these orders. Special magistrates on duty at the airport will take immediate action against the guilty and departmental action will be followed up," he said. The orders came following a meeting at the ministry of civil aviation and tourism. Tax departments, customs, immigration and expatriates' welfare activities will be separated and made subject to special monitoring and observation, he said. Authorities will also monitor baggage handling, taxi hiring and other transport facilities for passengers to ensure better services. He said the police and other concerned agencies had been informed of the upcoming changes. Quader also said steps had already been taken against any unofficial 'groups' working within the country's airports. "Though the situation has improved in this regard, tougher steps will be taken from now if irregularities in dealing with passengers are uncovered," he said. Labour and employment, expatriates' welfare and overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and expatriates' welfare secretary Ataharul Islam also attended the meeting. b
