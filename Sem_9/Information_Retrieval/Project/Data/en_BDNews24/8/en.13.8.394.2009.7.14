 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's parliamentary delegation, selected to inspect India's planned Tipaimukh dam site, will leave on July 29, a government official said Tuesday. A 10-member parliamentary panel, headed by the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources ministry Abdur Razzaq, will go to India to gather data on India's proposed dam over the cross-border Barak river in the northeastern state of Monipur. "The parliamentary team will leave Dhaka on July 29," state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahamud told reporters Tuesday. Six MPsfour from Awami League, one from Jatiya Party and one from Bangladesh Jaamat-e-Islamione water expert and three government officials, have been selected for the delegation in a draft list prepared by the government, Abdur Razzaq told bdnews24.com. Regarding the BNP's inclusion in the team, Razzaq said the main opposition party was "playing politics" with the issue. "The BNP chief whip met with me about inclusion of their MPs but they are not providing the names, so I don't know whether BNP members will be inducted in the team." Aside form Razzaq, the members of the team so far include: ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader MP (JP), Abdur Rahman MP (AL), A K M Fazlul Haq MP (AL), ABM Anwarul Haq MP (AL), Hamidur Rahman Azad MP (BJI), Prof Monwar Hossain of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission, the water resources secretary and a director general of the foreign ministry. India invited a parliamentary delegation from Dhaka to visit the site of the contentious project as Bangladeshi environmentalists, media and public have voiced concerns that the dam will cause environmental disaster to downstream regions, including Bangladesh. India says the project is aimed at generating power and would not divert or hold up water from the river. Many in India's Monipur are also in opposition to the project saying the dam would make displace thousands of people. The Barak river supplies waters to two rivers in Bangladesh, the Surma and Kushiara, the main sources of water to hundreds of water bodies in the greater Sylhet region and which in turn feed the mighty Jamuna river.
