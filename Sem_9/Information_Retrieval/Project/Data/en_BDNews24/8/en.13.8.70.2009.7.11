 Kurigram, July 10 (bdnews24.com)The erection of Tipaimukh dam across the Barak will be resisted by people if it runs counter to Bangladesh's interests, the water resources minister said on Friday. "None will be allowed to do anything harmful to Bangladesh. India cannot erect Tipaimukh Dam without our consent," Ramesh Chandra Sen asserted. "Our parliamentary delegation will go to India on July 15 [to visit the dam site]. They will visit [the site] to survey and get all data," he told reporters after visiting river erosion-hit areas in Kurigram. "A decision on the issue will come only after the experts examine those." Embankments along with other permanent protection system will be taken to prevent the river erosion, he said. In addition, rivers will be dredged in the current fiscal year. The minister said work to dig 280 kilometres strech from Chilmari to Chandpur in Kurigram will start this fiscal year to restore navigability in the rivers.

He visited the erosion-hit area from 8:30am to 7pm, and listened to problems raised by locals. He left for Lalmonirhat at 8pm.
