 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina paid tribute to her father and independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Saturday to mark his historic March 7 speech, a celebrated turning point in the nation's history. On this day in 1971, Mujib's fiery address at Ramna Race Course called for independence: "Ebarer sangram amader muktir sangram, ebarer sangram swadhinatar sangram (this time the struggle is for freedom, this time the struggle is for independence)". In his address, Sheikh Mujib made specific charges against the Pakistani martial law authorities, which failed to transfer power to elected representatives after a landslide victory for his party Awami League in the 1970 election. The day set the stage for the liberation warfought and won in 1971. Hasina, with party leaders including cabinet members, laid flowers at Mujib's portrait at Bangabandhu Museum in Dhanmondi at around 7am. Party presidium member Tofail Ahmed said: "Bangabandhu's speech was the inspiration for our liberation war. We fought long nine months for liberation." "The country is again facing conspiracy," he said, in reference to the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny that many have speculated had 'external linkages'. "We have to be united in fighting against it." Fellow presidium member Abdur Razzak echoed him: "We must thwart the conspiracy against democracy." Hasina was expected to join a discussion at the Engineers' Institute in the afternoon to mark the day. AL's associated organisations were also paying tribute to Sheikh Mujib on the day. bdnew
