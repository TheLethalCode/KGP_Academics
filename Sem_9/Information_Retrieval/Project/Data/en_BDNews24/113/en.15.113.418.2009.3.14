 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  Four of the Basundhara fire victims were identified up to early hours Saturday. At least seven died after Bashundhara City, Bangladesh's largest shopping mall, turned into a towering inferno in the heart of the capital on Friday with flames engulfing the corporate offices on the upper floors. Bashundhara Group security officer Baki Billah died of critical burn injuries at 4:30pm Friday at the nearby Samarita Hospital, said hospital spokesperson Pradip Kumar Bhowmik. Six other bodies were lying in the DMCH morgue in the early hours of Saturday. Their charred bodies were retrieved from the 17th and the 10th floors, police said. Bashundhara fire supervisor Bashiruddin said early Saturday they identified another three bodies. All three were Basundhara employees: fire supervisor Harunur Rashid (48), general supervisor Mohammad Ali (55) and electrician Ibrahim Mandal (37). Another three Basundhara employees were also reported missing by relatives, though it could not be confirmed that they were among the dead. The three still missing were: Basundhara fireman Anisur Rahman Babu (22), painter Md Renu (27) and tiler Md Hamidul (25). Basundhara employees face aftermath, media barred Hundreds of people were seen milling in front of Basundhara City Saturday, though the mall was closed to the public and media were barred from entering. Shop owners and Basundhara employees were being allowed in to deal with the fire's aftermath. A Bashundhara Group official, however, ordered employees who were talking to the media not to make any further comments to the press. Bashundhara security men also reportedly obstructed members of the media who were trying to get information about the fire's aftermath and trail of damage. Blaze raged for seven hours The blaze that started around 1:30pm had died down toward late evening after firemen spent over five hours fighting raging flames that spread up and down the top floors of the 20-storied building, trapping many inside. bdnews24.com correspondents saw the fire still being battled in places at 8:40pm, but the country's chief fire fighter said the blaze was brought under control at around 9pm. Fire Brigade chief Abu Nayeem Mohammed Shahidullah told reporters that five floors, from the 15th to 19th, were burnt to a shell and the 14th was partially destroyed by the inferno. Bashundhara Group executive director Zahidur Rahman said the blaze started on the 18th floor and spread down to the 13th and up to the 20th, gutting those storeys including chairman Ahmed Akber Sobhan's office on the 19th floor. There was no report of damage to shops in the complex, as the fire did not reach the lower floors, he added. Probe ordered A three-member investigation committee was formed to look into the cause of the fire, its rapid spread and its handling. 'South Asia's largest' The owners of Basundhara City, opened to the public in August 2004, claim it is the largest shopping mall in South Asia and the 12th largest in the world. The building is 20 storeys high, with the first 8 floors holding over 2,000 retail stores and cafeterias. Other floors also house a multiplex cinema, gymnasiums with swimming pools. The upper floors are used as the corporate headquarters of the Bashundhara Group. Mall closed to public Sat, Sun The mall will remain closed to the public on Saturday and Sunday, said an official. General secretary of Basundhara's shop owners association, Khalilur Rahman, said only they and the building's other workers would be allowed to enter the premises during the period. Rahman said none of the shops were damaged in the fire that engulfed the upper floors though some merchandise was damaged to due to water poured in to extinguish the fire. bdnews24.com/pc/
