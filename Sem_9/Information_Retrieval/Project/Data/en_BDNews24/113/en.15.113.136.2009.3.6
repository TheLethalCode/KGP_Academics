<TITLE> Don't abandon Pakistan pleads Younis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Younis Khan said terrorism would be the victor if cricket teams do not play against Pakistan in the future. "I can only plead to everyone don't abandon Pakistan now or try to isolate it. If this mistake is made, terrorism will have won in Pakistan," Younis told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The 31-year-old said cricket was a binding force for young and old in the country. "We don't have much to cheer about and if you stop cricket activities you are encouraging young minds to be influenced by these militants". Investigators suspect the involvement of home-grown militants in Tuesday's ambush on the Sri Lankan team bus 500 metres from the Gaddafi stadium, where they were playing the second test against Pakistan. Seven Pakistanis -- six policemen and the driver of the coach carrying the match officials -- were killed in the attack which also left six Sri Lankan players and two team officials wounded. British match referee Chris Broad and Australian umpire Simon Taufel have since described the security for officials as inadequate, saying they were abandoned by Pakistan security forces when the gunmen opened fire. Younis said he was surprised the International Cricket Council (ICC) had allowed the pair to make damaging statements about Pakistan's security plan and cricket. "Foreign teams have been coming here since 9/11 and the security plan has worked. This incident could have happened anywhere in the world. It is unfortunate but to blame Pakistan for this is unacceptable," he added. The Pakistan Cricket Board said on Thursday it would lodge a complaint with the ICC over Broad's remarks
