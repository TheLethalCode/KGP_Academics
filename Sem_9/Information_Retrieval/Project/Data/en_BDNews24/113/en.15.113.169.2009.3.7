 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  The National Volleyball League, sponsored by Rangs Group, will get underway on March 17 in Narail with 320 clubs from 16 districts taking part in the meet being staged after seven years. Districts with the financial assistance from the Bangladesh Volleyball Federation will first hold local leagues and later champions from each of the 16 districts will qualify for the finals expected to be held in the last week of April. "First, we are holding the league in 16 districts due to lack of funds, but we hope to take it to the remaining 48 districts in three phases in the next two years," said BVF general secretary Ashiqur Rahman Miku at a press conference at the NSC conference room Saturday. "It is tough for the district sports associations to hold the league regularly that is why we have extended our hands to provide them Tk 20,000 for the local league. "The sponsor Rangs Group assured that they would offer us more help to hold the second phase league with 32 districts, which we plan to do in November," Miku added. It is expected nearly 3,840 players will be engaged in the first-phase league in 16 districts. Rangs Group chairman Abdur Rouf Chowdhury and BVF vice-president Iftekhar Ahmed were also present. Sixteen districts are Narail, Kusthia (March 18), Satkhira (March 20), Jessore (March 22), Rajshahi (March 23), Chapainawabganj (March 25), Bogra (March 27), Gaibandha (March 29), Tangail (March 31), Gazipur (April 1), Narayanganj (April 3), Bhola (April 4), Cox's Bazar (April 7), Chittagong (April 9), Noakhali (April 10) and Comilla (April 11). bd
