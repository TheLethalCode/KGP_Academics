 BELFAST, Sun Mar 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Political leaders and former foes said on Sunday the killing of two British soldiers by gunmen in Northern Ireland would not be allowed to throw the province back into a new cycle of violence. Gunmen shot the soldiers as they picked up pizzas at the gates of an army base near Antrim on Saturday night. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack but it was widely suspected to be the work of a republican splinter group. "Their intention is to bring British soldiers back onto the streets. They want to destroy the progress of recent times and to plunge Ireland back into conflict," said Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, for years the face of opposition to British rule in Northern Ireland. The attack was one of the worst acts of bloodshed since the signing of a peace deal in 1998 that stemmed decades of sectarian and political violence. It followed a police warning last week that the threat from splinter groups from the Irish Republican Army was again high. Four people, including two pizza delivery men, were wounded in the shooting. The victims were collecting the pizza at the Massereene base near Antrim, 15 miles northwest of Belfast, when the gunmen pulled up in a vehicle and opened fire. After an initial burst of gunfire, the attackers walked up and shot the victims as they lay on the ground, Irish state broadcaster RTE said. The two soldiers who were killed were in their 20s and due to fly out for duty in Afghanistan. The 1998 Good Friday peace accord ended 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland in which more than 3,000 people were killed but sporadic violence, much of it crime-linked, has continued. The IRA, which sought a united Ireland and drew support from the minority Roman Catholic community, and pro-British Protestant guerrilla groups agreed to ceasefires under the deal. "Those responsible (for the attack) have no support, no strategy to achieve a United Ireland," Sinn Fein's Adams said in a statement. "Our responsibility is to defend the peace process and the progress that has been made to achieving national and democratic rights." Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson said an IRA splinter group was likely to be behind the attack. "We are talking about people who do not have public support and crazies with guns in their hands. Whether it's the Real IRA or the Continuity IRA they need to be defeated," he told Sky News. The violence appeared to be a tactic to provoke a reaction from loyalists to British rule, said Pete Shirlow, senior lecturer at Queen's University Belfast School of Law. "The main threat is how the loyalists will react to this. It shows you how fragile the peace process could be," he said. But there would need to be a sustained level of new violence for the peace process to risk breakdown, Shirlow said. "I don't think we can go back to what we had (in the Troubles) but it creates unease, it creates uncertainty." NO TROOPS BACK ON STREET Former IRA activist and prisoner Anthony McIntyre said he believed between four and six dissident groups existed. They believed they had the right to fight British rule with arms, he told Sky News, but: "They don't have the resources, they don't have the strategic intelligence, they don't have the support, they simply cannot succeed.." Northern Ireland Police Chief Sir Hugh Orde said troops would not be deployed back on the streets and police strategy would not change. Britain and Ireland, joint peace mediators, both condemned the attack. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it an "evil and cowardly" action. "No murder will be able to derail a peace process that has the support of the vast majority of the people of N.Ireland and we will step our efforts to make the peace process one that lasts and endures," he said in a broadcast statement. Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said: "A tiny group of evil people cannot and will not undermine the will of the people... to live in peace together." Nationalist politicians had reacted angrily last week to the reports that members of Britain's Special Reconnaissance Regiment had returned to the province. The worst attack since the 1998 agreement occurred just months after the signing when a car bomb in the market town of Omagh killed 29 people. The Real IRA claimed responsibility
