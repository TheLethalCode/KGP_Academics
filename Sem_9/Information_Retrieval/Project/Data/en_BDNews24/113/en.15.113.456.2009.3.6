 MILAN, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Serie A ahead of this weekend's matches. AC Milan's David Beckham is hoping his loan deal is extended before Sunday's home game with Atalanta (1400 GMT).

Beckham would then go back to Galaxy before returning to Milan towards the end of the year. "There is still nothing official," a Milan spokeswoman said, but an announcement is expected later on Friday or Saturday. Kaka again misses out for third-placed Milan with a foot injury while Ronaldinho is doubtful with a knock and defender Giuseppe Favalli is suspended. Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho will revert to his favoured starting lineup for Saturday's tricky trip to Genoa (1700). Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will lead the line for the Serie A leaders having been rested for Wednesday's 3-0 Italian Cup semi-final first leg defeat at Sampdoria. Forward Mario Balotelli has recovered after colliding with the post on Wednesday. Second-placed Juventus are without suspended centre back Nicola Legrottaglie for Saturday's derby with Torino (1930) so Olof Mellberg is poised to deputise. Francesco Totti looks certain to skip AS Roma's home game with Udinese on Saturday (1500) as he bids to shake off a knee problem ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Arsenal. Roma's striker problems continue with Mirko Vucinic suffering a bad back while Julio Baptista and Jeremy Menez have flu. Fiorentina in fourth host Palermo on Sunday (1400) without suspended fullback Juan Manuel Vargas
