 KARACHI, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad wants the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ban match referee Chris Broad for criticising security after Sri Lanka's team were attacked by gunmen in Lahore on Tuesday. "The ICC must ban Broad from standing in any matches. He has intentionally tried to damage the image of Pakistan and isolate it as a cricket nation," Miandad, a member of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), told Reuters on Friday. Former England player Broad was travelling behind the team in another coach and his driver was killed in the ambush. Six policemen also died in the attack and six Sri Lanka players and two team officials were wounded. Broad told a news conference on Wednesday that he and his colleagues were left like "sitting ducks" due to lack of security during the attack. His comments were discussed on Friday at a governing body meeting of the PCB. "He is twisting things. He is trying to scare away teams from playing in Pakistan," Miandad said. The PCB plans to lodge a protest with the ICC about Broad and a board official said the letter, which was discussed at the meeting, would be soon sent. Another former Pakistan skipper, Ramiz Raja, said if Broad had reservations about the security arrangements he should have conveyed them to the ICC instead of going public. "His comments are unfortunate and have hurt Pakistan cricket," Raja said. Tauqir Zia, former chairman of the PCB, said Broad "should not be welcomed in Pakistan anymore for any assignment". The PCB decided at Friday's meeting to set up a security department and hire a security advisor to ensure a safe environment for visiting teams in the future and for its domestic cricket. PCB chairman Ejaz Butt added that the board would be taking out life insurance on Pakistan players. "The incident will affect Pakistan cricket and its home series schedules but we need to take more steps to satisfy other boards and visiting players and officials that it is safe to play in Pakistan," Butt told reporters
