 PARIS, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Ligue 1 ahead of this weekend's matches: Lille will set a crowd record for a Ligue 1 game when they host leaders Olympique Lyon in front of 79,500 spectators at the Stade de France on Saturday (2000 GMT). Last season, the northern side hosted Lyon near Paris in front of 77,840 fans. Their long-awaited new stadium is due to be ready in 2012. Lille went through to the French Cup quarter-finals with a 3-2 win over Lyon on Wednesday. Lyon will field their best possible team against Lille four days before they visit Barcelona in the Champions League. France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and Brazil midfielder Juninho are set to start the game after being rested from the French Cup this week. Striker Karim Benzema is fit after recovering from a sore hip. The leaders still face problems at right back with Francois Clerc and Anthony Reveillere just back in training after long-term knee injuries while Ghana's John Mensah is out of action with a thigh problem. Second-placed Paris St Germain will be without captain Claude Makelele and in-form playmaker Stephane Sessegnon, both suspended, when they visit Lorient on Saturday (1800). Promising centre back Mamadou Sakho is doubtful with a sore ankle. Lorient welcome back their top scorer Kevin Gameiro. The striker, who has seven goals this season, had been sidelined for two weeks after a knee injury. Third-placed Olympique Marseille will be without Bakary Kone when they take on strugglers Valenciennes on Saturday (1800). The Ivory Coast forward sprained an ankle during last weekend's 1-0 win at Caen. Girondins Bordeaux visit local rivals Toulouse without Fernando on Saturday (1800). The Brazilian midfielder is suspended for four games because of his rude behaviour towards the referee during last month's 3-0 win at Paris St Germain in a French League Cup semi-final
