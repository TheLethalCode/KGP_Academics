 EL FASHER, Sudan, Sun Mar 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir flew into Darfur on Sunday to rally supporters in defiance of criticism for his shutdown of aid agencies running a huge humanitarian relief effort. Sudan expelled 13 foreign aid groups and shut down three local organisations saying they helped the International Criminal Court (ICC), which last week issued an arrest warrant for Bashir over charges he masterminded atrocities in Darfur.

"While some 85 international NGOs (non-governmental organisations) operate in Darfur, without these organisations much of the aid operation literally comes to a halt," the statement said. Aid officials have warned the expulsions will hit other turbulent areas of northern Sudan, particularly in areas along the contested border with the country's semi-autonomous south. The expulsions did not affect aid programmes in southern Sudan. Despite heavy security, Bashir put himself in some personal danger by visiting El Fasher, analysts said.
