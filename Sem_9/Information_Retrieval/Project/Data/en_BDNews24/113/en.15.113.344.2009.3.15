 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina met with ruling Awami League members at her political office in Dhanmondi Saturday after a long break, an aide said. The meeting decided to hold discussions to mark independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's birth anniversary and National Children and Youth Day on Mar 17 at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim will lead a delegation to Tungipara on Mar 17 to pay respects to the grave of Sheikh Mujib. The meeting also decided to organise a discussion on the occasion of Mar 26 National Day in the city on Mar 27. The AL Central Working Committee would meet at Hasina's political office on Mar 28, he added. The meeting was part of her schedule to meet the party supporters and the people on Saturdays, Azad said. Members of presidium, working committee and representatives of the divisional sub-committees attended the meeting. Hasina held such meetings on Jan 31 and Feb 7 on being prime minister. The aide said the AL president could not meet people since because of circumstances unavoidable. Azad told reporters that the prime minister briefly visited the fire-ravaged complex of Bashundhara City in the afternoon on her way to the office. She inquired about the progress of investigations into Friday's incident that left at least seven dead. bdnew
