 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked opposition leader Khaleda Zia to give the investigators any evidence she has on the BDR mutiny. "She (Khaleda) has said she has evidence on this incident. I am entreating her to hand it over to the probe committee," Hasina said at a March 7 programme Saturday. The prime minister vowed again that all who were linked to the BDR bloodbath would be punished. "Army officers were killed in a plot to push the country into civil war," she said. Pointing a finger at the main opposition BNP, she said, "Those who came to power through bloodshed after [Aug. 15, 1975 military putsch] are plotting again now. "Their game has not finished." She asked all to be united to overcome the crisis. "The people have to be cautious, avoid conflict and go forward patiently without being misguided by allegations and rumour in this difficult time." She expressed sympathy with the bereaved families of the slain army officers. Daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who was killed after independence, Hasina said, "I lost 18 people, including my parents and brothers, in 1975. I perceive these families' woe and pain." "I, as head of government, tried to save them (mutiny victims)," the prime minister said. "I concentrated mainly on saving people and averting civil war. I called chiefs of three services and discussed with them. "I saved 43 army officers and their families." She urged restraint on all parts, avoiding violent path and said, "It took place just when people were relieving a bit." Hasina was speaking at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh to mark Sheikh Mujib's historic March 7, 1971 call for independence at Ramna Race Course, now Suhrawardy Udyan. Senior Awami League leaders were present. bdn
