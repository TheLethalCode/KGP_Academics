 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak's issue of playing in the ongoing Premier Cricket League hangs in the balance as Bangladesh Biman struck to their stance of playing him in their side. Razzak was kept outside the pool list before the inter-club players' transfer and Biman signed him up though at that time Razzak was suspended for his bowling action by the International Cricket Council. He has now been cleared by the ICC to bowl in international cricket. Razzak, who given permission to bowl in the Twenty20 League, was later brought under the pool, leaving Biman with four pool players instead of three. Other clubs opposed allowing Razzak playing for the national flag carrier. But Biman are determined not to release Razzak to other teams and they have appealed to the BCB president on Saturday. "The team's high-ups appealed for Razzak to the board president and are now awaiting for his decision," Biman captain Sanwar Hossain told bdnews24.com on Saturday on the verge of their tenth round game. Sanwar, however, confirmed that Razzak would not be able to play in the round. However, it is learned that before the start of their game, the board had informed Biman that Razzak would be treated as a pool player after his suspension withdrawal, but Biman disagreed. Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting Club have showed an interest in Razzak however Biman refused to release the spinner. bdnew
