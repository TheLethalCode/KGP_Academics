 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  Eight more have been arrested or shown arrested in the Peelkhana mutiny case bringing the total to 42 so far. CID investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand said two more suspected mutineers were arrested from the BDR headquarters Saturday. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Faisal Atiq Bin Quadir also showed six detained suspects as arrested in the case, Akhand added. Another seven, including a BDR cook, were shown arrested Friday, CMM court recording officer Khandaker Eklasur Rahman told bdnews24.com. Twenty-two BDR members, who were detained from Tangail while fleeing the Peelkhana headquarters, were shown arrested on Thursday by the same court. The first to be arrested in the case was one of the alleged ringleaders of the mutiny DAD Touhidul Alam, along with four others, on Mar 3 (Tuesday). The CMM court placed Touhid and the four in remand on Mar 4, giving the Criminal Investigation Department seven days to question them. Lalbagh police filed the case on Feb 28 against more than 1,000 BDR members for the Feb 25-26 armed uprising at their Peelkhana headquarters that left at least 62 army officers dead or missing.
