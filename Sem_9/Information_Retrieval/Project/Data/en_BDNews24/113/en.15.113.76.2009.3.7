 Pradip Choudhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com) Sixty-eight year-old scientist Shamsul Alam Panna recalls the historic March 7 speech by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, saying that he has never seen so many people captivated by the words of one person. "When Bangabandhu raised his finger to the sky and told millions present that this was our movement for independence, the notion of freedom seemed very real," Panna told bdnews24.com on Saturday. On March 7 1971, Mujib's fiery address at Ramna Race Course was a turning point in Bangladesh's history, calling as it did for independence: "Ebarer sangram amader muktir sangram, ebarer sangram swadhinatar sangram (this time the struggle is for freedom, this time the struggle is for independence)". In his address, Sheikh Mujib made specific charges against the Pakistani martial law authorities, which failed to transfer power to elected representatives after a landslide victory for his party Awami League in the 1970 election. The day set the stage for the liberation warfought and won in 1971. Shamsul Alam Panna, then a 21 year-old researcher, is now retired after working for four decades at the then Pakistan and later Bangladesh Science Laboratory Institute. Recounting the days leading up to the liberation war, he said that on March 4, he along with two of his associates, Dr Aminuddin and Dr Siddik Ahmed got together, raised money and started to write banners in protest against the Pakistan authorities. "The next day we brought out a protest rally that went from Nilkhet-Shaheed Minar to Hatkhola and from there it came back to Science Laboratory via Motijheel, Press Club and Shahbagh," he recalled. "On March 7, people from all walks of life came to the Race Course grounds and as we arrived we saw a helicopter was circling above," recalled Panna. "The people below were feared an aerial attack." Panna said his name was on the list of intellectuals to be killed on December 4, but since his name was similar to another, he was saved. "Dr Aminuddin and Dr Siddik Ahmed were killed," he said. In Aug 15, 1975, just four years after the dream of independence was realised, Mujib himself was killed in a military coup along with members of his family. Panna lamented that Mujib's ideals were yet to be realised to the full. bdnews24
