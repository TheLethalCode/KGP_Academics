<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  A 71 MW generation unit of Baghabari Power Plant has been shut for nine days on a lack of gas supply, an official said Friday. The unit was closed on Mar 5 amid fears that mechanical fault might develop if the 100 and 71 MW units run together, Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman, manager and engineer of the plant, said. When the two units ran simultaneously, the 71MG power unit vibrated terribly, he added. The units together produced 11 percent less than their capacity, the official said. Gas supply of Western Zone Gas Company falls sharply after 2pm after rising from 3am to 2pm since the closure. So it had been impossible for them to re-run the unit, Akhataruzzaman also said. The gas-fired plant has been facing various problems including lubricating oil leakage since its installation. The government set up 71-MW unit at a cost of Tk 186 crore in 1991 and 100-MW unit at over Tk 133 crore in 2001. bdne
