 NEW DELHI, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. The sources of reports are in brackets. Mayawati, the chief of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), an organisation of lower caste voters strong in the potentially swing state of Uttar Pradesh, has said her party would fight the election alone (All newspapers). The move signals the difficulty the "Third Front", a loose coalition of smaller parties that pitches itself as an alternative to the ruling Congress and opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, will have in uniting before the general election. Mayawati is a candidate for the post of prime minister if the Third Front wins enough number of seats. The Communists Party of India (Marxist), India's largest leftist organisation, will release its election manifesto on Monday around 0630 GMT. The communists are the driving force behind the "Third Front". The communist manifesto is unlikely to mention measures to push financial reforms or liberalisation, and is expected to stress on a more independent foreign policy
