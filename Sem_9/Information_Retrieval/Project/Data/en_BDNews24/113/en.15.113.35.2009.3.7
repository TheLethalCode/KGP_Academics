 PORT OF SPAIN, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Andrew Strauss struck his third century of the series to lift England to 258 for two on the first day of the fifth and final test against West Indies on Friday. England, trailing 1-0, need to win in Trinidad to avoid their first series defeat by West Indies since 1998. On another slow wicket Strauss (139 not out) batted with excellent concentration and was well supported by Paul Collingwood who was unbeaten on 54 at the close. West Indies, chasing their first series victory since beating Bangladesh in 2004, surprisingly dropped spinner Sulieman Benn and played an extra batsman in Lendl Simmons. An ankle injury robbed the hosts of paceman Jerome Taylor and, with replacement Lionel Baker bowling medium-fast, the attack looked unthreatening. Coach John Dyson defended the omission of Benn as "horses for courses", given the spinner has only thrived when the wicket has offered bounce and turn, which the selectors do not expect to see at the Queen's Park Oval. Whatever the rationale, the result was part-time seamer Brendan Nash was in action before lunch, one of six bowlers skipper Chris Gayle turned to in the opening session. Daren Powell, who has struggled throughout the series, had the added responsibility of taking the new ball and he delivered an early breakthrough when opener Alastair Cook was caught behind for 12. RETIRE HURT Owais Shah ground out 29 in 115 balls before retiring hurt due to cramp in his hand. It was not the first time the Middlesex player, who grips the bat exceptionally hard, has had to deal with such a problem. Shah was replaced by Kevin Pietersen who survived a scare off his third ball when he was given out leg before to Nash. The former England captain referred the decision successfully to the video umpire, who noted the ball had pitched outside leg stump. Ryan Hinds then found turn and bounce to beat Pietersen's outside edge before following up with an 'arm ball' which went straight and bowled the batsman through the gate for 10 with the last delivery before tea. Collingwood, like Strauss in a good run of form, came to the crease and together with his skipper shared an unbroken 102-run partnership. The highlight of a generally dull day's cricket was Strauss's rock solid batting, after his 169 in Antigua and his 142 in Barbados he now has the perfect platform to go on and make his first test double century. The England skipper hit 11 fours and 67 singles as he picked up runs all around the field. Given the series situation, the visitors need to build a big total before trying to bowl out West Indies twice for the first time in the series
