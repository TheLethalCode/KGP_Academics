 Islamabad, Mar 14 (BBC Online) - Pakistan's information minister has resigned in the wake of a growing clampdown by the government on protests by lawyers and opposition groups. Sherry Rehman tendered her resignation on Friday night after Pakistani television station Geo was blocked in locations across the country. Police have also arrested several protesters and sealed off city exits amid growing protests. Opposition groups are demanding that the president reinstate sacked judges. Authorities have recently banned all protests and detained hundreds to block a "long march" planned for Monday.
