 BEIJING, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japan Airlines plane bound for Tokyo made an emergency landing in Shanghai shortly after take-off due to "engine problems", Xinhua news agency said on Sunday. Ten minutes after taking off from Shanghai's Hongqiao airport on Saturday afternoon, the crew "noticed engine problems and the plane began to shake slightly," Xinhua said, citing border inspection authorities. The plane landed at Shanghai's other international airport in Pudong about 45 minutes later. No injuries were reported among its 208 passengers and 14 crew, Xinhua said. An initial probe showed the aircraft had hit birds after take-off, but the cause was being investigated, Xinhua said. Calls placed to JAL offices in Tokyo and Hong Kong went unanswered. Staff contacted at Pudong airport were unable to confirm the report
