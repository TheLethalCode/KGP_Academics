 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  State-run phone equipment company Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd is fishing for any of a multitude of projects to survive stagnation, from producing ATM and credit cards to repairing railway carriages and building solar power systems. A telecoms ministry official told bdnews24.com Sunday that Indian company Exicom Telesystems has so far expressed their interest to produce mobile phone batteries with TSS. TSS invited proposals from companies through an advertisement on Feb 22 to assemble or manufacture mobile sets, cordless telephone sets and accessories by joint venture. The moribund company also advertised for partners in "manufacture/repair/maintenance of railway carriages, wagons, locomotives and related spares". It is further looking to produce "solar energy power systems", "safety locking devices", "optical fibre cables", "pre- and post-paid digital metres (electricity, gas and water)". Another area of interest was all types of chip cards, includes SIM cards, credit cards, ATM cards and scratch cards. Ministry officials say the mammoth initiative is being taken "to rescue TSS". Most of the state-run company's equipment has become obsolete, they said, adding that the premises could be utilised for many purposes. March 22 is the final date to submit expressions of interest. The state-run entity was established in 1967 as Telephone Industries Corporation under a joint venture between the then government of Pakistan and Siemens AG, West Germany, now Nokia Siemens Networks, Germany. TIC was transformed into Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd after independence. bdn
