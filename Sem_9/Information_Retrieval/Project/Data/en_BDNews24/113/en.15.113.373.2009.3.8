 LONDON, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United and Chelsea cruised into the FA Cup semi-finals with comfortable away wins at Fulham and Coventry City respectively on Saturday. Carlos Tevez scored twice and Wayne Rooney and Park Ji-sung also struck as United turned on the style at Craven Cottage, while goals from Didier Drogba and Alex made it six wins out of six since new manager Guus Hiddink arrived at Chelsea. United boss Alex Ferguson, eying next week's Champions League return with Inter Milan and Premier League showdown with Liverpool, opted to leave Cristiano Ronaldo and Dimitar Berbatov out of his squad but in Tevez he had the ideal replacement.

They opened the scoring after 15 minutes when Drogba muscled Scott Dann off the ball, went round keeper Kieran Westwood and turned in his shot from a tight angle. Championship (second division) team Coventry, seeking to reach the last four for the first time since winning the Cup for the only time in 1987, struggled to build any pressure and it was no surprise when they fell further behind after 72 minutes. Alex and Drogba, who had both been off the pitch receiving treatment after a collision, came back on and immediately joined a counter-attack that ended with halftime substitute Ricardo Quaresma crossing for the Brazilian defender to sidefoot home. Chelsea also enjoyed the added bonus of a first appearance since August for midfielder Michael Essien, who played the last 30 minutes having recovered from a knee ligament inj
