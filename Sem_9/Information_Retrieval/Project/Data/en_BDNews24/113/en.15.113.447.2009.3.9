 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)General Officer Commanding of the Jessore-based 55 Infantry Division Maj Gen Rafiqul Islam was killed Monday as his helicopter crashed after running into power lines in Tangail, the army said. Corrected Pilot Lt Col Md Shahidul Islam also died instantly on impact. The co-pilot, Maj Saif, was injured and taken to Dhaka Combined Military Hospital, officials said. The chopper was travelling from Jessore to Mymensingh when it went down near Elanga at 7.50am, said an ISPR release. Gen Rafiq was to pick up the GOC of the Ghatail-based 19th Division en route to a conference at army headquarters in Dhaka, said the statement released around 11:30am. "The helicopter crashed after hitting electric wires," it said. Local people and army officials said the Mymensingh-bound army helicopter, BH-SC-206, hit a power pole at Shyampur village in Elenga due to foggy weather. The pilot lost control and the helicopter fell onto the ground with a heavy sound, with smoke billowing. The helicopter hit several trees and broke into pieces but the main part fell into Rouha Eidgah pond, some 400 metres east off the tower, district police chief Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com. The local people found the twisted helicopter sunk in waist-deep water upside down. Locals and army officials from Ghatail cantonment and Jamuna Bridge Authority pulled out the dead and the injured. Co-pilot Major Saif sustained critical injuries in the knee, waist and head and was first taken to Tangail General Hospital and later to Dhaka CMH, said Lt Col Lutful, an officer of the 98th Combined Brigade stationed near the Jamuna Bridge. Maj Gen Mujahid Uddin, GOC of Ghatail, Brig Gen Nasimul Gani of 98 Combined Brigade and RAB, army and air force officials visited the spot. bdnews24.c
