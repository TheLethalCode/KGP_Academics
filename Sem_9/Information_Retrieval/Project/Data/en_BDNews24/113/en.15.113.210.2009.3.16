 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  Police detained Sunday the director general of the Directorate of Family Planning on charges of sexually assaulting his 5-year-old adopted girl. Khilgaon police, who received the complaint from legal aid organisation Ain O Salish Kendra in the afternoon, said they might arrest Amirul Islam if medical tests on the girl confirmed the assault. Islam has refuted the paedophilia charges. Nahid Shams, who filed the complaint, said the child told her mother 'Sokhina', who works at Islam's house as a maid, first about the alleged molestation which took place on Mar 9 at Islam's West Ulan home at Khilgaon. She said the mother told the organisation about the incident and they spoke to the child to be sure about it. Shams said the girl was sent to Victim Support Centre at Tejgaon Police Station for tests. The director general adopted the child at his private clinic, Speed Bangladesh Clinic, four years ago. He married four months ago after his first wife died, she added. Syed Nazrul Islam, officer in charge of the Khilgaon police, said they were questioning the official at the police station. His new wife and two daughters who study at private universities were with him, he added.
