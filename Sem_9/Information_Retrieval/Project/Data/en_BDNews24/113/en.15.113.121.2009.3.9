 KAMPALA, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Antonov cargo plane with seven people on board crashed into Lake Victoria after take-off from Uganda's main airport on Monday, officials said. "It plunged into the lake and went down deep," said an aviation source, who feared all seven had been killed. Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakoba said she did not have any details on what had happened to those on board or what had caused the crash. Local media said the plane, which took off from Entebbe airport outside the capital Kampala, was carrying supplies for Ugandan peacekeepers in Somalia. Africa's air accident rate is six times worse than the rest of the world, according to the International Air Transport Association
