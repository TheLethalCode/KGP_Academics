 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.comThe probe committee, formed during Friday's devastating Basundhara City blaze, visited the site Saturday to start looking into what fire safety measures were actually in place at the multistorey shopping and office complex. "We are also asking why and how the building caught fire," the committee's chief Iqbal Khan Chowdhury said in a press conference at the site. "And we are investigating whether there was any foul play," said Chowdhury, who is home ministry joint secretary (police). Architect Md Foyez Ullah said the committee wanted to discover what precautions and preparedness the building authorities had in case of fire. "We want to find out whether there was any gap in the response." Adviser to the Basundhara Group chairman, Mustafa Kamal Mohiuddin, said the company was considering what it could do for the victim's families. An information desk has been set up on the second floor of the building to coordinate activities of the corporate offices that were gutted in the fire. Friday's blaze was confined to the offices on the top floors leaving the 20-storey building intact up to 13th floor. The mall will be reopened to shoppers in 2-3 days, said Mohiuddin. b
