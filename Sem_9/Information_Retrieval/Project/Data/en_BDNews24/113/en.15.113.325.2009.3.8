 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  The World Bank is willing to offer power-starved Bangladesh soft loan to set up power stations. It has offered to mediate between the foreign investors and the government to pump FDI into independent power producers (IPPs) that Bangladesh is looking to install. The bank has said it is ready to help develop the power sector as an acute power crisis has hit irrigation and businesses. Finance minister AMA Muhith and the bank's country director Xian Zhu briefed reporters on the meeting between the visiting World Bank vice president for South Asia Isabel M Guerrero and Muhith at the Secretariat Saturday. Guerrero, who arrived earlier in the day on a three-day visit to discuss with the policymakers the global financial meltdown and its impact on Bangladesh, did not speak to the media. She rushed to the meeting with prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Muhith said the government sought the bank's support to develop the power sector. "They did not facilitate investment in the power sector for a long time but now have resumed. He said proposals on private power plants are pouring in. "We need huge foreign investment for the energy sector. They can help us to get that investment," he told reporters. "They can help invigorate the flow of private funds. The terms of private fund are now easy as the interest rate has fallen." The minister said he told the senior executive that, Bangladesh may overcome the impact of the financial meltdown now but is concerned about what would happen next. He asked for increased budgetary support from the bank to strengthen social safety net programmes to safeguard the people from the recession fallout. Zhu said FDI would be effective to develop energy and power infrastructure. He said Muhith stressed the need for increased project and budgetary support for social safety net programmes, infrastructure and agriculture sectors. The government, Zhu said, will prepare a document on budget support for the bank's consideration.
