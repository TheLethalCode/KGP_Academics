 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com) - RUET and four more higher educational institutions in Rajshahi were shut sine die Saturday following a series of clashes that closed Rajshahi University on Friday. The four others were Rajshahi New Government Degree College, Rajshahi City College, Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute and Rajshahi Institute of Health Technology (Paramedical). The decisions to shut their doors came from separate emergency meetings of the institutions' academic councils attended by senior teachers and officials. Rajshahi deputy commissioner Shefaul Karim said the closures came in the wake of RU campus violence. Rajshahi College and Rajshahi Medical College had shut indefinitely Friday shortly after RU announced its sine die closure in the wake of ICS-BCL clashes that left a Shibir leader dead. RUET RUET vice chancellor Dr. Fazlul Bari said the university was closed indefinitely after reviewing RU situation in a meeting of the university advisory committee at noon. He said male students were asked to leave their halls Saturday by 5pm and female students by 10am Sunday. Acting registrar Dr. Mortuza Ali, all professors, deans, heads of all departments and hall provosts were present at the meeting. Rajshahi New Government Degree College Principal Farida Parveen said the college announced closure after an emergency meeting. She said all students were asked to vacate their halls by Saturday noon. Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute Principal Joynal Abedin said they had closed the college indefinitely, but examinations of all departments would be held as scheduled.
