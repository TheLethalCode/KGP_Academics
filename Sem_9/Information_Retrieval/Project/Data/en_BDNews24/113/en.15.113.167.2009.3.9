<TEXT>
 PORT OF SPAIN, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - He may need to be strapped up, injected with pain killers and use a runner but West Indies captain Chris Gayle says he will bat again in the fifth and final test despite tearing a hamstring muscle. Gayle pulled up dramatically as he scampered through for a single that brought up his 10th test century and had to be helped off the field in agony. "Definitely I will be batting again. Even if I am not needed I am going to bat again definitely," said Gayle. "I don't know how bad it is, but right now, I'm feeling pretty decent. But I am not a doctor to decide.

Gayle suffered an injury to the same right hamstring on the tour of South Africa in late 2007 and was hampered by a groin injury a year ago. "I pulled the same hamstring before, out in South Africa, its an old injury so maybe its aggravated a bit," he added. West Indies recovered from losing Gayle to reach 349 for four and avoid the follow-on at the close on the third day although they still trail England's first innings 546 by 197 runs. Leading 1-0, a draw would be enough to secure Gayle his team's first series win over England since 1998 and their first win in any series since 2004. "I think we are in a pretty decent position to win this game, once we can bat to tea tomorrow then we can put England under a bit of pressure and I am sure we can get a lead," he said. "England have got to throw everything at us, so we just have to bear that in mind and be aware of the situation and get past tea and then see what happens. "[England] might as well try something because if they lose 2-0 it is the same thing as 1-0 -- they lose the series. "They will have to take some chances and hopefully we don't create that opportunity where they get a sniff
