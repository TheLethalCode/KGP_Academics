 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court ordered prime accused DAD Touhidul Alam and 10 others to jail pending charges in the BDR mutiny case on Saturday. CID investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand requested the court to jail the eleven without further remand or being charged. The IO told the court the accused looted the BDR arms depot on Feb 25 and indiscriminately killed army officers of various rank at the Peelkhana headquarters. "They disclosed significant facts about the killings during interrogation, and would flee if released," said Akhand, a senior assistant superintendent of police. Magistrate Md Abdur Rahim, of Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court, ordered all eleven to jail. The other ten beside Touhid were: DAD Abdur Rahim, Habildar Azad Ali, Nayek Firoz Ahmed, Sepoy Zakir Hossain, Sepoys Imran, Shah Alam and Moshiur Rahman, medical assistant Jamiruddin and cooks Shahjahan and Amirul Islam. Akhand produced them before the court Friday at the end of their various remand terms. bdne
