 KHARTOUM, Fri Mar 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aid officials warned on Friday that an expulsion of humanitarian agencies from Sudan could lead to fresh conflict in flashpoint oil-producing border regions where hundreds of thousands people will be left without help. Sudan's government shut down 13 foreign aid groups this week, accusing them of passing information to the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to face charges of alleged war crimes in Darfur. Aid groups deny working with the court. Senior humanitarian officials said the expulsions had left large areas of the highly-charged regions of Abyei, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, along Sudan's contested north-south border, without any humanitarian cover. The three "transitional" areas saw some of the heaviest fighting in the two-decade civil war between north and south Sudan that ended with the troubled Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005. Large parts of their populations supported the south but they were left as part of the north after the accord, leaving widespread resentment and tension. "The impact of the expulsions goes way beyond Darfur," said one Khartoum-based international aid official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "They have been expelled from some of Sudan's most war-ravaged areas, areas where the people have absolutely nothing. The risk of new conflict in these areas is real." FEARS OF UNREST The official said there were fears of unrest when aid reaching those regions was removed. And there was a risk of further conflict when Khartoum officials carried out their threat to seize the assets from expelled organisations, in areas still partly patrolled by southern soldiers. Another senior aid official, who also asked not to be named, said the expulsions had hit major projects designed to support the 2005 peace agreement. "We are talking about major projects with major budgets - bridges, serious reconstruction, that are now at risk. These were all supposed to build up the Comprehensive Peace Agreement." The expulsions hit three of the largest organisations working in Abyei -- Mercy Corp, Save the Children USA, and PADCO, a humanitarian contractor re-building large parts of war-ravaged Abyei town. Both north and south Sudan claim Abyei, which contains oil fields and a key pipeline, and their troops have clashed there since the 2005 accord, leading some commentators to warn of a return to war. Save the Children - which also had its UK arm shut down this week - said the decision would have a serious impact on its work in Southern Kordofan, Abyei and other areas of Sudan, including west Darfur. "If we are forced to stop our work the lives of hundreds of thousands of children could be at risk," the organisations' international secretary general Charlotte Petri said in a statement. In Darfur, there were particular worries for deliveries of emergency food, handed out by some of the expelled groups including US-based Care. Britain's Oxfam said its programmes, that covered water, hygiene, schooling and other areas in Darfur and underdeveloped eastern Sudan, would collapse within weeks if it was not allowed to return. "Darfuris do have their own incredible coping mechanisms and can cope with reduced services," said spokesman Alun McDonald. "But when you expel around 12 of the biggest organisations, you do wonder how they are going to cope without the food and medicine and assistance that they have been receiving." The head of Sudan's state Humanitarian Aid Commission Hassabo Mohamed Abd el-Rahman on Wednesday told Reuters civilians would not be affected as the work of the expelled agencies would be taken up by the government and remaining humanitarian groups. Agencies working in southern Sudan have not had their licenses rev
