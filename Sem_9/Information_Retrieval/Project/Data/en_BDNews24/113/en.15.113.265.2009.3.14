<TITLE> JCD demands Tanbir expulsion </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal has demanded that BNP expel its standing committee member Chowdhury Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky, in the wake of mounting controversy centering on his son's allegations against party chief Khaleda Zia. The BNP-backed student front demonstrated and burnt the effigies of Tanbir and son Irad in front of the party chairperson's Gulshan office on Saturday. They chanted slogans demanding Tanbir's ouster from the party in front of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia who arrived there at around 7:30pm. Meanwhile, a group of Titumir College JCD unit students in a mock 'people's court' gave an expulsion verdict. Tanbir's son Irad Ahmed Siddiky alleged at a press briefing last Monday that Khaleda had asked for Tk 5 crore in return for a party ticket in the Dhaka mayoral election. Irad also called incumbent mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, and former mayors BNP's Mirza Abbas and AL's Mohammad Hanif "all corrupt", who "failed to deliver". He said none among Khoka, Abbas, ASM Hannan Shah and former FBCCI chief Abdul Awal Mintoothe likely BNP candidateswas acceptable. Tanbir, however, was quick to counter his son's allegations. "What my son said was false," Tanbir told reporters the following day. He said Khaleda never sought money in return for the Dhaka mayoral ticket, as Irad claimed. He dismissed his son's remarks as "false and unwanted". The son's comments have nevertheless angered party adherents and the standing committee on Tuesday asked Tanbir to explain in 72 hours why he should not be punished over Irad's allegations. A meeting of the BNP standing committee on the issue, which was scheduled for Saturday, was deferred, party sources said. bdne
