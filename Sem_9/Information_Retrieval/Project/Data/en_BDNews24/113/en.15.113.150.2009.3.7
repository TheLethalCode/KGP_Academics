 Gazipur, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  A bystander died and 40 people were injured in a series of clashes that began at a sweater factory in Sripur Saturday, police and witnesses said. The violence erupted in the morning as sacked workers of Pandora Sweaters went to collect their dues and were 'obstructed' by factory authorities, said witnesses. Shopkeeper Saiful Islam, caught up in the clashes, succumbed to injuries at Dhaka Medical College Hospital around noon, said Sripur police officer-in-charge SM Monjur Kader. Locals violently protested the death of Saiful, searching out the Pandora workers and assaulting them throughout the day. Local Jubo League leader Kabir Hossain has been admitted to DMCH, while at least 10 other injured were taken to Sripur Upazila health complex, said Kader. Authorities closed the factory at around 11am. Police arrested four of the injured workers in connection with the violence. The garment factory had been facing worker unrest since early February, when authorities sacked 137 workers and closed down. As the factory reopened on Feb. 28, the workers unrest stepped up, police said. Kader said preparations were on to file a case. bdnews24.
