 DHARAMSALA, India, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Tibetan government-in-exile welcomed China's willingness for more talks with its envoys, but reiterated the conditions outlined in its previous memorandum to Beijing. "His Holiness the Dalai Lama is always ready to engage with the Chinese leadership to find a mutually acceptable solution to the problems of the Tibetan people," Samdhong Rinpoche, prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said in a statement issued late on Saturday. A memorandum of "genuine autonomy" for Tibet was presented to Beijing last October during the eighth round of talks with China. "The Memorandum clearly outlines the aspirations of the Tibetan people strictly within the constitutional principles of the People's Republic of China. Premier Wen Jiabao appears to be trying to avoid acknowledging this document," the statement said. Chinese officials and envoys of the Dalai Lama -- branded by Beijing as "splittist" -- have held several rounds of talks, but little of substance has been achieved. Wen said on Friday that China was open to more talks with envoys for the Dalai Lama as long as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader renounces what Beijing describes as separatism. The Dalai Lama marked March 10, the 50th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule, with a speech calling for "meaningful autonomy" for Tibet in the north Indian town of Dharamsala, seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile. The latest statement reiterated that the Dalai Lama is not seeking separation. Thubten Samphel, a spokesman, added they would not negotiate on their core demands. "These are our core demands. We will not dilute them, we will not climb down," he said
