 PARIS, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Ligue 1 ahead of this weekend's matches: Former France midfielder Claude Makelele returns from a two-match suspension for Paris St Germain against arch rivals Olympique Marseille on Sunday (2000). The capital side, who are second in the standings one point behind Olympique Lyon, are still without influential Benin midfielder Stephane Sessegnon, who was banned for three matches earlier this month. Third-placed Marseille, who have not conceded a goal in their last five league matches, also have their suspension woes and will have to make do without Algerian midfielder Karim Ziani at the Parc des Princes. OM will also be without right back Laurent Bonnart, who picked up a groin injury in his team's 2-1 defeat of Ajax Amsterdam in the UEFA Cup on Thursday and has been ruled out for at least two months. "It looks pretty serious and he might be out until the end of the season," coach Eric Gerets told the club's website (www.omnet). Ivory Coast striker Bakari Kone and captain Lorik Cana are doubtful because of minor injuries as are defenders Vitorino Hilton and Julien Rodriguez. Girondins Bordeaux, who take on Nice on Saturday (2000) will have to make do without talismanic striker Fernando Cavenaghi after the Argentine was been ruled out for six to eight weeks with a knee injury. They will also miss midfielder Fernando, who is suspended. Bordeaux are fifth in the standings, six points adrift of Lyon. Mali defender Abdou Traore called on his Bordeaux team mates to put their recent woes behind them ahead of the Nice game. "The defeat at Toulouse hurts us deeply bit we must forget about it," he told Bordeaux's website (www.girondins.com) "Let's just show something else against Nice, let's win it and move on." Olympique Lyon will be without Abdul Kader Keita in their home game against AJ Auxerre on Sunday (1600) after the Ivory Coast forward was handed a two-match suspension. Monaco, who are on a five-match winless streak in Ligue 1, will be without Alexandre Licata for the Toulouse home game on Saturday (1800), after their top striker was been ruled out until the end of the season with an ankle injury earlier this week. Influential midfielder Jerome Leroy returns from a one-month injury layoff for sixth-placed Stade Rennes's trip to troubled Le Mans, on Saturday (1800)
