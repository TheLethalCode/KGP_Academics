<TITLE> Broad vents frustration over Caribbean wickets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PORT OF SPAIN, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England seamer Stuart Broad has criticised the Caribbean wickets in the current series against West Indies, saying they have created an unfair battle between bat and ball. Following drawn tests in Antigua and Barbados, the fifth and final match at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad is heading for another likely stalemate after West Indies ended the third day on 349 for four replying to England's 546 for six declared. "I think the wickets have been terrible to be honest," Broad told reporters. "Throughout the series it's not been a fair battle between bat and ball. I don't know the exact stats but it must be nearly 20 hundreds and four five-for bowling performances which hardly creates fair cricket," he said. Thirteen centuries have been scored in the series and flat tracks have dominated all three tests since England were routed by an innings and 23 runs in Kingston, Jamaica in the first test. "You've got youngsters watching, I remember watching (England batsman Michael) Atherton and (South Africa pace bowler Allan) Donald's battles and you don't get fair battles on wickets like this. "But that's what we're dealt with and it's probably our fault for getting rolled in Jamaica that they've created such flat wickets," said Broad whose father Chris is a former England batsman and now ICC match referee. "You're playing for your country you're always going to run in and try to get wickets but it's disheartening when the ball's not doing anything and it's so good for batsman," Broad said. "But that seems to be the way test cricket is going and hopefully we'll realise soon that we need to have some balance between bat and ball." England need 16 wickets in the final two days if they are to avoid a draw and level the series and Broad said Sunday's play had been particularly difficult to accept. "There's frustration in that we bowled well as a unit and kept out disciplines on what's a really flat wicket. "It was quite a frustrating day with quite a few chances not going to hand and landing short and a few poor umpiring decisions, but it's one of those days. Hopefully tomorrow (Monday) we can come in and hit them hard before lunch and knock them over.
