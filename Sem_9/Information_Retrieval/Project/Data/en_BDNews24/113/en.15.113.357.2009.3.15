 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's energy correspondent Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  No final decision on exploration of oil and gas in the Bay of Bengal is coming anytime soon as the country reels under a debilitating power crunch on a lack of gas supply. The prime minister's energy adviser said Sunday Toufique E Elahi Chowdhury told reporters Sunday they were examining the papers "which will take time". On how long it may take for them to be through with it, he said it was difficult to say. The state minister for energy Shamsul Haq Tuku also said they were examining the papers. Former special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of energy M Tamim told bdnews24.com an immediate decision should taken on both offshore and onshore exploration. Power generation is suffering severely on gas supply interruptions, and the businesses and industries are counting billions of taka in lost production. The state-owned oil, gas and mineral resources exploration company Petrobangla has warned that it will not be able to supply gas to new plants beyond 2012. It says it produces nearly its capacity of 1800 million cubic feet of gas a day. The two companies winning the bid are USA based Conoco-Phillips and Irish company Tullow. The former is due to get eight deep-sea blocks 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21  while the latter is set to sign a production-sharing contract for Block 5, they said. The government floated an international tender on Feb 15 for 28 offshore blocks, and Petrobangla opened the bid documents on May 7 to complete evaluation in three weeks. International companies Houston-based Conoco-Phillips, Australia's Santos International, Longwoods Resources, a US-China joint venture, Korea International Oil Corporation, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Comtrack Services and London-based Tullow dropped bids. The emergency government selected Conoco-Phillips and Tullow for the exploration in late last year but the interim cabinet left it for a political government for a final decision. The government will sign a four-year exploration deal for shallow sea blocks and five-year agreement for deep-sea blocksboth renewable by four years, officials said. On submission of development plans by the selected bidders, agreement will be signed for gas and oil fields for 25 and 20 years respectively. The companies will pay compensation in case of accidents stemming from neglect and inefficiency. Any company wishing to sell more than 50 percent of its shares would have to take permission from the government, the officials further said.
