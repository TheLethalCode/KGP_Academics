<TITLE> Blaze baffles Bashundhara architect </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  The man who designed Bashundhara City shopping complex says he is baffled by the speed at which the fire spread out Friday although modern fire-extinguishing equipment were on hand. "It has all the modern, automated systems to extinguish fire and prevent all other accidents," architect Md Foyez Ullah told bdnews24.com. There is a fire-detection system and trained staff on each level of the complex. They are supposed to douse flames shortly after the fire is detected, he said. "Now my question is why the fire spread so fast!" Security system of the complex is maintained from a control room on the ninth floor under an automated building management system. The air conditioning, ventilation and power supply systems are also controlled there, he added. There is also a backup system if the main control panel collapses. Asked whether there were any fault by the authorities, Foyez Ullah said nothing should be said on assumption, as there might be other factors. He, however, added that primary steps to put out the fire might not have been taken at the right time on a lack of workforce on the weekend. bdnews2
