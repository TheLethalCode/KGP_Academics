 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)A four-member Scotland Yard team will arrive Wednesday to assist in the BDR mutiny investigation, says visiting UK minister Mike Foster MP. The UK minister for international development condemned the Feb. 25-26 BDR mutiny in a press briefing at the airport on arrival Tuesday. "I would like to express my condolences for the families affected by the BDR incident," said Foster at the start of his official three-day tour. . "I'm also pleased to say that a team of four from Scotland Yard will be arriving tomorrow to help the government deal with the aftermath of the incident," he said. The 45 year-old MP, who looks after the UK department's South Asia desk, said his country would continue to support the Bangladesh government. Foster, on his first official trip to the country, is expected to meet with several key cabinet members. His visit also marks the first UK ministerial visit since Sheikh Hasina's government came to power in early January. "We reaffirm the United Kingdom has unwavering support for the democratically elected government," said Foster. He said Bangladesh made "real strides" in its development efforts in recent years. "The United Kingdom is committed to providing the political and economic support to Bangladesh as it works hard to lift its people out of poverty. "The UK is Bangladesh's largest donor. And our aid will rise to 150 million pounds a year by 2010-11," he said. The UK at present provides some  125 million annually for different development programmes. Foster is scheduled to visit a number of UK-funded programmes for vulnerable people in Bangladesh, such as char dwellers, street children and victims of social and family repression, during his trip.
