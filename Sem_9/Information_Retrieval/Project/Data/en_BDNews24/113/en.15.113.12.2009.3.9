<TITLE> Terrorists could hit JS 'with ease': Shawkat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)A top-level committee to review parliament's security arrangements has observed that terrorists could approach the premises "with ease" to carry out attacks. The committee, headed by the deputy speaker, termed the existing security measures "inadequate" at a meeting on Monday. The meeting decided to set up an explosives detection system at a single entrance point through which all vehicles would pass to go into the Jatiya Sangsad complex. It also decided to increase the height of the boundary fence. The committee will also request authorities to carry out police checks of all staff of the parliament secretariat. "Under the present arrangements, terrorists can easily come up to the entrance of the parliament building," deputy speaker Col Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said terrorists could gather around the premises one by one as there were many entry points. "Therefore, we have decided to reduce the number of entrances," he said. Chief whip Abdus Shahid, also a committee member, said: "We must be aware following the BDR mutiny that terrorists can attack at any place, at anytime." "Terrorists could come in the guise of VIPs and carry out attacks," he said. "They can even come in flagged vehicles," said Shahid. Deputy speaker Shawkat said everyone, including all ministers and MPs, must be made to pass through a metal detector. "Besides, we will set up an under-vehicle-scanning system through which all vehicles must pass to enter the premises. "The scan would detect explosives carried by vehicles, if any, at the entry point," said Shawkat Ali, a retired colonel. "We will take measures for police verification, if possible every year, of all staff members of the parliament secretariat," he said. Justifying the measure, he said the police checks would help authorities to detect whether any of the officers or employees had links with terrorists. "The height of the boundary fence is just three feet. Any person could easily scale the fence." "It may be raised up to eight or 12 feet," he said. Speaker Abdul Hamid and deputy speaker Col Shawkat Ali met last week to discuss parliament's security in the wake of the BDR mutiny. They formed the 11-member committee to review parliament's security measures. bdn
