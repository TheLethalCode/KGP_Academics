 NEW DELHI, Mar 13(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India replied on Friday to 30 questions raised by Pakistan over last November's Mumbai attacks and said it was time for Islamabad to act quickly in the investigation. Pakistan raised the questions in response to a dossier of evidence published by India. New Delhi said the dossier pointed to Pakistan-based militants being behind the attacks that killed 166 people in Mumbai. The Mumbai attacks have raised tensions between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, who have been to war three times since independence in 1947. "We expect Pakistan to take investigations forward quickly, apprehend all the culprits and either hand over to India for prosecution and punishment or prosecute and punish them in Pakistan," India's Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters. He said India's reply was a comprehensive document supported by documentary evidence, CDs and forensic analysis report. Analysts say India will continue to rely on the United States to pressure Pakistan to cooperate in the investigations, but progress will be slow, given the political turmoil in Pakistan. An attack earlier this month on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore may also give Islamabad an excuse to delay or stonewall the probe by arguing authorities are too busy with that probe, analysts say. Both sides have exchanged angry rhetoric since the November attacks, with India saying the gunmen must have had support from official Pakistani agencies. Islamabad has accused New Delhi of indulging in a blame game. Pakistan has acknowledged that the raid had been launched and partly planned from Pakistan. It has detained several Islamist leaders, including some whom India has named as planners of the attack. "If Pakistan is serious about investigating the origins of the horrific crime committed in Mumbai, these answers provide a solid basis," Chidambaram said. Ten gunmen who Indian identified as Pakistani nationals went on the rampage in the November attacks on Mumbai landmarks, including two five-star hotels, a Jewish centre and a busy railway station. Indian commandos killed nine of them. The man said to be the lone surviving gunman was charged by Mumbai police last month.
