 JERUSALEM, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Far-right leader Avigdor Lieberman would become Israel's foreign minister if an outline coalition pact with Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu goes into effect, a spokeswoman for Lieberman said on Monday. Netanyahu's deal with the Yisrael Beitenu Party, initialled by the parties late on Sunday, was his first step to forging a right-wing government that could be on a collision course with the Obama administration's goals of seeking a Palestinian state. The deal, still subject to possible pacts with other parties including centrists led by Tzipi Livni, would hand the foreign ministry to Lieberman, a Russian-speaking immigrant from former Soviet Moldova whose rhetoric is seen by many as anti-Arab. His party would also have four other portfolios including internal security, said spokeswoman Irena Ettinger. Netanyahu's Likud party and Lieberman's faction would need to secure agreements with other parties to achieve a majority in the 120-member parliament, but their accord was the first step towards establishing a new government after a Feb. 10 election. Lieberman's party polled the third largest number of seats, at 15, with Likud winning 27. Deputies of both parties initialled the deal during talks held on Sunday. Yisrael Beiteinu has called for trading land where Israeli-Arab citizens live in exchange for Jewish settlements in the West Bank in any peace deal with Palestinians. Lieberman has also urged steps to ensure all Israelis, including Israeli-Arab citizens, were loyal to the Jewish state as a condition for retaining citizenship. Netanyahu faces an April 3 deadline to complete a government, after being given the task last month by President Shimon Peres. Netanyahu, who clashed with former US President Bill Clinton over Middle East policies when he was last prime minister from 1996 to 1999, has said he wants to shift the focus of Palestinian statehood talks from territorial to economic issues, a plan rejected by Palestinians. Despite his deal with Lieberman's party, Netanyahu's deputies were continuing efforts to win support from outgoing Foreign Minister Livni's centrist Kadima party to try to widen his support base in parliament. Livni, whose party outpolled Netanyahu by one seat in the election, has demanded Netanyahu commit to US-backed talks with Palestinians for a two-state solution, as a condition for joining any government. She also wants a power-sharing arrangement in exchange for joining any government, in which she would rotate the job of prime minister with Netanyahu
