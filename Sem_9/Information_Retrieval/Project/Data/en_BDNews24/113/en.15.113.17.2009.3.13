 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  The new BDR chief, battling to reorganise the border force, says a government decision is still awaited on whether some 55,000 members will be assimilated or new soldiers recruited. "We'll start implementing what the policymakers finally decide upon, which may take a little time," said Brig Gen Moinul Hossain, the director general, speaking exclusively to bdnews24.com Thursday night. "A new force is a must," Gen Moinul said and added there was no alternative to restructuring the BDR after the Feb25-26 mutiny by renegade members at their headquarters in Dhaka. A senior army general recently said the government had already decided to rename the border force. The mutiny killed at least 57 army officers, including its director general Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed, deputed to the paramilitary border force. "The border guards have been completely spoilt," he said. "Their morale, ethics and sense of discipline have been shattered." "Nothing good or meaningful can be expected from them any more. There's no alternative to raising the border troops afresh into an effective force." "We have the morale and capability of rearing these riflemen afresh and we're working in that direction." Gen Moinul said they were now busy screening the soldiers who were returninga process seen crucial to the efforts digging into the horrendous genesis to the Peelkhana massacre. "We are not rushing, because haste might destroy valuable alibis and evidence." "The force has to be nurtured and reformed so that its members get back their old life." Asked about the name or uniform of the reorganised force, the general spoke of listening to 'people's wishes', hinting the change was almost a certainty. "I don't think Bangladeshis will like to hear the name 'BDR' or see the familiar uniform again after what happened there in late Feb." He dismissed reports that the army officers already deputed to different battalions across the country were now feeling insecure to return to their posts. "This is a total lie. A number of media outlets have published wrong newsAll officers have actually joined their new postings Wednesday and Thursday. The rest are on leave. "Journalists should verify before they report." On rumours that the BDR soldiers were starving or getting insufficient food inside the Peelkhana, he said, "The Peelkhana residents are being given food regularly." Gen Moinul, who was appointed DG on Feb. 27, said, "Salaries have already reached those units of which the commanding officers have not been killed." "Those units who lost their commanders are late in receiving the salaries due to change in command and related banking formalities." Asked if anything can be done to allow more families to see the detained BDR members inside the headquarters, the chief said, "This is not a civilian concern, you got to understand. We are currently allowing the soldiers' pregnant wives and mothers to see the soldiers inside." "Besides, people can connect with each other through telephone, intercom and letters. I'd love the relatives to meet their dear ones inside the Peelkhana and urge them to disclose whatever they know of the atrocities." Asked if an account of the looted arms and ammunition has been possible to draw so far, the DG said, "It will take little longer to ascertain the number of arms lost. The ammunition loss may be possible to gauge in a day or two." On the number of BDR members present at Peelkhana during the killings and of people present there now, Gen Moinul said, "A lot of documents and evidence were torched during the massacre. There are about 7,000 troops residing in the Peelkhana now." bdnews
