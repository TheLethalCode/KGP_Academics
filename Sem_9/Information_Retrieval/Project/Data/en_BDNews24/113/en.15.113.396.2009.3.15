 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Sex Workers Network of Bangladesh has demanded separate budget allocation for their members and their children. The organisation made the demand Sunday as part of an eight-point charter to the government ahead of a national conference. It also demanded a stop to harassment of sex workers without creating alternative means of livelihood. "They are neglected and tortured. We have to create proper opportunities for them. All of us should come forward to this end," said rights activist Khushi Kabir at a press briefing at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. She asked the media to play a pro-active role in changing society's attitude and behaviour to sex workers. Hundreds of workers, delegations from NGOs and representatives of donor countries will join the two-day national conference to be held at Gano Shaystha Kendra in Savar. Among others the press conference was attended by ASM Atikkur Rahman, who teaches at Dhaka University's social welfare department and president of the Sex Workers Network of Bangladesh, Mamtaj Begum. b
