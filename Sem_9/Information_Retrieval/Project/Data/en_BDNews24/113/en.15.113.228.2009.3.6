 WELLINGTON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The second one-day international between New Zealand and India at Wellington was abandoned because of rain on Friday. India looked set to post a big total after racing to 188 for four from 28.4 overs but were unable to complete their innings because of the inclement weather. "It was frustrating but the weather's uncontrollable unless you have an indoor stadium," India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said. "I don't know if we would have won but we were in a good position if it was a 50-over game." Sachin Tendulkar (61) and fellow opener Virender Sehwag (54) blasted half-centuries after the tourists won the toss and elected to bat first, but their efforts were in vain. The innings was interrupted on three separate occasions, forcing the Indians to chance their arm and allow New Zealand's bowlers to make inroads. "The bowlers showed a slight improvement, probably to the other batsmen apart from Sehwag," New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori said. "We were reasonably disciplined .... but still, we've got a lot of work to do on him." India won Tuesday's opening match in Napier, which was also affected by rain, by 53 runs to lead the five-match series 1-0. The third match is in Christchurch on Sunday. India stuck with the same team that won the opening match while New Zealand were forced to reshuffle their side because of a hand injury to wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum. McCullum was cleared to play in the Wellington match but only as a batsman, forcing the selectors to bring in Peter McGlashan to keep wickets and drop Neil Broom from the starting XI. Players from both sides wore black armbands and observed a minute's silence before the match as a mark of respect for the victims of Tuesday's attack on the Sri Lanka team in Pakistan
