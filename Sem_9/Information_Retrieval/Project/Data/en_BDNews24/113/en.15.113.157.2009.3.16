<TITLE> Taiwan to cut troops by 16 pct as China ties warm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan will cut troops by about 16 percent over the next five years, officials said on Monday, in part as a streamlining measure and in part in response to a perceived lower-level threat from political rival China. The defence ministry will reduce Taiwan's military police to a command centre under the army, part of a long-term effort to cut troops from a 1970s Cold War high of about 600,000 to 210,500 in 2014, going for quality over quantity, military sources said. China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's Communists won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary. But since China-friendly Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May, tensions have eased as the two sides sign trade and transit deals. Ma is pressured at home to make peace with China without getting too close politically. Taiwan has also cut annual live-fire military drills to once every two years and reduced its 2009 defence budget under Ma. Taiwan also seeks the troop cut to streamline its military, switching to a well-trained volunteer force with improved technology such as modern US weapons, military sources say. The US government has declined to make a long-awaited sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan for fear of upsetting China, Taiwan's parliament speaker said last week. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, recognising "one China", but remains the island's biggest ally and arms supplier
