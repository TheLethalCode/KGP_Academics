<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com) - A depleted Abahani crushed arch-rivals Mohammedan Sporting Club by five wickets to consolidate their lead in the Premier Cricket League on Sunday at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Biman, who lost against Mohammedan in the previous round, bounced back with a four-wicket win over Cricket Coaching School at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Elsewhere, a six-wicket haul from Tavir Ahmed helped BKSP beat star-studded Gazi Tank by nine wickets at the BKSP ground. Abahani vs MSC With key pacers Ziaur Rahman, Shuvashish Roy and Talha Jubair suffering from different ailments, Abahani pinned their hopes on the spinners, including pacer-turned-off-spinner Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who did not frustrate the Dhanmondi-based outfit after restricting Mohammedan to 198 all out in 47.4 overs. New face Shahadat Hossain was given the new ball and the inexperienced pacer conceded 40 runs in his five-over spell, but Nasir Hossain bowled tightly to give away just 22 runs in eight overs to take the wicket of Mohammedan captain Shurawardi Shuvo. Nasir also was instrumental in Mohammedan creating two run outs of top-scorer Farahad Hossain (47) and national batsman Roqibul Hasan (0) by direct throws. Mohammedan initially got off to a fine start with a 67-run opening partnership before third-change bowler Rezaul Karim made inroads having makeshift opener Nadimuddin caught by wicketkeeper Shahagir Hossain for 22. Mashrafee, who chose to bowl off-spin due to his back injury, dismissed Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya, triggering a middle-order collapse that followed two successive run outs. Jayasuriya made a sparkling 42 off 40 balls studded with four fours and two sixes before he gave a catch to Rony Talukdar, leaving the side at 81-2 in 19 overs. Then Nasir ran out Farhad Hossain and Roqibul Hasan before left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny then rattled the middle-order to return three for 42. Mashrafee removed Rashedul Haq to return two for 35 before Mohammedan's last two batsmen also fell short of the crease. Abahani, in reply, reached 201-5 with seven balls to spare as wicketkeeper Sahagir Hossain remained unbeaten on 41 along with Mashrafee, who was 11 not out. Openers Rony (4) and Tamim Iqbal (24) returned cheaply, but, one-down Imran Ahmed along with Indian Ranjan R Parida put on 74 runs to ease the pressure. Imran was dismissed for 38 by Sajidul Islam while Parida was run out for 46, leaving the side at 134-4. However, Sahagir and Mashrafee steered Abahani to their ninth victory in 11 outings. Biman vs CCS Zahid Niaz struck a swashbuckling 117 off 130 balls that included nine fours and two sixes as Biman reached 280-6 with five balls to left after CCS racked up a challenging 276-7. Niaz was well accompanied by Javed Omar and Mushfiqur Rahman, who made a 38-ball 36. Omar struck an exact 50 off 69 balls studded with five fours. Earlier, put in to bat, CCS built a solid score after fifties from Shuvagoto Mom and Nazmul Hossain. Mom smacked 75 off 63 balls while Nazmul played a 63-ball 58. Gazi vs BKSP Shaikat Ali and Shoumya Sarkar struck 68 and 55 as BKSP raced to 136-1 in 24.1 overs in reply to Gazi Tank's poor total of 134 all out in 46 overs. Electing to bat, Gazi Tank were caught in a spin web from Tanvir, who cleaned up the middle and tail after Shaikat Ali ratted the top-order. Tanvir returned with six for 26 in his 10-over spell while Shaikat took two for 14. Opener Anwar made highest 75 followed by captain Mohammad Ashraful on 11. Apart from Anwar and Ashraful, no batsman could reach double digits. bd
