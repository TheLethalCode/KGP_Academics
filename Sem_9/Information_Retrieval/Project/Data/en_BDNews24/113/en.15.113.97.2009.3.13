 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites Abahani almost confirmed a place in the semi-finals of the Citycell Super Cup while title contenders Sheikh Russel kept their faint hopes alive of qualifying for the last four on Friday. A brace from Emeka Christian powered Abahani to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club while a second-half strike from Vukadin Milunovic helped Sheikh Russel edge past Rahmatganj MFS 1-0 in the first match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Abahani stay atop in Group A with six points while Sheikh Russel and Chittagong Mohammedan have three points each from two outings. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen chose two holding midfields Arif Khan Joy and Prantoskh Kumar against a spirited Chittagong Mohammedan, who upset Sheikh Russel 2-0 in their first match. Joy, Pranotosh and Ghanaian playmaker Awudu Ibrahim toiled hard in the midfield as the Sky Blues went behind in the 39th minute when Raphael Sagno drove a Kaiser minus past goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya. The Chittagong Mohammedan players grew in confidence and were perhaps another upset was on the cards, but their effort was not enough to catch the B. League champions off-guard. Emeka, who struck twice in Abahani's 3-0 win over Rahmatganj MFS, levelled two minutes from the breather as the Nigerian found the back of the net from a goal-mouth-melee. Chittagong Mohammedan tried hard to break down Abahani's backline, marshalled Mohammad Sujan, Nazrul Islam, Samad Yousuf and Wali Faisal while Biplob was solid between the sticks. The Mohammedans successfully foiled the Abahani attacks by keeping Ibrahim well marked, but their resistance finally ended when Emeka scored in the 89th minute. Abahani defender Sujan hammered a powerful shot outside the box that was blocked by the Mohammedan defence, but Emeka was left to direct the ball home. Sheikh Russel, knowing the fact that another defeat would dash their dreams, struggled to deal with Rahmantganj, who enjoyed the lion's share of procession and had at least three good chances in the first half, but Idris Kasirye failed to take advantage. After the breather, Sheikh Russel regrouped to launch some attacks and came up with the match-winner seven minutes into the second half. Moroccan Samir Omari whipped a cross from the right for Siberian striker Milunovic, who drove the ball home giving goalkeeper Mohammad Ali no time to react.
