<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com) - The Rajshahi University unit of Islami Chhatra Shibir has accused 27 leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League's RU unit, including its president and a local Awami League leader, in a case involving the death of Shibir leader Sharifuzzaman Nomani. Shibir's RU unit organising secretary Farhad Alam lodged the case with Matihar Police Station on Saturday, a day after the death. The case accused local AL leader Anwar Hossain Anar, BCL's RU unit president Ibrahim Hossain Moon, law affairs secretary Arifuzzaman Roni, culture affairs secretary Awal Kabir Joy and 24 Chhatra League activists. The case details say the BCL leaders and activists called Shibir member Farhad Alam from his room at Sher-e-Bangla Hall Friday at around 10am, and then forcibly held him hostage in one of their rooms. They verbally abused Alam andf forced him to phone to other Shibir activists, claimed the complainant. The general secretary of Shibir's RU unit, Nomani, and four other ICS men went to rescue him at around 11am. The Chhatra League men attacked them, according to the case details, with Joy ordering his fellow-members to "kill" the Shibir men. Roni allegedly hit Nomani, whom another BCL man also attacked with a machete. Nomani's finger was cut off as he tried to protect his head with his hand, say the case details. Others, too, started indiscriminately attacking Nomani with sharp weapons, the complainant alleged. Rafiqul Islam Khan, officer in charge of Matihar Police Station, said they had not made any arrests in the case up to Saturday evening. "But we are trying to round up the accused," he added. bdn
