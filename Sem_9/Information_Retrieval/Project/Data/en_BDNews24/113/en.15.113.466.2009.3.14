 WELLINGTON, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jesse Ryder shone with both bat and ball in New Zealand's eight wicket win over India in their fifth and final one-day international at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday. Ryder captured three wickets then blasted a quick half-century to set up his team for their first win of the series as the hosts avoided a whitewash. Martin Guptill also chipped in with an unbeaten 57 as new Zealand cruised past India's modest total of 149 with a reply of 151-2 in 23.2 overs. India's chances of winning the match were in ruins after they were bowled out cheaply with 25-year-old Ryder picking up the wickets of Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan with his medium pacers. Jacob Oram, who had failed to take wicket in any of the previous matches, made up for lost time when he dismissed Suresh Raina in his first over then claimed the prized scalp of in-form opener Virender Sehwag for 40. Iain O'Brien also grabbed two late wickets while India contributed to their own downfall with the needless run outs of tailenders Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan after mix-ups with top scorer Rohit Sharma (43 not out). New Zealand were given 43 overs to reach their target after the match was reduced by seven overs per side because of heavy rain before the scheduled start, but eased to victory with 118 balls to spare. They suffered an early setback when Brendon McCullum was dismissed for two but Ryder and Guptill put the home side back on track with an 84-run partnership for the second wicket. Ryder belted 63 off 49 balls, featuring six fours and four sixes, before he played on with the total on 93. Guptill, whose 57 not out came off 50 deliveries, safely guided his team to victory with an unbroken partnership of 58 with Ross Taylor (28 not out). India won the series 3-1 after winning in Napier, Christchurch and Hamilton, while the other match in Wellington was washed out. The two sides are due to play other in three tests, with the first starting at Hamilton on Wednes
