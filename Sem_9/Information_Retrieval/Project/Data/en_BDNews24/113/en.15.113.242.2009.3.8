 BELFAST, Sun Mar 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen shot dead two British soldiers as they picked up pizzas at the entrance of an army base in Northern Ireland in an attack that appeared aimed at provoking a new round of violence in the province. British and Irish political leaders condemned the Saturday night attack and said it must not derail the peace process. The Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said Republicans had a duty to oppose what it called a "wrong and counterproductive" act. "Their intention is to bring British soldiers back onto the streets. They want to destroy the progress of recent times and to plunge Ireland back into conflict," Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said in a statement. It was one of the worst attacks in Northern Ireland since the 1998 peace deal was signed to end decades of political and sectarian strife. It followed a police warning last week that the threat from splinter groups from the Irish Republican Army was at its highest for nearly a decade and reports that British special forces were back in Northern Ireland to gather intelligence. Four people, including two pizza delivery men, were also wounded in the attack, Irish public broadcaster RTE reported. The victims were collecting the pizza at the Massereene base near the town of Antrim, 25 km northwest of Belfast, when gunmen pulled up in a vehicle and opened fire. There was one burst of gunfire then the attackers walked forward and shot the victims as they lay on the ground, RTE said. The two soldiers who were killed were in their early 20s and were due to fly out to Afghanistan. The 1998 Good Friday peace accord ended 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland in which more than 3,000 people were killed, but sporadic violence has continued. The IRA, which sought a united Ireland and drew support from the minority Roman Catholic community, and pro-British Protestant guerrilla groups agreed to ceasefires. "Those responsible (for the attack) have no support, no strategy to achieve a United Ireland," Sinn Fein's Adams said in a statement. "Our responsibility is to defend the peace process and the progress that has been made to achieving national and democratic rights. Pete Shirlow, senior lecturer at Queen's University Belfast School of Law, said the attack appeared to be a tactic by dissident republicans to provoke a loyalist reaction. "The main threat is how the loyalists will react to this. It shows you how fragile the peace process could be," he said. But there would need to be a sustained level of new violence for the peace process to risk breakdown, Shirlow said. "I don't think we can go back to what we had (in the Troubles) but it creates unease, it creates uncertainty." BRITISH AND IRISH CONDEMNATION Britain and Ireland, joint mediators of the peace deal, both condemned the attack. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it an "evil and cowardly" action. "No murder will be able to derail a peace process that has the support of the vast majority of the people of N.Ireland and we will step our efforts to make the peace process one that lasts and endures," he said in a broadcast statement. Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said: "A tiny group of evil people cannot and will not undermine the will of the people... to live in peace together." Nationalist politicians had reacted angrily last week to the reports that members of Britain's Special Reconnaissance Regiment, at the forefront of intelligence operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, had returned to the province. Northern Ireland's police chief Hugh Orde said on Friday he had deployed what he called specialists to help police deal with dissident groups but that they were not "special forces". The worst attack since the 1998 peace agreement occurred just months after the signing when a car bomb in the market town of Omagh, west of Belfast, killed 29 people. The Real IRA splinter group claimed responsibility. The bombing caused an international and domestic outcry that put pressure on republican dissidents to curb their violence. In January, a large bomb was defused in Castlewellan, 50 km south of Belfast. A splinter republican group claimed responsibility for the
