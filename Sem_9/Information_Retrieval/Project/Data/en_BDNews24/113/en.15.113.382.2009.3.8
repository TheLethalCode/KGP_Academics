 Liton Haider bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  The BDR chief has asked relatives to ask the border guards to give a true account to investigators about the Feb. 25-26 mutiny. Most of the BDR members had fled their Peelkhana headquarters in the capital during or after the mutiny that left at least 60 army officers, deputed to the paramilitary force, killed or missing. "Please write to your sons, brothers or whoever is inside the headquarters asking them to tell the truth about the mutiny," director general Brig Gen Moinul Hossain told waiting relatives at the Peelkhana gate on Sunday. "Please write to ask them to cooperate with the investigation agency to get to the truth." After the revolt ended, BDR members started reporting back to the headquarters in their hundreds. Since then they have been kept inside the headquarters, and their anxious relatives waiting outside. They are not being allowed to meet or talk over phones. "I know all the BDR members are not involved in the incident and it's also true that still five army officers are missing. "We're desperately trying to find them out, but the BDR members are not giving any information," General Moinul said. He asked the relatives what should happen to the perpetrators and was told the perpetrators should be punished, not the innocent ones. When a relative asked the BDR chief for permission to talk to a BDR member over mobile phone, he refused. "Let's see if we can manage intercoms to allow you to talk to the BDR members," General Moinul said. He said according to their estimates, some 7000-8000 BDR members were at the headquarters when the revolt erupted. b
