 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  The BDR mutiny probe committee has asked the government for more time to submit its findings due Monday. "We have requested a time extension as we have yet to complete the report," committee head M Anisuzzaman Khan told reporters Sunday. The government named an original ten-member investigation committee on Feb 27, headed by home minister Sahara Khatun. The government recast it on March 2, with retired civil servant Anisuzzaman replacing the home minister. The new team began work on Mar 3. It was given seven days to submit its findings, making it due on Mar 9. "We have yet to finish some tasks. We will submit the report after completing them," said Anisuzzaman after a meeting with additional home secretary Golam Hossain, also a committee member. On how many more days they needed, Anisuzzaman said: "The government will set it." Asked if the report would be complete by the end of the week, the former secretary said: "It might not be possible." Pressed by reporters on the committee's findings, he said: "Nothing can be said right now." "The government will make it public after we submit our report," he added. bdne
