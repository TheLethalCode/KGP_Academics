 LONDON, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona won and Olympique Lyon lost ahead of the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at the Nou Camp on Wednesday. Real Madrid were held by Atletico in their derby before facing Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday while Inter won at Genoa ahead of Wednesday's visit to Manchester United, 4-0 winners of their FA Cup match at Fulham. SPAIN Barcelona returned to winning ways and extended their lead over Real Madrid to six points with a 2-0 victory at home to Athletic Bilbao, their first win in six outings in all competitions. Real's 10-match winning streak came to an end when the champions were held 1-1 at home by city rivals Atletico and Sevilla cemented their hold on third with a 2-1 home win over Andalusian rivals Almeria. Cash-strapped Valencia's hopes of a place in next season's Champions League were dented when they surrendered the lead to lose 2-1 at relegation-threatened Numancia and slipped outside the European qualification places. ITALY Inter Milan took another step towards retaining their title when goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Mario Balotelli sealed a 2-0 win at Genoathe home side's first defeat of the league season at the Marassi. Inter stayed seven points clear of second-placed Juventus, who needed a late Giorgio Chiellini header to win the derby with Torino 1-0. Both sides suffered injuries ahead of their midweek Champions League matches, Inter losing defenders Marco Materazzi and Nicolas Burdisso while Juve's Mohamed Sissoko broke his foot. Filippo Inzaghi bagged a hat-trick in AC Milan's 3-0 win over Atalanta where David Beckham, who will stay on loan until the end of the season, played in a new role behind the strikers because of an injury crisis. FRANCE Olympique Lyon's bid for a record eighth consecutive Ligue 1 title suffered a setback as they lost 2-0 to Lille, leaving them just one point ahead of Paris St Germain. After losing to Lille in mid-week in the French Cup, Lyon succumbed again to goals by Robert Vittek and Michel Bastos. PSG secured a 1-0 win at mid-table Lorient thanks to a stunning volley from outside the penalty area by former French international Ludovic Giuly. Third-placed Olympique Marseille drew 0-0 at home to lowly Valenciennes, while Toulouse beat Girondins Bordeaux 3-0 to leapfrog them into fourth spot. GERMANY Hertha Berlin extended their lead to four points with a 3-1 win over Energie Cottbus, courtesy of a hat-trick by Andriy Voronin for a tally of six goals in four league matches. Champions Bayern Munich climbed back to second on 42 points after demolishing Hanover 5-1 and offering coach Juergen Klinsmann some respite after a string of bad league results and their mid-week German Cup exit. Four teams have 42 points with joint-second Hoffenheim, held 0-0 by Werder Bremen, having an identical record to Bayern. Hoffenheim hit the woodwork three times through Boubacar Sanogo, a former Werder striker. Felix Magath's VfL Wolfsburg quietly notched up their fifth consecutive victory with a single goal against Karlsruhe to move level on points and goal difference with Bayern and Hoffenheim though behind them on goals scored. Fifth-placed Hamburg are also on 42 points after a stinging 4-1 defeat by Borussia Moenchengladbach, who lifted themselves off the bottom for the first time since late November. ENGLAND Manchester United, Chelsea and Everton all reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, while Arsenal progressed when they won a delayed fifth round match, beating Championship (second division) side Burnley 3-0. The only Premier League match was Tottenham Hotspur's 1-1 draw at Sunderland thanks to a late Robbie Keane equaliser.

Chelsea beat Championship side Coventry City 2-0 with Didier Drogba scoring his third goal in four matches.

St Mirren, third-last in the league and fighting against relegation, won with a second-half Billy Mehmet penalty after Celtic captain Stephen McManus had brought down Craig Dargo. Cup holders Rangers beat Hamilton Academical 5-1 in their quarter-final. GREECE Panathinaikos warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League visit of Villarreal with a convincing 3-0 win over Larissa to move back into second place, level on points with PAOK Salonika but nine behind leaders Olympiakos Piraeus.
