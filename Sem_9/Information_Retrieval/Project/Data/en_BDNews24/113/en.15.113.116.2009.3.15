 March 15 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites Abahani moved into the Citycell Super Cup semi-finals with a comprehensive 3-0 win over Sheikh Russel KC in the final group clash at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. With three successive triumphs, the Sky Blues emerged Group A champions with maximum nine points from three outings while Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club finished runners-up with six points after beating Rahmatganj MFS 2-0 in the day's first match. With Chittagong Mohammedan already qualifying for the last four on better goal difference, Sheikh Russel with a win from two matches needed at least a 3-0 margin win against Abahani in their last match to put the B. League champions behind to ensure a semi-final berth. Abahani, however, needed just a draw against Sheikh Russel to finish atop in the group. Despite this simple equation, the Sky Blues adopted an attacking approach and got the dividend in the very sixth minute. Coach Amolesh Sen chose speedy Jahed Parvez Chowdhury in place of holding midfielder Prantosh Kumar, who showed enough never to do the job against spirited Chittagong Mohammedan in their 2-1 win, in the starting line-up and Jahid Hasan Emily got the ball to advance into the danger zone. Emily outfoxed Russel's defender Jahirul and Aminul and goalkeeper Khaled Azam Biplob to cut the ball back to Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim, who did not hesitate to give the Sky Blues a six-minute lead. Despite going one goal down, there was no surge from Sheikh Russel and the first half almost turned into a pedestrian affair though it seemed Russel lacked coordination in three departments. After the break, Abahani doubled the lead in the 68th minute when Wali Faisal whipped a cross from the left for Emily, who rose high to head the well-judged cross home to make the job for Russel hard. Though before conceding the second goal, Sheikh Russel's striker Samir Omari was in a threatening position inside the box, but Abahani defender Samad Yousuf stopped the Moroccan marksman. With 11 minutes to left, Sheikh Russel were reduced to 10 men as defender Prashanto Barua fouled Jahid Hasan Emily and Abahani, taking advantage of the numerical advantage, widened the margin one minute from time. Nigerian Emeka Christian, who struck four goals in previous two matches, played a fine one-two with substitute Shahazuddin Tipu to fire home, sending Sheikh Russel packing to the Plate Cup, a competition for bottom four teams. bd
