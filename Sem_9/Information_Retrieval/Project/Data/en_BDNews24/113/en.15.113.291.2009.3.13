 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wales will be without West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison for their World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Germany after he was ruled out for up to seven weeks with a dislocated kneecap on Thursday. West Ham confirmed on their website (www.whufc.com) Collison was recovering from surgery carried out earlier this week and they hoped he would play again before the end of the season. However, he will not be fit for the qualifiers against Finland on March 28 or Germany on April 1. Wales also hope that West Ham centre back James Collins, who has a hamstring strain, will recover in time to play. Striker Craig Bellamy, who tore tendons in his kneecap playing for Manchester City against West Ham on March 1, is another injury doubt for both matches. Wales are third in Group Four with six points, four behind leaders Germany
