 SRINAGAR, Mar 14(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troops in Kashmir shot dead five members of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group in clashes on Saturday, police said. Three of the militants were holed up in a mosque in Kishtawar district in Srinagar and were killed after a fierce encounter with security forces, police officer Kuldeep Singh said. Indian troops were carrying out a search operation in the mountainous Kishtawar area south of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, for other militants, Singh said. Two more LeT members were shot dead by security forces later on Saturday in another gun battle in north Kashmir, police said. New Delhi says the LeT was behind last November's attacks in Mumbai in which nearly 170 people were killed, a charge the rebel group has denied. Officials say more than 47,000 people have been killed since an anti-India insurgency broke out in 1989 in the disputed Himalayan region. Separatists put the toll at nearly 100,000. But overall violence involving Indian troops and separatist guerrillas has declined significantly across Kashmir since India and Pakistan began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. New Delhi put a pause on the dialogue after the Mumbai attacks.
