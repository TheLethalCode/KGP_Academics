 By Nigam Prusty NEW DELHI, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India and Pakistan must change the way they treat each other and bury a "dirty past" to tackle growing militancy in the region together, Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf said on Saturday. "The past has been dirty, the past has been bad, but don't put the blame on Pakistan," Musharraf said at a media event in New Delhi late on Saturday. "You tried to do damage to us, we were not sitting idle, we tried to damage you." He said both countries were to be blamed for decades of mistrust and dispute, but now need to move ahead.

The former president, who stepped down in August last year, said the army and the ISI were the best bets to fight the growing influence of the Taliban and militancy in Pakistan. "Please don't create misunderstanding in the world against the ISI and the army," he said. Pakistani authorities have been criticized after gunmen fired at the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore on Tuesday. "Pakistan is critical under the present circumstances to fight terrorism and extremism, Pakistan is critical to bring peace in the region," Musharraf said.
