 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club are looking forward to clinching the Super Cup to make up for the pain of coming second in the B league. The Black and Whites, who emerged champions in the season curtain-raiser Federation Cup, fell six points short of the coveted B League title to finish behind after archrivals Abahani. "I believe we will be champions if the boys can perform accordingly," said Mohammedan coach Maruful Islam at a media briefing at BFF House on Saturday. Rahmatganj MFS also appeared at the briefing, organised by the BFF to highlight how the clubs were preparing for the Super Cup, which begins on March 11 at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The Mohammedan coach felt that his side could not win the B. League because the strikers failed to avail the chances. Maruful, however, was pleased with the team's preparations that started three days after the B. League wrapped up. Alamu Bukola Olaleken was their main weapon in the competition as the Nigerian striker became the league's top scorer with 18 goals in 20 outings. So Mohammedan will once again rely on Olaleken, who is supposed to return to Dhaka in a couple of days with another Nigerian striker to play in the Super Cup. "He (Bukola) will bring another Nigerian striker, who is better than him according to Bukola," said Mohammedan manager Amirul Islam Babu adding that Egyptian Hazem Khaled Mahmood and Danny Emanuel were also playing for the club. Referring to the B League matches, Mohammedan captain Arman Aziz said that they played comparatively better than others, but could not get the desired results due to some mistakes, mostly made by the strikers. "But, we have learned from our mistakes and now we are concentrating on the Super Cup to be champions," said Aziz. Aziz was also happy that both Hasan Al Mamun and striker Mohammad Robin had recovered from injury. B. league giant-killers Rahmatganj were eying a semi-final spot. "We started our B League campaign upsetting Abahani and now want to repeat the act in the Super Cup," said Rahmatganj manager Hazi Harunur Rashid. Rahmatganj also stunned Mohammedan Sporting Club and beat Chittagong Abahani and Khulna Abahani in the B League to finish seventh in the 11-team table. Coach Mir Mohammad Faruque said that they had strengthened some areas with the inclusion of Azmal Hossain Buddut, Tajul Islam, Himel, Akram, Kamal and Rassul. "Our target is to win every match whoever the opponents are," said Faruque, who considered Nche Francis, Mostafa Kaba, Idris Kasirya and Felix as his key weapons. "We managed to cause a few upsets to enter as one of the top eight teams for the Super Cup. I believe we will be able to challenge the big guns in this tournament too," said captain Nche Francis. bd
