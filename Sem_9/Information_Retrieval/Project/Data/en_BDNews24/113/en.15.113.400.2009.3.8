 Jamalpur, March 8 (bdnews24.com) - Unknown attackers killed four members of a family in Jamalpur, police said on Sunday. The attackers strangled Shahjahan, of Fulkar Char in Islampur, wife Sabuja Khatun, their five year-old son Sohan and one and a half year-old daughter Sujeda. Monirul Islam, sub-inspector of Islampur police station, said they had not yet uncovered the motive behind the murders. Locals said a long-standing land dispute between Shahjahan and his two brothers, Samag and Surjaler, might be behind the killings. Since the killings, all the members of the household, including Samad and Surjal, were on the run, they said. Union Parisad chairman, Maksusdur Rahman, said he discovered Shahjahan's body hanging from a jackfruit tree and three other bodies lying on their bed. On hearing the news, police recovered the bodies at around 11am. bdn
