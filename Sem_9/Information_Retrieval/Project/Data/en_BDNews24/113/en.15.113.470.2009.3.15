 WASHINGTON, Sun Mar 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Vice President Dick Cheney said on Sunday he was unhappy with then-President George W Bush's refusal to pardon Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Cheney's onetime chief of staff who was convicted in the CIA leak case. "I was clearly not happy that we, in effect, left Scooter sort of hanging in the wind," Cheney said in an interview on CNN's "State of the Union with John King."

In one of his first acts after taking office, Obama vowed to close the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba within a year. It now holds about 240 terrorism suspects. He also ordered more humane treatment for terrorism suspects and an end to renditions, the practice of transporting foreign detainees to other countries for interrogation.

Cheney defended the policies adopted by the Bush administration in the war on terrorism as being done legally and in accordance with US "constitutional practices and principles."
