 PORT OF SPAIN, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies's bid to win their first series against England since 1998 have been hit by injuries to two important players. England scored 258 for two on the first day of the fifth and final test on Friday against an attack shorn of dangerous paceman Jerome Taylor (ankle injury). To add to West Indies woes, batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul injured his groin while fielding. The loss of Taylor was a huge blow for the hosts, who have depended on the Jamaican and Fidel Edwards for their strike bowling this series. Taylor, who took seven wickets in the first-test win over England, struggled with his ankle in the fourth test in Barbados. LITTLE NIGGLES "We were hopeful he would have been able to play," coach John Dyson told reporters. "But he is carrying two little niggles and the feeling was he probably would not last the five days. "We just couldn't risk that," added the Australian, who also said Taylor was carrying a hip problem. Chanderpaul pulled up when chasing the shot which gave England captain Andrew Strauss (139 not out) his third century of the series. The prolific left-hander, the anchor of the West Indies middle-order, left the field immediately to receive treatment. "At this point he has strained a groin muscle and we won't know the full extent of the injury until he has had full treatment after play and a night's rest on it," said Dyson. The only piece of good news for West Indies was the sight of all-rounder Dwayne Bravo, who has missed the entire series following an ankle operation, on the field as a substitute for Chanderpaul. Bravo, whose lively medium-quick bowling and hard-hitting batting have been missed, is hoping to be fit for the five one-day games that follow the tests
