<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  Police authorities have removed the CID officer who was overseeing the investigation of the BDR mutiny case. CID chief Javed Patwari said on Friday he had ordered Misarul Arif to take over, replacing special superintendent (SSP) Abdullahhel Baki. Arif will now keep tabs on the investigation that is being led by ASP Abdul Qahhar Akhand, who famously conducted the Bangabandhu murder inquiry in the late 1990s. Baki was Ctg deputy police commissioner in 2004 The controversial Baki was in charge of Chittagong port during the April 1, 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of arms, to which the then government and intelligence operatives have been linked. Ten trucks of rifles and grenades were seized as they were being unloaded at the Urea Fertiliser Ghat in Anwara. The government last month ordered a fresh probe into the incident. Two separate cases were filed at the time, under the arms act and on smuggling charges, but the state minister for home, Tanjim Ahmed, recently questioned why the investigations had failed to disclose key facts to date. CID grilling BDR accused The Criminal Investigation Department took over investigation of the BDR case on Mar 1, the day after Lalbagh police sued more than 1,000 BDR members, including at least one of the alleged ringleaders DAD Touhidul Alam. On Mar 4, a Dhaka court gave the CID seven days to question Touhid and four others, arrested the day before. Another 22 BDR men were arrested up to Friday. bdnews24.com/
