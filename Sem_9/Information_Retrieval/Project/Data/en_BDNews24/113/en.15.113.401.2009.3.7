 SRINAGAR, India, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) on Friday denied involvement in the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore, saying it was the "handiwork" of Indian agencies. "The attack on Sri Lankan cricketers is an attack on Pakistan, which Kashmiri Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba cannot even think of," Abdullah Gaznavi, the spokesman for the group, told Reuters by telephone. "The attack is the handiwork of Indian agencies to malign the freedom struggle of Kashmir and Pakistan," Gaznavi said from an undisclosed location. Pakistani authorities said they were making progress in the investigation on the attack on Sri Lankan cricketers as they drove to the main stadium in Lahore on Tuesday. Seven Pakistanis, six policemen and the driver of a bus carrying match officials, were killed. Six Sri Lankan players and two team officials were wounded. Members of the banned LeT are emerging as the most likely culprits, Dawn newspaper on Friday cited investigators as saying. "Media reports suggesting Lashkar's involvement in the attack are lies and against journalistic ethics," said Gaznavi. India says the LeT was behind November's attacks in Mumbai which killed nearly 170 people
