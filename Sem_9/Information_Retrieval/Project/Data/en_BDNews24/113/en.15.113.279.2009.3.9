<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he is concerned that militants could attack Premier League clubs but added he had no plans to seek increased security for his side. Wenger was speaking after Tuesday's militant attack on the bus of the Sri Lankan cricket team in the Pakistani city of Lahore and his comments were widely reported in Britain's Sunday newspapers. Seven people were killed in the attack and a number of Sri Lanka's cricketers were injured as players and match officials were making their way to the Gaddafi Stadium for the third day of the second test between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Wenger said: "We don't regard ourselves as targets, but you wonder, "why not?". I am surprised football has not been targeted," the Sunday Mirror quoted him as saying. "But we have not brought in added security." Asked if he thought his team were ever in danger, he replied: "No, but sport has become a major world famous thing and it is a good thing to attract attention. "In England you don't get a police escort and its more and more difficult to get one before games. The police just refuse - especially in London." The People quoted him as saying: "You have to rely on the internal security of the country you are in." Wenger said he had no plans to increase security around his players, however. "I don't live with the obsession of security and I won't be getting any security for our team. The police have to look after it. I do not want security and I do not want five doctors." Although no attacks have been made on football, Wenger added: "I have thought about that many times when you go to World Cups or the European Championship. "We have had alerts before a game at home. We kept it as quiet as much as we can because often you find a bag in the stadium someone has forgotten.
