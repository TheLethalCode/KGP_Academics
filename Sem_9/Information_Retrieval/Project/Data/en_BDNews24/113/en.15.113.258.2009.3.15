 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com) The government will suspend gas supply to two fertiliser plants, and may order shops and malls to close an hour earlier, to face the acute power crisis across the country. Ministry officials said Sunday that gas supply to the two factories in Polash and Ghorasal would be shut off to conserve gas for power. They said some 45-49 million cubic feet of gas could be diverted for power production. State minister for the power Shamsul Haq told reporters earlier in the day: "We are seriously considering whether to order shops shut by 7pm instead of 8pm." The ministry also took a decision Sunday to monitor the power and gas situation on a daily basis, he said. "We are practicing load management on the basis of the past caretaker government's system." "The situation is being monitored from all divisional headquarters. The ministry also has a monitoring cell," he said. The minister said irrigation was also being given top priority. Replying to a question, Haq said, "We don't think Boro production will be hampered, because we took the decision in principal to divert power from urban areas to rural for irrigation." But, Haq added, "We need at least a year to solve the power crisis." The prime minister's adviser Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury told reporters after the ministry meeting, "We are looking at power management very carefully." Asked about water authorities' difficulties in extracting water due to power cuts in the capital, he said they would look into the truth of the matter. "We are trying to divert more gas to power production," he added. According to the Power Development Board, maximum power generation was 3,600MW on Sunday against maximum demand of 4,550MW. Generation was 601MW short on maintenance and rehabilitation and 493MW short on gas shortages. Estimated 'load shedding' amounted to 870MW.
