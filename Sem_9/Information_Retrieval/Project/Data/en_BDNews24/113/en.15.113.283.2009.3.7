<TITLE> No militant links found so far: CID </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  The CID chief has said his investigators have yet to find any link to militants in the bloody BDR mutiny. "We are investigating, information is still coming in, but we have found no such links so far," CID chief Javed Patwari told bdnews24.com, in the face of media speculation on militant 'linkages' to the Feb 25-26 massacre. Patwari also said CID special superintendent Abdullahhel Baki, who was overseeing the investigation of the case, has been replaced by Misarul Arif. Arif will now keep tabs on the investigation being led by ASP Abdul Qahhar Akhand, who famously conducted the Bangabandhu murder inquiry in the late 1990s. Qahhar told bdnews24.com Saturday eight more BDR men were named in the case, bringing the total to around 40. Lalbagh police filed the case on Feb 28 against more than 1,000 BDR members, though just six were initially named. Another six detained suspects were shown arrested in the case on Saturday and two suspected mutineers were arrested from inside the Peelkhana headquarters, said Qahhar. Akhand said they were interrogating more people and still amassing evidence. Three revolvers, a sub-machine gun and 36 bullets were recovered from inside the headquarters Saturday, which had allegedly been used during the armed uprising. CID took over the investigation on Mar 1.
