 ANTANANARIVO, Sun Mar 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Madagascar's opposition leader was in hiding and his television station off air on Sunday as authorities intensified their crackdown on his anti-government movement after weeks of unrest. A close aide to Andry Rajoelina, who accuses the president of transforming Madagascar into his own personal fiefdom, said the capital's sacked mayor would remain at an undisclosed location until his security could be guaranteed. A deadly power struggle between 34-year-old Rajoelina and President Marc Ravalomanana ignited the unrest that has killed around 135 people and crippled the island's $390 million tourism sector.

It was the initial banning of Viva TV last December, after the station aired an interview with exiled former president Didier Ratsiraka, which triggered the political crisis. Armed riot police continued to block access to the city's main square on Sunday. Many Malagasy people blame Ravalomanana for grim levels of poverty at a time the economy of the world's fourth largest island has grown steadily off the back of booming oil and mineral sectors. Ravalomanana, 59, a self-made millionaire who founded his business empire flogging yoghurt off a bicycle, has denied abusing state power and said he will fulfill his mandate which expires in 2011. Madagascar has opened its doors to major foreign multinationals including Rio Tinto and Sherritt International which are looking to extract cobalt, nickel and Ilme
