<TITLE> India carried mutiny mayhem: Nizami </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  The BDR bloodbath was carried out from the 'intelligence headquarters' of India, opposition Jamaat-e-Islami chief has said. "How come the Indian media ran the news of the BDR carnage citing their intelligence sources before the local TV stations could cover it?" Matiur Rahman Nizami asked at a party programme in the city. He referred to the mass-selling dailies Anandabazar, Daily Telegraph and The Times of India which reported the Feb.25-26 carnage that left 55 army officers dead or missing. The 'killing mission' was executed from the intelligence headquarters through 'close monitoring', the Jamaat chief further alleged. He said India pulled a masterstroke by destroying the border guards and trying to weaken the army, and national security and defence. "It needs to be seen whose interest could be behind the incident," Nizami added. He demanded 'fair, impartial' investigation and called for a halt in the blame game. The former minister was critical of the way the government handled the crisis. "The government is saying there would have been more casualties if the army stormed the BDR compound. Aren't the body counts huge already? "I think the massacre could have been averted without firing a single shot if the Artillery Brigade was given the responsibility." bdnews
