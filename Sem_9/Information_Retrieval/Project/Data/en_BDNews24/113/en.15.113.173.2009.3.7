<TITLE> Trial process depends on probe report: Shafiq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  The trial process of the BDR mutiny case depends on the outcome of the investigation, the law minister said on Saturday. The constitution may have to be amended if a special tribunal is to try the mutineers, Shafiq Ahmed said. "But what type of court and under which law the mutiny case will be tried ultimately depends on the investigation report," said the minister, at a programme of the Judicial Administration Training Institute. "If the investigation finds that only BDR members were involved in the incident, then the trial process will go one way, which will differ from that if any 'outside forces' are found involved," he said. The existing speedy trial tribunal might be enough to try the perpetrators if there were no outsiders involved, Shafiq said. He said the BDR mutineers might also be tried under the International Crime Tribunal Act 1973. "But if any new special tribunal needs to be formed, however, the constitution will have to be amended," he said. Asked about possibility of Court Martial, the minister replied, it might come into play if the case was tried under the Army Act 1952. "But everything depends on the probe report, under which law they will be tried or what measures will have to be taken." The law minister had earlier said laws would be enacted and a special tribunal would be formed if necessary for the trial of the mutineers. bdne
