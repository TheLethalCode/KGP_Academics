 ANTRIM, Northern Ireland, Mon Mar 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited troops in Northern Ireland on Monday after a republican splinter group killed two British soldiers in the worst attack in the province in a decade. Police ramped up the hunt for the killers of the two soldiers who were shot dead late on Saturday as they collected pizzas at the gates of an army base near Antrim, a commuter town outside Belfast. "You never stood a chance, gunned down by cowardly scum," read one of wreaths of flowers laid outside the barracks. Brown has promised to "bring the murderers to justice" and on Monday visited the army base where the attack took place. The soldiers were the first British troops to be killed in the province since 1997. A caller to the Dublin-based Sunday Tribune newspaper on Sunday claimed responsibility for the shooting in the name of the South Antrim brigade of the Real IRA. A splinter group that left the main Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Real IRA wants a united Ireland and the withdrawal of all British troops from the province. Former foes across the sectarian divide vowed the killings would not plunge the province back into violence seen before a 1998 peace deal ended 30 years of conflict, known as "The Troubles," which killed over 3,600 people. The IRA, which fought British rule for decades and drew support from the minority Roman Catholic community, and pro-British Protestant guerrilla groups agreed to ceasefires under the 1998 deal. Despite a power-sharing pact between IRA ally Sinn Fein and pro-British Democratic Unionist Party in 2007, which cemented the 1998 accord, sporadic violence has continued. "A vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want to stick with the peace, want to stick with the political process," British Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Jacqui Smith said on Monday. "It's extremely important that that happens as well as we catch these people," Smith told station GMTV. The weekend shooting followed a police warning last week that the threat from IRA splinter groups was again high. The Real IRA carried out the deadliest single bombing of Northern Ireland's sectarian violence in the market town of Omagh in August 1998. Twenty-nine people were killed. At the end of January police defused a 300-pound (140 kg) car bomb been left by dissident republicans in a Northern Irish village. "Any resumption of violence in Northern Ireland will cause inestimable damage to the peace process, prevent foreign investment and contribute to rising unemployment," the Dublin-based Irish Times wrote in a editorial. "There should be no return to the dark days of the past," it said. British troops stood down in 2007 after their 38-year role supporting police in the province, ending their longest military operation ever. A maximum of 5,000 military personnel as part of a "peacetime garrison" is stationed in Northern Ireland. The two soldiers who were killed were in their 20s and due to fly out for duty in Afghani
