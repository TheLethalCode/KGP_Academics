<TEXT>
 March 15 (bdnews24.com) A brace from Ghanaian Raphael Sango took Chittagong Mohammedan to the semi-finals of the Citycell Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Rahmatganj MFS in their last Group A match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. Raphael struck in each half to raise the port city team's points tally to six from three outings. The Chittagong Black and Whites, who showed plenty of spirit in their 2-0 win against Russel and 2-1 loss to Abahani despite going ahead in the match, went into the game knowing that only a win against Rahmatganj would guarantee them a place in the last four. They launched the first attack in the seventh minute when Liberian midfielder Anthony Pele Doe's sudden dipping shot outside the box was tipped over by goalkeeper Himel. The same player once again went close in the 21st minute when goalkeeper Himel palmed away a curing shot off him. One minute later, Rahmatganj should have taken the lead when Felix Onyo Koro sprang the off-side trap to advance into the danger zone and placed the ball for an unmarked captain Nche Francis, who drove it miles off the target. Chittagong Mohammedan created a fine scoring chance in the 33rd minute when Mashud Parvez Kaiser played a nice one-two with Nasir to enter in the box, but his flick was thwarted by keeper Himel. The port city side finally broke the deadlock in the 39th minute with Raphael tapping the ball from close range. Himel, who showed his nerve to thwart at least four good efforts, fisted a Kaiser free kick, but former Army marksman Nasir headed the follow-up down for Raphael to tap into the right side of the net. After the interval, Chittagong Mohammedan's defensive approach suggested that they were satisfied with a 1-0 lead. Rahmatganj, however, failed to take advantage of having so much of the ball as most of their well-worked attacks broke down. Only Idris' powered-packed shot in 66th minute that came narrowly went over the crosspiece was the closet they scoring a goal Seven minutes later, Chittagong Mohammedan sealed the match from a counter-attack when Raphael, being set up by compatriot Mousa F Camara, beat the advancing goalkeeper to place the ball home. bd
