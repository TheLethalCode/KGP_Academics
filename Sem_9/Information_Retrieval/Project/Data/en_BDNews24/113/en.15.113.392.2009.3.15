 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has renewed her government's pledge to develop "a special package" of support to global recession-hit businesses in Bangladesh, a top aide said on Sunday. "The government is closely watching the global developments, with the finance minister himself in charge," press secretary Abul Kalam Azad quoted the prime minister as telling a team of FBCCI Sunday. Azad said Hasina was happy that top traders took steps to lower the price of edible oil as well as cut the prices of essentials. She also told the business chiefs that the government would so all to ensure uninterrupted exports. She asked them to try to find new labour markets and help solve the crisis in the existing ones. She said special economic zones would be set up in the underdeveloped and neglected regions of the country and asked the businessmen to invest there. She said she believed there was a huge demand for organic fruits and vegetables around the world and recommended efforts towards exporting such products. The prime minister said her government would ensure that both the public and private sectors were given equal opportunity. She asked them to take steps to generate power for their own factories and added the government was also considering generating hydro-electricity. The prime minister thanked the business community for support in handling the BDR mutiny, Azad said. The FBCCI team members praised Hasina for securing a peaceful solution to the crisis, Azad said. "I don't want any such situation to happen. I want peace," Azad quoted the prime minister as saying. "Such incidents damage our trade and exports." The 41-member FBCCI delegation, led by president Annisul Huq, spent nearly two hours with the prime minister from around 10:30 am.
