 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina's cousin Sheikh Helal Uddin on Saturday was all set to become MP for Bagherhat-1, one of the two seats vacated by the prime minister. Sheikh Helal is the son Sheikh Naser Rahman, younger brother of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Both were killed on Aug 15, 1975, along with other members of the family. Voting was due on Apr 2 for the seat as well as six other constituencies, but two other Bagherhat candidates failed to pass the EC scrutiny. The last date for appeal against the EC decision was Saturday. Nazmul Hasan, the EC official in charge of receiving appeals, told bdnews24.com that he had not received any appeal till 5pm. "He is all set to become MP, but a formal announcement will be made on Mar 17, the last day of nomination withdrawal," EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, three Rangpur-6 candidates Saturday challenged the EC decision cancelling their nominations. Motaharul Huq Bablu, Nur Alam Miah and Haider Rahman Miah, all independent candidates, were rejected by the EC on Mar 11. They were among 10 such candidates rejected by the EC. Rangpur-6 was also won by Sheikh Hasina in the Dec 29 election. Of the other five vacated seats, Khaleda Zia won Bogra 6-7, H M Ershad Rangpur-3 and Kurigram-2 and president Md Zillur Rahman Kishoreganj-6. bdn
