 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Brothers Union improved their semi-final hopes with an emphatic 3-0 win over 10-man Chittagong Abahani in the Citycell Super Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. Zahid Hossain, Henry Quaye and Mehdi Hasan Tapu struck one goal each for the Orange outfit, who raised their points tally to four after playing a goalless draw against Farashganj Sporting Club. With successive defeats in two matches, Chittagong Abahani crashed out of the eight-team tournament. The day's match got off to sparkling start with both sides coming close to opening their accounts in the first six minutes. Brothers, however, put up improve performance than their first match and started to control the midfield. Coach Wasim Iqbal chose Hasan Imam Rikto in the starting line-up with midfielders Motiur Munna and Shakil Ahmed. The Gopibagh-based outfit continued to press hard on the Sky Blues of the port city and got the dividend from a fumble by Abahani defenders Jahangir Alam Mintu and Nazir. The ball was played low from the middle and Jahid snatched it from Mintu to advance into the danger zone from the right to lash the ball past goalkeeper Sujan Chowdhury in the 36th minute, though defender Joseph Fullo Samai tried to block Jahid inside the box. Playmaker Rikto then found unmarked Arup Kumar Baiddya on the right and the winger darted into the box to set Henry, who just tapped the ball home from a handshaking distance to double Brothers' margin in the 44th minute. To add misery, Abahani midfielder Othelo Banei picked up the first red card of the tournament just before the break when he fouled Rikto in an off-the-ball situation. After the resumption, Abahani coach M Kashed sent on Shariful Islam in place of left-stopper Mintu to restrict a spirited Jahid, but the substitute defender could hardly do his job. Brothers Union kept on creating chances and the winners got the third goal in the 63rd minute. An Atiqur Rahman Mishu corner from the left was deflected on way to Tapu, who just flicked inside the box to find the back of the Abahani net. The Brothers coach Wasim Iqbal brought on Jahid, Rikto and Henry in place of Rony Islam, Masud Rana and Abdullah Parvez, who, however, had no impact in the remaining time. bd
