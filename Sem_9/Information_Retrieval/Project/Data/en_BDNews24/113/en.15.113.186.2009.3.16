<TITLE> Some are protecting mutiny suspects to save themselves: Faruq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce minister Faruq Khan has said "some people" with links to the BDR mutiny are protecting those who were directly involved in the killings. He said there were others involved in the mutiny "along with militants". "Some people in order to save themselves are trying to assist or protect those who were more directly involved," the minister, who is coordinating the various mutiny probes, told reporters on Monday. Last week, Faruq, a former army officer, said evidence had been found tying the banned Islamist outfit Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh to the Feb 25-26 massacre at the BDR headquarters. Pressed by reporters on Monday to give more details, Faruq said: "It won't be right to disclose anything now. The investigation is ongoing." Some border guards are still fugitive, he said. "Some got away with arms and grenades. They are a threat to the country, nation and society unless caught." He called on the fugitives to return to barracks and surrender the looted arms and ammo. The minister repeated the prime minister's recent announcement that no innocent BDR member would be punished or harassed. "Measures will be taken against the guilty ones alone," he said. He said the government probe committee would submit its report soon. "Things are fast returning to normal for BDR, at its headquarters and across the country," he said. "Border patrols have been carrying out their routine duties." bdnews24.com/m
