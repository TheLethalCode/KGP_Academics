 PORT OF SPAIN, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paul Collingwood and Matt Prior cracked centuries in a 218-run partnership to carry England to 546 for six declared on the second day of the fifth and final test against West Indies on Saturday. West Indies in reply raced to 90 for no loss inside 17 overs before Devon Smith was bowled by Monty Panesar for 28 with two overs remaining. Captain Chris Gayle was unbeaten on 49 alongside nightwatchman Daren Powell as the hosts closed on 92 for one. England will be satisfied with their progress but in a game they need to win the true challenge is still to come, they must bowl West Indies out twice in the remaining three days to level the series 1-1. The surface remains slow and low and unless it deteriorates badly, getting 20 wickets will be a tough task against a team that scored 749 in Barbados last week. West Indies, who used eight bowlers, kept a defensive field for most of the day and seemed content for England to take their time in getting a big score. For the most part, with gentle medium-pacer Brendan Nash and part-time spinner Ryan Hinds in action against England batsmen unwilling to take risks, it was a second day of disappointing cricket. The day began brightly for West Indies, picking up two early wickets after England resumed on 258 for two. HAND CRAMP Fidel Edwards bowled Andrew Strauss around his legs, the England skipper having added three runs to his overnight 139. A nervous-looking Owais Shah, resuming his innings after retiring hurt with hand cramp on Friday, was then run out for 33 by substitute fielder Dwayne Bravo at mid-wicket. Then came the fifth-wicket partnership between Prior and Collingwood which restored England's momentum. Wicketkeeper Prior was the most aggressive, with 20 of his first 24 runs coming in fours. Collingwood, solid and dependable as usual, put away the bad balls as he brought up his ninth test century and his fourth against West Indies. Prior, who missed the last test on paternity leave, celebrated the birth of his son with his second test century. He rocked his arms to salute the milestone but by then much of the crowd had begun to lose interest. Collingwood finally went for 161, trapped leg before as seamer Lionel Baker claimed his first test wicket. Baker picked up a second when he got rid of Stuart Broad, caught by Lendl Simmons for 19 going for a big hit. Prior was unbeaten on 131 when the declaration came. The negativity in the home side's bowling was not evident when they batted with 19 overs to navigate before the close, Gayle taking on England's attack and smashing spinner Graeme Swann for two straight sixes. Gayle also struck six fours as he looked in menacing form. The shine was taken off the spritely start when Smith misread Panesar's straight delivery and was bowled through the g
