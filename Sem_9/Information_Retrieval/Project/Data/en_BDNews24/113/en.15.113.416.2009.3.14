<TITLE> Fire service exposed, yet again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  The fire service has once again been agonisingly exposed to its serious handicaps. Fighting fire in multi-storied buildings has never been their fortethe 2007 blaze that burnt BSEC Bhaban nearby was a glaring example revisited Friday. Officials and shop-owners said the authorities made a futile attempt to tame the flames after the 17th floor that houses corporate offices at Bashundhara City shopping complex caught fire minutes before 2pm. Security guards rushed to the floor but eight of them were trapped there. The upper part of the 20th floor burnt down before them. They called the fire service headquarters and said smoke was coming out of the 17th floor. They were told that a team was already on the way. A shop-owner, Tofael Ahmed, said the firefighters came to the scene at around 2:30pm but did not do anything remarkable immediately to douse the fire. They ran around for water and then tried to spray water on the flames but the water did not reach the fire-engulfed floor, he said. Later, they tried to reach water there through Skylift at around 3:30pm when fire started jumping to the top of Bashundhara Tower. And again they failed. Firemen finally entered the Bashundhara City compound and took 30 minutes to climb up the upper floor on Skylift and still failed to hose the fire down. Fire servicemen from the eighth floor tried to douse the fire spreading behind the complex, but the water even could not touch the 17th floor. State minister for home affairs Tanjim Ahmed Sohel said at the scene it needed to be investigated why such big buildings were allowed to be built when firemen could not douse the fire in those buildings. The firefighters had failed on Feb. 26, 2007 to put out the flames in the multi-storied BSEC Bhaban which housed private TV stations NTV, RTV, daily Amar Desh and seven other company offices. bd
