 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Injury news ahead of this weekend's FA Cup and Premier League matches: Nicholas Anelka will miss Chelsea's FA Cup quarter-final at Coventry City because of a toe injury. Michael Essien and Ricardo Carvalho, who have begun their comebacks from long-term injuries by playing for the reserves, are unlikely to feature either. Coventry will be without fullback Daniel Fox, who has an injured knee. Striker Leon Best, who scored Coventry's winner against Blackburn Rovers in the fifth round, has recovered from a throat infection and will wear a mask to protect a fractured cheekbone. Theo Walcott, who has not played since November because of a shoulder injury, could return to the Arsenal squad for their delayed fifth round tie against Burnley on Sunday. Striker Eduardo could also be in contention after recovering from a hamstring injury. Kolo Toure (calf) will not play, although William Gallas has recovered from an ankle injury. Burnley, who knocked Arsenal out of the League Cup in December, will be without defenders Rhys Williams and Michael Duff for the match at the Emirates. Duff is serving a one-match suspension while Williams, who is on loan from Middlesbrough, has not been given permission to play by his parent club. Sunderland midfielder Teemu Tainio will miss the match against his former club Tottenham Hotspur because of a knee injury. It is the only Premier League game being played on Saturday
