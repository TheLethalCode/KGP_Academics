 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  An army officer died in still unclear circumstances Saturday at Rajmoni Isa Kha Hotel in the city, police said. Captain Razibul Haque Himel, 28, worked at the Armoured Core at Falahaati Cantonment at Parbatipur, Dinajpur, the deputy commissioner of Ramna Zone, Atiqul Islam, told reporters. He came to Dhaka for a day while undergoing training at Bogra Cantonment. His home is in Uzirpur, Barisal and his parents live in Shantinagar in the capital. Islam said the hotel authorities called to inform him at around 5:15pm that the body was lying at the lobby of the second floor. They were claiming that Himel had jumped to his death from room 903, the police officer said. The hotel's reception manager Abdur Rahman said captain Himel checked in at around midday identifying himself as Himel Ishtiaque Ahmed of Halishahar, Chittagong. But professor Shafiqul Haque, his maternal uncle, said it was a "planned murder" because the hotel authorities had washed the corpse before the police had come. "His brains would have spilled all over if he had jumped from the eighth floor." He also said blood was found in the bed sheet and basin in the room, which suggested that someone had washed his hand after the killing. There was also a broken glass there and the body was kept downstairs after the murder, he further alleged. The hotel authorities were involved with the murder, he claimed. Police are investigating the incident, Islam said. bd
