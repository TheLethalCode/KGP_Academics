<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  No case was filed up to 9pm Sunday after an army officer died in still unclear circumstances at Rajmoni Isa Kha Hotel in the city Saturday. Mofijul Islam, assistant sub-inspector of Ramna Police Station, said 28-year-old Captain Razibul Haque Himel's maternal uncle Masud Ali said they would file a case after a family meeting. Police, however, had questioned a few staffers, he said. They said they also discovered a number of a woman from call list on his mobile phone. Ramna police chief Daulat Akbar said they suspect the woman was with him during his death and or she was supposed to meet him. She was questioned on mobile phone since she was in Chittagong. She has been asked to immediately come to Dhaka, he added. The body was taken to the Combined Military Hospital after autopsy at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. His funeral prayers were held at Shantinagar. Another Namaz-e-Janaza will be held at the CMH before he is buried at the Banani graveyard Sunday. Himel worked at the Armoured Core at Falahaati Cantonment at Parbatipur, Dinajpur and came to Dhaka for a day while undergoing training at Bogra Cantonment. His home is in Uzirpur, Barisal and his parents live in Shantinagar in the capital. The hotel authorities told police Saturday that the body was lying at the lobby of the second floor. They claimed that Himel had jumped to his death from room 903. The hotel's reception manager Abdur Rahman said captain Himel checked in at around midday identifying himself as Himel Ishtiaque Ahmed of Halishahar, Chittagong. But professor Shafiqul Haque, another maternal uncle, said it was a "planned murder" because the hotel authorities had washed the corpse before the police had come. "His brains would have spilled all over if he had jumped from the eighth floor." He also said blood was found in the bed sheet and basin in the room, which suggested that someone had washed his hand after the killing. There was also a broken glass there and the body was kept downstairs after the murder, he further alleged. bdnew
