 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  A special incentive package for export-focused sectors will be announced in a month to help them face the global financial crisis, the finance minister has said. "Exporters are apprehensive about the adverse impact of the worldwide recession," AMA Muhith told reporters Sunday after a meeting with leather industry leaders. "Different sectors have been approaching the government for special financial packages because of the global scenario." Hew said, the government is monitoring the varying degrees of impact upon different sectors. "The findings will be culled and based on them a special integrated incentive package will be announced within a month." The minister met with members of Bangladesh Finished Leather, Leather Goods and Footwear Exporters Association and Bangladesh Tanners Association before speaking to the media. "The leather industry representatives say they will relocate tannery units from Hazaribagh in the city to Savar in two years," Muhith said. They sought a Tk 250 crore compensation deal from the government for the move, he added. "I haven't promised them anything," he said, adding the government will decide about the issue. bdnews
