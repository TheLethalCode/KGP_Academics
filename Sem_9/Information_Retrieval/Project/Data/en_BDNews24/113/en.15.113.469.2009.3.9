 LONDON, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United will meet Everton and Arsenal or Hull City will face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals following the draw on Sunday. The games will take place at Wembley Stadium on April 18 and 19 with the final at Wembley on May 30, the latest date for the final in 137 years of the competition. Manchester United, still in the hunt for five trophies this season, will seek to avenge their 1995 FA Cup final defeat by Everton. The champions have only lost once to the Merseyside club in 29 matches since, however, beating them 1-0 at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season and drawing 1-1 at Goodison Park. United reached the last four with a 4-0 demolition of Fulham on Saturday and Everton overturned Middlesbrough's halftime lead to beat them 2-1 on Sunday. Arsenal knocked Burnley out in their delayed fifth-round tie with an easy 3-0 win at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday and will face Hull in the quarter-finals on March 17 or 18. Hull, who surprisingly beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Emirates in September, last reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1930. The winners will face Chelsea, who cruised into their third semi-final in four years with a 2-0 win at Coventry City of the Championship on Saturday. Chelsea have reached the last four without meeting another Premier League side
