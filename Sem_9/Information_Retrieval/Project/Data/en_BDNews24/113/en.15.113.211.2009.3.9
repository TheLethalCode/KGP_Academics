 MILAN, March 8 (Reuters) - David Beckham is leaving his options open when he finishes the Major League Soccer season with Los Angeles Galaxy in November, the former England captain said on Sunday. The 33-year-old, who has agreed to extend his loan spell with AC Milan until June, will return to the United States for the second half of the MLS season and then decide if he should try to come back to Italy. "Once I finish the season here I'll have a four-week break then I'll go back to LA and play for the Galaxy for the rest of the season, which will be good, it's something I am committed to, and after that we'll see," Beckham said in quotes released to Reuters. ADVERTISEMENT He has the option to return to Milan and because he has enjoyed his time at the San Siro and the Rossoneri would like to keep him, it is likely he will go back to Italy. His original two-month loan was due to expire on Monday and the midfielder, who has made a financial sacrifice himself, thanked Milan and Galaxy for making the new agreement happen. "There's been lots of toing and froing and in the end I thought it would go down to the last hour and I'd be packing my bags but it's the day before, which has been good," he said. "I've been able to help myself stay in Milan. It's never ever been about the money for me. It's always been about the football and my passion for football." WORLD CUP The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player, who wanted to join Milan to boost his chances of playing at a fourth World Cup in 2010, denied accusations he would be tired playing for such a long stretch of time. "Of course, people have talked about the amount of games I've playedbut that's never bothered me. But if you look at it I get a good rest in the summer, four weeks and then in December. It is a good deal on that side as well," he said. "Even in the three months I've been here I feel my game's improved. Physically, I'm possibly in the best shape of my career. If this gives me a better chance of being in the (England) squad I'll do everything possible to make that happen." Beckham signed for Galaxy from Real Madrid in 2007 as part of a drive to boost interest in soccer in the U.S. Critics said he went to a less high-profile league too early and that his plan has failed given Galaxy missed out on the MLS playoffs last term. "People have always asked me if I regret my decision," he said. "Throughout my career and throughout my life I've never wanted regrets. I've said no. At the time I thought it was the best thing to do. "Statistics show that the game has grown (in the U.S) but it's not going to happen overnight," added Beckham, who sees himself being involved with the MLS for a long time. "I have an option to own an MLS franchise as soon as I finish playing and I will start that immediately," he said. "It is something I'm really excited about and so hopefully that proves to a lot of people that I am committed to making the game bigger and better in the U.
