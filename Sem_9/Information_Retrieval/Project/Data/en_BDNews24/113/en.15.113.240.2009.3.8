<TITLE> Dhaka water crisis rises on power cuts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  Power cuts are causing acute water shortages in Dhaka, adding to the sufferings of millions of residents, and the government sees no total solution to the crisis this year. Frequent power cuts and shortages of water before summer is yet to set in are forecasting a grim picture for city dwellers in the coming hot months. "For days now, we have been getting water for only two hours after midnight and the flow is thin, making it almost impossible to complete necessary washing throughout the day," Saiful Islam Shaheen, a resident of Shewrapara in Mirpur, told bdnews24.com Sunday. Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority blamed the power shortages for disruptions in water supply, as electric pumps draw water from the city's deep tube-wells. DESCO and DPDC, two of three power supplying agencies in the city, have been able to supply just 1000-1200MW in areas under their coverage against a demand of 1500MW a day. "There are seven to eight power cuts a day; how we can pull up water?" asks WASA managing director Raihanul Abedin. Of Dhaka WASA's 504 deep tube-wells, 233 have permanent alternate power generators to lift and purify waters with 41 more mobile generators for emergency. Areas under WASA coverage have a demand of 205 crore (20.5 billion) litres of water a day. The agency has a capacity of 194 crore litres, and manages to supply about 190 crore litres, said Abedin. "WASA is trying to minimise the 15 crore-litre water deficit," he added. The agency's public relations department said they are setting up 10 more deep tube-wells and replacing older pumps in five deep tube-wells, which will draw another 5.60 crore litre water a day. In the face of frequent power cuts, WASA has also taken up initiatives to buy 75 more permanent and 50 mobile power generators. Meanwhile, the state minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak met with the WASA authorities Sunday. After the meeting, he said despite all efforts this year the water crisis will remain. "We'll see that no water crisis erupts in the next year," said Nanak. bdnews
