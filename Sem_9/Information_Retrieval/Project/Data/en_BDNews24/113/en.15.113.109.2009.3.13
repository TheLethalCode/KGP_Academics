 Rajshahi, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities indefinitely closed Rajshahi College and Rajshahi Medical College Friday shortly after mayhem at Rajshahi University. The decisions came from separate emergency meetings of the two colleges' academic councils to "avoid any untoward incidents on the campuses". Female students were ordered to vacate the hostels by 10am on Saturday, and male students by 5pm Friday. "Tension surfaced on Rajshahi College campus and its residential halls just after clashes at Rajshahi University," principal professor Ali Reza Mohammad Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com. A clash broke out between Rajshahi Medical College units of BCL and ICS Tuesday which left 25 students injured, Touhidul Islam, principal of RMC, said. "So, we declared the college closed, otherwise tension might flare here after the clash at Rajshahi University." Rajshahi University closed sine die as an Islami Chhatra Shibir leader was killed and scores were injured in campus clashes with Bangladesh Chhatra League. Sharifuzzaman Nomani, general secretary of the RU Shibir unit, died around midday, Rajpara Police Station officer in charge Anisur Rahman told bdnews24.com. Assistant proctor Moshtaq Ahmed told bdnews24.com the authorities decided to shut down the public university and asked male students to vacate dormitories by 5pm. The female students would have to leave theirs by 10am Saturday. Hundreds of activists of the Jamaat-backed ICS gained control of the Rajshahi University campus from noon after two days of tension and clashes with rivals including the ruling Awami League-backed BCL. Eight to 10 people including police had already been injured, witnesses said. bdn
