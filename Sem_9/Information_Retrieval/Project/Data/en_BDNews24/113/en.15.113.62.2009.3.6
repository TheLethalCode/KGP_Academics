 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  The families of the civilians severely wounded in the BDR mutiny want the government to pay them financial compensation. They say they are borrowing heavily from relatives and friends to continue treatment. They allege that their patients are not getting the treatment they deserve at Dhaka Medical College Hospital which has been providing free medicines only. The hospital has dismissed the allegations, however. "We had to buy six bags of blood. One of my relatives loaned us money for which we can treat this patient," Khadiza told bdnews24.com at ward 32 of the hospital. Her tea-seller brother Akter took stray bullets in the chest and the right hand at the early hours of the Feb. 25-26 mutiny. The family of adolescent Akter has lost their home and cropland to three bouts of river erosion. Now, Khadiza says, they are buckling under a mountain of debts to get him treated. "The home minister came and assured us of proper treatment. But we had to spend money for the first four days of treatment. "From the fifth day, the hospital authorities began giving drugs," she said. "We want that the government gives us financial support, too." Akter's relative Abdur Rahim, who was giving money for Akter's treatment, told bdnews24.com Friday that, they have spent around Tk 40000 for treatment. Khadiza said acute poverty forced them to send Akter, a fifth-grader, to Dhaka about three years ago for work. Akter is the second among one daughter and four sons of his parents who live in Mehendiganj of Barisal. A stray bullet hit Al-Amin in the right leg on Feb. 25 when he was going to work at a shop in New Market near the BDR headquarters from Kamrangirchar. "We had to purchase four bags of blood," his mother Nargis told bdnews24.com at the same ward of the hospital. Al-Amin, the eldest of five brothers, is the sole breadwinner of the family. "My son sustained bullet injuries for no fault of his. The home minister came and assured us of all help. "Since then the hospital authorities are giving us medicine. But we buy everything from outside," said Nargis, who also gave only one name. "I have heard the other victims are getting lots of money. But my son got absolutely nothing from the government," she said. Hasibul Islam Shaon, a class seven student of a Rayerbazar school, was also injured as he had gone out to play in the morning. His mother Sharmin Rahman said people took her son to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Asked if they received any help from the government, she said, "No. I don't need help from the government anymore." bdnews24.com/gma/
