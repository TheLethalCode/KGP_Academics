 BERLIN, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Champions Bayern Munich crushed Hanover 5-1 to climb back up to second place in the Bundesliga on Saturday, four points behind leaders Hertha Berlin.

Miroslav Klose made it 2-1 in the 25th with a another header following an almost identical Schweinsteiger free kick.
