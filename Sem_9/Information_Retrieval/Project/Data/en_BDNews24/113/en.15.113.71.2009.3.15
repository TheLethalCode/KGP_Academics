<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi University syndicate has urged the government to launch a judicial investigation into Friday's mayhem on the campus. Eight members of the syndicate were at the meeting Saturday night, chaired by vice chancellor professor Abdus Sobhan at his residence, he told reporters. The clash between RU unit of pro-Awami League student front Bangladesh Chhatra League and Jama'at-e-Islami's student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir Friday left the general secretary of ICS's university unit Sharifuzzaman Nomani dead and scores injured. Rajshahi University closed its doors indefinitely after the violence, and seven other universities and colleges in Rajshahi followed suit fearing similar clashes on their campuses.
