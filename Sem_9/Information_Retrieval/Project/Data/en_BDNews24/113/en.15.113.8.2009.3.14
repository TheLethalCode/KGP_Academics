 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  The authorities did not allow those watching a movie inside Star Cineplex at the Basundhara City to get out as the upper floors of the building went up in flames Friday, a witness said. Joyita Islam, who along with friends went to watch the movie Monpura, alleged the authorities had misled them about the fire and tried to go on with the show as the inferno was spreading even further. The complex authorities said they did not want the audience "to panic and hurt themselves on their way out". Some 300 people were at the Monpura show and there were more people at two other cinemas of the multiplex, Joyita said. Joyita's mother called at around 2pm to inform her of the fire and asked her to come out. But the Cineplex authorities claimed there was "nothing to be afraid of", as they seemed to be waiting for an official announcement on the fire. Joyita and one of her friends came out despite the authorities' "false assurance". They went downstairs and heard someone on loudspeakers was asking all inside to go out at around 2:25pm. "All inside the complex's levels were scrambling for way out. I saw shop owners were rushing out, leaving their valuables behind," she added. The chairman of Showmotion Ltd which runs the Cineplex said he was happy with the way his staff dealt with the crisis. "We handled the emergency situation with utmost care so that audience did not panic and hurt themselves on their way out," said Mahboob Rahman. "I am very thankful to my skilled employees (that they could) get everyone evacuated without any incident." Mahboob Rahman added: "But BCDL did not warn us in time."
