<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  The government Sunday extended the parole of Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia, for another month. The home ministry extended the duration up to April 16 on a petition by Coco's lawyer Mahbub Uddin Khokan. Coco, an accused in the GATCO case alongside his mother, and facing other graft cases, fell ill behind bars during the past caretaker government's tenure. The former prime minister's son was paroled on July 17 for eight weeks to seek medical treatment abroad and flew to Bangkok two days later. The government has since successively extended Coco's parole by a month each time. bdne
