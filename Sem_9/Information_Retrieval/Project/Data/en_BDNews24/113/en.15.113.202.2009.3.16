 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Monday granted bail to six doctors of United Hospital in a case filed in connection with the death of popular film actor Manna. Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate Abdul Majid allowed bail on a Tk 50,000 bond for each of the six accused charged with causing death through negligence. The doctors, Enayet Hossain Sheikh, Jahiruddin Mahmud Ilias, Momenuzzaman, Khandakar Mahbub Sohail, Fatema and Mainul Islam Majumdar, had earlier surrendered to the court just after midday. Manna died without being seen The actor was admitted to Gulshan's United Hospital with chest pain on Feb 17 last year. Manna's family claimed doctors neglected to see him immediately, delaying treatment after he was admitted. He died before they arrived. Brother-in-law Reza Quader filed a murder case seven months later with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Judiicial probe finds 'negligence' The court issued arrest warrants against the six on Jan 28 after a judicial probe stated that the film star's death was due to negligence and charged the doctors with 'destroying evidence'. The six doctors petitioned the High Court for bail the next day. The court rejected the bail petition, adding it would be considered after the doctors surrendered to the trial court. "Horrible and unexpected traits have been observed in the health services delivery sector," said the judge at the time. 'Law will take its course' One of the lawyers for the accused, Fazle Noor Tapash, said on Monday, "We are extremely sorry that Manna died. But he didn't die due to any doctor's neglect." "The government ordered a probe to look into the matter. The law will take its course," he said. bdnew
