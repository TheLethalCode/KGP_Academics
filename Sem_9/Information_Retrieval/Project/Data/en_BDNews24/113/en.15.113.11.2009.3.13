<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  Basundhara City, the country's largest shopping mall, turned into a towering inferno in the heart of the capital on Friday as fire engulfed the corporate offices on the upper floors. The blaze that started around 1.30pm had died down toward evening after firemen spent over 3 hours fighting raging flames that spread through the top floors of the 21-storied building, trapping many inside. But firefighters said they were still fighting flames on the 16th floor at around 5pm. At least seventeen injured were taken to Dhaka Combined Military Hospital. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina asked army, security agencies and all emergency rescue services to join the operations, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters. He added the prime minister's adviser retired major general Tareq Ahmed Siddiqui has been tasked to oversee the operations. The army along with navy fire experts joined rescue operations. Brig Gen Anwar said they had come in aid of the fire service and to secure the area. Flames fanned by wind The fire that began at around 1.30pm appeared under control at one point, but began raging again from 2:30pm as the flames were fanned by the wind, said firemen. Fire brigade director Major Motiur told bdnews24.com that the fire originated from the 17th floor and flames were going upwards. Senior correspondent Sumon Kaiser said flames and smoke were billowing from the 21-storey building. Another correspondent, Humayun Hashim, said he saw many people looking out of windows to get out of the building. Rescuers were forced to climb the top floors. A fire safety officer of the Bashundhara Group, Kazi Golam Mostafa, had to be rescued by helicopter. Firefighters had to climb up to the 17th floor as water hoses could not reach, said Motiur. He said five fire units had initially been deployed and reinforcements later called in. State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, police chief Noor Mohammed and Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief Naim Ahmed were at the scene. Noor told reporters they were not able to give logistic support but were observing the situation. Sea of spectators Hundreds of shoppers poured out of the main entrance of the building as the fire broke out at the top of the building. The shoppers joined crowds of spectators that had gathered on Panthapath, which had been quickly closed off to traffic causing long tailbacks on adjoining roads. Thousands of people congregated around Basundhara with a sea of spectators reaching from Panthapath back towards Hatirpul. Fire rips through corporate offices Deputy managing director of Bashundhrara Group Touhidul Alam said the corporate office caught fire and he sent men to salvage papers, but they could not. The fire jumped floors and flames ripped through the top storeys, burning everything in its wake, he said. Alam said he had no idea how the building caught fire. Owner of Bismallah Store, Tofael Ahmed, said they were not allowed to bring out their merchandise. He said he thought the fire started from the group chairman's office on the 20th floor. A security worker of the complex, Rafiq, who gave only one name, had earlier said the 17th and 18th floors of the building that house the corporate offices of the Group caught fire. 'South Asia's largest' The owners of Basundhara City, opened to the public in August 2004, claim it is the largest shopping mall in South Asia and the 12th largest in the world. The building is 21 stories tall, of which 8 floors hold over 2,000 retail stores and cafeterias. Other floors also house a multiplex cinema and a gynamsium. The upper floors are used as the corporate headquarters of the Bashundhara Group. bdnews24.com/sk/sit/
