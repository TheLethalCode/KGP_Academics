 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)Climate change could threaten millennium development goals, cautioned the food minister on Saturday. "We saw the poverty rate increase in the past few years as food security was threatened by rising prices worldwide," said Abdur Razzaque. "Poverty will rise again if our food output is threatened by climate change," he told a seminar on 'Global Climate Change and its Impact in Bangladesh'. This will make it difficult to achieve millennium objectives, said Razzaque. "Agricultural production has increased in recent years. But to ensure development goals and the eradication of poverty, agricultural and energy sectors have to be given the topmost priority," said the minister for food and disaster management. "Food production can rise and costs can be reduced if electricity supply can be ensured," he said. Seeking Japanese assistance in financial and technical sectors for development of the energy and agriculture sectors, the minister said: "Bangladesh has very little role in climate change, but we are feeling its impact most." "Which is why we need the help of developed countries," he said. In the keynote paper Dr Ainun Nishat, country head of International Union for Conservation of Nature, agreed: "Poor countries will undoubtedly be more affected by climate change." The impact will be felt most in food, disaster management and health sectors, said the environmentalist. "The government must work to face the impact of climate change through close inter-ministerial ties," said Nishat. The seminar at the LGED auditorium was organised by JICA Alumni Association of Bangladesh. The seminar was presided over by vice president of the association, Prof Khurshid Jahan, and attended among others by Bangladesh representative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, Nobuko Suzuki Kayashima, and Gias Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury, executive director of the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services. b
