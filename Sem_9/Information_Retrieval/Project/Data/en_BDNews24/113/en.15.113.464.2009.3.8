 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government will prepare new lists of beneficiaries under social safety net programmes, cancelling previous lists prepared on "political consideration", said the social welfare minister on Sunday. The government will also increase the number of beneficiaries and raise the monthly allowances for elderly, freedom fighters and widows, and include the physically-challenged, under the next budget. "These decisions are meant to live up to the pledges in our election manifesto," social welfare minister Enamul Haque Mostafa Shahid told reporters. "The new lists will be prepared to ensure the truly deprived come under the coverage of such initiatives," he said after a meeting on allowances for the elderly chaired by finance minister AMA Muhith. Shahid said the past BNP-led government had distributed allowances according to lists prepared by unelected "village governments" and the previous caretaker government followed the same lists. "Many eligible people were deprived of allowances while many ineligible people were included in the lists, as they were prepared on political consideration." MPs, Upazila and union parishad representatives will prepare the new lists, which will be completed by June this year, he said. On whether the new lists would be free from political influence, the minister said, "The real poor will be included in the new lists, which will be prepared by people's representatives." Asked about the rate of increase of allowances, Shahid said it would depend on the number of would-be beneficiaries. "If their number is found to be much greater than the present lists, then the increase will be by a comparatively lesser amount." "The government will also introduce a new allowance for the physically challenged poor and a special programme to train up poor jobless youth in the next budget," said the minister. bdn
