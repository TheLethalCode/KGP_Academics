<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)   Favourites Mohammedan Sporting Club stormed into the Citycell Super Cup semi-finals handing a comprehensive 4-0 defeat to Farashganj Sporting Club at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. Mohammedan became the first team to reach the last four from Group B, in which Brothers Union also raised their hopes with four points. To see them go through to the last four, Brothers just need a draw against Mohammedan on Monday in the final Group B clash. The Black and Whites, who survived from a scare against Chittagong Abahani before riding on a controversial penalty from Alamu Bukola Olaleken, were also struggling till the first half before Nigerian Olaleken put them ahead in injury time with a penalty. Referee Tayeb Hasan awarded Mohammedan a spot kick after marksman Hedayetul Robin, playing his first match after sustaining an ankle injury midway through the second-leg B League, was obstructed by defender Mamun Mia and Emeka Lucky Uti inside, but the game was halted for five minutes as players argued with the official. Olaleken finally converted the spot kick. After the break, Mohammedan looked much confident enjoying the lion's share of ball possession in the midfield comprising Egyptian Hazem Khaled Mahmud, Arman Aziz and Enamul Haq Sharif. Hazem went close to doubling the advantage four minutes into the second half when the playmaker rattled the Farashganj crossbar and five minutes later, Sharif fired home to double the lead after being set up by a touchline minus from Olaleken. Farashganj, who put up a spirited show against Brothers Union to hold them a goalless draw, were kept busy trying to thwart the Black and White attacks. The Old Dhaka outfit's defence was unsettled once again when Nasir released a fine ball to an unmarked Sharif, who made the margin 3-0 with the help of a little deflection off defender Mamun Mia. Mohammedan's fourth goal was also a piece of luck. An Arman Aziz free kick outside the box kissed the Farashganj net after getting a deflection from the wall in stoppage time. bd
