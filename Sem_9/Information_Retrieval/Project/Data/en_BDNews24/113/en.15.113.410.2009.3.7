<TITLE> Strauss taking more risks as captain than batsman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PORT OF SPAIN, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Strauss took few risks with the bat to compile his third century of the series on Friday but as captain he gambled in his team selection for the fifth and final test against West Indies. On a slow and low wicket that gave little to the bowlers and was hardly conducive to attacking strokeplay, the opener produced another long innings to hit 139 not out as England reached 258 for two at the close. Following his 169 in Antigua and 142 in Barbados, Strauss again showed the concentration needed to bat all day. He picked up runs where he could get them, 67 singles as well as 11 fours. "It has been an incredible little run for me," he told reporters as he tried to help England level the series 1-1. "It has been a purple patch. "Having been through a couple of difficult patches in my career I suppose I appreciate this more and it makes you hungrier to take advantage of it when you are in good form." Strauss showed the good shot selection needed at this level but never let his positive mood turn into recklessness, despite the temptations presented by a second-string attack. As skipper he was more willing to surprise, handing a debut to Danish-born fast bowler Amjad Khan and bringing back slow left-armer Monty Panesar to play in tandem with off-spinner Graeme Swann. BOPARA DROPPED England must take 20 wickets to win and level the series and that meant dropping Ravi Bopara despite his century in the fourth test in Barbados to adopt a risky policy of naming only six front-line batsmen. "It was a tough call because there were so many different permutations," said Strauss. "We went for Amjad Khan because he offers us something different, he has fresh legs and West Indies have not seen him before. That is an exciting selection. "Monty has got great pedigree as a spinner and has taken a lot of five-wicket hauls so there is no reason why he cannot have a big impact," added Strauss. Strauss said the match was likely to turn into a long, hard battle. "I am hopeful this time my hundred will bring a victory," said the opener. "It's a slow attritional pitch but there were certainly signs of turn there in the evening session. "But we have to set the game up well. It was a good first day but we have to continue doing this day after day after day. "We are not going to rip through them by any means so we are going to have to work hard and I think we have the armoury in the bowling attack to take 20 wickets.
