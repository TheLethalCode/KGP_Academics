Police said the four heavily armed militants from the People's United Liberation Front (PULF) were shot near Irilbung village, about 15 km east of the state capital, Imphal. "Our boys surrounded the hideout of the militants in a forested area to catch them, but the militants fired at us and in the ensuing encounter four of them were killed on the spot," a police spokesman said by phone from Imphal.
