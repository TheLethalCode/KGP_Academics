<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)Islami Chhatra Shibir has alleged the government staged the latest "incidents" at Rajshahi University to conceal the facts behind the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. A Jamaat leader also blamed ruling party Awami League for "assisting" its student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League. ICS central president M Rezaul Karim told a press conference Friday evening: "Awami League's link to the BDR massacre is being revealedthe incident (at RU) has been staged to move the focus away from it." Reading out a statement, he said armed members of ruling party-backed Chhatra League with help from the police and university authorities attacked ICS members and general students Friday morning. "They (BCL members) took Shibir members hostages and tortured them," Karim claimed. He said that neither the police nor the authorities came to save the "hostages" despite repeated calls for help. He told the press that Shibir's RU unit general secretary Sharifuzzaman Nomani was killed by a group of BCL members led by RU BCL president Ibrahim Hossain Moon. Blaming the government for inciting BCL to take control of educational institutions in the country, Karim said the government is creating "a conspiracy to turn Bangladesh into a failed state". "The RU incident is a part of that." Jamaat blames AL Earlier in the day, a Jamaat spokesperson also blamed the government. Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Muhammad Kamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com at noon: "Chhatra League is assisted by the government." He sought the intervention of the prime minister. He condemned Nomani's killing, saying, "It was a planned incident." "If the Chhatra League cadres aren't brought to task, the situation will worsen," warned Kamarazzuman. He claimed AL was to blame. ICS announced countrywide protest programmes on Saturday, campaigns and meetings between March 16 and 19. "If the government fails to arrest the culprits behind the killing of Nomani by this time, we will have to come up more with serious programmes," said Karim.
