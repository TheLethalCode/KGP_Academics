 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has asked Standing Committee member Chowdhury Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky to explain in 72 hours, a day after his son made allegation against party chief and other leaders. Joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters at around 10pm that Chowdhury Irad Ahmed Siddiky's "objectionable' remarks against Khaleda Zia in Tanvir's presence were in breach of party discipline. The comments have angered the party adherents and so, the Standing Committee asked Tanbir to show cause why he would not be punished, he added. "The notice will reach him (by Tuesday night)," Khan said at the press briefing at the chairperson's political office in Gulshan. The meeting ended at 11:30pm. "The statements were not only motivated but also defamatory," he told reporters after the meeting. Earlier in the day, Tanbir, who was absent from the meeting of the party's highest policymaking body, told reporters at a hurriedly-called briefing that Khaleda had never sought money from his son. "What my son had said about Sadeque Hossain Khoka, Mosaddek Ali Falu and Mirza Abbas, my FBCCI successor Abdul Awal Mintoo, Awami League's (former mayor) Mohammad Hanif and A S M Hannan Shah was false." Irad did not belong to BNP and he neither had the right to make the remarks, the father added. "I was present at Irad's press conference but didn't realise he would talk this way. I did not immediately comment on his remarks, lest another 'unwarranted situation' erupted," Tanbir said when asked why he did not speak out Monday. Irad alleged at the press briefing Monday that Khaleda had asked for Tk 5 crore to give him party ticket for Dhaka mayor election. "I went to see her. I expressed my interest (in running for Dhaka mayor)." "She asked me if I had enough money. She asked for Tk 5 crore for election (expenses). But I am no (Mosaddek Ali) Falu or (Mirza) Abbas," he added. Irad had called mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, former mayors BNP's Mirza Abbas and AL's Mohammad Hanif "all corrupt", who "failed to deliver". He said none among Khoka, Abbas, A S M Hannan Shah and former FBCCI chief Abdul Awal Mintoothe likely BNP candidateswas acceptable. "There are allegations of corruption against them all. After 1/11, all of them were charged and are facing trial. Some of them had to go to jail." Some angry supporters of BNP and its associate organisations burned effigies of the two outside the chairperson's political office in Gulshan at around 7pm, minutes before the meeting. Other agenda Khan said the meeting also discussed nominations for the seats reserved for women in parliament. BNP will have four seats according to their strength in the House. He said the policymakers asked prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet colleagues to not make remarks that may influence the investigation into the BDR killings. Khan said the meeting condemned the 'vulgar and audacious' remarks about Khaleda by Britain-based journalist Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury
