<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori has returned to the side for their must-win fourth one-day international against India on Wednesday after the birth of his first child. Vettori missed Sunday's 58-run loss in Christchurch to be present at the birth of his son in Auckland late on Sunday. Sachin Tendulkar scored a majestic 163 to lead India to 392 for four, which was always out of reach for the New Zealand batsmen despite an impressive 166-run opening stand between Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum and some late slogging by the bowlers. India hold a 2-0 lead in the series heading into the fourth match in Hamilton on Wednesday. Medium-fast bowler Ian Butler has been omitted from the New Zealand squad after suffering a muscle strain on Sunday, which limited him to bowling just five of his allotted 10 overs. His place has been taken by left-arm seamer Ewen Thompson, who played in a Twenty20 international against West Indies last year. Selection panel head Glenn Turner said Butler should be available for selection for the final game in Auckland on Saturday. McCullum, who did not keep wickets in Christchurch after being hit on the thumb in the first one-dayer in Napier, would continue to play just as a batsman with Peter McGlashan staying with the squad, Turner added. New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (captain), Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum, Peter McGlashan, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Ewen Thomps
