 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  The law minister on Monday reiterated that the trial process in the BDR mutiny case depends on findings of the ongoing investigation, but there may be court martials, if necessary. "The case will go to trial as quickly as possible," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the secretariat. "At the moment, it is not possible to comment on how long it will take to complete the trial." "But the government will ensure fair trial within shortest possible time," he said. "Those involved in the incident will be tried with an iron hand; none will be spared." "The trial process will start once the CID submits its investigation reports," Shafiq said. bdnew
