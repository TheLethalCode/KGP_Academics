Armed police battalions and Rapid Action Battalion will act as striking forces, he said. Ansar and police personnel will be stationed in voting centres, he added.

By-elections will be held in seven constituencies -- Rangpur-3, Rangpur-6, Kurigram-2, Bogra-6, Bogra-7, Bagerhat-1 and Kishoreganj-6 -- vacated by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, president Zillur Rahman, leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad.
