 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said her administration is committed to revoke all laws that discriminate against women. She made the declaration at a rally to mark International Women's Day Sunday. "We intend to have a woman speaker in parliament in the near future," said the prime minister. "We have undertaken a process of raising women leadership right from the grassroots," she said of her party. Of the sacrifices made by women in Bangladesh's liberation war, the prime minister said, "Countless women took part in the independence struggle." She mentioned the challenges that still faced women. "Tragic incidents of injury and persecution of women, in connection with early marriage, dowry, trafficking and acid throwing, are still occurring everyday." "We attempted a number of measures to redress these issues during the past Awami League government in 1996-2001," said Hasina. "We commit ourselves again to combating inhuman treatment and persecution of women." The women and children affairs ministry organised the celebrations at Osmani Memorial Hall in observance of the day. The audience applauded as the prime minister said women workers must be entitled to the same benefits as a male. She said families of men and women employed by the government should be entitled to similar benefits after their death. "I thought men would be clapping more," Hasina quipped, which prompted the male audience to clap an encore. To guardians and parents, the prime minister said: "Don't treat your sons and daughters differently. Girls are not less worthy than boys by any standard." "Look at us here, Bangladesh boasts its prime minister, opposition leader and deputy leader of parliament, who are all women." "Educate your daughters properly and they will grow into similar assets for our country as our sons." "Half of society is female. It cannot progress by maiming half its population," she said. "The government as well as the private sectors and society at large must prioritise women's rights, introducing equality at all levels. "The law enforcing agencies will have to play a crucial role to end persecution. They must enforce the law sincerely and stringently to curb violence against women at any place, any time." International Women's Day is observed on March 8 around the globe. Women and children affairs secretary Rokeya Sultana and head of the women affairs directorate Rawshan Ara Begum also spoke at the Osmani Memorial Hall programme. bdnew
