 Bandarban, March 13 (bdnews24.com)Two terror suspects were being grilled in Bandarban Friday after three army forest patrols recovered a massive cache of arms the night before from Roangchharhi, said an army officer. The army patrols found an American M-16 with grenade launcher, an SLR and 18 grenade launchers, in a dense patch of forest. Two suspected terrorists were also picked up during the arms haul. Tipped by army intelligence and acting on clues given by a suspect already in custody, Major Khaled of the 34 East Bengal Regiment led the expedition into Aungjaiparha, Roangchharhi, on Thursday night. They also recovered a sizable ammunition store, including 299 SMG bullets, 91 rounds of SLR ammunition, two M-16 magazines, four ammunition pouches and a holster, as well as a pair of Bangladeshi and Indian army uniforms. The two suspect terrorists were named as Kamong Marma, 29, and Kaching Nue Marma, 23, sons of Puhlang Marma of Aungjaiparha. They were being quizzed Friday at the Bandarban Sadar Zone headquarters. Maj Khaled quoting intelligence sources said there were armed terrorist groups hiding in the forests of Ruma and Roangchharhi. Arrestees Kaching and Kamong Marma said DPA members from Myanmar had given them the arms and ammo for safekeeping. Khaled said Thursday night's raid had been carried out on information gleaned from two terrorists, including Puichathui, another son of Puhlang Marma, arrested earlier. Acting on such intelligence, they had been patrolling the forests and finally nabbed the two men and recovered the arms after conducting several raids in the past 5-6 months. An earlier operation on Feb 19, led by Captain Mirza, had retrieved two Chinese firarms and huge quantities of ammunition. Major Mosleh of the 69 Infantry Brigade said various units, alongside overall peacekeeping in the area, had retrieved automatic weapons, local firearms, grenades, ammunition and other military equipment. Similar operations and raids will be regularly conducted in Bandarban and border areas to maintain law and order, he said.
