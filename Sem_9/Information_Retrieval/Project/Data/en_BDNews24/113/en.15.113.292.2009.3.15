 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  The prime minister is willing to go to Kuala Lumpur, if needed, to resolve problems to the export of skilled labour to Malaysia, the labour and employment minister has said. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told reporters Sunday he himself would go to Malaysia on Mar 29 or 30 while returning from Geneva. Foreign minister Dipu Moni would also accompany him to hold talks with the new Malaysian government to be formed after Mar 26 elections, he added. They would try to talk the Southeast Asian country, the second largest destination for Bangladeshi workers, into allowing in more Bangladeshi workers. Malaysia last week cancelled 55,000 visas for Bangladeshis citing the ongoing global recession. He said the government has launched diverse diplomatic efforts to iron out a solution which is unlikely before the national election in that country. Asked why he thought Malaysia stopped taking in Bangladeshis but allowed workers from other countries, the minister said Malaysian labour organisations wanted their government to employ domestic workers instead of overseas workers. Mosharraf, however, said there was no reason to be in a panic about the issue. Kuala Lumpur did not take any firm decision on not allowing Bangladeshi workers to Malaysia, he pointed out and said Malaysian had taken in some 532 workers even after the announcement on visa cancellation. On whether other country stopped recruiting overseas workers due to global recession, he said they had no information yet. The government, however, is looking for new and alternative labour markets for Bangladeshi workers. The process for sending more Bangladesh workers to several countries including Libya was underway. The minister also said the Bangladesh high commissioner to Malaysia and officials who dealt with labour issues there had been called back for their failure to ensure an uninterrupted recruitment of Bangladeshi workers. The mission would be overhauled to protect the Bangladeshi workers' interests there and allegations of incompetence or neglect against any high commission staff would be investigated, he added. b
