<TITLE> Rooney's 'hatred' for Liverpool dampened by United </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney's comments that he "hated" title rivals Liverpool have been removed from the Premier League club's website ahead of Saturday's clash between the two sides. "I'm very excited about the game because I grew up as an Everton fan hating Liverpooland that hasn't changed," England striker Rooney told the club website (www.manutd.com) on Thursday. The article was later cut to say: "I'm very excited about the game because I grew up as an Everton fan." "The comments were removed. We (the club) understand what he was trying to say but we did not want the media to sensationalise it," a Manchester United spokesperson told Reuters. Rooney, who began his career with Liverpool's arch-rivals Everton, moved to United in Aug. 2004, a club who also share a close rivalry with the Anfield side. United head into Saturday's Old Trafford meeting seven points ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool, with a game in hand on both sides and only 11 league matches left to play. Defeat for Liverpool will almost certainly end their title hopes. "We're in pole position in the title race and we know if we can beat Liverpool on Saturday then that'll more or less end their chances of winning the league," Rooney told MUTV. Liverpool refused to comment on Rooney's remarks when contacted by Reuters
