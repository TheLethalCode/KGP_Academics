Being left-handed, and with the only available guitar strung for right-handers, he learned to play with it upside-down, something he still does today. "I'm very proud that he asked me to paint my portrait and I'm very pleased for his success," Yunupingu said in a statement that Maestri read on his behalf at the prize-giving ceremony.
