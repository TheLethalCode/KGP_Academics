 DUBAI, Mar 14(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden accused moderate Arab leaders of plotting with the West against Muslims, in an audio recording aired by Al Jazeera television on Saturday.

Al Jazeera broadcast excerpts of the recording, in which the speaker's voice sounded like earlier messages from bin Laden.
