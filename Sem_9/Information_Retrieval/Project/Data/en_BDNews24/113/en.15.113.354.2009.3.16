<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's capital market will be considered an "emerging market" in a couple of years, a former regulatory body chief said Sunday. Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi said the last two years were "remarkable" as average turnover and market capitalisation rose substantially. But the supply of scrips did not increase, he said at a farewell dinner thrown by the Chittagong Stock Exchange. Siddiqi, who took over as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006 and retired last week, said more and more multinational company would be encouraged to get listed with the bourses once mobile-phone operators came in the market. The SEC's initiative to introduce book building was meant to encourage profitable companies to float public shares, he added He lauded the emergency government's move to offload shares of state-owned enterprises and said he believed the new government would continue it. The ceremony held at the city's Hotel Sarina also heard from acting SEC chairman Mansur Alam, CSE president Nasiruddin Ahmed and vice president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed.
