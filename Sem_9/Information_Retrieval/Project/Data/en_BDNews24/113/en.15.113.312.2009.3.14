 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  Seven Basundhara City fire victims were identified by Saturday afternoon, 24 hours after Bangladesh's largest shopping mall turned into a towering inferno in the heart of the capital as flames engulfing the corporate offices on the upper floors. All seven were Basundhara employees. Bashundhara Group security officer Baki Billah died of critical burn injuries Friday afternoon at the nearby Samarita Hospital. Six other bodies were lying in the DMCH morgue in the early hours of Saturday. Their charred bodies were retrieved from the 17th and the 10th floors, police said. Bashundhara fire supervisor Bashiruddin said they identified three bodies early Saturday, those of fire supervisor Harunur Rashid (48), general supervisor Mohammad Ali (55) and electrician Ibrahim Mandal (37). The last three identities were confirmed by late afternoon: fire alarm technician Anisur Rahman Babu, tiler Hamidul Islam (25) and painter Renu Sarcar (26). Relatives and colleagues of the victims identified the dead by their size and where the bodies were recovered. Probe looking into fire safety measures The three-member probe committee, formed Friday, visited the site Saturday to look into what fire safety measures were actually in place at the multi-storey shopping and office complex. "We are also asking why and how the building caught fire," the committee's chief Iqbal Khan Chowdhury said in a press conference at the site. "And we are investigating whether there was any foul play," said Chowdhury, who is home ministry joint secretary (police). Architect Md Foyez Ullah said the committee wanted to discover what precautions and preparedness the building authorities had in case of fire. "We want to find out whether there was any gap in the response." Blaze raged for seven hours The blaze that started around 1:30pm had died down toward late evening after firemen spent over five hours fighting raging flames that spread up and down the top floors of the 20-storied building, trapping many inside. bdnews24.com correspondents saw the fire still being battled in places at 8:40pm, but the country's chief fire fighter said the blaze was brought under control at around 9pm. Fire Brigade chief Abu Nayeem Mohammed Shahidullah told reporters that five floors, from the 15th to 19th, were burnt to a shell and the 14th was partially destroyed by the inferno. Bashundhara Group executive director Zahidur Rahman said the blaze started on the 18th floor and spread down to the 13th and up to the 20th, gutting those storeys including chairman Ahmed Akber Sobhan's office on the 19th floor. There was no report of damage to shops in the complex, as the fire did not reach the lower floors, he added. 'South Asia's largest' The owners of Basundhara City, opened to the public in August 2004, claim it is the largest shopping mall in South Asia and the 12th largest in the world. The building is 20 storeys high, with the first 8 floors holding over 2,000 retail stores and cafeterias. Other floors also house a multiplex cinema, gymnasiums with swimming pools. The upper floors are used as the corporate headquarters of the Bashundhara Group. Mall closed to public Sat, Sun The mall will remain closed to the public on Saturday and Sunday, said an official. General secretary of Basundhara's shop owners association, Khalilur Rahman, said only they and the building's other workers would be allowed to enter the premises during the period. Rahman said none of the shops were damaged in the fire that engulfed the upper floors though some merchandise was damaged to due to water poured in to extinguish the fire. bdnews24.com/pc/
