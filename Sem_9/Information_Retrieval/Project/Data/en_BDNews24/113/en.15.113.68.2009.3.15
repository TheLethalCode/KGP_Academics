<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  BDR chief Brig Gen Moinul Hossain said Sunday families of BDR members at the Peelkhana headquarters would receive last month's wages and rations within a week. "Paying wages and rations to those who didn't get them since the Feb 25-26 mutiny have started today and we hope to finish the process in a week," the director general told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Gen Moinul said March wages would be paid in due time. "The process of arms appraisal and identification of the suspects is going on," he said. The army has started assessing the arms and ammunition that the mutineers deposited at the Peelkhana arms depot on Feb 26 night. The weaponry also includes those recovered from the neighbouring areas. An army officer assigned to the job, Major Imran, told bdnews24.com, "We are using surgical gloves so that the evidence is not spoilt." He said an expert team of the Criminal Investigation Department was carrying out ballistic tests examining bullet-fire from the weapons. "Finger prints from the weapons are being collected for matches with suspects," said the officer. Another army officer, preferring anonymity, said those officers who survived the tragedy were being consulted on restructuring the border force and restoring the chain of command in battalions across the country. Meanwhile, families of 15 BDR members were allowed inside the Peelkhana HQ on Sunday, said Captain Touhid of the Information Centre at the main gate. "Many have also had the chance to talk to their relatives from the mobile phone booths outside the barracks," he said. bdnew
