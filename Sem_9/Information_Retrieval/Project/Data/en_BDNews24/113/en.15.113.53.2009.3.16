<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bashundhara City was open to shoppers Monday after a two-day closure to take stock after Friday's devastating blaze that gutted the building's top six floors. The shopping mall was open at around 10am, Bashundhara Group security supervisor Md Selim told bdnews24.com. As many as 2,000 shops were seen opening their shutters, Bashundhara Shop Owners' Association general secretary Khalilur Rahman said. "The first hours saw curious visitors rather than customers, entering after queuing amid tight security," he said. "The mall is fully safe now," he added. Anisur Rahman, an employee of Prime Collection situated on the first floor, said their shop had not faced any problem. "There are some shoppers, but mostly the people have come to see things after the fire," he said. Bashundhara City turned into a towering inferno on Friday with the fire claiming seven lives as it engulfed the corporate offices from the 15th to 20th floors. bdne
