 UNITED NATIONS, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Friday slammed as "reckless" and "callous" Khartoum's decision to expel more than a dozen aid groups, saying it put millions of people's lives at risk in Sudan's western Darfur region. "The United States is gravely concerned by the reckless decision of the Sudanese government to expel international aid groups working to ease the suffering of Sudan's citizens," US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told reporters. "The humanitarian situation in the country is already dire and this callous step threatens the lives of innocents already suffering from years of war and upheaval," she said in a conference call. The move by Sudan came after the International Criminal Court charged President Omar Hassan al-Bashir with war crimes in Darfur. Khartoum ordered 13 high-profile aid agencies out of Darfur, including Oxfam and Save the Children, accusing them of passing evidence to the court. "Millions of civilians, including untold thousands of children and elderly people, will be left even more vulnerable to starvation, disease, despair and death if the government of Sudan does not immediately change course," Rice said. "The government of Sudan at its own choosing is now heading down a path towards even greater international isolation." 'STORM IN A TEACUP' Rice said she had a "forceful" conversation with Sudan's UN Ambassador Abdalmahmoud Abdalhaleem, in which she told him the decision was counterproductive and an "enormous escalation" that would exacerbate the situation on the ground and harm Sudan's relations with the international community. Abdalhaleem told reporters that the expulsion of non-governmental organizations was a "storm in a teacup" and denied that it had anything to do with the ICC indictment. He said Khartoum had ample evidence of wide-ranging treachery by NGOs in Sudan, though the only examples he gave had to do with NGOs providing information to the ICC. "The evidence is there, I can bring it over," he said. Rice was asked if Washington was still considering the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Darfur as the new US administration has indicated previously. She said that option was being "considered and discussed" as part of a policy review the administration is undertaking. US officials, she said, were consulting with others on the Security Council about the issue and were awaiting a briefing from UN humanitarian officials during a special closed-door council session on Sudan later on Friday. In response to a question, Rice left open the possibility that Washington would push the council to pass a statement or resolution ordering Khartoum to reverse its decision to expel international aid organizations from Darfur. "We will have the briefing and will together decide on appropriate next steps," she said. Any council moves, Rice added, would take time since delegations would need to consult with their capitals
