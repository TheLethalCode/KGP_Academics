 SRINAGAR, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One person was killed and at least 40 wounded on Friday in Kashmir when police fired bullets and teargas to quell protesters demanding the release of a senior separatist leader, police said. Hundreds of Muslim demonstrators marched in Srinagar after Friday's weekly prayers, shouting "Indian forces go back, we want freedom." The protesters, most of them wearing masks, pelted police with stones and demanded the release of top separatist leader Shabir Shah and other Kashmiri prisoners. "The fierce clashes continued till late evening, one person is dead," said police officer Abdul Majid. Last year, police detained Shah after he led some of the biggest protests in two decades against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region. Those protests had tapered off and state elections were held peacefully in December. Shah, dubbed by supporters "Kashmir's Nelson Mandela", has spent a total of more than 20 years in prison for opposing Indian rule, is an executive member of the region's main separatist alliance, All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference. Kashmiri separatist groups condemned use of force to stop protests. "We strongly condemn the use of force," said Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. "The Indian government should not push Kashmiris to resort to the same type of agitation Kashmir witnessed last year." Officials say more than 47,000 people have been killed in the region since discontent against New Delhi's rule turned into a full-blown rebellion in 1989. Separatists put the toll at 100,000. But overall violence involving Indian troops and separatist guerrillas declined significantly across Kashmir since India and Pakistan began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. New Delhi put a pause on that dialogue after last November's Mumbai attacks in which nearly 170 people were killed
