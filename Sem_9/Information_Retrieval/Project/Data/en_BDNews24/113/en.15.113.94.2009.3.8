<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  A deadlock between locals and the Barapukuria mine authorities appeared to be resolved as coal extraction resumed Saturday at 11pm after an 11-day break. bdnews24.com's correspondent reported miners returned to work after the Barapukuria Coal Mine Company Ltd and the mine's Chinese operator CMC-XMC assured locals of meeting their demands. The mine was forced to stop extraction at coal face 1114 on Feb. 25 in the face of protests by local residents for compensation and relocation over subsidence and loss of arable land due to open-pit mining. CMC-XMC had given a Mar 5 (Thursday) deadline to BCMCL to restart extraction, threatening to pull out of Bangladesh if the deadline was not met. The Chinese consortium also served notice of retrenchment on Thursday to hundreds of miners, telling them not to return to work after paying off their dues, sparking fresh protests. On Friday, state minister for forest and environment Mostafizar Rahman Fizar met with locals to resolve the crisis. CMC-XMC eventually agreed to extend the deadline until Sunday on BCMCL's requested. bdnews2
