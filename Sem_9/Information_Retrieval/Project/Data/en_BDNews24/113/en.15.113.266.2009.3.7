<TITLE> BNP wants all-party probe headed by ex-CJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  BDR bloodbath mystery can only be unravelled by an all-party inquiry committee headed by a retired chief justice, BNP policymakers say. "It is not possible to conduct a neutral probe with the government's re-constituted probe committee. Rather, it will be acceptable to all if a former chief justice heads a probe committee," said former law minister Moudud Ahmed Friday. He suggested that, the all-party committee will also have representatives from the civil society, army and BDR. "It was a deep-rooted plot against independence and sovereignty of the country. The government should seek out the perpetrators through a 'proper probe'." He said, the government has formed an inquiry committee firstly by the home minister and later by a former secretary; both are constituted by the government. It is not possible for them to be free of any influence from the government in such an investigation, he argued. Another policymaker, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain alleged, the government does not want to take any assistance from the opposition even in such difficult times. The government should have consulted the opposition leader after the carnage, "but the prime minister did not do that". The former health minister said the mutiny was plotted to destroy the armed forces and BDR. It is a bigger threat to the independence and sovereignty. It must not be belittled in any way. "And so, we want a just probe so that the real perpetrators are identified and their severest punishment is ensured." b
