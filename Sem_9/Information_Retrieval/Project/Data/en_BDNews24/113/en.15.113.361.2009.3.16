 NEW DELHI Mon Mar 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), India's most influential hard-left party, called on Monday ahead of a general election for state control of the financial sector and restrictions on foreign investment to overcome an economic slowdown. CPI(M) held the balance of power for most of the tenure of the Congress Party-led government before withdrawing its support last year, and has often played a role in shaping coalition government policies.

The communists may struggle to retain the same number of seats in this election amid problems in some of its voter heartlands, like West Bengal. But it could still muster enough seats to hold the balance of power, political analysts say. Its leaders believe an economic slowdown in India sparked by the global financial crisis could see a backlash against foreign firms and lead voters to support more regulation of the financial sector.
