 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)The government is optimistic over fair distribution of Teesta waters between Bangladesh and India, said a minister on Sunday, though co-speakers at a conference highlighted the challenges for managing the country's water resources. Discussion with India is continuing over distribution of waters, said food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaque at the international conference on water and flood management. He said he hoped the successful resolution in Ganges water sharing would be duplicated in the case of the Teesta. Though 57 rivers of India enter Bangladesh, he said, a water-sharing agreement had been reached for only the Ganges. He said Dhaka and New Delhi would discuss the Tipai Mukh dam project in the Indian state of Manipur, addressing its impact on the Surma, Kushaira and Meghna rivers. The dam has already been given the go-ahead by the Indian government. A.M.M. Shafiullah, vice chancellor of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said three major rivers of the sub-continent fall into Bangladesh making the water resources system extremely complex and its management a big challenge. Fritz Meijndert, Dutch deputy ambassador and head of development cooperation at the mission, said long term vision and commitment was required to manage water resources. He said it could not be managed without addressing climate change. Bangladesh had a strategy to face climate change, but lacked the broader vision over the next 10 to 50 years, he said. He pledged the Netherlands' support for Bangladesh's water management. The three-day conference, to end Monday, was being held by the BUET Institute of Water and Flood Management at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Centre. A total 135 experts from 13 countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, UK, USA, Nepal, Australia, Japan and France, are participating. bdnew
