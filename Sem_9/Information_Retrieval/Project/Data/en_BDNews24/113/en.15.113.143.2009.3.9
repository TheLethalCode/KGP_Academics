 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government inquiry into the BDR mutiny will take another seven working days to submit findings. "The investigation committee needed more time for its report," additional home secretary Golam Hossain, also a committee member, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The 11-member team on Sunday sought more time for its report that was due Monday. According to the new deadline, it will continue with its work till March 19 as three holidays fall in this period, Eid-e-Miladunnabi on March 10 and a two-day weekend. The government on Feb 27, a day after the 33-hour mutiny was quelled, named an original ten-member team for an inquiry, headed by home minister Sahara Khatun. It recast the committee on March 2, with retired civil servant M Anisuzzaman Khan replacing the home minister as its head. The new committee began work on Mar 3.
