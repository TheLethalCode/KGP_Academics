<TITLE> Dyson banking on Bravo return for consistency </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PORT OF SPAIN, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies coach John Dyson believes the return to fitness of all-rounder Dwayne Bravo could help the Caribbean side find the consistency they need to build on their first series win in five years. After missing the series against England following an ankle operation, the exciting 25-year-old has been named in the Twenty20 side for Sunday's game and is expected to feature in the one-day team before touring England in May. As West Indies were being presented with the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 1998, Bravo was already padded up and the moment the trophy was handed over to skipper Chris Gayle he was on the field for batting practice. "He's always keen and it is great to see that," Dyson told Reuters an interview. "It's terrific to see he is OK and I am really looking forward to him coming back and playing well. "He well add another dimension to our team that will hopefully make us that much stronger and more consistent," added Dyson. Bravo began life as a top-order batsman with Trinidad but his medium-quick bowling, delivered with plenty of variety and enthusiasm, turned him into an all-rounder. Without him in the series against England, won 1-0 after draws in the last three tests, West Indies lacked a seam option in the bowling attack and also missed his hard-hitting contribution with the bat. "I think Bravo is best used in the middle order. He is a terrific player. He has regained full fitness, but obviously after being out for a while he needs to regain his feel for international cricket and form. It will be great to have him involved," Dyson said. BARREN SPELL After ending their barren spell, Dyson believes that his team now need to find consistency if they are to move up to the next level. "The really good teams are consistent with their performances, we still need to get that with our bowling and the same with the batting," he said. Dyson believes that Australian-born Brendan Nash, who made his maiden test century in the final test, has brought backbone to the middle-order but says there are still gaps to fill. "We need Devon Smith to step up in the opening role and put up some really big scores, we need to get someone in the number four spot to get some big scores as well -- Ryan Hinds showed some glimpses batting under pressure. "There are a couple of spots that need someone to put up there hand and say 'I am here and I am going to hang on to that spot'," Dyson said. TECHNIQUE PROBLEMS Seamer Daren Powell's position looks in jeopardy after a poor series in which he managed just six wickets at nearly seventy runs each, but Dyson has been impressed by the way he has worked hard at dealing with technique problems. "He has to have faith in his ability and work on various aspects of technique that are appropriate to finding the consistency he wants. "One of the other difficulties is that when you look at alternatives in the regional competition there are not too many (quick bowlers) throwing up their hands by getting consistent returns," he said. Dyson's 18 months in charge of West Indies have brought improved performances and a change in the mood surrounding cricket in the Caribbean which he hopes can be maintained. "Each time we show a glimpse of doing well, the enthusiasm level definitely picks up but then drops back down because perhaps of a loss or bad performance," he said. "In this series the thing that is consistently mentioned as the most heartening factor of the performances is that the guys are fighting and not falling over like a deck of cards. "People are proud of guys for the fight that they have shown. They have seen three really good fights (for draws) in the series and one magnificent performance that won us the series.
