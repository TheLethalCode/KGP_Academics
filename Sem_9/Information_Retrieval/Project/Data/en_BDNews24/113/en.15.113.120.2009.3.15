<TITLE> RTI: Intel agencies may not be fully exempt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)Intelligence agencies may have to provide some information to public and media under the new right to information law. The parliamentary standing committee on the information ministry recommends intelligence and some law enforcing agencies remain effectively exempt under the bill that awaits passage. But the bill proposes the agencies should be made to disclose some types of information relating to corruption and human rights violations. The right to information ordinance of the previous caretaker government had similar content. The agencies are: National Security Intelligence, Directorate General Forces Intelligence, Defense Intelligence agencies, Criminal Investigation Department, Special Security Force, the intelligence cell of the National Board of Revenue, Special Branch and the intelligence cell of Rapid Action Battalion. The committee also recommends a new provision saying no organistaion can deny information without approval of the proposed information commission, an autonomous body that would enforce the law and deal with complaints from information seekers. Obaidul Quader, chairman of the committee authorised to bring changes after scrutiny, presented a report in parliament on Sunday with its recommendations. If the proposed bill is passed, organisations run on public money will be bound to give information in line with the law to any citizen. It will give people the right to seek information from public offices and file appeals with the information commission on being refused information. However, organisations are not bound to provide information that might go against national security or sovereignty, confidential information received from foreign governments or information on affairs under trial and investigation. The caretaker government passed the right to information ordinance in October last year to promote transparency and accountability, reduce corruption and facilitate good governance. bdn
