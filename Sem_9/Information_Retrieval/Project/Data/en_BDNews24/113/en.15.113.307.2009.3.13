<TITLE> Valencia in talks with Man City on striker Villa - report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Valencia have discussed the possible sale of Spain international striker David Villa to Manchester City, the Primera Liga club's vice president Fernando Gomez was quoted as saying on Thursday. Britain's Times newspaper quoted Gomez as saying Valencia officials met representatives from the English Premier League club to discuss Villa's transfer. Both clubs declined to comment on the report. "They (City) didn't make us any offer. The president (Vicente Soriano) asked for a significant amount and they didn't agree," the paper quoted Gomez as saying. Valencia said last week they might have to sell some of their best players to ease their financial problems. They have been unable to pay their players, including prize assets Villa and David Silva, part of their wages and construction has been halted on a new stadium. Villa signed a six-year contract with Valencia last August, but it now looks inevitable he will leave the club in the close-season. The Times made no mention of a transfer price. City effectively became the richest club in the world last year when they were taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group, owned by billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan
