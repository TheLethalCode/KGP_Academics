<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US relations in Latin America, energy cooperation and two upcoming summits of world leaders will top the agenda of President Barack Obama's meeting with his Brazilian counterpart on Saturday. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva meets Obama at the White House at 11:00 a.m. (1500 GMT), making him one of a small handful of foreign leaders to visit the Democratic president in Washington since his inauguration on Jan. 20. The meeting comes against a backdrop of global economic and financial crises, which will dominate two gatherings of world leaders next month that both men will attend: the G20 meeting of old and emerging economic powers on April 2, and the Summit of the Americas on April 17-19. Officials said Obama and Lula would discuss the economic crisis and preparation for those summits while touching on climate change, biofuels and US policy toward Brazil's neighbors in Latin America. "The two presidents will use this opportunity to discuss strengthening our cooperation on bilateral, hemispheric and global issues, including how to address the financial crisis in the lead up to the upcoming G20 meeting," said Mike Hammer, spokesman for the White House National Security Council. Divisions between the United States and Europe over how best to address the financial crises have arisen ahead of the G20 meeting. Washington is pushing for increased government spending while countries such as France favor more emphasis on tough market regulation. A senior administration official said Obama would ask for Lula's position but not push him to join the US side. RAPPROCHEMENT For his part, Lula is expected to use Brazil's leverage as a regional heavyweight to press Obama for more engagement and fewer sanctions in dealing with Latin America's deep-seated social disparities and economic problems. "What I want is for the United States to look at Latin America and South America with a friendly eye," Lula said last week. "We are a democratic and peaceful continent and the United States should look at production and development, not only drug-trafficking and organized crime." Lula will also urge Obama to end the long-standing trade embargo on Cuba and seek a rapprochement with Venezuela's Socialist President Hugo Chavez, one of Washington's fiercest critics. Thomas Shannon, US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, said the United States appreciated Brazil's efforts to promote regional dialogue. "Our willingness to engage constructively with countries around the region depends on a reciprocal willingness on their part to engage with us," he told reporters on Friday. Observers said Lula's early visit to the White House illustrated US recognition of Brazil's importance. "The US is quite aware that Brazil is becoming a major player on the world stage," said Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. Though energy policy and efforts to fight climate change would come up, Lula will likely struggle with his demand that the United States cut import tariffs on Brazilian ethanol. "At this point biofuels have receded on the agenda," said Martinez-Diaz, noting the current low price of oil
