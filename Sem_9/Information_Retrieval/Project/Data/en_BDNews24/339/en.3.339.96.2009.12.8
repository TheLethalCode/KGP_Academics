 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Google Inc has revamped its search engine to allow results to be refreshed with up-to-the-second data increasingly churned out by the new crop of real-time Web products. The move to integrate real-time search results directly into Google's flagship Web search product comes nearly two months after the company announced a partnership to license data form microblogging service Twitter.

Google announced a variety of other search innovations during the event, including a Japanese-language voice search product that allows Japanese speakers to say a query into a cell phone. The product was previously available in English and Mandarin Chinese.

The company said it has introduced 33 different search innovations in the past 67 days. Google is the top search engine in the United States with a search-query share of about 65 percent, compared with Yahoo Inc's 18 percent share, according to comScore.
