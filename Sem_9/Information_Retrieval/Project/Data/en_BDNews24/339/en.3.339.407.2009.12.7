<TITLE> Crucial climate talks begin </TITLE>

 Copenhagen, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The biggest ever global climate conference began in Copenhagen on Monday, with delegates from 192 countries attending. Danish prime minister Lars Looke, in his opening remarks, said 110 ten heads of government were expected to join the conference "for more than just talks". The biggest climate talks in history must deliver an ambitious, sweeping agreement to capitalise on pledges by countries to fight global warming, the United Nations has said. On the eve of the two-week talks in the Danish capital, the UN climate chief said time was up to agree on the outlines of a tougher climate deal after troubled negotiations have deepened splits between rich and poor nations. "I believe that negotiators now have the clearest signal ever from world leaders to draft a solid set of proposals to implement rapid action," Yvo de Boer told reporters. "Never in the 17 years of climate change negotiations have so many different nations made so many firm pledges together. Almost every day countries announce new targets or plans of action to cut emissions," he said. Much is at stake at Copenhagen. Scientists say the world is heating up because of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and massive deforestation. The United Nations says the world needs a tougher climate pact to halt rapidly rising carbon pollution. Failure to do so would mean triggering dangerous climate change such as rising seas, melting ice caps and greater weather extremes that could disrupt economies and force millions to become climate refugees. 'CLIMATE DEAL MAY BE CLOSE' Countries meeting at the United Nations climate change conference may be closer than some observers realise to agreeing the emissions cuts required to give the world a reasonable chance of avoiding global warming of more than 2 C, according to an analysis launched just ahead of the talks. The study has been compiled by Lord Stern of Brentford, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics and Political Science, in collaboration with analysts at UNEP. UNEP said an analysis of national proposals for annual emissions reductions, published on the eve of the UN climate change conference, indicates that the gap between countries' strongest proposed cuts and what is needed may be only a few billion tonnes of greenhouse gases.
