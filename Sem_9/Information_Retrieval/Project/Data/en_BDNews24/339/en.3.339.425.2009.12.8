 Dhaka, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)  Unruly drivers on Dhaka roads face strict penalties from Tuesday. Dhaka Metropolitan Police have announced that, beginning Dec 8, drivers violating new traffic light or lane rules will be fined a minimum of Tk 1,000 and/or a minimum three-month ban on their licence. Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief AKM Shahidul Haque chaired a meeting of traffic police, transport owners and workers Monday, as traffic hit a peak after a long Eid and post-Eid reprieve. Teams, led by 12 deputy police commissioners, will operate throughout the city in the drive against traffic violations, Haque said. Explaining the penalties, deputy police commissioner Walid Hossain said they would depend on the type of violation. "In some cases drivers will just be fined on the spot; if they cannot pay at the time, they may face cases," Hossain said. "In other cases they may have to face fines as well as a court appearance, suspension of driving license for at least three months and even arrest," he said. DMP introduced new automated signal lights at 50 intersections of the city from Nov 21. They launched a week long promotional campaign on Dec 1 to introduce new traffic lanes too, in a bid to ease gridlock and enforce greater discipline on roads. bd
