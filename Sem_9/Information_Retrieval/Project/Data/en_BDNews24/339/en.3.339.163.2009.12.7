 Dhaka, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)--Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami has asked the government to stop formulating new education policy, returning to the original constitution of 1972 and hold war crimes trial which he claimed were 'against Islam'. "The aim of the proposed education policy is to erase Islamic education, culture and values and their initiative to return to the constitution of 1972 by amending the fifth amendment to the constitution is to turn the country into a state without religion," he said. The High Court in a landmark judgement on Aug 29, 2005 declared the Fifth Amendment to the constitution and subsequent 1975 military takeover as illegal. Nizami was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of Majlish-e-Shura's plenary session at the party headquarters at Moghbazar in Dhaka on Monday. On the trial of those committed crimes in 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, he said, "The government is conspiring to destroy Islamic forces in the country in the name of trying war criminals, making an issue of something that has been settled." The Awami League-led coalition government took initiatives to try the 'war criminals' after storming to power in January. "We hope the government will try to create a peaceful atmosphere in the country instead of pushing the country towards conflict." Nizami urged the political parties to create an atmosphere for peaceful coexistence. He also opposed the planned Asian Highway and agreements with India. Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid, senior nayeb-e-ameer Abul Kalam Muhammad Yusuf, nayeb-e-ameer Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, among others, were present there. Nizami and Mujahid were re-elected to their offices in the session. bd
