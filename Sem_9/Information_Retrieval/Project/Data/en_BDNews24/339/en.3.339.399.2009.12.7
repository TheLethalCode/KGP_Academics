<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)BNP will propose to add to its constitution new posts of senior secretary general, deputy treasurer and indigenous people affairs secretary, a senior party leader said on Monday. They will also propose to have one more joint secretary, taking the total of such post to seven, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy told reporters. BNP vice president Tariqul Islam, who is also the convenor of the constitution reformation committee, said they have received 40 reform proposals from across the country. "After scrutinising those proposals, we have submitted them in a report to the party chairperson. Of them, most have proposed 'One Leader, One Committee', which means no leader can be in more than one committee." In addition, there are suggestions that all committees from union to central level are expanded and every committee has at least 30 percent women, he also said. The highest policymaking forum of the party, the national standing committee, has approved all the proposals after scrutiny. But the proposals will get the final endorsement in the national council on Tuesday, Islam added. Before 2001 parliamentary elections, BNP chief Khaleda Zia appointed her son Tarique Rahman as her party's joint secretary general and promoted him to senior joint secretary general. The council of the party was not held in the past 16 years. Late president and party chief Ziaur Rahman approved the constitution in its council in 1978, which was reformed in the last council in 1993. bdnew
