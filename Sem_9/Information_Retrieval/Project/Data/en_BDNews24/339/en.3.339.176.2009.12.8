 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, now in London undergoing treatment, has said he is still undecided about his direct involvement with party activities. "It (his participation) will depend on overall situation and my health," he said in a pre-recorded video speech aired at the BNP council on Tuesday. Tarique, the elder son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, went to London for medical treatment in September 2007 after being granted bail in a number of corruption cases. He wished all success of the council. "My treatment is still ongoing. I don't know how many days it will take to get full recovery. "I hope to join with you on my return home after recovery. Tarique said he still quivers when he remembers his days in jail. "They wanted to kill me. I am still alive due to honest deeds of my parents." "I did not do any harm to anybody consciously and never thought of doing anything against the interest of the country. "Why I had to get such punishment without any reason?" he asked. Tarique said he was asked to leave the country during the state of emergency. "I did not escape. I had to face false charges and torture." He was arrested under emergency rules by the past military-backed caretaker government. Tarique said the country is now passing through a 'crucial period'. "My father (late president Ziaur Rahman) sacrificed his life for the country. My mother is still working hard for the country and its people." "I could choose a secure life. But I did not. I worked for the welfare of people. Tarique urged all to pray for his quick recovery. He asked all councillors and delegates to convey his greetings to all leaders and activists at grassroots levels. bdnew
