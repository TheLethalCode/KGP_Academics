 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia demanded respect for the opposition as she threatened to launch an anti-government campaign from a landmark party event that saw her son Tarique Rahman deliver a video message to thousands of councillors. She also called on the government "to make parliament effective". "Create an environment for them (the opposition) to speak for the people and refrain from accusing them of false charges," Khaleda Zia told the opening session of at the fifth party council at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Tuesday. "Make scope for discussions on welfare of the country and the people in parliament instead of taking any secret decision. We will help make the house effective," she said. Khaleda asked the government to stop filing false cases against her party leaders and activists and refrain from torturing and harassing them. The opposition leader urged the councillors and delegates to build efficient and quality leadership to take the party forward. She called on all BNP leaders and activists to maintain discipline in the party. Tarique, the party's senior joint secretary general, now in the UK, in a pre-recorded video speech aired ahead of his mother's address, had disappointed many and delegates when he said he was not planning a return to politics in the immediate future. Speculation had mounted ahead of the conference that Khaleda's elder son, who was all but banished from politics by the past caretaker government, would be returning to take up a central role in a "renewed" post-council BNP. Tarique in his video message, however, told the council he is still undecided about his direct involvement with party activities. "It will depend on the overall situation and my health," said Tarique, who went to London for medical treatment in September 2007 after being granted bail in a number of corruption cases. "My treatment is still ongoing. I don't know how many days it will take to get full recovery. "I hope to join with you on my return home after recovery. He wished all success of the council. 'TOUGH MOVEMENT' Khaleda, following on in her address, asked the government to implement its election pledges. "Work for the country and the people and fulfil your election pledges. We will help you." "But if you do anything contrary to the country's interest we will protest it. We will launch movement with people if required," she warned. Khaleda asked all to get ready for tough movement. "You should stay united and rally public support. It will be our prime job for the future." She reiterated her firm stance against corruption, communalism, militancy and terrorism. "We have to be careful about those who introduced autocracy by killing democracy. We should remain alert so that they cannot revive." Khaleda asked people to be aware of propaganda by certain quarter. She urged all to unite with the spirit of nationalism and democracy. "We do neither want religious fanaticism nor politics against religion. All of us are brothers and sisters irrespective of religion. We want to live as Bangladeshis. The council was adjourned at 2:40pm. It resumed at 5pm with a second session that included a closed-door parley, where secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain was placing the proposals on amendments to the party constitution. bdnew
