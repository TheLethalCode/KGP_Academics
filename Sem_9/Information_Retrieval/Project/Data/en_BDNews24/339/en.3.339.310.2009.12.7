<TITLE> Q&A: Copenhagen climate conference </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) - The ultimate aim of the Copenhagen talks is a global deal to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level to prevent irreversible human-made climate change. The majority of the world's governments believe that climate change poses a threat to humans and the natural world. WHY ARE THE COPENHAGEN TALKS HAPPENING? The aim of the Copenhagen talkstechnically known as the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changeis a new global agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol. With 193 Parties, the UNFCC has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol sets binding targets. A new deal is needed to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997, entered into force in 2005 and expires in 2012. Two years ago, at UN climate talks in Bali, governments agreed to start work on the new global agreement. The Copenhagen talks mark the end of that two-year period. Governments hope to leave the Danish capital with a political agreement on the outlines of a new deal. WHAT DEAL? Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol, 37 industrialised countries plus the European Union as a whole commit themselves to reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases by 5 per cent on average in relation to 1990. The targets apply from 2008 to 2012. The protocol applies to the emissions of six greenhouse gases: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and the three types of industrial gases - sulphur hexafluoride, HFCs and PFCs. For the sake of ease, carbon dioxide (CO2) is used as a standard, and the remaining gases are converted to their CO2 equivalents. Developments in the world since the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997 show that much greater reduction commitments are needed. They also show that poor and vulnerable nations need financial support to face the worst effects of climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, new deal should agree aggregate emission reduction by industrialised countries of between minus 25% and 40% over 1990 levels would be required by 2020 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change, with global emissions falling by at least 50% by 2050. WHO IS LOOKING FOR WHAT? A lot of interests are at stake. Industrialised nations will set targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate climate change. The key date for these commitments is 2020, although some countries are looking beyond that, to 2050. Richer developing countries, like China and India, are also likely to be asked to constrain their emissions. If they do make any pledges, they are likely to restrain the growth of emissions rather than making actual cuts. In order to help developing countries constrain their greenhouse gas emissions, industrialised nations have agreed in principle to help them in areas such as renewable energy. Developing countries are looking for mechanisms that can speed up this technology transfer. Many countries are thinking about how to prepare for the impacts of climate change - what sorts of adaptation will be necessary. Developing countries are therefore also looking for substantial and reliable finance to help them adapt. Their argument is that as the industrialised world has caused the problem, it must pay to sort it out. Measures to protect forests will be a component of the deal. WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS FOR A DEAL? The Copenhagen conference may not yield a new global climate treaty with every minor detail in place. A political agreement appears more likely, with attempts to secure a legally-binding treaty deferred until some point in 2010. But hopefully the Copenhagen talks will close with agreements on some essentials. According to UN climate chief Yvo de Boer, four essentials calling for international agreement in Copenhagen are: 1. How much are the industrialised countries willing to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases? 2. How much are major developing countries such as China and India willing to do to limit the growth of their emissions? 3. How is the help needed by developing countries to engage in reducing their emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change going to be financed? 4. How is that money going to be managed? HOW MUCH WILL IT COST? In general, fossil fuels provide us with our cheapest sources of energy. The main route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to avoid burning fossil fuels; so a successful treaty would almost certainly make energy more expensive. Funding clean technologies will be part of any deal There are different analyses of how much it would cost to make this transition quickly enough to avert "dangerous" climate change. Developing countries are looking for money in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars each year for mitigation - the ballpark figure that the International Energy Agency calculates is necessary to fund a large-scale switch to low-carbon energy. A number of studies, including one by the World Bank, also suggest that a further $100bn per year  on top of existing aid - will be needed to help poorer countries adapt. By comparison, the amount of overseas aid currently given each year by rich countries is in the region of $100bn. WHY IS CLIMATE CHANGE HAPPENING? The greenhouse effect is a natural mechanism that retains the heat emitted from the earth's surface. If the natural greenhouse effect did not exist, the earth's average temperature would be around minus 19 degrees Celsius. The greenhouse effect is caused by a range of different gases in the earth's atmosphere. Water vapour makes the most significant contribution to the greenhouse effect, followed by CO2. Analyses of air contained in ice from the Antarctic ice cap show that there is far more CO2 in the air today than at any time in the last 650,000 years. The consequence is that the greenhouse effect is becoming stronger, and therefore the earth is becoming warmer. How much warmer has, however, been a matter of dispute. The most recent assessment report from the IPCC is from 2007. It concludes that the earth's average temperature has risen by 0.74 degrees in the period from 1906 to 2005. The report concludes that the average temperature will continue to rise, but that the extent and the duration of this rise, and the severity of its consequences, depend on how quickly and how effectively emissions of greenhouse gases can be restricted and, over time, reduced. The principal cause is burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas. Deforestation and processes that release other greenhouse gases such as methane also contribute. Although the initial impact is a rise in average temperatures around the world - "global warming" - this also produces changes in rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, changes to the difference in temperatures between night and day, and so on. This more complex set of disturbances has acquired the label "climate change" - sometimes more accurately called "anthropogenic (human-made) climate change". WOULD A COPENHAGEN DEAL SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE? The global average temperature has already risen by about 0.7C since pre-industrial times. In some parts of the world this is already having impacts - and a Copenhagen deal could not stop those impacts, although it could provide funding to help deal with some of the consequences. Greenhouse gases such as CO2 stay in the atmosphere for decades; and concentrations are already high enough that further warming is almost inevitable. A strong Copenhagen deal might keep the temperature rise under 2C; but given uncertainties in how the atmosphere and oceans respond to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, it might not. IPCC figures suggest that to have a reasonable chance of avoiding 2C, global emissions would need to peak and start to decline within about 15-20 years. Currently, the cuts pledged by industrialised nations are not enough to halt the overall global rise in emissions. This is why developing countries put such an emphasis on adaptation, which they argue is necessary already. Whatever happens in Copenhagen, further meetings will almost certainly be necessary to finalise the "rules" of any new treaty. Further ahead, at some point governments will almost certainly begin the process of securing the deal after Copenha
