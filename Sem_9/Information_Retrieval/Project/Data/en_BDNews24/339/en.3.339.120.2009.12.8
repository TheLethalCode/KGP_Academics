 CANBERRA, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's conservative opposition moved further to the right on Tuesday, paving the way for a bruising 2010 election fought over climate change and tougher immigration and government spending. New conservative leader Tony Abbott, who last week wrestled the leadership from moderates, announced an opposition frontbench of climate change sceptics and backers of tougher immigration and labour laws. "I think the government is vulnerable," Abbott said, pointing to weekend by-elections in two conservative heartland seats that showed voters backing the opposition defeat of key emissions trade laws promised by centre-left Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. "Ordinary families are unsure of what is happening to them under this government, and the government is very vulnerable on economic management," Abbott told reporters in Canberra. In a dramatic week in Australian politics, Rudd's landmark carbon trade plan was last week rejected by parliament and the opposition dumped moderate leader Malcolm Turnbull, who was considered too close to Rudd on climate policies that have split voters. SHARPEN CHOICES The opposition elected the social conservative Abbott, a former boxer and Rhodes scholar who once studied for the priesthood, in a move political analysts said would sharpen the choice voters face at elections due by late 2010. Abbott confirmed those expectations, appointing maverick upper house senator and trenchant emissions trade opponent, Barnaby Joyce, as his finance spokesman, while naming another climate change sceptic, Nick Minchin, as his resource spokesman. Their appointments make it more unlikely that Abbott's conservatives can be swayed to back emissions laws when they are returned to the parliament in February, with their earlier rejection already giving Rudd a trigger for early elections. "The last thing we should do is go into a giant new emissions tax without a full public debate. He is the prime minister, it's his A$120 billion ($110 billion) money-go-round that needs to be explained," Abbott said. Another opposition hardliner, Eric Abetz, will take on Rudd's Labor over the relaxation of workplace laws, in a move which could draw crucial business support from the government, but polarise voters, who punished the conservatives on the issue in 2007. Moderate opponent Scott Morrison was tapped by Abbott to take on immigration, laying the ground for a battle over recent asylum boat arrivals and a possible replay of divisive 2001 elections which carried then-ruling conservatives to an unexpected victory. Abbott's reshuffle signalled a bitter coming election campaign that could unsettle both business and voters anxious for economic recovery and emissions trade certainty. Rudd and his Labor Party have led in opinion polls since he won office in late 2007, but Abbott's election is likely to lead to a short-term revival of opposition support, which would dampen speculation of an early electi
