 Satkhira, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The trial of suspected BDR mutineers in Satkhira region began at 3pm on Monday in a special court at the border force's district headquarters. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam is leading a three-member court. The two other members are officers of lieutenant colonel and major general ranks. This is the second court after the first BDR mutiny trial started in Rangmati. Huge contingent of police, RAB and intelligence force have been deployed around the special court installed at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters, the battalion's commander Lt Col Iqbal Azim said. The court will adjourn for the day after the charges are read out. It will resume on Tuesday in presence of the accused BDR men in the dock, he said earlier. Some 61 border guards under 7 Rifles Battalion based in Neeldumur will face the trial in the first phase. Among them 34 are currently detained in prison and 27 under the custody of the battalion in a mutiny case filed with Shyamnagar Police Station. Also, 27 personnel of 41 Rifles Battalion based in Satkhira town are in detention in jail and they will be tried later in a separate case filed with the Sadar Police Station, he added. Deputy attorney general Zahid Sarwar Kajal, representing the attorney general, Shashanka Shekhar Sarder and Mohammed Khosruzzaman, special public prosecutors, will plead for the state during the trial. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the border force's Dhaka headquarters killed over 73 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. The rebellion also spread to other BDR posts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty finding, the maximum penalty for rebellion is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of killings, looting and arson. A number of border guards of 7 and 41 Rifles Battalions expressed solidarity with the mutineers on Feb 26 and 27, the BDR captain said. The special courts will try the mutineers and the proceedings for looting will be held under general laws. bdn
