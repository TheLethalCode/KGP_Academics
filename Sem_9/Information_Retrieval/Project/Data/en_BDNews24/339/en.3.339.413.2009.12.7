 Maruf Mallick and Rashida Ahmad Copenhagen, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The world's biggest climate conference began in Copenhagen on Monday, with 15,000 participants attending from 192 countries and renewed hopes for a deal. The UN and host country Denmark have billed the talks as a "turning point" and "an unmissable opportunity". "The world is depositing hope with you for a short while in the history of mankind," Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told delegates at the opening ceremony of the talks, seeking to agree the first UN climate pact in 12 years. He said that 110 world leaders, including US President Barack Obama, would attend a summit at the end of the Dec. 7-18 meeting to agree deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for the rich by 2020 and raise billions of dollars for the poor in aid. "A deal is within our reach," Rasmussen said. The presence of so many world leaders "reflects an unprecedented mobilization of political determination to combat climate change. It represents a huge opportunity. An opportunity the world cannot afford to miss," Rasmussen said. "The ultimate responsibility rests with the citizens of the world, who will ultimately bear the fatal consequences, if we fail to act," he said. The biggest climate talks in history must deliver an ambitious, sweeping agreement to capitalise on pledges by countries to fight global warming, the United Nations has said. 'TURNING POINT' On the eve of the two-week talks in the Danish capital, the UN climate chief said time was up to agree on the outlines of a tougher climate deal after troubled negotiations have deepened splits between rich and poor nations. "Copenhagen is already a turning point in the international response to climate change," said Yvo de Boer, head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat. "I believe that negotiators now have the clearest signal ever from world leaders to draft a solid set of proposals to implement rapid action," Yvo de Boer told reporters. "Never in the 17 years of climate change negotiations have so many different nations made so many firm pledges together. Almost every day countries announce new targets or plans of action to cut emissions," he said. Much is at stake at Copenhagen. Scientists say the world is heating up because of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and massive deforestation. The United Nations says the world needs a tougher climate pact to halt rapidly rising carbon pollution. Failure to do so would mean triggering dangerous climate change such as rising seas, melting ice caps and greater weather extremes that could disrupt economies and force millions to become climate refugees. 'CLIMATE DEAL MAY BE CLOSE' Countries meeting at the United Nations climate change conference may be closer than some observers realise to agreeing the emissions cuts required to give the world a reasonable chance of avoiding global warming of more than 2 C, according to an analysis launched just ahead of the talks. The study has been compiled by Lord Stern of Brentford, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics and Political Science, in collaboration with analysts at UNEP. UNEP said an analysis of national proposals for annual emissions reductions, published on the eve of the UN climate change conference, indicates that the gap between countries' strongest proposed cuts and what is needed may be only a few billion tonnes of greenhouse gases.
