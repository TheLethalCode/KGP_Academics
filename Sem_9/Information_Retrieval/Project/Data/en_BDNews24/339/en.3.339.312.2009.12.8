 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)The government is finally set to sign agreements with three companies, worth Tk 1655 crore, to expand the Dhaka-Chittagong highway to four lanes. The cabinet purchase committee, headed by finance minister AMA Muhith, approved a proposal Monday to award contracts to a Chinese company and two local firms. "This long-waited project is about to materialise with today's approval," Nurul Karim, joint secretary of the cabinet division, told reporters after the meeting. The construction work is divided into 10 parts, seven of which will be done by China's Sinohydro Corporation. Reza Construction and TBL-ACL joint venture will get two parts and one part respectively. The present government has declared expansion of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, the country's main road route, as one of its top priorities. The highway is seen as crucial for increasing foreign trade through Chittagong Port and transportation of goods along the country's main commercial route. Plans for its expansion from two lanes to four have been on the table since 2004. But previous tenders were twice cancelled following allegations of irregularities by local bidders. This time round, both foreign and local bids were invited. The tender, floated in June, closed in September. Monday's meeting also approved the appointment of an adviser for the Water Management Development Project. This Tk 47 crore project under the WDB is being jointly funded by the World Bank and government of Netherlands. The purchase committee also approved appointment of a consultancy firm for the 'Cyclone Recovery and Restoration' on an emergency basis. The Tk 12.7 crore project is being jointly implemented by the Bangladesh government and World Bank. Appointment of a contractor for construction work of circular drains and internal roads of Purbachal New Town was also approved in the meeting. bdnews24.
