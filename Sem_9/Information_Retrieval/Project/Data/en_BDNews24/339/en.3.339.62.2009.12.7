 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's India visit has been postponed because of the Copenhagen talks, which she is due to attend. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, announcing the postponement in a press conference Monday, said new dates might be set for the New Delhi trip, possibly in the second week of January. "The prime minister was scheduled to fly for Delhi from Copenhagen on Dec 18, but we had to reschedule the trip. And that might take place on Jan 10/11," Dipu Moni told reporters at the foreign ministry. She said the visit has been deferred at the request of Indian government. The foreign minister said Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh will also attend the meeting of the heads of state and government on Dec 18 in Copenhagen. She said US President Barack Obama will also attend the summit in the Danish capital on Dec 18, the climax day of the climate change conference. "The deferral will give us chance to get better prepared for the prime minister's upcoming tour of India," foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes told reporters at the press conference.
