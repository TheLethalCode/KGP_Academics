<TITLE> FACTBOX: The essentials of COP15 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 The aim of the Copenhagen talks, technically known as the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), is a new global agreement. The ultimate objective of any climate deal is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level to prevent irreversible human-made climate change. . With 193 Parties, the UNFCC has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997, entered into force in 2005 and expires in 2012. Under the Protocol, 37 States, consisting of highly industrialised countries and countries undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, have legally binding emission limitation and reduction commitments. A new deal is now needed to replace the Kyoto Protocol. Developments in the world since the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997 show that greater reduction commitments are needed. They also show that poor and vulnerable nations need financial support to face the worst effects of climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an aggregate emission reduction by industrialised countries of between minus 25% and 40% over 1990 levels would be required by 2020 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change, with global emissions falling by at least 50% by 2050. The Copenhagen conference may not yield a new global climate treaty with every minor detail in place. But hopefully it will close with agreements on some essentials. According to UN climate chief Yvo de Boer, four essentials calling for international agreement in Copenhagen are: 1. How much are the industrialised countries willing to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases? 2. How much are major developing countries such as China and India willing to do to limit the growth of their emissions? 3. How is the help needed by developing countries to engage in reducing their emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change going to be financed? 4. How is that money going to be managed?
