 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Monday adjourned hearing until Jan 4 on the petition for quashing the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman. The bench of Justice Syed Muhammad Dastagir Husain and Justice Md Rais Uddin passed the order on a time prayer moved by attorney general Mahbubey Alam. On Oct 15, the High Court asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) to explain why the proceedings of the case should not be cancelled. On Sep 15, two separate petitions were filed at the High Court a petition for quashing the corruption case by Mahbubuddin Khokon on behalf of Khaleda and Tarique. The hearing on the petitions started on Oct 7. The ACC deputy director Harun-or-Rashid pressed charges against six persons including Khaleda and Tarique on Aug 5. The High Court vacation bench of Justice AFM Abdur Rahman and Justice Rezaul Hasan had rejected their petitions on Sep 24. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against Khaleda, Tarique and four others on Aug 5, accusing them of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed only on paper. The court of Dhaka metropolitan special judge A N M Bashirullah on Sep 7 set Oct 25 to frame charges against five other defendants. It issued arrest warrants on defendants Mominur Rahman, nephew of Khaleda, and former principal secretary Kamal Uddin Siddiqui, who did not appear in court. The Supreme Court on Aug 2 upheld the previous High Court bail orders secured by both Khaleda and Tarique in the case filed with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. Tarique is out on bail to receive medical treatment in the UK. bdnews
