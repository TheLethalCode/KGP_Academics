 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)The government is going to pass a law that will scrap the provision for court to issue warrant of arrest in defamation cases on journalists, editors, writers and publishers. Currently, a court can order arrest of these professionals if any defamation case is filed under Section 500, 501 and 502 of the criminal penal code. Chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the weekly cabinet meeting on Monday provisionally approved the draft of the relevant law, The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 2009, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters at the secretariat. "Under the current law an arrest warrant is issued just after a defamation case is filed on any journalist, editor, publisher or a writer. "But the new law will prohibit issuance of such warrants while the court can issue summons," he added. Monday's meeting also gave consent to the drafts on three lawsBangladesh Telecommunications Act (Amended) 2009, Court Fees (Amended) Act 2009 and Bangladesh Tourism Protected Area and Special Tourism Zones Act 2009, the press secretary added. "The prime minister in the meeting gave directives to stop felling of trees in the areas reserved for tourism and asked all to also preserve the rights of the local residents in those areas." She also asked the relevant authorities to properly utilise the world's longest sea beach in Cox's Bazar, Azad added. Moreover, the proposals to sign the 'Framework Agreement on Trade Facilitation in APTA Participating States' and the 'Framework Agreement on the Promotion, Protection and Liberalisation of Investment in APTA Participating States' have also been approved by the cabinet. "Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Philippines will sign agreements under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), which is expected to boost trade among the signatories." Reports on the progress made from the participation of SAFTA ministerial council meeting held on Oct 28 in Kathmandu, the 35th general meeting of UNESCO and the visit of a government delegation to Russia on Oct 19-21 were submitted at the meeting. The cabinet was briefed on Bangladesh's stand in the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, Azad added. bdnew
