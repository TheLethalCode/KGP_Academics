 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday asked the government and the BTRC to explain why the suspension of Jamuna TV's transmission and the cancellation of its frequency are not unlawful. In a rule nisi , the court also asked them to reply why the seized goods and machinery of the private TV station will not be returned and why the channel will not be issued a final licence. Justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Mamnun Rahman gave the orders on a petition filed by Jamuna Group managing director Shamim Islam. The court has asked the information secretary, the chairman and assistant director of Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to reply in seven days. The BTRC shut down the test transmission late on Nov 19. The telecoms regulator had asked Jamuna not to go on air without obtaining the 'no-objection' certificate. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq, counsel for Jamuna TV, at the hearing said BTRC violated law by shutting down the transmission. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, for the prosecution, said Jamuna TV applied for the 'no-objection' certificate on Oct 8. But the channel started transmission illegally while the matter was under consideration. bdn
