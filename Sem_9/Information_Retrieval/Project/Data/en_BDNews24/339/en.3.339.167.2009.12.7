<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission is thinking of cancelling the registration of political parties failing to get minimum votes in two successive general elections. A decision may come after talks with political parties, election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain told reporters at the EC Secretariat on Monday. He said such provision is being broached to make the parties more active instead of reining them in. Hossain said it will stop the tendency of putting up 'dummy' candidates who never contest elections. Of the 39 registered political parties, 38 ran the December 29 parliamentary polls and all but four failed to receive less than one percent votes. He said the EC will set the percentage of votes a party has to get after discussion. In line with the Representation of People Order, an independent candidate has to submit the signatures of one percent voters of the constituency. As party candidates do not have to comply with the regulation the political parties take advantage to field 'dummy' candidates in more than one constituency, he observed. So, they will propose to incorporate the new provision into the electoral laws (RPO) so that disparity between party and independent candidates go, he said. bd
