 Kishoreganj, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)--The death toll from the Kishoreganj boat capsize climbed to 52 after another dead body was recovered on Monday, the Mithamoin Upazila chief executive said. The body retrieved eight kilometres from the accident scene was identified as that of 10-year old Oliullah of Sunamganj district, Gopal Chandra Das, the Nirbahi officer, told bdnews24.com. Bodies of Tanvir, 25, and Tanjil, 12, pulled earlier, had been handed over to their relatives shortly after the accident without informing the local administration, he added. In addition, the name of a dead man had been written twice on the list of victims, taking the death counts to '50' earlier in the day, Das said. Two more bodies are still missing, he said. He also said a five-member committee, headed by the shipping ministry's joint secretary Mohammad Abdul Kuddus, visited the scene at 11am and talked with eyewitnesses. The committee is to submit a report within three days, he added. The accident took place on Friday when a Bhairab-bound engine boat collided with passenger ferry MV Al-Helal near Charigram in Mithamoin upazila of Kishoreganj. bdnews24.c
