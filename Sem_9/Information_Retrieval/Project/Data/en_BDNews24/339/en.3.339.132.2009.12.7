<TITLE> Pakistan amnesty case stirs tensions, bomb kills 6 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD Dec 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's top court began hearing challenges on Monday to an amnesty order that could deepen political tensions in a nuclear-armed country already facing pressure to fight Taliban militants on several fronts. The turmoil could further weaken embattled President Asif Ali Zardari, whose civilian government has failed to contain militants who have demonstrated they can penetrate security near the headquarters of Pakistan's all-powerful military. Some of Zardari's closest aides may face revived corruption charges depending on the ruling of the Supreme Court, which took up legal challenges to an amnesty order granted to about 8,000 people, including the interior and defence ministers. The politically charged issue could distract the government from a crackdown on the Pakistani Taliban, blamed for bombings that have killed hundreds of people since October. In the latest violence, a suicide bomber killed six people near a court building in the northwestern city of Peshawar. "The bomber got down off an auto-rickshaw and rushed towards the gates of the court. He detonated the explosives strapped to his body when our men pointed their rifles to stop him from getting into the court," Peshawar police chief Liaquat Ali Khan told reporters. Rescuers collected body parts after the blast, while six cars were engulfed in flames outside the courthouse. Pakistan's military, once a staunch supporter of Afghan militants in their fight against Soviet occupation in the 1980s, now faces brazen Taliban insurgents on its own soil. The army's priority is to defeat the Pakistan Taliban, but taking on hardline Islamist groups has been complicated by U.S. demands they do more to wipe out militants who cross the rugged border to attack U.S. troops in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama sent a clear message to Pakistan last week in his speech outlining plans to send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. Pakistan, he said, must not allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for militants. But Pakistan's military, which sets national security policy and has great influence on decisions on Afghanistan, can't afford to let its guard down in the fight against the Pakistani Taliban. Last week suicide bombers and gunmen climbed over a wall and attacked a mosque near the military headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi, just 30 minutes' drive from the capital, Islamabad, officials said. More than 40 people were killed. PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY Zardari, the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, cannot be prosecuted because of presidential immunity, in the amnesty case. But the re-opening of files could further weaken the increasingly unpopular president as the opposition steps up demands for government figures protected by the decree to resign. More political wrangling would dismay the United States as it would divert attention from the fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants at a time when Obama's administration is struggling to stabilise Afghanistan. Zardari's government last month was forced to abandon plans to get parliamentary approval for the amnesty in the face of objections from a coalition partner and the opposition. "This is a law of the jungle," Qazi Hussain Ahmed, an Islamist party opposition leader, told reporters outside the court. The hearing is likely to last for weeks. In the face of widespread opposition to the amnesty, a government lawyer told the Supreme Court the government would not attempt to defend it. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who is heading a 17-judge panel hearing the challenges, ordered the government to provide the court with full details of those who were protected by the amnesty on Tuesday. The case was then adjourned. The amnesty was introduced by former president Pervez Musharraf under a plan to bring Bhutto back from self-imposed exile under a power-sharing pact. Bhutto returned in October 2007, weeks after Musharraf introduced the amnesty, but she was assassinated weeks later. Zardari led her party to victory in an election in February 2008 and became president after Musharraf resigned that Aug
