 Cox's Bazar, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)  Fifteen fishermen, thrown overboard their vessel by pirates early Friday, are still missing in the Bay of Bengal, survivors said on Saturday. The pirates threw all the 17 crew overboard and let the fishing trawler go down into the sea after looting the catch. The survivors are Abu Taher, 32 and Sayed Ullah, 30. Salamat Ullah, the owner of the trawler told bdnews24.com that his 'FBN Haq' trawler went to the sea on Dec 2. He said, "The pirates sank the trawler after looting at least 3,000 Hilsha fish and some machinery. They threw the fishermen into the sea with their hands and legs tied." The two survivors, floating on the water, were rescued by another trawler. A search is underway to find the missing fishermen, locals said. bdnews24.co
