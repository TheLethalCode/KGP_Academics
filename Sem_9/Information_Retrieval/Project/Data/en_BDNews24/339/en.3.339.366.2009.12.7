 Copenhagen, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  The world was once again reminded of the dangers of changing climate as the head of the UN climate panel told the global convention Monday that low-lying countries like Bangladesh and small island nations could be submerged by the rising sea levels. IPCC chief Rajendra Pachauri urged world leaders to take climate change action and support vulnerable countries as he spoke at the opening ceremony at the Bella Conference Centre in the Danish capital. Pachauri was specific in calling for concrete action to save vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh. He said G8 leaders had recognised the broad scientific view of limiting the rise in average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius. He said the IPCC also clearly specified that global emissions must peak no later than 2015. "That is because barely six in years from now, and some may even question the goal 2 degree as a ceiling, because this would lead to sea level rise on account of thermal expansion alone of 0.4 to 1.4 metres." "This increase added to the effect of melting of snow and ice across the globe, could submerge several small island states and Bangladesh". RENEWED HOPES FOR DEAL The world's biggest climate conference began in Copenhagen Monday morning, with 15,000 participants attending from 192 countries and renewed hopes for a deal. The UN and host country Denmark have billed the talks as a "turning point" and "an unmissable opportunity". "The world is depositing hope with you for a short while in the history of mankind," Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told delegates at the opening ceremony of the talks, seeking to agree the first UN climate pact in 12 years. He said that 110 world leaders, including US President Barack Obama, were expected to attend a further summit at the end of the Dec. 7-18 meeting to agree deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for the rich by 2020 and raise billions of dollars for the poor in aid. "We are here today, because we all are committed to take action to tackle climate change," Rasmussen said. "A deal is within our reach." "Leaders do not come to talk, they come to act, and they come, not to agree to just anything-but to agree to an effective deal based on our fundamental principals, on our common resolve and on the political, social and economic reality in our countries throughout the world." "Global warming knows no order, it does not discriminate. If affects us all. And we here to day, because we are all committed to take action." "Climate change is higher on the agenda than ever". UN climate chief Yvo de Boer said, after two years negotiation, "the time has come to deliver". "Copenhagen will only be a success if it delivers significant and immediate action that begins the day the conference ends."
