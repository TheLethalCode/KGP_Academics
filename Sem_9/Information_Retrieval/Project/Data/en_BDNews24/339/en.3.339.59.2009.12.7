 Dhaka, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said on Monday Bangladesh wants to see the Copenhagen deal ensure carbon emission cut targets "legally binding" for all emitters by 2010. Currently, emission cut targets of the gas is a "politically binding" for developing countries, but legally binding for developed nations. If the Copenhagen agreement has legally binding provision for the emission cut targets for the emitters, the developed and developing countries will have to reduce burning fossil fuels, which generate carbon di-oxide and other harmful gases responsible for earth's temperature rise. The "politicall binding" emission cut targets give the polluters a chance not to slash emissions. "There is an effort in the climate negotiations for keeping provision of politically binding emission reduction," Dipu Moni told reporters Monday at a press conference at the foreign ministry. "All the countries will have to be on board for an effective deal. "So, we will accept the provision for politically binding emission cut targets if those could be made legally binding by the year 2010," she said. Dipu Moni said, "I think it will be an achievement (of the Copenhagen deal)". The existing Kyoto Protocol has legally binding emission cut targets for the developed countries responsible for global warming, which will trigger sea level rise on the planet and many small countries might be extinct from the world map. The foreign minister reiterated Dhaka's demand for specific commitment for funding from the international community necessary for mitigation and adaptation. "The funds must be in the form of grants, not as loan. "Besides, the money must not be cut from the development aid," said the foreign minister. Experts fear that Bangladesh will lose at least 18 percent of its landmass by the middle of this century due to sea level rise if the global temperature goes up at the present rate. The government says around 20 million people will be displaced by the sea level rise, caused by the climate change.
