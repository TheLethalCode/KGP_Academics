 WASHINGTON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US and Japanese governments look to sew up an agreement in Washington this week to further open transpacific air service, a crucial deal for American Airlines and an important one for investors looking to capitalize on closer ties between carriers. Negotiators expect to finalize the liberalization or "open skies" accord as early as Thursday. The talks aim to break down restrictions on which airlines from each country can fly to and from Tokyo. Only a handful of carriers have meaningful passenger and cargo service now. "Until you've agreed, you're not there. We think we're within reach. I think the will is there on both sides," John Byerly, a State Department official and lead US negotiator in the Japan talks, said in an interview with Reuters. The negotiations mostly center on access to Tokyo's Narita airport where takeoff and landing rights are government-controlled. US officials have sought for years without much success to eliminate barriers that restrict opportunities for direct service for most American carriers. But the deterioration of Japan's flagship airline - Japan Airlines, expectations for Tokyo as a gateway to a fast-growing Asia market, and potential opportunities for Japanese carriers to maximize revenues on transpacific flying -- kick-started talks this year. U.S. negotiators were taken by surprise. Airlines generally favor "open skies" for maximum opportunity to start or expand service or add muscle through alliances. The situation in Japan is no different, but enthusiasm for a deal varies among big airlines. For instance, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp, and FedEx Corp, operate in Japan with few limitations, according to a post-war treaty that governs rules on U.S./Japan service. With facilities and direct service in Tokyo, they maintain a sizable advantage over American Airlines and other carriers who rely on third parties or ticketing and marketing arrangements to fly their passengers or haul their goods. These advantages for these so-called "incumbents" would continue if an "open skies" pact were not achieved. JAPAN SEEKS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY The Japan negotiations must clear technical hurdles, but most insiders expect an "open skies" accord this week that will ultimately give U.S. carriers more passenger and cargo flights at expanding Narita airport but eventually reduce their share of airport operations, which now exceeds 25 percent. A Japanese government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the two sides have reached "an overall understanding" on basic aspects of "open skies," but "formidable" legal technicalities remain. For "open skies" to take effect, Japan wants the United States to lift antitrust restrictions so alliances can maximize revenues by collaborating on pricing, scheduling and operations. Lucrative alliances are a popular substitute for mergers. Byerly cannot promise approval outright for so-called antitrust immunity, but those bids are only permitted when a framework for "open skies" is in place. The Transportation Department regularly approves immunity applications. Will Ris, the top lobbyist for American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp , and other experts with knowledge of the discussions believe an immunity component will be part of the "open skies" deal. This would let American and the Oneworld alliance pursue deeper ties with Japan Airlines, if JAL does not opt for another tie-in. Struggling JAL is in the throes of restructuring and is being courted by American Airlines, which has teamed with private equity fund TPG and other Oneworld partners to offer more than $1 billion to shore up JAL finances, if it remains on the team. Oneworld provides JAL with $500 million in annual revenue. "In terms of our ability to carry passengers from the US to points in Asia, we rely on Japan Airlines to provide connections through Narita," Ris said. "I think more importantly, we've evolved in the airline business into a competition among alliances." Delta also is wooing JAL with a $1 billion equity proposal to leave Oneworld and join the SkyTeam alliance, which would be augmented by an immunity application. Delta could also seek venture capital to sweeten the offer. United is lobbying for an immunity grant with All Nippon Airways Co to beef up the Star Alliance. Delta said in a statement that it supports "open skies" but only one that allows for full market freedom. A more restrictive US/Japan deal may not suit De
