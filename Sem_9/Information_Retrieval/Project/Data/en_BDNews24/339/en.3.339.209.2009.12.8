 BAGHDAD (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 62 people were killed and 105 wounded when four or more large car bombs shook Baghdad on Tuesday, the latest high-profile blasts apparently aimed at sensitive Iraqi government buildings, police said. The explosions rattled buildings across the capital, and undermined a fragile sense of security ahead of an auction of oilfield contracts this weekend, when executives from top oil firms will fly into town, and before an election next year.

The blasts are the first large, high-profile explosions in Baghdad since October 25, when two massive truck bombs killed 155 people at the justice ministry and Baghdad governorate headquarters. A smaller blast, which some police officials said might have involved the accidental explosion of a hidden stockpile of munitions, killed seven children at a school in the Shi'ite slum of Sadr City on Monday.

Rather than stage frequent smaller-scale attacks against soft targets like marketplaces or mosques, insurgent groups like al Qaeda now appear to be aiming for spectacular and less frequent strikes against heavily defended government targets. Overall violence triggered by the 2003 US-led invasion has fallen dramatically. The health ministry in November reported the lowest monthly death toll of Iraqi civilians in 6-1/2 ye
