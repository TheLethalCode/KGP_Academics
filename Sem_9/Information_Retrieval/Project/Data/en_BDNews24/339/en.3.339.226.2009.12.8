 WASHINGTON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top US military commander and top US diplomat in Afghanistan face Congress on Tuesday to explain to skeptical lawmakers how a surge of 30,000 soldiers will turn around the eight-year-old war. Critics have branded President Barack Obama's new strategy as vague and contradictory, pointing to his call for US forces to begin pulling out of Afghanistan in July 2011 just as he orders new troops into the country. Obama is sending less than the 40,000 troops requested by General Stanley McChrystal -- a lightening rod issue for many lawmakers, even though part of the gap will be filled by NATO contributions. "Did that (30,000) number just come out of a hat?" said Howard "Buck" McKeon, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, which will hear McChrystal's testimony starting at 9:30 a.m. EST. "What I want to find out is what McChrystal got compared to what he asked for," he told Reuters. "We have never seen actual numbers." Supporters are looking to McChrystal and Ambassador Karl Eikenberry to explain how the US military will reverse the Taliban momentum in time to meet Obama's drawdown goal, which offers hope for a gradual exit from a costly, unpopular war in which casualties are rising. For McChrystal, it will be his first appearance before Congress since he warned in a bleak August assessment that the mission would fail without more troops. He and Eikenberry have said improvement by Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government, widely seen as corrupt, was also critical. Lawmakers are expected to press Eikenberry, a former US military commander in Afghanistan, about his concerns leaked to the media about sending in more troops before that improvement by Karzai's government. Analysts played down chances the envoy would signal a split with McChrystal or Obama's decision on the surge. "I think they (Eikenberry and McChrystal) both felt that clear conditions needed to be established with Karzai," said Anthony Cordesman, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I think (the Obama administration) acted on Eikenberry's cable and that there were some fairly frank exchanges about what would be required from the Afghan government." HONEST MINISTERS Karzai, whose re-election was tainted by widespread fraud in the August vote, pledged in his inauguration speech to appoint capable and honest ministers. His cabinet is expected to be announced in the coming days. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates arrived in Afghanistan on Tuesday, saying he would press Karzai to appoint "honest" members of the cabinet but playing down the need for a wholesale shakeup of his government. Gates said he would tell Karzai and other Afghan leaders that Washington will remain "their partner for a long time" but expected Kabul to get serious about accelerating the training of Afghan forces so they can start taking charge of security. "As the security situation improves and we're able, over time, to reduce our forces, the civilian, developmental, economic, other kinds of relations between us will become the predominant part of the relationship," Gates told reporters aboard his plane. Gates said he ran into McChrystal at the Pentagon on Monday morning before he left for Afghanistan. "I actually told him that I'd rather be going where I'm going than where he's going," Gates said, referring to the hearings on Capitol Hill, where Gates endured the first round of questioning from lawmakers last week. McChrystal, Eikenberry and General David Petraeus, head of US Central Command, will testify at hearings this week. Obama's commitment means there will be about 100,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- two thirds of whom will have arrived since he took office -- along with more than 40,000 from allied countries. Following the US troop announcement, NATO allies have offered as many as 7,000 reinforcements of their own, although it still not clear how many of the troops are already in Afghanistan. Gates said that number "may go higher than that" after a conference on Afghanistan next month in Lon
