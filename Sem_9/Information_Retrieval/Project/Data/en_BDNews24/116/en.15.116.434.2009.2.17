 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government wants to see the Anti-Corruption Commission independent and capable, and the graftbusters should watch out against indulging in corruption, an aide said Tuesday. Hasina said the state needed to ensure that no-one got involved in corruption in trying to fight other's graft and referred to the huge government funds spent on paying the lawyers to represent the ACC in the trial of cases. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said Hasina expressed her government's determination to strengthen the anti-graft body during a meeting with visiting UN assistant secretary general Ajay Chhibber at midday. Ajay was accompanied by the UN resident representative Reneta Dessallien, UNDP resident representative Stefan Priesner and UN policy adviser Magnus Lundgren. "The UN delegates congratulated the PM on the holding of free and fair polls and on her party's grand victory in the election. The meeting also discussed strengthening Bangladesh's economy and democratic institutions," Azad later told reporters. The meeting discussed natural disasters, climate change, global temperatures rise and food shortages. The prime minister urged the UN to help Bangladesh to avert food shortages in the future. The meeting also discussed the ACC, Azad said, when Hasina reiterated that her government were against all corrupt practices. "The prime minister said Anti-Corruption Commission has to be strengthened and it should be allowed to work independently so that people believe that anyone resorting to malpractice will be taken to task," said the press secretary. "Since people should always be satisfied about the funds spent on handling corruption, the ACC activities must be transparent and accountable all through. One cannot be expected to be involved in graft while rooting out corruption." She said a special parliamentary committee was reviewing the ordinances enacted by the caretaker government and that they would be made law when they pass the scrutiny of that committee. Earlier, Mirza Zia Ispahani, Pakistani prime minister's special envoy, met Hasina at 10:30am and conveyed greetings from the Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari and prime minister Yousuf Raja Gilani to her. The prime minister told Ispahani it was possible to establish peace in the region by rooting out povertythe common regional problem. Azad said Hasina raised the issue of the former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination and said she herself had survived attempts on her life many a time in the past. She called for concerted regional efforts to curb terrorism. Pakistani High Commissioner Alamgir Babar and PMO office secretary Molla Waheeduzzaman were also present at the meetings. bd
