<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  One feuding faction of Jahangirnagar University's Chhatra League unit have taken control of all the residential halls, continuing to ignore a central committee decision on suspension of its activities on campus. Central leaders of the Awami League-backed student body initially suspended all Chhatra League activities at JU for a month on Jan 18 following clashes with other student bodies. But two factions became involved in violent clashes involving gunfire on Monday before the deadline was over. The central body again announced a further month's suspension of all Bangladesh Chhatra League activities at the university after Monday's clashes. The main BCL group led by the JU unit president and general secretary have now wrested control of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall and Maulana Bhasani Hall from a 'breakaway' BCL faction, thus taking over all the six halls on campus. A gun battle had broken out on Monday between the two groups over the two halls occupied by the breakaway faction. At least five people sustained bullet wounds and 16 others received other injuries during the fighting, said the witnesses. The police raided the two disputed halls Monday night, but Adnan Bhuiyan Ayan and Ajibur Rahman, the leaders of the rebel BCL group, reportedly evaded the raid by fleeing the halls. JU BCL unit president Sohel Parvez and general secretary Mahmud Naser Jony later took over the two halls with their followers. Sohel Parvez told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that they had returned to the two halls "after one and a half years". The students who had been pushed out of the halls for so long were now able to return, he said. "They are showing the police their proper identity cards at the gates." "But we are requesting the other fleeing leaders to return to the halls. We believe in equal position," said Sohel. Classes and exams of a few departments were postponed on Tuesday due to the campus unrest. JU acting registrar Abu Bakar Siddique told bdnews24.com that the administration had not made any decision yet to postpone classes and exams. "The campus is quiet now. The administration is trying to continue with academic activities normally," he said. Ashulia police sub-inspector Aminul Islam told bdnews24.com that JU BCL president Sohel Parvez had filed a case in connection to Monday's incidents, accusing about 50 people. bdnews24.c
