 LONDON, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA Cup holders Zenit St Petersburg began life without influential playmaker Andrei Arshavin by defeating VfB Stuttgart 2-1 in their first knockout round first leg tie on Wednesday. Arshavin, instrumental in Zenit's first European triumph last year, completed a move to Arsenal earlier this month after protracted negotiations with the Premier League side. Zenit edged their home leg with Stuttgart at the Petrovsky stadium with Ukraine international Anatoliy Tymoschuk blasting the Russian side 2-1 ahead in first-half stoppage time with a fierce shot after latching on to Danny's pass. New signing Szabolcs Huszti had fired Zenit ahead on his debut after two minutes, the Hungarian international pouncing on a rebound before Mario Gomez grabbed what could be a crucial away goal following a lengthy run. The competition's leading scorer Vagner Love took his tally to nine this season with a first-half goal in CSKA Moscow's 1-1 draw in Birmingham with Aston Villa. Brazilian Love worked a one-two with strike partner Alan Dzagoyev before advancing to fire past keeper Brad Guzan and hand CSKA a 14th-minute lead. Norwegian striker John Carew capped a sustained spell of Villa pressure to sweep in the equaliser on 69 minutes from Craig Gardner's pass and set up an intriguing second leg next week in Moscow. "We cannot be disappointed but we had our chances to win," Carew told Channel Five television. "The away game will be more difficultwe will have to prepare well but we believe we can still do it." Brazilian coach Zico took charge of CSKA for the first time after replacing Valery Gazzaev who led the Russians to their 2005 UEFA Cup triumph and ended his long association with the club in December. St Etienne, back in Europe this season for the first time in 26 years, continue to defy their poor Ligue 1 form and rekindle memories of their heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. Les Verts, 10-times French champions and beaten 1976 European Cup finalists, secured an impressive 3-1 away win at Olympiakos Piraeus, who had previously gone nine matches unbeaten at home in Europe. Despite being entrenched in a battle to avoid relegation from Ligue 1, St Etienne took the game to Olympiakos and led 2-0 at the interval through Brazilian striker Ilan and midfielder Geoffrey Dernis. A penalty from Predrag Djordjevic gave the hosts hope but Bafetimbi Gomis struck a third in stoppage time. Valencia, the 2004 winners, drew 1-1 in Ukraine against Dynamo Kiev. Tournament favourites AC Milan play away at Werder Bremen in a later kickoff on Wednesday (1935 GMT). Five first leg ties takes place on Thursday. The final is in Istanbul on May 20
