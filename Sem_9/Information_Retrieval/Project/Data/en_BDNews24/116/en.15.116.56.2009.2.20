 MILAN, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of weekend matches in Serie A. Serie A leaders Inter Milan are without suspended defenders Nicolas Burdisso and Cristian Chivu so Walter Samuel and Ivan Cordoba will likely be the centre backs for the game at Bologna on Saturday (1500 GMT). Marco Materazzi has a thigh problem but Patrick Vieira is pushing for a start after recovering from a string of injuries. Coach Jose Mourinho may decide to rotate his team slightly with one eye on Tuesday's Champions League last 16 first leg at home to holders Manchester United. Juventus, nine points adrift in second, have striker Vincenzo Iaquinta back from suspension for Saturday's trip to Palermo (1930) while David Trezeguet is also fit after a knock. Inter, Juve and AS Roma are playing on Saturday to give them extra time to prepare for next week's Champions League games against United, Chelsea and Arsenal. Roma in sixth host Siena (1700) but have doubts over Francesco Totti after media reports said the captain limped out of training with a leg injury. Midfielders Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi are banned. AC Milan's David Beckham, still waiting to hear if his loan move will be made permanent, is poised to return to the starting lineup for Sunday's home game with Cagliari (1400). The England midfielder was on the bench for Wednesday's 1-1 UEFA Cup last 32 first leg draw at Werder Bremen having hurt a calf in last weekend's 2-1 defeat by Inter. Kaka missed the derby because of a foot injury and it looks unlikely he will be fit to face the in-form Sardinians. Defender Giuseppe Biava and midfielder Ivan Juric are suspended for fifth-placed Genoa's trip to Napoli on Sunday (1400). Fourth-placed Fiorentina, beaten 1-0 at home by Ajax in Thursday's UEFA Cup clash, have no new injury worries for Sunday's home game with struggling Chievo (1400)
