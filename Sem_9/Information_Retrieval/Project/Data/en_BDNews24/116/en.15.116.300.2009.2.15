<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnew24.com) - The High Court issued a ruling Sunday against the government and the National Board of Revenue on the legality of imposing VAT on healthcare services. The court ordered the health, finance and law secretaries and the NBR chairman to reply to its rule nisi asking why VAT on healthcare should not be ruled illegal. A HC bench of justices ABM Khairul Huq and Md Abdul Hye gave the order based on a public interest petition lodged by three Supreme Court lawyers Julhasuddin Ahmed, Abdul Bari and Golam Mostafa Laskar. Advocate Monjil Morshed, on behalf of the petitioners, told the court, "By imposing VAT, citizens are being curbed of their right to proper medical care." He also reminded the court that Article 18 of the Constitution states that it is a fundamental duty of the government to develop healthcare. "The VAT law of 1991 mentions medical and healthcare as a sector that should be waived from VAT," added Morshed. bdnew
