<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  German hockey coach Gerhard Peter Rach arrived in Dhaka on Tuesday to discuss his possible appointment as the head coach of the Bangladesh national team. Rach watched a practice match of the national team in the afternoon. He will also observe practice sessions for two more days before he leaves on Thursday. The 60-year-old coach believes Bangladesh have the capability to grab the fourth or fifth place in Asia if their neighbouring India and Pakistan could stay in the top level. Rach said India and Pakistan players are very skilled with the sticks and Bangladesh is no different from them in terms of stick-work. He added that South Korea's game has developed due to their hard work and mental toughness. But they don't have much stick-work like the subcontinent players. "I think Bangladesh should be where Japan, China and Malaysia are now," said Rach, who helped India to finish seventh and fourth in the Olympics and Champions Trophy in 2004. Rach came to know through the Asian Hockey Federation's development officer Taiyeb Ekram and former Indian Hockey Federation general secretary Joytte Kumar that Bangladesh needed a coach. The German also coached Zimbabwe and Kenya in 80's. Besides he was appointed coach at club level in Germany and Spain. Rach said that he first began coaching in his homeland way back in 1972. Rach said he wants at least three months to coach the Bangladesh national team ahead of the Asian Cup in Dubai. BHF joint-secretary Abdur Rashid Shikdar hinted that they would go for a short-term contract. "After our discussions it seems he is interested in Bangladesh hockey and first wants to coach the side up to the Asia Cup," said Shikdar. Shikdar also said that Rach was not thinking of his remuneration and left it up to the federation. "We hope you will know something positive tomorrow," said Shikdar, an Usha Kira Chakra official. Bd
