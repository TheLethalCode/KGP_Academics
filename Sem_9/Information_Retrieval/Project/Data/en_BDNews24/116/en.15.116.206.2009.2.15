<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday dropped prime minister Sheikh Hasina's appeal to cancel the Niko corruption case from the worklist and deferred the final hearing on the barge-mounted power plants corruption case to April 19, an attorney said. The bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Mohammed Raisuddin gave the rulings on a joint appeal by Hasina's lawyer A F M Mesbahuddin and attorney general Mahbubey Alam. The court on Jan. 7 had deferred the final hearing of her appeal for cancellation of these cases until Feb. 15. It had also ordered authorities not harass or arrest her until the cases were resolved. The court on Oct. 27 last year had extended time for the cases as the postponement time was not settled. On Aug. 13 that year, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court orders that the proceedings of the cases should be suspended in the trial courts. The High Court had postponed the proceedings of these two cases on July 7 and ordered the Anticorruption Commission and the government to explain why these cases should not be cancelled. The ACC and the government lodged a case at the Tejgaon Police Station on Sept. 2 , 2008 accusing Hasina of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe in for the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in exchange for permission to set up the power plants during her 1996-2001 days as prime minister . The ACC lodged the Niko corruption case against Hasina and six others at the same police station on Dec. 9, 2008. The case accuses her of awarding the contracts, without inviting bids, for Chhatak, Kamta and Feni gas fields to Canadian oil and gas exploration company Niko Resources Ltd., making the state to count more than Tk 13500 crore. The ACC later pressed charges against Hasina and eight others in the court. b
