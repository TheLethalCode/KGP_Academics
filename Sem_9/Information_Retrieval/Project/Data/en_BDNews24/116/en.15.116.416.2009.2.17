 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities on Tuesday cancelled the allocation of a kiosk and warned four others on charges of breach of regulations at the ongoing Amar Ekushey Book Fair at the Bangla Academy premises. "The Best Way Foundation was allocated a space, as it had said it would display books on Maulana Bhasani that they published, but they did not do that," director general of Bangla Academy, co-organiser of the fair, Prof Mohammad Sahed said. "So their allocation has been cancelled on recommendation of the review committee," he said. He said they warned the four kiosks as they were selling books of other publication houses in violation of book fair's regulation. On the 17th day of the month-long, publication houses brought 95 new titles, most of which are poems and novels, according to academy's public relations department.
