 DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan, Fri Feb 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 20 people and wounded more than 50 during a funeral procession on Friday for a Shia Muslim gunned down a day earlier in a northwestern Pakistani town, police said. Sectarian violence between militant Sunni Muslims and Shia groups has plagued the town of Dera Ismail Khan on the western bank of the Indus river and close to the South Waziristan tribal region, where support runs deep for the Taliban and al Qaeda. "The blast occurred when a funeral procession for a Shia Muslim murdered a day earlier was passing by," said Syed Mohsin Shah, the area's top administrator. Police said they had found the body parts of the suspected bomber. "It's a suicide blast. We have found the severed legs of the suspected bomber," deputy superintendent Sanaullah said. A policeman at Dera Ismail Khan's main hospital said the toll could rise. "We have 20 dead in the hospital and some of the wounded are in critical condition," said a police officer Deen Mohammad, adding that more than 50 people were being treated for wounds. Authorities imposed a curfew in the town, 270 km (170 miles) southwest of the capital, Islamabad. Violence erupted as people enraged by the attack vented their anger by torching vehicles and ransacking shops. Gunfire also broke out briefly. "We have imposed a curfew and called army to quell violence as we fear it could spread to other parts," top government official in the city, Syed Mohsin Shah, told Reuters
