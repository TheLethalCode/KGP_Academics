 NEW DELHI, Feb 15(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The coalition government will put rescuing flagging growth and stemming job losses at the centre of a mini budget on Monday as it aims to woo voters ahead of general elections just weeks away. Acting Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee will present interim spending plans for the 2009/10 fiscal year starting April 1 but they may have a limited shelf life since nationwide elections in the world's biggest democracy must be held by mid-May. Only the government formed after the election can put in place more permanent spending plans. "This interim budget will be more like a party manifesto declaring the coalition's intent of what they would do to drive the economy," said Rajiv Kumar, director at the Indian Council for Research in International Economic Relations (ICRIER). Indian policy makers have scrambled to support the economy from the impact of the global financial crisis, which analysts estimate has helped fuel a blow-out in the federal fiscal deficit to about 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2008/09 from a planned 2.5 percent. Faced with faltering growth, the government has announced two stimulus packages, including extra spending of $4 billion, while for its part the central bank has cut its key lending rate by 350 basis points since October to 5.50 percent. The government has also unveiled plans to borrow 460 billion rupees ($9.45 billion) by the end of the fiscal year in March to fund its stimulus measures and meet extra spending needs. The government estimates that growth in Asia's third-largest economy will slip this fiscal year to 7.1 percent from 9 percent or more in the past three years. Data has already shown the global slowdown is hurting key sectors including exports, housing and manufacturing. The prime minister's economic advisory council expects growth to hold around similar levels in 2009/10, although private economists see that as too optimistic. In its five budgets since 2004, the Congress party-led coalition has raised spending on health, education and rural employment but analysts say the economy has suffered due to a lack of economic reforms. Previous governments have refrained from changing the rates of direct taxes -- such as personal income and corporate taxes -- in interim budgets. But speculation that may change this year mounted after Palaniappan Chidambaram, finance minister until late 2008, said earlier this month that the budget may include some changes in the tax structure and further stimulus measures. Indirect taxes, such as factory gate duties, which do not require parliamentary approval, have been changed during interim budgets in the past. "The key focus will be on checking job losses and the government could waive the 10 percent surcharge on income tax, (but refrain from cutting income tax rates), and cut some indirect taxes," Rajeev Malik, economist at Macquarie Securities said in a research report. The Labour Ministry estimates that about half a million jobs were lost in the December quarter in small business, which account for more than 60 percent of economic activity.
