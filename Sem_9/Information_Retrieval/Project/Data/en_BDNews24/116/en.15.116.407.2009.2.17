 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb killed three people and wounded 13 on Tuesday outside the home of an official who was raising a militia to fight Islamist militants in northwestern Pakistan, witnesses and police said. The bomb attack in the Batta Beir area on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province, targeted the residence of the nazim, or mayor. Nazim Fahim-ur-Rehman, who had been entertaining friends at home, was unhurt. "The explosive device was planted in a car parked near Rehman's house," city police chief Safat Ghayur told Reuters. The blast came a day after the government in the northwest signed a pact with Islamists to introduce Islamic law in the northwestern Swat valley and neighbouring areas in a bid to take the steam out of a Taliban uprising raging since late 2007. Militants have stepped up violent attacks in Pakistan, particularly in the northwest, since August, when government forces launched offensive in Swat and the tribal region of Bajaur on the Afghan border.
