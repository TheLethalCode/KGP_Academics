<TITLE> NBFIs to see foreign loans soon: BB gov </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed says a policy is on the cards to ensure that non-bank financial institutions can secure loans from multinationals, but he is also concerned over the growth of classified loans. "Loan rates from local banks range from 13 to 15 percent at present, which can be as low as 12 to 12.5 percent in the case of overseas lenders," Anis A Khan, chairman of Bangladesh Leasing and Finance Companies Association, told reporters Tuesday. But the Financial Institutions Act 1993 bars them from direct overseas transactions. "Which is why we have asked the central bank to take necessary steps to secure foreign loans," said Anis after a meeting with the central banker. Salehuddin Ahmed, after the talks with executive directors of the country's 29 financial institutions, said such a policy was being formulated. "The NBFIs have also been given instructions and guidelines to reduce their rate of loan defaults," the governor told reporters. According to central bank figures, of the 29 NBFIs, 10 have a default rate of more than 10 percent. According to the latest quarterly account, the overall default rate is 8 percent compared to 6 percent a year ago. "NBFIs operate by taking loans at high interest from banks and that is the reason for the crisis," said the governor. To settle this problem, they made a formal recommendation to the central bank to facilitate the securing of overseas loans at lower rates, said Salehuddin. The governor also said that financial institutions that have yet to do so have again been directed to float shares to raise funds and boost the capital market. Of the 29, 20 have already floated shares to increase their capital. Three have been waived from the requirement and six have yet to issue IPOs despite repeated directions from Bangladesh Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission. "It's very difficult for financial institutions to raise funds and as cost of loans is high here, we want to secure them from overseas institutions," said Anis A Khan. As a result, financial institutions have to take loans from banks or approved foreign exchange currency dealers. "But there isn't a specific guideline in this regard," said Anis. He also said that the six remaining institutions will soon float shares on the capital market. bdnews
