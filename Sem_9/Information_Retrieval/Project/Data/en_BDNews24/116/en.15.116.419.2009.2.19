 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  In a sharp rebuttal to allegations made by several MPs and the prime minister, the Anticorruption Commission has said it is spending on lawyers according to the financial independence it enjoys. "There is no scope for any debate over the money spent by the ACC on lawyers," said colonel Hanif Iqbal, director general of the ACC at a regular press briefing Thursday. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said Tuesday that prime minister Sheikh Hasina during a meeting with UN assistant director general Ajay Chhiber spoke of the money spent by the ACC on lawyers. "The prime minister said that a huge amount of money has been spent by the ACC on hiring lawyers," Azad said. Several MPs recently said the graftbusters were needlessly spending money on attorneys. Iqbal clarified the ACC's liberty in spending money and said, "The Anticorruption Commission also carries out regular audit and so there is no way to conceal any expenditure." He said in the last one and a half years, the ACC spent around Tk 7.74 crore on hiring lawyers and in 2007-2008 fiscal year, it spent Tk 5.11 crore to retain 51 lawyers. "The lawyers appointed in the fiscal year 2007-08 fought 500 cases," said Iqbal. The 51 lawyers include four senior lawyers, 10 lawyers who act as adviser, 22 public prosecutors, one assistant public prosecutor, four lawyers to file writ petition and four advocates on record. "From July 2008 until January 2009, the ACC spent Tk 2.62 lakh on lawyers," he added. Talking about rewards handed out to certain officials before a final verdict at the High Court, Iqbal said, "The ACC hands out awards to investigation officials after a verdict at the trial court." He also said the law did not clearly state what would happen to the reward if the verdict is overturned in the higher court. On the allegation by a few MPs that at certain times the honorarium of the lawyers exceeded the judges', he said, "It would be wrong to compare the fees of a lawyer with that of a government official." The ACC hired lawyers keeping the business interests in perspective, added Iqbal. "In January, 47 charge-sheets have been given against 80 persons in various cases and the ACC lodged cases against 14," said the director general. bdnews24.co
