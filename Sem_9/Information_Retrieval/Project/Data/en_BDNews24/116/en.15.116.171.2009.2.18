<TITLE> Muhith backs more pay for public servants </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering a revised pay scale for Bangladesh Bank employees, among other public servants, in an effort to keep them from jumping to high-paid jobs in the private sector. "I endorse the concept of a separate pay scale for central bank employees," said finance minister AMA Muhith on Wednesday. "The government is mulling separate pay scales for a number of organisations including Bangladesh Bank, BAPEX as well as teachers," Muhith told reporters after the meeting. He said Bangladesh Bank employees had a tendency to switch to better paying jobs with private and foreign banks after gaining minimum experience on the job. For that the central bank suffered a crisis of talent and skills. "To overcome the crisis I think there should be a separate pay scale for our central bank employees," said Muhith. A separate pay scale is also needed for BAPEX, because the workers there do the same. They should also be encouraged by increasing their salaries, said the minister. The government has also taken the same move for the teachers, he said. The finance minister also had some tough words for loan defaulters, after a meeting at the central bank, warning them of "drastic" measures. "I don't want to see loan defaulters getting away. The government is going to get harsh in dealing with them." "I was the first finance minister to identify the 10 top loan defaulters in 1982," said Muhith. The minister said, "I know so-called 'pressure groups' are active in the matter. Maybe it will be tougher dealing with them now than it was in 1982." "But I am going to launch all-out efforts to wipe out defaulters." Asked if ruling party defaulters would get the same treatment, Muhith said, "I've already told you, I will not tolerate any loan defaulters. All of them will be dealt with drastically irrespective of their affiliations." According to Bangladesh Bank data, the total amount of 'classified' loans as of Sept 30 2008 stands at a little over Tk 25,000 crore (Tk 250 billion). bdnews24.com/
