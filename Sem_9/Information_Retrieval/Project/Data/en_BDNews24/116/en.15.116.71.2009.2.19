 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) - Gazi Tank Cricketers returned to winning ways in the Premier Division Cricket League after they handed Young Pegasus a five-wicket defeat on Thursday at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. On the other hand, City Club's dismal run continued with a fourth straight defeat as Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan beat them by six wickets at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Elsewhere, Surjo Tarun Club recorded their third triumph with a slim 16-run win over Cricket Coaching School, who stunned Gazi Tank in the previous round, at the BKSP ground. Gazi Tank vs Pegasus Openers Imrul Kayes and Anwar Hossain struck fifties as Gazi Tank raced to 220-5 with 20 balls to spare in reply to Pegasus' moderate 219-9 in 50 overs. Imrul and Anwar put on 99 runs for the opening stand before the latter fell for exact 50 off 69 balls that included five fours. Imrul and Nafis Iqbal (30) took Gazi Tank to 167 before the left-handed opener was dismissed by Abul Bashar for 78, triggering a mini collapse and Gazi Tank were reduced to 189-4 in 43 overs. Imrul struck seven fours and two sixes in his 110-ball knock. Nayeem Islam (15) and Pravanjan Mullik (4), however, remained unbeaten to steer their side home. Earlier, electing to bat, Pegasus posed a modest total, riding on 51 from Humayun Kabir. Openers Arif Reza (32) and Rahat Sadek (31) were only other double-digit scorers while Enamul Haq Jr returned with 4-47. City Club vs BKSP Chasing City Club's paltry total of 188-9 in 50 overs, BKSP cruised to 189-4 in 40.5 overs, thanks to a fine 75 from opener Asif Ahmed. Asif along with Mominul Haq contributed 72 runs for the third wicket after BKSP were reduced to 43-2 inside nine overs as Shafaq Al Zabir dismissed Shaikat Ali and Atiqur Rahman cheaply. Mominul was removed by Lalmon for 38 leaving the side at 115-3 in 28 overs, but Asif along with Zabid Hossain took the side to verge of triumph before Asif was dismissed by Lalmon. Asif left the side at 174-4 and Zabid (43) and Tanveer Haider (4) propelled BKSP home. Earlier, Surajullah Khadem and Lalmon Hossain put on 50 and 40 respectively to give the City Club bowlers something to defend. Surjo Tarun vs CCS CCS could manage 228-9 in the stipulated 50 overs after Surjo Tarun opted to bat first and racked up a fighting total of 244-9. CCS were 99-5 at one stage before tail-ender Nizamuddin struck a gutsy 76 not out along with Monowar Hossain, who also made a quickfire 30 off 34 balls. The pair raised hopes of a third triumph after putting on 77 runs for the ninth wicket, but Monowar's run out ended any chance of that happening. Opener Sandeep Sharman was Taurn's top scorer, who made a patient 64 off 114 balls with the help of five fours. Besides, Sanjamul Islam, Junaed Siddique and Sabbir Hossain chipped in with 38, 35 and 31 respectively. bd
