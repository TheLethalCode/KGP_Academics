 MILAN, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham said on Sunday it would be difficult for him to return to Los Angeles Galaxy if his permanent move to AC Milan does not materialise. The England midfielder, on a two-month loan at Milan, wants to stay in Italy but Galaxy said on Friday that he must go back to Los Angeles after a Major League Soccer deadline to complete the transfer passed. "I've said I want to stay here and if I do go back then it will be a bit difficult but we'll have to wait and see what happens," Beckham told reporters after his side's 2-1 defeat by Inter Milan. Milan have said they still hope to sign the 33-year-old full-time irrespective of the MLS deadline. Asked if there might be an outcome in the next few days, Beckham said: "I don't know. It is out of my hands and they'll be talking in the next week or two. "Hopefully things will go the way I want them." Beckham was substituted early in the second half because of a slight calf injury but enjoyed playing in a third big European derby having had the same experience for Manchester United and Real Madrid. "They are all huge games, they are all the biggest games in football. I'm proud to have played one in England, one in Spain and one in Italy but it would have been better to win it," he said. Third-placed Milan are now 11 adrift of leaders Inter and Beckham acknowledged their title hopes could be over. "We are quite far behind, we were quite far behind before the game started and we needed to win it," he said. "But you never know, this league is up and down. There obviously a chance but it is a slim chance.
