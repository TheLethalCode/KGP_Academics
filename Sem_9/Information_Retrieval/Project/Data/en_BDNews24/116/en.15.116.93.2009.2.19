 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)At least half a dozen prominent US journalists have joined the Obama administration, raising questions about their professional integrity from the conservative camp. Journalists, including some of those who have jumped ship, say it is better to have a solid job in government than a shaky job  or none at all  in an industry that is domestically on the decline. But conservative critics answer with the question: Would journalists be making the same career choices if John McCain had beaten Barack Obama in November? "Obama bails out more media water-carriers," conservative blogger Michelle Malkin wrote upon hearing that the Chicago Tribune's Washington bureau chief Jill Zuckman is taking a job with the Obama administration. Blogs at both the Weekly Standard and the National Review, two prominent conservative publications, are pointing to a "revolving door" that spins between the media and the Obama camp. Some former journalists, who have joined the government, vehemently deny that. "I began looking around for a new job last month after my company [The Tribune] drastically cut staff," Zuckman told The Politico. She said she had no plans to go to the administration  until she heard about an opening under Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a former Republican representative. As for other reporters making similar moves, Zuckman said that she didn't think there would be so many "if the industry were stable." But it isn't, and there are. On Tuesday, Scott Shepard of the Cox newspaper group joined Sen. John Kerry's office as a speechwriter, becoming the second journalist this year to take a job under the Massachusetts Democrat. Doug Frantz, former managing editor of the Los Angles Times, is now chief investigator under the Kerry-helmed Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A week before Zuckman announced that she's headed for Obama's Transportation Department, her Tribune colleague Peter Gosselin signed on as speechwriter for Obama's treasury secretary, Tim Geithner. In December, Jay Carney left his job as Time's Washington bureau chief to become Vice President Joe Biden's communications director. Warren Bass, another top flight journalist, left the Washington Post to write speeches and advise Dr. Susan Rice, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Linda Douglas, a veteran legal correspondent for the ABC News, joined the Obama campaign back in May and is expected to become assistant secretary for public affairs in the department of Health and Human Services. On Monday, Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism published a report on "The New Washington Press Corps," grim statistics confirming the high rate at which regional newspapers are shuttering their D.C. bureaus while niche and foreign outlets grow. Of the journalists flocking to government jobs, Pew Project Director Tom Rosenstiel says: "There's no mystery here, and I don't think the key to this is ideological as much as economic. The newspaper industry is suffering mightily." To allay criticism about his new role in government, Doug Franz said: "I didn't leave journalism easily and I'll always think of myself as a reporter. Frantz isn't alone in downplaying the partisan aspect of his new job. Maybe it's based on a lifetime of nonpartisan conditioning, but many of the reporters who've made the leap to government seem hesitant to admit that they're no longer impartial observers. "This is a Democratic administration; we're obviously on that side of the aisle, but I don't see this as a partisan job at all," Carney told the New York Times recently. Al Hunt, the executive editor for Bloomberg News, said that making the switch used to be a "very weighty" decision  and that it's not anymore. "It's a sad commentary on the state of the business," Hunt said, adding that people have "got to put food on the table." He acknowledged that journalists weren't exactly flocking to government work when George W. Bush took office in 2001, but he said that the industry factors were different then. No one was seriously predicting in February 2001 that large cities in the United States might be without daily newspapers by the time the year was out.
