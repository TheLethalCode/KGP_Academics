<TITLE> Swann puts West Indies in a spin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ST JOHN'S, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Graeme Swann's off-spin proved the undoing of West Indies as England took command of the third test by bowling out the hosts for 285 on the third day on Tuesday. England lost captain Andrew Strauss in reaching 31 for one in their second innings at the close, a lead of 312 runs with nine wickets remaining. Swann became the first England off-spinner in 10 years to take five wickets in a test innings, completing figures of five for 57 on a ground where slow bowlers usually have little joy with his well-flighted and positive bowling. Ramnaresh Sarwan's stylish 94 was the only bright spot in a largely poor West Indies batting display but he was one of a number of batsmen who got out to loose strokes. Chasing England's 566 for nine declared, West Indies could ill-afford any recklessness but although they may have feared England's pace bowlers being able to make the most of the ridge on the wicket it was Swann who proved their downfall. After West Indies resumed on 55 for one overnight, the spinner made two breakthroughs before lunch. Opener Devon Smith and nightwatchman Daren Powell resisted well for over an hour before left-hander Smith was bowled by Swann playing an awful shot across the line. Powell, normally a tailender, produced his longest test innings before he edged a well-flighted, turning Swann delivery to Paul Collingwood at slip. SHARPLY AWAY Ryan Hinds helped Sarwan add 70 for the fourth wicket until Andrew Flintoff moved a ball sharply away to have the left-hander caught for 27 by a diving Matt Prior behind the stumps. Then Shivnarine Chanderpaul, so often the anchor of West Indian batting, made just one before he edged an outswinging half-volley from Broad straight to Prior. Sarwan batted beautifully, timing the ball crisply, but having survived a risky single when Stuart Broad missed the stumps with the batsman stranded, he had another escape when Broad spilled a caught and bowled opportunity. Just six runs short of his century, Sarwan came down the track in an attempt to drive Swann over the top only to loop the ball to Flintoff at mid-on who snaffled the chance. With his next ball Swann dismissed Denesh Ramdin, gleefully taking a caught and bowled from a poor full-toss. Flintoff removed Brendan Nash before Swann picked up his fifth wicket by trapping Sulieman Benn lbw. With a tired bowling attack, Strauss decided to bat again and force West Indies to try and save the game batting last. Strauss did not make it through the session, though, edging Fidel Edwards to Devon Smith at second slip. Nightwatchman James Anderson entered the record books with his 46th test innings without making a duck but he was lucky to get through to the close as he was dropped by Hinds at third slip off Edwards. The last off-spinner to take five wickets in a test innings for England was Peter Such against Australia in Sydney in 1999
