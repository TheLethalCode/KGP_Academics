 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines topped the point table with three straight triumphs and holders Abahani Limited returned to winning ways, but title contenders Mohammedan SC went down for the first time in the Premier Division Cricket League on Saturday. An unbeaten fifty from Shakib Al Hasan powered Biman to a convincing seven-wicket win over Partex SC at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. Pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza claimed four scalps to guide Abahani to a 69-run win over Young Pegasus Club at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Arman Hossain struck a superb century to propel Victoria SC to an emphatic eight-wicket win over Mohammedan at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Biman vs Partex Shakib, the world's best ODI all-rounder, claimed two wickets and later struck an unbeaten 51 off 46 balls to take Biman to 159 for three in 33.2 overs after Partex made 153 for nine in 50 overs. Openers Nazmus Sadat and Javed Omar gave the national flag carrier a fine start, contributing 45 runs before Sadat was out for a 19-ball 29. One-down Jahurul Haq (15) also departed shortly before opener Javed along with Shakib took the side to the verge of win, adding 71 runs for the third wicket. Javed was just three short of a half-century when he was stumped off an Omar Faruque delivery. Gritty Javed consumed 108 balls and clubbed six fours in his 47-run knock. Shakib smashed 51 off 46 balls with four fours and three sixes to take the side home. Earlier, put in to bat first, Partex's batsmen struggled to find their feet as pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin ran through the top order to return four for 24. Pakistani middle-order batsman Rashid Hanif topscored with 33 off 77 balls. Abahani vs Pegasus Pace duo Mashrafee (4/25) and Subhashis Roy (3/16) shared seven wickets as Young Pegasus slumped to 106 all out in 36.2 overs, chasing Abahani's paltry 175 all out in 47.2 overs. After being bundled out for 105 against Gazi Tanks in their previous match, Abahani batsmen again failed, with Indian Venu Gopal Rao scoring highest 37 runs. Captain Mashrafee, batting at number eight, played a 29-ball 24 before Abahani collapsed to 175 all out, raising the spectre of another defeat. Pacemen Mashrafee and Subhashis, however, made things difficult for Pegasus, who having been reduced to 44 for five never recovered. Ruvin Peiris stuck to the crease make 37 off 77 balls, but he hardly got any support from other Pegasus players. MSC vs Victoria Asked to bat first, Mohammedan made 242 for seven in 50 overs, thanks to fifties from opener Nasiruddin Faruque and middle-order batsmen Pankaj Joshi and Faisal Hossain Dickens. Faruque and Pankaj took Mohammedan to 138 for four from a precarious 33 for three before Faruque was trapped leg before by Pakistani Akil Arshad for 61 off 96 balls. Afterwards, Pankaj pairing with Faisal added 96 runs for the fifth wicket, but Pankaj fell short of the crease, leaving the side at 134 for five in 48 overs. Pankaj smashed 82 off 120 balls with eight fours and one six. Faisal also followed Pankaj to be run out for 67 off 43 balls, studded with four sixes and as many fours. Victoria got off to a fine start in their chase with a 61-run opening stand before Amit Majumdar was run out for 29. However, opener Arman along with Ashraful Aziz blunted Mohammedan bowlers to keep them at bay, contributing 100 runs for the second wicket. Mohammedan captain Suhrawardi Shuvo broke the stand, trapping Aziz leg before for 50 off 73 balls that included five fours and one six. Arman and Akil, however, kept things under control to propel their side o 244 for two in 43.2 overs, giving Victoria their first win in three matches. The wicketkeeper, Arman, struck exactly 100 off 99 balls with the help of six fours and two sixes, while Arashad was 46 not out facing 57 balls
