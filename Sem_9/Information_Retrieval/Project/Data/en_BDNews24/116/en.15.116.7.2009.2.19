 MINGORA, Pakistan,Thu Feb 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen killed a journalist in Pakistan's northwestern Swat valley, his brother said on Thursday, casting a pall over hopes for peace in the restive region after the government struck a deal with Islamists. Mohammad Musa Khankhel, 28, a reporter for Geo News television channel and The News daily, was killed on Wednesday evening at a peace march led by radical cleric Maulana Sufi Mohammad. The cleric, who signed an agreement with the government on Monday to restore Islamic sharia law in the region, was on his way to plead with Taliban militants to shun violence. "He was picked up by unidentified people after he covered the peace march," the brother, Mohammad Essa Khankhel, told Reuters. A Taliban spokesman in Swat condemned the killing of Musa Khankhel saying "it is the work of those forces who want to sabotage peace efforts in Swat." Musa was the fourth journalist who has been killed in violence-ridden Swat over the past one year. Hopes of peace in Swat soared after Mohammad, who has been at the vanguard of a long struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in Swat, reached agreement with the government on Monday. The cleric Mohammad, who spent six years in jail for leading thousands of fighters to Afghanistan in a bid to help the Taliban repel U.S.-backed forces in 2001, was freed last year with hopes he would persuade his even more radical son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, to halt an insurrection. Pakistan is fighting militants on several fronts in the tribal areas, well-known sanctuaries for al Qaeda and the Taliban, and officials say a compromise with Mohammad was the best option to pacify Swat at least. Several journalists have been killed in covering the conflict in the tribal areas. The Paris-based media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders (BSF), in its annual report in December ranked Pakistan, the Philippines and Mexico as the most dangerous countries for reporters after Iraq
