 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)The finance minister had some tough words for loan defaulters on Wednesday, warning them of "drastic" measures. "I don't want to see loan defaulters getting away. The government is going to get harsh in dealing with them," AMA Muhith told reporters after a meeting at Bangladesh Bank. "I was the first finance minister to identify the 10 top loan defaulters in 1982," said the finance minister. The minister said, "I know so-called 'pressure groups' are active in the matter. Maybe it will be tougher dealing with them now than it was in 1982." "But I am going to launch all-out efforts to wipe out defaulters." Asked if ruling party defaulters would get the same treatment, Muhith said, "I've already told you, I will not tolerate any loan defaulters. All of them will be dealt with drastically irrespective of their affiliations." According to Bangladesh Bank data, the total amount of 'classified' loans as of Sept 30 2008 stands at a little over Tk 25,000 crore (Tk 250 billion). On the government's deliberations over revising the pay scale of Bangladesh Bank officials and employees, the minister said, "I quite endorse the concept of introducing a separate pay scale for central bank officials and employees." "The government is mulling separate pay scales for a number of organisations and departments including the Bangladesh Bank, BAPEX as well as education ministry officials, employees and teachers," said the minister. bdnews24.c
