 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court sent BNP MP for Chandpur-4, Harun-ur Rashid, to jail Thursday in a case involving charges of fraud and defamation. The BNP lawmaker, against whom an arrest warrant was issued on Feb 8, surrendered to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court in the morning. The magistrate, Mohammad Rashed Kabir, rejected his bail prayer and ordered him to jail instead. Aspiring BNP candidate for Chandpur-4, Abdul Mannan, filed the case against Rashid on Dec 23. According to the case details, the Election Commission cancelled Mannan's nomination ahead of the Dec 29 elections after Rashid alleged that the former's degree certificate from the private Royal University was fake. Mannan in turn accused Rashid of submitting a fake document to the EC, with false signatures of Royal University officials, to support his objection against Mannan's nomination. Mannan, who is claiming Tk 5 crore in damages, said Rashid's false allegation was defamatory. bdnew
