<TITLE> Village courts in the offing: Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government is going to establish village courts to reduce case backlog and give the rural arbitration bodies an administrative form, the local government minister said. "A process has already begun though issues like structures and people in charge have not been finalised," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters at his office Tuesday. "The village courts will not accept any criminal cases and only family-related issues will be solved here," said the minister. The village court, he said, aimed to give a permanent structural format to the rural arbitration bodies. Earlier, three teams led by visiting UN coordinator Ajay Chhibber, co-chairman of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission Lord Eric Avebury, and chief of the European Commission in Bangladesh Stefan Frowen met the minister. Talking about the meetings, Ashraful said, "With Stefan Frowen the discussion was on development programmes and the implementation of the government's electoral manifesto." Recommendations were made by the European Commission on how the government should work for the implementation of the manifesto. With the UN team, the discussion was on local government administration, added the minister. "They wanted to know how education, local government and other administration will be brought under Upazila administration." Talking about the possibility of dissolving the local government commission formed during the caretaker government, the minister said they were not accepting all the ordinances of the emergency government. "Initially, we are accepting the electoral and economic ordinances passed during the caretaker government," he observed. Since the local government commission was not linked to election or finance, it has not been kept on the primary list, Ashraful said, declining to confirm its dissolution. "When we were in power before, we formed the local government commission and the present commission may be formed in that format." In talks about Chittagong Hill Tracts, the implementation of the peace agreement and the land rights of the people of the hills regions were discussed, said Sultana Kamal, member of the International Commission on Chittagong Hill Tracts and a former adviser to the caretaker government. Reiterating the government's desire to implement the peace deal, Ashraful said, "Within the next five years this matter will be resolved positively." b
