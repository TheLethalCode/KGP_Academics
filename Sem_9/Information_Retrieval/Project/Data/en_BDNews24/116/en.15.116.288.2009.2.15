 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistani Shahbuz Butt struck a stroke-filled century to guide Cricket Coaching School to a shock 53-run victory over star-studded Gazi Tank Cricketers in the Premier Division Cricket League at Narayaganj Osmani Stadium on Sunday. Elsewhere, fifties from Anhoor Newaz and Mehrab Hossain Junior helped Old DOHS beat Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) by 27 runs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium while Surjo Tarun Club recorded a 91-run win over City Club at the BKSP ground. CCS vs Gazi Tank Powered by Shahbuz's superb 156 not out, CCS, who were put in to bat, posted a challenging total of 285-4 in 50 overs. After opener Elias Sunny (0) was removed off the only fourth delivery, Shahbuz added 92, 99 and 86 runs for the second, third and fourth wicket stands respectively. Opener Uttam Kumar (37), two-down Shuvagoto Hom (39) and Nizamuddin Ripon (33) gave him good company along the way. Shahbuz smashed 17 fours and two sixes in his 162-ball sterling knock. In reply, Mohammad Ashraful's Gazi Tank, who had previously beaten holders Abahani, could manage 232-9 after some tight bowling from Elias Sunny (3/37), Biswanath Halder (2/39) and Nizamuddin (2/46). Despite the early loss of Imrul Kayes, opener Mithun Chowdhury (45), one-down Anwar Hossain (41) and Indian Pravanjan Mullick (55) gave Gazi Tank a fine start, but the middle order failed to keep the momentum. Ashraful made a 36-ball 21 before the Bangladesh captain was bowled by Biswanath. Nayeem Islam struck 36 not out but it was not enough to see Gazi Tank in home. DOHS vs BKSP Abul Hassan (3/29) and Monir Hossain (3/33) shared six wickets as Old DOHS dismissed BKSP for 178 in 48.5 overs after making 205 in 49.5 overs. Opting to bat, DOHS were reduced to 15-2 in four overs however Anhoor Newaz and Mehrab Hossain held their nerve contributing 91 for the third wicket. Both batsmen were eventually run out but not before they completed their respective half-centuries. Newaz made 51 while Mehrab scored exactly 50. Tail-ender Monir Hossain made a rapid 31 to take DOHS past the 200-run mark. BKSP's reply fell 28 runs after middle order Mominul Haq scored highest with 37. Surjo Tarun vs City Club Chasing Surjo Tarun's 241-9 in 50 overs, City Club were skittled out for 150 in 41.4 overs after Shaklain Sajib, Sabbir Rahman and Sanjamul Islam took two wickets each. Hannan Sarkar was the most successful Tarun batsman hammering 70 off 95 balls studded with four fours and a six. Besides, opener Shandeep Sharma (33), Junaed Siddique (31), Rajin Saleh (23) and Sabbir Rahman (21) were the other notable scorers. City Club opener Rashel Al Mamun contributed 42 while middle order batsmen Serajul Alam Khadem added 24 and Lalmon Hossain 22 respectively. bd
