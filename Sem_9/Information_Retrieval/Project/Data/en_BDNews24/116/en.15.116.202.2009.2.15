<TITLE> Barua to look into 'plastics park' proposal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)The government may consider setting up an industrial park exclusively for plastics manufacturers, the industries minister said Sunday. Dilip Barua told a meeting with the Bangladesh Plastic Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association he would look into the proposal for a 50 acre industrial park or township. Bangladesh produces plastic wares worth about Tk 4,000 crore annually, BPGMEA president Md Jashim Uddin told the meeting. "Direct exports stand at about Tk 600 crore, and exports through backward linkages bring in another Tk 1,200 crore," he said. "And the government earns around Tk 1,200 crore as revenue from the sector," said the association chief. The minister also assured the industry body that the next industrial policy would be the most comprehensive in the country's history, incorporating proposals from all concerned ministries and government departments. "We have never had a comprehensive industry policy, though we could say we have had 'working' policies," Barua. The BPGMEA team pointed to the crying lack of coordination amongst government ministries and agencies and underscored its priority. "We find the BOI approving proposals in some cases while the environment ministry vetoes them, putting entrepreneurs on the backfoot," said the association's general secretary Md Shamim Ahmed. "To address such confusions, all orders relating to a proposal must be issued by a single authority, which should be the industries ministry." Barua assured greater coordination in the future. "The policy to be formulated has been envisaged to ensure coordination between the Board of Investment, ministry of environment, other concerned ministries and all government departments involved in industrialisation." The minister also highlighted 'non-cooperative' attitudes as a major deterrent to industrialisation. "For example, foreign investors here face harassment and non-cooperation when they approach the BOI for visa extensions and so on, which affects industry adversely." bdnews
