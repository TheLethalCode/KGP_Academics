<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Thu Feb 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai was forced to postpone a visit to Pakistan on Thursday, due to snow in the Afghan capital. Karzai had been due to meet Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani during his short trip to Pakistan. "He's not coming today. The new date will be announced later," a Pakistani foreign ministry official told Reuters. He said the new schedule might be announced after Zardari returns from a four-day visit to China commencing on Friday. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the key allies of the United States in the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban and both of them will be sending their foreign ministers to Washington next week to take part in a US policy review of the region ordered by President Barack Obama. The review is to be completed before a NATO summit in April. Obama's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, visited both countries as well as India in his first trip to the region this month. Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have been troubled by cross-border incursions of the militants from sanctuaries on Pakistani side of the border, but ties have improved since a civilian government came into power in Pakistan last year. Zardari visited Kabul last month
