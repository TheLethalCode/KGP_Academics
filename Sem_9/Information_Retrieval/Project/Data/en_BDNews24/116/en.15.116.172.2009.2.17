<TITLE> Chaos over MPs' Upazila role </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Food minister Abdur Razzaq on Tuesday came under fire from the treasury bench for comment that the MPs' role in the Upazila was "controversial". The House turned heated for more than five minutes as almost all of the MPs began shouting as the minister contended there should be a "coordinated involvement" of members of parliament in development works at Upazila level. The MPs were so loud that Speaker Abdul Hamid and the minister had to scream at the top of his voice to stop them. Razzaq made the comment during the question-answer session for the ministers. Awami League MP Atiur Rahman Atik wanted to know whether the government would cancel a order detaching the local MPs from Upazila development work. "Involving the MPs into the local development work is a controversial issue," the minister said, in response to a question from actress-turned-MP Sarah Begum Kabori. "Members of the civil society insist the MPs' role be limited only in law-making, and the local representatives do the development work," the minister said, sparking off instant protests from angry MPs. "Please let the minister finish. Listen to him first," the speaker pleaded, but barely anybody listened. A good number of MPs, speaking without microphone, were heard saying that they must be associated with the local development work. "Please, let me finish my speech. I am not done yet," the minister said. The speaker tried again and failed. The chaos continued for over five minutes. The prime minister, Shiekh Hasina, was present in the House when her party MPs raised their voice against her cabinet colleague. "The local MPs must have involvement in the local development activities," the minister said after the MPs agreed to hear him. "The senators of the US, MPs in Britain, Canada, Australia have offices at the local level. The local MPs cannot stay away from the development activities in the local level." "I have studied in the US. The senators there recommend the enrolment of students in the schools." said Razzaq. The MPs at this stage were happy and thumbed their desks in approval. "For the first time, I enjoyed being in the House," speaker Abdul Hamid said. The military-installed caretaker government amended the Upazila law of 1998, leaving no room for MPs to play any role in local development activities. bdn
