 Barisal, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  Eight bodies were recovered and over 40 passengers were still missing some 11 hours after a launch capsized in the Kirtankhola river in Barisal Thursday, said officials. "The sunken launch was lifted at around 5:15pm, with the bodies of three women, one child and three men inside it," Barisal metropolitan police commissioner M Akber Ali said. The body of a dead woman, identified as Dipty Dey, 30, had been recovered from the river soon after the accident. The identity of the other deceased was yet to be confirmed, said police at around 5.30pm. "On the basis of a list by rescue workers of passengers that were on board the launch, we're estimating that some 43 are still missing," said Barisal deputy commissioner Mushfiq Ahmed Shamim. The ML Happy, heading towards Patarhat from Barisal, capsized at around 6:30am after a sand-laden cargo vessel hit it at Beltala, some three kilometres out from the district down. The worried families of those missing have complained of a slow rescue operation. bdnews24.com/c
