 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Monday awarded the death sentence for the brutal rape and murder of Rehala, a young garment factory worker, in 2004. Judge AKM Mostafa Dewan, of a special tribunal for prevention of women and children repression, sentenced the fugitive 'Liton' to death and fined him Tk 1 lakh. Another three accused in the case, 'Delwar', 'Kabir' and Fazar Ali, were acquitted. State counsel Abdul Qayyum told bdnews24.com after the verdict, "If the investigation was done properly none would have been acquitted." "The investigation officer did not make efforts to properly identify Liton's accomplices," he said. Savar police filed the case on Sept. 1, 2004, under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act. The case details describe the horrific crime of August 2004 in which the young victim met co-worker Liton on the way home from an outing to the zoo. Liton offered to drop her home by rickshaw. The accused raped and stabbed Rahela, later setting her alight with the help of his accomplices. They left her for dead in a wooded area behind Jahangirnagar University's Mosharraf Hossain Hall. Locals discovered Rahela three days later, still fighting for her life. Savar police rushed her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where she died 26 days later. Before her death she gave a statement to magistrate Mofidur Rahman, but she could not identify all of her attackers. Three accomplices were charge-sheeted along with Liton the same year. bdnews24
