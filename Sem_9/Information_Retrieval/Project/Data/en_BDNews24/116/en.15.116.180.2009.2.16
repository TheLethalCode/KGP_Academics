 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan is all for a South Asian taskforce against terrorism proposed by Dhaka, the president's special envoy said Monday. Mirza Zia Ispahani, the special envoy who came to Dhaka earlier in the day on a three-day visit, met foreign minister Dipu Moni and hailed the move to form the taskforce. He, however, said the trial for war crimes committed during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan had better not be held "right at this moment". "Good idea. It is a new idea," Ispahani said when asked whether Islamabad would cooperate in forming the regional anti-terror taskforce. "We have discussed this at the meeting (with the foreign minister). It is a very good idea," the envoy said. A foreign ministry spokesperson told bdnews24.com after the meeting, "The envoy has discussed the issue of forming South Asian taskforce with the foreign minister." "Pakistan is a victim of terrorism. They appreciated the idea," the spokesperson said. The special envoy said Bangladesh and Pakistan should move forward to cement the bilateral relations. "I think we should now think of moving forward. We should not go into this (trying the war criminals) right at this moment," Ispahani said, when asked if Pakistan would cooperate Dhaka in trying war crimes. "We have so many other issues to cooperate with Bangladesh," he said. "No discussion," Ispahani said in response to a question on whether he had discussed the issue of trial of war criminals. The special envoy is set to meet prime minister Sheikh Hasina Tuesday to convey president Asif Ali Zardari's felicitation to the new government.
