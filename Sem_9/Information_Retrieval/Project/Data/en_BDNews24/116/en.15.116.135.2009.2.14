 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition party BNP will not approve any ordinances of the previous caretaker government in parliament, except those passed for elections and routine work, the party's secretary general said on Saturday. "BNP will not approve any other ordinances of the caretaker government, except those that were passed to hold the election and continue routine works in line with the Article 58 (D) of the Constitution," Khandaker Delwar Hossain said after a meeting of the party's national standing committee. The meeting, chaired by BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, discussed all 122 ordinances of the caretaker government to be placed before the House. Another standing committee member MK Anwar said "the country's top lawyers" were also against approving the other ordinances of the interim government, except those related to holding elections and continuing routine works. Delwar said: "We've said earlier that the caretaker government came to power declaring a state of emergency as part of a joint local-foreign conspiracy,". "The caretaker government stayed in power extra-constitutionally," he said. "Even after that we participated in the general election, but the (Awami League-led) grand-alliance resorted to massive rigging in the polls." Khaleda Zia resumed a meeting of the party's standing committee on Saturday, on the "overall political situation of the country". The meeting, which took off where a previous meeting left off last week, was held at the chairperson's Gulshan office from 7.30-9.30pm, said BNP's office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. "The overall political condition of the country was reviewed at the meeting, resuming from the one that was adjourned on February 10 last, " Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Khaleda convened the 'urgent meeting' of the party's top policy making forum last Tuesday. The meeting had discussed the political situation of the country and international issues, including the visit of Indian external affairs minister and the issue of Indian transit, said BNP leaders after last Tuesday's meeting. The members of the standing committee beside the BNP chairperson are: M Saifur Rahman, Khandakar Delwar Hossain, Khondakar Mosharraf Hossain, Abdul Matin Chowdhury, R. A Gani, Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Moudud Ahmed, Khondakar Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Lt Gen (retd) Mahbubur Rahman and M Shamsul Islam. bdnews24.c
