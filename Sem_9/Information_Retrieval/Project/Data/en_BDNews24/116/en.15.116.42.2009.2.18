<TITLE> Some protests set for Clinton's Indonesian visit </TITLE>

 JAKARTA, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Small-scale protests were expected in Indonesia on Wednesday ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the world's most populous Muslim nation and Southeast Asia's biggest economy. But the visit is generally expected to go smoothly given relatively good government-to-government relations and many Indonesians' view of Clinton's boss President Barack Obama as something of a favourite son. Clinton is due to arrive in the Indonesian capital from Japan on Wednesday afternoon on the second leg of an Asian tour also taking in South Korea and China. The US Secretary of State called on Tuesday for coordinated action to revive the global economy at a news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone. Her visit to Indonesia is in line with Obama's desire to forge a better US relationship with the Muslim world, where many of the policies of former president George W. Bush's administration, including the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, were deeply unpopular. Indonesia was no exception to that, but Washington aided Jakarta in efforts to quash its own violent domestic militants, Bush lifted sanctions on military aid and sales imposed over human rights issues, and there was cooperation in other areas. And when it comes to the new U.S. administration, many Indonesians are proud of the fact Obama lived in Jakarta for four years when he was a child, and they enthusiastically rooted for his election. However, while most Indonesian Muslims are moderate, the country has a small, radical fringe. About 100 Indonesians from a hardline group, Hizbut Tahrir, protested against Clinton's visit outside the US embassy in central Jakarta on Tuesday, some arguing the visit was aimed at dividing Muslims. Another group, Laskar Maftuh Fauzi, planned to hold a march of about 500 people to the US embassy and Presidential palace in Jakarta, according to online news service Detik.com. The police have deployed 2,800 officers in the capital for Clinton's visit. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, seeking a second term this year, is keen to showcase Indonesia's stability since its transformation from an autocracy under former President Suharto -- who was forced to resign in 1998 -- to a boisterous democracy. Clinton is due to arrive at an airport in the suburbs of Jakarta often used by the military and to meet Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda on Wednesday and President Yudhoyono on Thursday. She will also visit the Jakarta-based headquarters of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The United States is Indonesia's second-biggest export destination after Japan, but Jakarta is concerned over a slide in exports of commodities such as palm oil, rubber and nickel to developed economies. Indonesia also wants a bigger role in world affairs, notably in the Middle East, given its core position in ASEAN, its population of 226 million, and its strategic location straddling key trade routes. J. Stapleton Roy, a former US ambassador to Indonesia, China and Singapore, said it was "unprecedented" for a new secretary of state to include Southeast Asia on an initial trip along with Japan, South Korea and China. "It's a very positive sign ... it shows not only is the United States attaching priority to Asia, but it's attaching priority to Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia," Roy told a panel discussion in Jakarta this week
