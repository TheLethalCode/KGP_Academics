<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Raul surpassed Alfredo di Stefano's record as Real Madrid's all-time top scorer with two goals in a 4-0 thrashing of Sporting Gijon that cut Barcelona's lead at the top of Spain's Primera Liga to 10 points. In Italy, a controversial Adriano goal helped Serie A leaders Inter Milan to a 2-1 victory over AC Milan which all but ended their city rivals' title hopes. SPAIN Raul set a Real Madrid scoring record for the champions, surpassing di Stefano's tally of 307 by two with a double at Sporting. Marcelo and Klaas Jan Huntelaar bagged one apiece. The 4-0 scoreline cut Barcelona's lead down to 10 points in the Primera Liga and extended Real's winning streak to eight matches. Real were given their opportunity after Barca had to come from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 away to Real Betis on Saturday. Samuel Eto'o scored both goals taking his total for the season to 23. Sevilla climbed to third with 41 points, nine short of Real, after two late goals from Frederic Kanoute delivered a 2-0 win away at bottom club Espanyol. ITALY Inter Milan beat AC Milan 2-1 in an electric derby to move nine points clear at the top and 11 clear of their third-placed city rivals. Adriano used an arm to score Inter's opener before Dejan Stankovic doubled their lead before halftime. Alexandre Pato pulled one back for Milan with 20 minutes to go and they could easily have equalised with substitute Filippo Inzaghi having an effort ruled out for offside. Second-placed Juventus drew 1-1 at home to Sampdoria while Fiorentina went fourth after Adrian Mutu scored a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw at rivals Genoa, who had been 3-0 up with 10 men. AS Roma's good run came to an end with a 3-0 defeat at Atalanta. ENGLAND Favourites Manchester United led the way into the FA Cup quarter-finals with a 4-1 win at Championship (second division) Derby County. Everton were equally impressive as they ended Aston Villa's 16-game domestic unbeaten run with a 3-1 Goodison Park victory to reach the last eight for the first time in eight years. Chelsea, with new manager Guus Hiddink watching from the stands, are the only other team definitely through as a Nicolas Anelka hat-trick saw off Watford 3-1 on Saturday. A heap of draws and a delayed fourth round replay between Arsenal and Cardiff City on Monday made a mess of the quarter-final draw, though Everton are at home to West Ham United or Middlesbrough in the only guaranteed all-Premier League tie. GERMANY Hertha Berlin returned to the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since October 2006 with a 2-1 home win against Bayern Munich thanks to a double by Ukrainian striker Andriy Voronin. With five teams separated by only four points, the title chase is wide open with Hoffenheim, who were crushed 4-1 at home against Bayer Leverkusen on Friday, a point behind in second place on 39. Hamburg climbed to third, behind Hoffenheim on goal difference, after sweeping aside Arminia Bielefeld 2-0 with a lucky Piotr Trochowski free kick and a beautifully curled Paolo Guerrero shot. Champions Bayern dropped to fourth place on 38 points and Leverkusen are two points behind in fifth place. FRANCE Olympique Lyon won their first home game in three months, beating bottom club Le Havre 3-1 to maintain their four-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 on Sunday. The game was marred by a racist incident, with a Le Havre fan detained for shouting racist insults at Ghana defender John Mensah. Paris St Germain beat St Etienne 2-1 on Saturday, their fourth win in succession, to move up to second while Olympique Marseille, 1-0 winners at Monaco with a fine lob by Bakari Kone, went third and five points off the pace. Toulouse are fourth after Andre-Pierre Gignac's 15th goal of the season gave them a 2-1 win at strugglers Sochaux. NETHERLANDS League leaders AZ Alkmaar dropped two points when former Alkmaar striker Danny Koevermans hit a second-half double to salvage a point for PSV Eindhoven in a 2-2 draw. With 11 matches left, Alkmaar are nine points ahead of Twente Enschede who beat 10-men Volendam 2-1. Ajax Amsterdam registered their first win in five matches by beating arch-rivals Feyenoord 2-0, with Thomas Vermaelen and Urby Emanuelson on target for Marco van Basten's side who are third and trailing the leaders by 12 points. SCOTLAND The latest round of the Celtic and Rangers saga failed to spark as the Glasgow rivals fought out a goalless draw at Parkhead to leave Celtic two points clear at the top of the Scottish Premier League. Hearts climbed to third, 12 points behind Rangers and 14 adrift of the leaders, with a 2-1 home win over Aberdeen. GREECE Olympiakos Piraeus strengthened their grip on the Super League with a 2-1 win over Aris Salonika while nearest challengers Panathinaikos were held to a 0-0 draw by Iraklis. Olympiakos notched up their 18th win from 22 matches thanks to goals from veteran Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic and Argentine winger Luciano Galletti. The victory took them to 57 points, 14 clear of both Panathinaikos and PAOK Salonika who are battling for second spot. PAOK beat Levadiakos 3-0
