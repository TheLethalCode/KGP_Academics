 ST JOHN'S, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's victory bid on the final day of the third test against West Indies will be hampered by an injury to all-rounder Andrew Flintoff who managed just three overs on Wednesday. A team spokesman confirmed that Flintoff, who dropped down the order in England's second innings, was struggling with a nagging hip injury. In addition, his fast bowling partner Steve Harmison told reporters he was still suffering from the stomach upset which forced him to leave the field on Tuesday. "I'm not going to lie to you and say everything is all right (with Flintoff) because there is a problem there," Harmison told reporters. "What the problem I think we'll have to wait until the end of the match. Where he goes from here nobody knows, but hopefully he can be fit for the next test in Barbados. "But the big lad is in a bit of pain and it shows the character he has that he even attempted to go out on the field. I've been in those situations before, you are basically bowling for your mates to give the rest a bit of a rest. I imagine he'll be on the field tomorrow but he's in a bit of pain." Harmison said he had felt at "death's door" on Tuesday. "The first time I went off I was sick and after that the heat did me. It completely drained me. I didn't come out until lunch time. I was asleep on the floor," he said. "I didn't feel very strong out there today. I've not eaten much in the last few days which for me is difficult," he said adding his illness was probably due to something he had eaten. Despite the fitness problems facing the two main strike bowlers, Harmison said he was confident that England could get the seven wickets needed to dismiss West Indies. "The way we have bowled in this series so far, sticking to our task, searching for reverse swing, and then we'll have a new ball before tea, I'm pretty confident we can do it," he said
