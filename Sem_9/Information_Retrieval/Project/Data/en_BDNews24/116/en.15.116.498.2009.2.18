<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com) - Finance minister AMA Muhith reiterated on Wednesday that the impact of the current global recession on Bangladesh has been limited due to low levels of direct foreign investment. "If we had huge foreign investment then the impact of the global downturn would have been felt," said the minister after a meeting at Bangladesh bank. However, the minister said, a growth in foreign investment was required for overall economic development of the country. "But it will take some time for the FDI situation to improve." Muhith said that FDI data is often fraught with discrepancies as information from the Board of Investment does not match that supplied by Bangladesh Bank. "To end this confusion, arrangements have been made to keep only one set of data," said the finance minister. He said that from now on one set of data will be recorded after consultation between officials of the central bank, BOI and other relevant departments. bdnews
