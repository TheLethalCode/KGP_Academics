 LONDON, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jonathan Marland, who last week aborted his challenge to Giles Clarke as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), described the ECB's connection with Texas billionaire Allen Stanford as a "fiasco". Stanford and three of his companies were charged by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with "massive" fraud involving a multi-billion dollar investment scheme. He has denied any wrongdoing. The financier came to prominence in the cricket world following his private Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean and, in particular, the $20 million game in November between England and his own team made up of West Indian players. "In most other businesses some people would resign if they had been involved in such a fiasco as this," Marland told BBC Radio 5 Live on Wednesday. "It is entirely up to Giles Clarke and (ECB chief executive) David Collier what action they take. "The ECB failed in their due diligence ... the pictures of Clarke and Stanford posing behind that chest of money will haunt English cricket forever." The ECB said that all the money promised from the $20 million Stanford challenge match had been paid up but negotiations about future sponsorship had been called off. The ECB also said that it carried out due diligence before making the agreement with Stanford last year and that there had been no indications that he would be unable to fulfil his obligations.
