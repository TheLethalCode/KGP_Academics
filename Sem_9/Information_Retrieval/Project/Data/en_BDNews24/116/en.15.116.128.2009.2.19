 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com) - Election Commission officials will discharge the duties of returning officers for the Mar 30 by-elections in seven constituencies. "The EC has appointed its district election officers and deputy election commissioners as ROs and assistant ROs for the first time," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters Thursday. The constituencies holding the by-polls are Bagerhat-1, Rangpur-6, Bogra-6 and 7, Rangpur-3, Kurigram-2 and Kishorganj-6. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, opposition leader Khaleda Zia and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, each winning three seats in the Dec 29 general election, quit two seats each vacating six in total. Another seat was vacated when Zillur Rahman took oath as president. District commissioners and UNOs usually discharge the duties of returning officers and assistant returning officers in parliamentary polls. Explaining the reasons behind appointing election officials this time round, Sakhawat said, "There are possibilities for the government officers to be influenced under a political government." "There would be too many complications in taking legal measures against those officers if allegations of misconduct are made. This time, we've appointed the EC's own officials as returning officers so that we can take direct action in case of any allegations against them," he said. Expecting all out cooperation from the government, Sakhawat said, "We want to make the by-elections free and fair." The election commissioner urged all to respect the election code of conduct. "We're requesting that no minister, state minister or MP visit the election areas after the schedule is announced." "If they want to vote, they will be provided with postal ballots," he added. Sakhawat said the EC has already appointed judicial magistrates, who will award jail terms and fines for breach of the election code. According to the election schedule, nominations must be filed by Mar. 2, scrutiny will be on Mar. 5 and the deadline for withdrawals is Mar. 12. bdnews2
