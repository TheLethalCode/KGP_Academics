 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) - Champions Abahani Limited finished their B League campaign in style with a 6-3 win over Rahmatganj MFS in their final second-leg match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. Nigerian striker Emeka Christina struck his second league hat-trick as Abahani stretched their winning run to nine matches after the popular Sky Blues had started their second-leg campaign with a draw against Farashganj SC. Apart from Emeka's treble, Jahid Hasan Emily, Jahed Parez Chowdhury and Mamunul Islam slotted one goal apiece for Abahani, who raised their points tally to 50 from their stipulated 20 outings. Rahmatganj MFS, who stunned Abahani 2-1 in the B League opener, finished seventh in the 11-team point table with 21 points, also from 20 outings. Having retained the title with a match to go, Dhanmondi-based outfit Abahani Limited came into their final match hoping to turn on the style for their fans. There was no sign of complacency among the Abahani players, who went on the attack from the word go. They got the dividends in the 27th minute when Mamun fired a Wali Faisal cross home to give the side a deserved lead. Five minutes later, Rahmatganj responded well to level the margin when Niche Francis converted a spot kick after Abahani defender Mohammad Sujan handled a shot off Francis inside the danger zone. National striker Emily then put Abahani ahead again in the 39th minute with a fine one-two with Emeka, who struck his first goal just before the breather. Emaka widened the lead for Abahani in the 56th minute and two minutes later completed his hattrick, raising his goal tally to 17, just a goal behind top-scorer Mohammedan's Alamu Bukola Olaleken. After going 5-1 down, Rahmatganj hit back twice first through Francis converting another spot kick in the 68th minute and then Herok Joarder who scored three minutes from time. However, medio Jahed Parvez Chowdhury had earlier struck Abahani's sixth goal in the 75th minute. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen termed Abahani success as a combination of the players, coaching staff and club officials. He, however, singled out a few players such as Ghanaian centre-back Samad Yousuf, striker Jahid Hasan Emily, midfielders Mamunul Islam, Prantosh Kumar and Arif Khan Joy. bd
