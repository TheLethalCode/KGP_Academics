 ST JOHN'S, Antigua, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After the farcical scenes that led to Friday's second test between West Indies and England being abandoned, the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is in danger of becoming a very young white elephant. Unloved, unused and, at the moment, unfit for international cricket, the venue faces an uncertain future after hosting just one full test match and another that lasted only 10 balls due to unsuitable field conditions. Antigua risks losing the chance to host test matches until it gets a field and stadium that is up to scratch and wins back the confidence of organisers and officials -- a blow to tourism and another setback in attempts to revive the popularity of the game on the island. "I would recommend they play soccer there from now on. The amount of funding it would take to make that into a test venue again will be significant," West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chief executive Donald Peters told the BBC. "The West Indies Cricket Board will not go back to the Viv Richards Stadium. We are not prepared to take the risk." The ground is just two years old, cost an estimated $60 million -- mainly from Chinese investment -- to build and has hosted six one-day games at the World Cup in 2007, a test match against Australia last year and a few minutes play on Friday. On Sunday, after hasty re-arrangements, a new test will be played at the traditional home of cricket on this small island, the decaying Antigua Recreation Ground, where most local fans wish the game had stayed. Whatever the success or otherwise of the rescheduled game at the 'Rec' it is possible the International Cricket Council (ICC) will remove test status from the Viv Richards ground. "The ultimate measure we can adopt is the sanction of the accreditation of a venue and that is what is at risk for this ground," said ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat, adding that fines and suspension from use for tests could precede such a decision. Even if the ICC did not take any action, it is hard to imagine the West Indies choosing to risk another game at the ground in the near future. EXPENSIVE PLANS England fans, forced to rejig expensive travel plans or miss the final two days of the re-arranged test, were left asking how a match was allowed to start with a sandy outfield described on Friday as 'unfit and dangerous' by match referee Alan Hurst. One of the central problems afflicting many areas of cricket in the Caribbean is that West Indies are made up of independent nations and each has a strong degree of autonomy despite the existence of the central WICB. It was therefore no surprise that WICB president Julian Hunte explained the mess-up by citing the advice he had received from the Antiguans. "We did not move the test match because we were given assurances that the outfield and the facilities were in good order," he told reporters while accepting that the WICB had "ultimate responsibility". The farcical scenes on Friday, with groundstaff taking out shovels to dig up the sandy run-ups, was another body blow for the image of West Indies cricket. The World Cup in 2007, which should have been a carnival of Caribbean cricket, disappointed many with poor crowds and little atmosphere due to overpriced tickets and unpopular restrictions on fan behaviour. The West Indies team, once treasured as the most entertaining in the world, have faded in the past decade. Last week's innings victory over England in Kingston, Jamaica indicated that a revival could at last be under way to the delight of many fans over the world. Less than a week later, though, West Indian cricket looked a shambolic mess once again. "The Antigua Cricket Association have dropped the ball and should be ashamed of themselves," said West Indies great Viv Richards, whose name adorns the stadium. "This is not a shot in the foot for West Indies cricket, this is an arrow right through the heart.
