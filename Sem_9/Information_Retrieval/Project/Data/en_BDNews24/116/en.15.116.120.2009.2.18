 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told the parliament Wednesday the 'wholesale politicisation of the administration by the past BNP-led government' made the job of her government difficult. During her weekly question-answer session, she pledged not to politicise state machinery as was done under the previous BNP rule. "We cannot work effectively because of it. We have observed that our efforts are being hampered. Everywhere we see inertia and stagnation," said Hasina replying to a supplementary question from independent MP Fazlul Azim. Hasina also said her government would form a high-level taskforce with experts to devise ways to face the global recession. "You know very well what politicisation is and its forms as the party (BNP) once you were loyal to has shown. They resorted to wholesale politicisation everywhere starting from administration," Hasina said to Azim, a former BNP MP. "They removed efficient people from the civil administration, military bureaucracy, hospitals, courts everywhere," she said. As an instance of 'politicisation of the BNP-led government', the prime minister said the four-party alliance government cancelled the appointment of 22 judges and appointed people facing charges of certificate counterfeiting. "The only medical university (Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University) was politicised in such a way that the number of doctors there was higher than the number of patients," said Hasina. "But the number of doctors across the country was fewer." "The Awami League in its 1996-2001 tenure served the country without having the agenda of politicisation. We will not do politicisation again this time. We will be working as per the confidence and trust people have vested upon us," said the prime minister. On the impacts of the global economic meltdown, Hasina said the government had formed a secretary-level committee to fix the government strategies by identifying the possible impacts of the recession. "In addition, initiatives have been taken as overall cautionary measures to form a high-level taskforce comprising experts and people from the private sectors. "This taskforce will suggest us long-term policies necessary to face the fallout of the global economic meltdown," she said. Replying to a question from Awami League MP Chayan Islam, the prime minister said her government was planning to reintroduce the project "One farm at each household" which was annulled by the BNP-led government. "The process to restart the project has started already," she said. bdnews
