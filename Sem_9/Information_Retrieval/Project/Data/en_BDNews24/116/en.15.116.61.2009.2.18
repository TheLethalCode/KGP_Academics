 MADRID, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid winger Arjen Robben said on Tuesday he had some old scores to settle with Liverpool when they meet in the Champions League first knockout round next week. "I want to beat Liverpool because I've lost against them twice in the semi-finals," Robben told Radio Marca. "Also (Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe) Reina saved a penalty of mine and I would like to take another and score this time." Robben was at Chelsea when Liverpool beat them on the way to the European Cup final in 2005 and 2007. Two years ago, the match went to penalties after the tie ended 1-1 on aggregate, and Reina saved from Robben and Geremi as Liverpool took the shootout 4-1 at Anfield. The Dutch international, who left Chelsea for Real in August 2007, has been in sparkling form for the Primera Liga champions and has been a key figure in their recent eight-match winning streak. He missed the 4-0 hammering of Sporting Gijon on Sunday with muscle strain but is expected to be fit for the first leg on Feb. 25 at the Bernabeu. "Liverpool are a very strong team, they have a coach who is very good tactically, and they know how they have to play in particular games," he added. "The most important thing will be to score goals at the Bernabeu. We have to win by more than two goals because the return at Anfield will be tough." The second leg is on March 10
