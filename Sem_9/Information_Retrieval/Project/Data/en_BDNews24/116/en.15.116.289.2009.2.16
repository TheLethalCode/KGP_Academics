 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak will undergo further work in Australia to fine tune his bowling action in a bid to return to international cricket. Razzak is scheduled to leave for Australia Monday night. He will be accompanied by Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons. The 26-year-old cricketer was suspended by International Cricket Council in November for his illegal action after an independent analysis of his bowling action revealed that his action exceeded the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted under regulations. The BCB applied to the ICC for re-assessment after its bowling review group expressed satisfaction with Razzak's progress following a rehabilitation programme in country. Razzak was also allowed to bowl in a recently concluded Premier Division Twenty20 League at home. The successful spinner will first head to Brisbane where he will work with specialists at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence to fine tune his suspect action. Razzak will also appear for reassessment tests at the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS) in Canberra on Feb 23. Member of the ICC Panel of Human Movement Specialists at the AIS' Biomechanics Department Dr Marc Portus will conduct the assessment. bd
