<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has declared illegal the detention of controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun. The HC bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui gave the verdict on Thursday on a petition filed by Mamun's brother Jalaluddin Rumi. The petitioner's lawyer, barrister AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik, told bdnews24.com that the HC had declared Mamun's detention illegal and ordered his release if there was no other case against him. But Mamun is accused in at least ten separate cases. Of these, he has been convicted in two graft cases and one arms case, pending appeals. A close friend of the BNP chairperson's elder son Tarique Rahman, Mamun was originally arrested on March 25 2007. The government issued a fresh detention order on Jan 4 this year. The petition was filed by his brother on Jan 20 challenging the legality of the new detention order. Deputy attorney general Rajik Al Jalil opposed the petition. bdnew
