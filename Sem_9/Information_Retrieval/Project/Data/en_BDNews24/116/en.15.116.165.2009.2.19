<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan is "seriously considering" an Indian request to send investigators to India to share information on the Mumbai attacks, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said on Wednesday. Islamabad acknowledged for the first time last week that the November assault in the Indian financial capital that killed at least 179 people was launched from, and partly planned in, Pakistan. It also said six suspects, including an alleged ringleader, were in custody. India welcomed the Pakistani acknowledgement, in a sign that a thaw was possible in ties between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. Speaking at a news conference in the eastern city of Lahore, Gilani said New Delhi had asked for Pakistani investigators to visit India. "India has expressed desire that our law enforcement, especially an FIA team, should visit India for further information sharing and we are seriously considering that," he said, referring to Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency, which is dealing with the case. An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Anurag Srivastava, told Reuters that New Delhi had not been officially informed of Gilani's comments. Pakistani investigators have lodged a police complaint against eight suspects, including Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani militant captured alive by Indian forces during the attack, in which nine gunmen were killed. A top Pakistani interior ministry official said last week Pakistan may ask India for the custody of Kasab. However, Pakistan's foreign ministry denied media reports that it had formally asked for Kasab to be handed over. Pakistan has also asked Indian authorities to speed up their investigation and answer 30 questions sent to India by Pakistani investigators to help Pakistan's prosecution case. Tensions have been running high between India and Pakistan since the Mumbai attack, though fear of a conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours has receded
