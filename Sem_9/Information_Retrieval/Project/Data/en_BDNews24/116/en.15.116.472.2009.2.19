 Dhaka, February 19 (bdnews24.com)A special pay scale will be introduced for police, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Thursday. "I mentioned Wednesday the government was mulling revision of pay scales employees of Bangladesh Bank, BAPEX and teachers," Muhith told reporters at the secretariat. "I also wanted to mention that the police pay scale will also come under consideration for revision." Asked how separate pay scales will be formulated for different government departments and organisations, the minister said, "I had sat in January with members of the pay commission formed during the caretaker government's tenure." "I directed them to work out separate packages for the police, education department and BAPEX employees in line with the specific guidelines." "We'll also issue separate instruction to revise the pay scale for Bangladesh Bank staff," said Muhtih. Asked when the seventh pay commission's recommendations would be implemented, Muhith said, "The pay commission will submit its report in April." "After reviewing the pay commission report, a declaration about implementing the pay and allowances may be made in the new (2009-10) budget." The seventh pay commission, headed by former finance secretary Mostafizur Rahman, was formed in September 2008. bdnews24.c
