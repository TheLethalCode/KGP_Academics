 SYDNEY, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)- Australia earned a thrilling one-run win over New Zealand in the one-off Twenty20 match in Sydney. Set 151 for victory, New Zealand fell just short of their target when Nathan McCullum smashed a four and a six from the final two deliveries of the match. Brendon McCullum (61) top-scored for the tourists, while Nathan Bracken finished with 1-16 from four overs. David Hussey (41) was the pick of the Australia batsmen, with Daniel Vettori (1-23) outstanding for New Zealand. The Black Caps had looked on course for victory with the destructive Brendon McCullum at the crease in the penultimate over. The wicketkeeper put on 71 runs with Neil Broom in an enterprising third-wicket stand before his partner fell for 36 top-edging a James Hopes delivery to Callum Ferguson with the score at 73-3. However, the complexion of the match changed courtesy a moment of inspiration from Adam Voges when McCullum launched a Ben Hilfenhaus length ball down the ground in the 19th over. Yorksfan With the ball set to fly for six, long-on fielder Voges made the catch on the boundary, but his body's momentum took him over the rope. However, just before he crossed the boundary, the Western Australian threw the ball back into play, regaining his composure before sprinting on to the field to complete a quite outstanding catch, a dismissal confirmed by the third umpire Rod Tucker. Needing 14 from the final over, bowled by Bracken, New Zealand's hopes of victory looked to have ended when Grant Elliott (23) was run out off the first delivery. The next three went for just two runs, leaving the tourists needing 12 runs to win from the final two balls. Nathan McCullum promptly slapped them for a four and a six, leaving New Zealand agonisingly short of their winning target. With Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke or Mike Hussey all absent, Australia stand-in captain Brad Haddin won the toss and elected to bat at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The wicketkeeper made a flying start alongside David Warner at the top of the innings, racing to 34 inside four overs before he was caught and bowled by Tim Southee. Warner and Ferguson fell soon after before Hussey steadied the innings with a composed 41 off 39 deliveries, ably assisted by Voges (23), Cameron White and James Hopes (both 16). Courtesy : BB
