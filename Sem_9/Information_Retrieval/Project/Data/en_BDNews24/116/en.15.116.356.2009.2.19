<TITLE> County chairmen raise questions over Stanford payouts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English county sides may have to consider handing back money received as part of a deal with Texan billionaire Allen Stanford, Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove was quoted as saying on Thursday. Each of the first class county sides in English cricket received 50,000 pounds ($71,660) after last November's Stanford Super Series. "There may well be a moral issue in receiving the money," Bransgrove told the Guardian newspaper. "When you take ill-gotten gains it leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. You have to put it in context; thousands of people could be damaged by the actions of this man if the charges are upheld. "I don't know whether Hampshire can actually give the money back but, if you're asking whether I feel sullied by receiving it, yes I do," added Bransgrove. "The game will have to address and debate the moral issue." Stanford and three of his companies were charged by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with "massive" fraud involving a multi-billion dollar investment scheme. He has denied any wrongdoing. The financier came to prominence in the cricket world following his private Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean and, in particular, the $20 million game in November between England and his own team made up of West Indian players. Lancashire chief executive Jim Cumbes agreed with Bransgrove's position. "If the money has come by dubious means, it's something to think about," he said. "Socially and morally, he's right." The Guardian also quoted Durham chief executive David Harker as saying: "It's only speculation at the moment but, if it's proven that the money is ill-gotten gains, then it's not something we'd want to be party to." The Stanford affair has been deeply embarrassing for English cricket, with prominent critics slamming those who run the sport. "In most other businesses some people would resign if they had been involved in such a fiasco as this," Jonathan Marland, who last week aborted his challenge to Giles Clarke as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), said on Wednesday
