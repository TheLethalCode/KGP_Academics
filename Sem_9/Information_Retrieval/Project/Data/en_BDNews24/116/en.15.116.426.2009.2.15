<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Sunday declared the candidature of elected chairman of Daudkandi Upazila, Yusuf Jamil Babu, illegal and void. A three member bench of the Appellate Division headed by justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim pronounced the judgement, dismissing an appeal by Babu against a previous High Court order. The Election Commission cancelled his candidature on Dec 17 last year on charges of loan default brought by City Bank Limited. Babu filed a writ petition against the verdict of the EC. The HC rejected his petition on Dec 31 last year. Upon an application filed by Babu, the court of the Appellate Division Judge-in-Chamber stayed the HC order. Babu contested the election and won. The EC did not publish the result of the Daudkandi poll as the matter was pending in the Supreme Court. Counsel for City Bank Limited Barrister Mizan Sayeed told reporters Sunday that following the SC verdict the EC would cancel the election result in which Babu was elected chairman. Barrister Fida M. Kamal moved the petition for Babu, while former Attorney General Mahmudul Islam and Barrister Mizan Sayeed contested it for City Bank Limited.
