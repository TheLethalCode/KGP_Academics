 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Consumers have opposed a proposal of Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO) to increase the tariff to Tk 14.77 from Tk 10. They said in a public hearing that the DESCO proposal lacked adequate information. Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) organised the public hearing Wednesday. BERC chairman Gulam Rahman said DESCO applied to them November last year to hike power prices. Turin Afroz of Customer Group said the application did not sufficient information. "Therefore, we are opposing the proposal. We hope they will provide all information through the BERC." "We want the real information. They should tell us how they will develop efficiency." Dhaka Cember of Commerce and Industry director Hossain Ali said small and medium enterprises, the lifeline of the economy, depended heavily on power. "We should be careful about increasing the price." Dr. Shamsul Alam of the Consumers' Association of Bangladesh said DESCO had failed to argue convincingly for the planned tariff hike. DESCO managing director Saleh Ahmed argued that the Power Development Board had increased 13.16 percent bulk supply tariff and as a result, DESCO had to pay an additional Tk 9 crore a month. "DESCO is trying to develop, renovate and maintain itself on own funds instead of on donors' money." Asking not to be named, an BERC official told bdnews24.com DESCO was making Tk 0.5 profit per unit after the 16 percent tariff hike approved by the BERC. The BERC chairman told bdnews24.com, "We have asked for post-hearing comments by Feb. 28. A decision will be made by the middle of May." Another public hearing on a proposal of Dhaka Power Distribution Company will be held on March 4. March 11 is scheduled for the hearing of the proposal of West Zone Power Distribution Company. The Rural Electrification Board has been asked to resubmit the proposal with facts and figures, a senior BERC official said on condition that he not be named.
