<TITLE> UZ law to make way for 'local development' by MPs: Ashraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com) - Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam has proposed changes to the 1998 Upazila Parishad law for more extensive involvement of MPs in "local development work". "All of us want to fulfil our pre-electoral pledges, but there is no system of allotment to MPs for local development works, though such a system exists in India," the minister said on Sunday at the supplementary question and answer session in parliament. In India, the equivalent of some Tk 2 crore is allotted to each MP, said Ashraful. "That money is used for local development work." Stating that members of parliament should play the role of coordinators for local development, Ashraful said this was missing in the Local Government (Upazila Parishad) Ordinance 2008 of the caretaker government. "Therefore, the present government has decided to directly amend the Upazila Parishad Act 1998 to include the MP's role in local development," he remarked. The minister also assured there would not be any looting in the name of development during the tenure of the present government. "There has been mass pilferage in the name of development in the past and the work that has been done has been of a low quality." "This government will ensure sustainable development and a level playing field in the development sector," said the minister. bdnews24.c
