<TITLE> Mandela joins Zuma at ANC election event: ANC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nelson Mandela has joined South Africa's ruling ANC leader Jacob Zuma at a party election event, the ANC said on Sunday, a move likely to give the party a major boost before the April 22 poll. Zuma and the former president addressed a rally in the Eastern Cape, said the ANC. The province is expected to be a main battleground in the election. The ANC is widely expected to win the election but it faces a challenge from the new COPE party made up of ANC defectors. It was the first time Mandela has appeared at a campaign event before the election. The elder statesmen, who led the country out of apartheid, has steered clear of politics and power struggles that have hurt the ANC over the past few years. Mandela's appearance will also help Zuma, who is expected to become president after the election despite facing a revived corruption case that has dogged him for years. The ANC said in a statement the rally attended by thousands was part of the party's election program, focusing on its manifesto plans for rural development. While the Congress of the People (COPE) party is not expected to win the election, it could break the ANC's two-thirds majority in parliament, stopping it from pushing through whatever legislation it wants. COPE has opened up the political landscape in what some critics have described as akin to a one-party state. But investors are concerned about uncertainty. ANC power struggles have hampered efforts to tackle issues such as widespread poverty, one of the world's highest rates of violent crime and an AIDS epidemic.
