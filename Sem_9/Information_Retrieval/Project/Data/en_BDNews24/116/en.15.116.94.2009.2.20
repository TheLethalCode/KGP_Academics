 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The onus is on the government to ensure an effective parliament, said a senior opposition leader on Thursday. "Do not create such an atmosphere that forces us to take a tough step so that parliament becomes a one-party affair," warned Khandaker Delawar Hossain, secretary general of BNP which has been boycotting parliament since last month. He called on the ruling coalition parties, led by Awami League, to "change their attitude. "We want to play a constructive role in parliament as an opposition party. But, we are being barred from attending," he told reporters at the BNP chairperson's office in Gulshan. He also alleged the government was tampering with the opposition party's nominations to the parliamentary standing committees. Criticising the government's role once again in ensuring Khaleda Zia's security, he said, "The government is not paying attention to the fact that her security is much more sensitive now than any time in the past." "Sheikh Hasina's security consisted of 125 police officers when she was leader of the opposition. But Khaleda Zia is not being provided even one-tenth of the security that Hasina enjoyed," he said. Hasina's security was strengthened after the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally during the past BNP-led government. Demanding tighter security for Khaleda, he said, "It is what she deserves from the state. It is not a piece of kindness." He criticised the prime minister's speech on Wednesday at a Bangladesh Chhatra League re-union, in which Hasina said, "I do not hold the magic lamp of Aladdin in my hands". Delwar asked M: "Why did she confuse people with her election promises if she cannot deliver rice at Tk. 10 per kg, free distribution of fertiliser and employment for one person in every family?" The BNP leader also briefed reporters on incidents of "oppression, attacks and occupation of homes and lands of BNP workers" in a two-page written statement. Office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and the chairperson's information cell chief Maruf Kamal were present during the briefing among others. bdnew
