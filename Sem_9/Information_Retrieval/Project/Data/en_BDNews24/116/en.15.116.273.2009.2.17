<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)A special parliamentary committee placed its report Tuesday recommending 54 and rejecting 68 ordinances of the caretaker government. The committee, formed by the House to examine the ordinances promulgated since October 2006, gave the nod to 54 considering public interest and continuity of administration. "The committee thinks there was no justification for accepting the remainder of the122 ordinances," Rahmat Ali, chairman of the committee, told the House while tabling the report. The report also mentioned that an advisory panel of legal experts differed, saying many of the 54 were promulgated in violation of Article 58 of the Constitution. Article 58 states the tenure of any caretaker government should be no more than 90 days and the Constitution does not authorise any interim government to take policy decisions other than for holding elections, regular work including maintaining law and order and budgetary activities. The past caretaker government held office for an unprecedented 2 years. The law minister had recently said public welfare oriented ordinances such as the ones related to separation of the judiciary and the Anticorruption Commission would be given the nod alongside those relating to elections. Unless the public interest ordinances passed in the past two years are ratified, there will be some retrospective problems, the committee's report said. "Therefore, we recommended their passage," said Ali. He also said the government should not move to amend the constitution to validate the actions of the interim government during its lengthy term. "Once the ordinances are placed in the House as bills they will be the property of parliament. It is up to parliament when and whether to pass the bills. The 15-member special committee was formed on Jan 28 to examine the ordinances. Of the total, three were passed by the past BNP-led government at the tail end of its term while 119 ordinances were promulgated under the caretaker government. The committee had its fourth meeting on Tuesday afternoon with Rahmat Ali in the chair. The cabinet on Monday approved the first 11 ordinances, including the Electoral Rolls Ordinance 2007 and those relating to two annual budgets, to be tabled as bills in parliament. bdnews2
