<TITLE> Cook half century pushes England towards declaration </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ST JOHN'S, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Alastair Cook's second half-century of the game helped England build a huge lead over West Indies as they looked towards an afternoon declaration on the fourth day of the third test on Wednesday. England, 1-0 down in the five-match series, were 135 for three at lunch, a lead of 416. The aim of the tourists was to get runs on the board as swiftly as possible but that strategy was undermined by the hour-long presence of nightwatchman James Anderson. Anderson was eventually caught behind off Daren Powell for 20. Owais Shah was then bowled by the paceman for 14 after smashing him for six over mid-wicket. Kevin Pietersen looked to step up the run-rate before lunch and was lucky to survive when he was caught and bowled by Sulieman Benn off a no-ball. Cook was 51 not out and Pietersen unbeaten on 17 at the interval.
