"We've pledged to make Bangladesh a developed, modern and poverty-free country in our election manifesto. We've spoken of the charter for change in the manifesto," she said. "As we begin our journey for change, we expect cooperation from our patriotic members of Ansar and Village Defence Party," she said at the 29th national convention of Bangladesh Ansar and VDP at Safipur Ansar Academy in Kaliakoyor of the district..

She said some 50,00,000 Ansar and VDP members are "more or less trained" and she believed they had immense potential. "If we can engage the force in planned way in the development of the country, then we can make impossible possible," the PM said.
