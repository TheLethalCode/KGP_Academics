 MILAN, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham and his advisors will consider their position next week after Los Angeles Galaxy said his permanent move to AC Milan had collapsed, his spokesman said on Saturday. Beckham, on loan to Milan until March 9, has said he wants to stay at the Serie A club full-time but Major League Soccer imposed a Friday deadline which passed without agreement. Galaxy now expect him to return next month. "David is focused on the Milan derby this Sunday. We will be addressing this early next week," Beckham's spokesman Simon Oliveira told Reuters. Italian media speculated that a deal could still be reached by the parties irrespective of the arbitrary deadline set down by the MLS during the week. Beckham has the option of buying out his contract and has a clause which means he can leave Galaxy for nothing in October. Milan had no comment but coach Carlo Ancelotti is due to hold a news conference later on Saturday ahead of Sunday's game with Inter Milan
