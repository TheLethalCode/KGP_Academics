"Police have been ordered to hunt down Atikul Islam's killers as speedily as possible," Sahara Khatun told reporters. "Those responsible will have to account to me for their deeds as I have to account to the prime minister for my deeds," she added. The 35 year-old employee of the private TV station died after being shot, behind the RAB-2 office in the city's Moghbazar area, as he was riding his motorcycle home from work on Friday evening.
