<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Members of parliament on Tuesday came down heavily on Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari's special envoy for his "audacious" press statement on trial of 1971 war criminals. Senior treasury bench MPs asked the visiting dignitary to apologise for his remarks. Foreign minister Dipu Moni defended special envoy Mirza Zia Ispahani who came to Dhaka on Monday on a three-day visit but she categorically said the war criminals must be tried on Bangladesh soil as parliament passed a unanimous resolution to do so on Jan 29. Workers' Party MP Rashed Khan Menon initiated the unscheduled discussion on a point of order. Awami League MPs Fazle Rabbi Mia, Rafiqul Islam and Tofail Ahmed, and Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Oli Ahmed also took part in the discussion criticising the special envoy. "The special envoy told journalists on Monday that it was not the right time for war crimes trials. When parliament has unanimously adopted a resolution on trying the war criminals, his audacious statement is similar to undermining parliament and its members," said Menon. "As long as we are alive, the trial of the war criminals will take place on Bangladesh soil," he said. Awami League MP Rafiqul Islam said, "The state guest should apologise for his statement." Oli Ahmed said, "It cannot be that a foreign guest will humiliate us. I hope the foreign minister will ask the guest to say sorry for his statement". "As I understood his televised statement, he was referring to the trial of the Pakistani war criminals at this moment," Dipu Moni told parliament. "I don't want to make any comment on another's comment. But we will certainly try our war criminals," said the foreign minister. She said the trials were AL's election promise and had turned into a national pledge after the December 29 polls. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was presiding over the session, said, "The trial of the war criminals must take place". Tofail Ahmed said it was not unnatural that the Pakistani envoy could make such a remark considering Pakistan's role in 1971. "We made the Pakistani forces surrender. Now we have to implement our election pledge by trying war criminals, and their collaborators," he said. bdnews2
