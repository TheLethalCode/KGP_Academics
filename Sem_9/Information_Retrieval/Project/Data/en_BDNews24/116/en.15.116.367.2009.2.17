 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested two men on Tuesday in connection with the murder of NTV video editor Atikul Islam, recovering the dead man's hijacked motorcycle from one of the suspects. The first man to be arrested was 'Khokon' (30), who was released from prison last December after serving 9 years in prison, said Masudur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner of DMP Detective Branch. The second suspect, Abdullah Ibne Ali Sarkar Nahid (30) from Shahjahanpur in Dhaka, was arrested on information provided by Khokon, said the police official. "After the mugging and shooting of Atikul, our vehicle hijacking prevention team went into action and we caught the person by laying a trap," said Rahman, who is also head of the hijack prevention team. "We advertised, looking to buy a bike similar to the hijacked one," he said. The trap involved paying Tk 12,000 in advance to the gang suspected of shooting Atikul and hijacking his bike in on Feb 13. "When the seller came with the motorcycle to the designated spot Tuesday afternoon, he was apprehended by undercover members of the police team," said Rahman. "After questioning, Masud revealed the names of his accomplices and we hope to arrest all of them very soon," he added. The 35 year-old employee of the private TV station died after being shot, behind the RAB-2 office in the city's Moghbazar area, as he was riding his motorcycle home from work. The unidentified gunmen snatched the motorcycle, while locals rushed Atikul to Dhaka Medical College Hospital with bullet wounds to the chest, stomach and back. He succumbed to his injuries later that night. bdnews
