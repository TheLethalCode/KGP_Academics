<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  BGMEA have asked the government to cancel the zone-wise weekly holiday introduced to better manage power supply for industry. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association say the government has failed to ensure uninterrupted power supply and there are bureaucratic complexities for generator use. "The total power demand of this sector is 650 megawatts," BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez said in a meeting with the state minister for power and energy Samsul Haque Tuku on Tuesday. The zone-wise weekly holiday hampered production and made it difficult to meet export schedules, said the BGMEA delegation led by Parvez. Some 76 percent of foreign earnings come from this sector alone. It employs about 2.8 million people, said Parvez. "The government could specify one or two power plants specially for the garments sector," said the BGMEA president. He said, "The government should make a strategic plan, then we could base our business on the basis of government strategy. In the past, entrepreneurs have bought machinery, but they were unable to use them due to power and energy crisis, causing huge losses." The garment exporters presented the various problems faced by the sector. According to the BGMEA, there are around 6000 garments factory in the country, but only 3600 garments are currently operating. Tuku said the problems, especially the power crisis, were not new. "They have been prevailing for years. There is no easy solution, we must all be patient." "We will notify the residents in different areas about the load shedding schedule. We will advertise the schedule through the mass media", he added.
