 Arshad Mahmud writes from Washington Washington, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) .It's a long tradition for American presidents and their families to get out of Washington on weekends to spend some quiet time among themselves away from the White House. And they normally go to Camp David, the official presidential retreat in Maryland, just about 50 miles from Washington. But for longer weekendsusually stretching three days or morethey prefer to go further away. In the recent past, presidents tend to have pretty nice digs for weekend getaways George W. Bush, the eternal cowboy, had his ranch in Crawford, Texas. Ronald Regan also enjoyed the peace of his ranch in Santa Barbara. Bush Senior had his retreat in Kennebunkport. John Kennedy preferred to relax in Cape Cod. Bill Clinton often tarvelled to Martha's Vineyard. But for President Obama, there is no such place like sweet home in Chicago for a Valentine's Day retreat. So he decided to travel to Chicago for the long weekend. "He's a man of the people and never forgot where he came from," Andre Washington, Obama's neighbor, told ABCNews.

But beyond the consistently good haircuts, there are three big reasons why Chicagoans love their city: breakfast, lunch and dinner. And the president is quite a foodie.

As for where the president plans to take Mrs. Obama on their first Valentine's date as the first couple, it's a closely guarded state secret. The Secret Service has requested the media not to speculate about the possible restaurant for safety reasons. It could be downtown eatery Topolobampo, where the Obamas are regulars. Mrs. Obama reportedly loves the restaurant's guacamole. Topolobampo's manager, Alan Bochi, pleaded ignorance about whether the president could be stopping by. "I certainly wouldn't be at liberty to say," he said. "And if I knew, I wouldn't even know before a moment's notice." While it's not a dusty Texas ranch or the close-cropped green grass of the Northeast, Chicago is home for the Obamas. Even in this terrible winter, there's no place warmer for this presid
