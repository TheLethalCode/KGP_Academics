 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) - Badminton, basketball, judo, volleyball, cycling and cricket (under-21) are the six new disciplines that have been included to next year's 11th South Asian (SA) Games in Bangladesh. The decision was taken at the South Asian Olympic Council (SAOC) meeting held in Nepal capital Kathmandu on Monday. As many as 15 disciplines were approved by the SAOC meeting in Dhaka last February and now the number of disciplines has increased to 23, three more than the previous meet which was held in Colombo. As the host country, it is entitled to add two disciplines of their choice, so BOA on Monday declared wrestling and golf as sports of their choice. The other 15 disciplines are: football, archery, athletics, boxing, handball, hockey, kabaddi, karate, shooting, squash, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, weightlifting and wushu. Handball, golf and cricket are the new sports to be played in the SA Games for the first time. Bangladesh Olympic Association CEO Col (retd) Wali Ullah, who attended the meeting, said that the meeting was decided to hold the mega South Asian extravaganza from Jan 29 to Feb 9, 2010. The meeting, however, did not finalise the events of each discipline yet. "BOA will settle the issue as soon as possible," said Wali. bd
