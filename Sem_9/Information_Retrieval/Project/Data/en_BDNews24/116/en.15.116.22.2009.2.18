<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government's Real Estate Development and Management Ordinance 2008 will be passed in the parliament in the interests of the buyers and developers, the law minister said Wednesday. "(However) prior to placing it before the parliament to make it a law, the cabinet and the parliamentary standing committee (on the housing ministry) will scrutinise the ordinance," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat after meeting with a seven-member REHAB delegation. "No parties, buyers and developers, should be worried about the ordinance. Everything that is there will go through scrutiny," he said. The military-installed caretaker government made the ordinance with provisions of jail and fine for the developers if they fail to hand over flats to the buyers in time. The Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh delegation led by president Tanvirul Haq Prabal urged the minister to lower the flat registration fee, delete the mandatory provision to disclose the buyer's source of income in case of first flat purchase and announcing the real estate an industry. They also urged him to formulate a separate regulation on the real estate development on the basis of opinions from institutions concerned, environmental organisations and civil society members. bd
