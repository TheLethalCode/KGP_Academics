<TITLE> BNP feud flares in Chittagong </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition BNP's factional fight in Chittagong has flared up in the capital, with loyalists of one faction assaulting rivals Monday. A group of BNP adherents allegedly loyal to Salauddin Quader Chowdhury assaulted another group of BNP men from Chittagong South unit at the party's metropolitan unit office at Naya Paltan in the morning, party insiders said. The other group came to the office after the central committee had asked them to. Six organisational committees led by the party's joint secretary general are gathering information about the grassroots, interviewing local leaders from across the country. The group of Chittagong South unit BNP led by its president Ahmed Khalil Khan and acting general secretary Prof Sheikh Mohammad Mohiuddin came to the Naya Paltan office. But the 'Chowdhury loyalists' led by MA Hashem Raju intercepted them in front of the office, as they had not been invited to represent Chandanaish unit BNP. Raju told bdnews2.com those who got the letter belonged to BNP 'reformists'. He said the Chittagong South unit BNP was led by M Morshed Khan and Abdullah Al Noman, who were reformists. Khalil and Mohiuddin left the Naya Paltan office without appearing for the interview. Mohiuddin said Chowdhury was the head of the Raju-led group and Boalkhali Upazila unit BNP president Azizul Haq assaulted them. "They [Raju and Azizul] are Jamaat-e-Islami agents. They carried out such attack only to divide the party." bdnew
