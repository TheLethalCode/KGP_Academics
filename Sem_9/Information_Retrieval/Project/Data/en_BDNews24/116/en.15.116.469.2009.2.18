 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Wednesday sent to jail former state minister Ziaul Haque Zia after he was arrested by Rapid Action Battalion earlier in the day at a Mohammadpur residence in the capital. The Special Judge's Court-4 ordered him into Dhaka Central Jail dismissing his appeal for bail after he was taken to the court at around 2:15pm. He told judge Jesmin Anwar," I did not harm BNP or Awami League. I am very sick. I have come from abroad to seek justice in the cases." Zia claimed that he did not have much asset and added that his son owned a gas station. He had built a house on a plot taken from the government, he further said. His lawyers asked for bail but the public prosecutor opposed. Mohammadpur police chief Afizul Islam said the BNP leader, a fugitive convict sentenced to 31 years in prison in three cases, had eight cases pending against him. He was picked up from the first floor of the house, 10/B/1, of an Islami Bank official near the 'Geneva Camp' at Mohammedpur. He went to stay at the house on Friday. Zia had fled the country during emergency rule. He returned home recently evading immigration authorities at Zia International Airport before going into hiding, Islam said. In July last year, the then-fugitive BNP leader was sentenced to 13 years in a graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The former state minister was convicted of amassing Tk 12.81 crore beyond his known sources of income and concealing Tk 5.36 crore in his wealth statement submitted to the ACC. The former state minister, his wife and son have also been convicted of tax evasion. bdnews24.
