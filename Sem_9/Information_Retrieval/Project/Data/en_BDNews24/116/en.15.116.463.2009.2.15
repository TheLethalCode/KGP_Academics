 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain will use a range of options to deal with the banking crisis, finance minister Alistair Darling has said, as heavy losses at a unit of Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) led to a sharp drop in its share price. Part-nationalized Lloyds said its HBOS unit made a pretax loss of 8.5 billion pounds ($12.3 billion) last year due to a bigger-than-expected rise in bad loans, wiping a third off its value and raising fears more state help will be needed. Asked repeatedly whether nationalization of Lloyds was a possibility, Darling avoided giving a direct answer. "I said in January there is a range of options that we will be deploying, a range of levers that can be pulled to help all banks, because I have made it very, very clear that the integrity of the banking system is very, very important," he said in a BBC interview late on Friday. "What we are focusing on at the moment is making sure that we can identify these bad assets and then deal with that problem," he said, speaking from the G7 summit in Italy. "What we have got to do now is for banks - whether or not we have got shareholdings in them - to identify the problems they have got ... and to get those bad assets out of the system, because until you do that then you will continue to find that banks will not lend," he said. Britain announced a second, multi-billion pound bank rescue plan in January, allowing banks to insure themselves against losses on their riskiest assets and setting up a fund to buy high-quality securities to get cash flowing again. Earlier this month, Darling said Britain had not closed the door on setting up a so-called "bad bank" to ring-fence toxic assets. Vince Cable, finance spokesman for the opposition Liberal Democrats, said earlier that it looked increasingly likely that Lloyds would now go into majority public ownership, followed by full nationalization. HBOS, seen as vulnerable to the global credit crisis because it depended on wholesale borrowing for much of its funding, agreed to be bought by Lloyds TSB in September last year. The government-brokered deal was made possible by a one-off waiver of British competition rules. The government owns a 43 percent stake, after supplying 17 billion pounds ($24.57 billion) to the enlarged group. Lloyds said on Friday its Lloyds TSB unit made a profit of about 1.3 billion pounds, including write-downs of 1.3 billion pounds. The company also said the combined group had a core tier 1 capital ratio -- a key measure of capital strength -- of between 6 percent and 6.5 percent, "significantly ahead" of the regulatory minimum
