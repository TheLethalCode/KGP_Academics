 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  The finals of the Citycell National Women's Football Championship will get underway on Wednesday in Dhaka with eight districts taking part in the inaugural edition. Eight teams split into two groups will play each other with the top two advancing to the Feb 26 semi-finals both scheduled to take place at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, said organisers at the Bangladesh Football Federation House on Monday. "To make the championship competitive, we have kept two zonal champions and as many zonal runners-up in a group and the other group follows the same format," said Sirajul Islam Bachchu, chairman of the BFF Women's Committee, at the press conference. "After the four zonal competitions, many districts have shown their interest in women's football and we hope the number of teams will increase in the championship," said Bachchu, also a BFF executive member. State Minister for Youth and Sports Ahad Ali Sarker will declare the meet open with Bangladesh Ansar taking on Rajshahi District at the BNS. About 25 districts divided into four zones had earlier played in the preliminary round and the zonal championships and the zonal runners-up from each venue to qualify for the finals. Bachchu said that a five-member committee, headed by BFF technical director Shahidur Rahman Shantoo, had been formed to hunt the players for the national team, which would play in India and Nepal in the future. The champions will get Tk 40,000 while the runners-up receive Tk 20,000. The losing semi-finalists will also be awarded Tk 5,000 each.
