<TEXT>
 MINGORA, Pakistan Wed Feb 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A radical cleric who led a struggle for Islamic law in Pakistan's troubled Swat valley began a "peace march" on Wednesday to persuade the Taliban to stop fighting, two days after he reached an accord with the government. Maulana Sufi Mohammad was released last year after spending six years in prison for leading thousands of fighters into Afghanistan in a vain attempt to help the Taliban repel US-backed backed forces. "I ask you to remain peaceful. We have reached an agreement with the provincial government and Nizam-e-Adl (Islamic system of justice) will soon be enforced here," Mohammad told several thousand followers gathered in Mingora, the main town in Swat. "People will soon start getting justice and there will be a durable peace," he said as an army vehicle with a mounted machine gun patrolled the town's central bazaar. Bespectacled with a snow white beard, henna-tinted hair poking from beneath his black turban, Mohammad strode through the town followed by supporters, many waving black and white flags. The marchers, most also wearing black turbans, were expected to drive to meet Taliban leaders at their stronghold in the village of Matta, some 18 km (11 miles) away. No-one carried weapons and there were no signs of any security for the march, though vehicles entering Mingora were checked by Taliban fighters. US officials have expressed dismay privately to Pakistani officials over the decision to concede to the Islamists' demands for sharia, although in practise the laws are unlikely to be applied severely as there are no new judges being appointed. They fear it will encourage the Taliban to believe militancy will succeed both in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where President Barack Obama has began reinforcing US troops. But Pakistan is under immense pressure domestically. Between 250,000 and 500,000 people have fled Swat since Fazlullah launched a campaign of violence, and at least 1,200 civilians have been killed in the region just 130 km (80 miles) from Islamabad, and once a tourist paradise. President Asif Ali Zardari will only sign off on the deal to implement an Islamic system of justice across the Malakand division of North West Frontier Province, which includes Swat, if peace is genuinely restored, aides said. DOUBTS PEACE WILL LAST The government freed Mohammad in the hope the old rebel would persuade his even more radical son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, to halt an insurrection that began in late 2007. The Taliban announced a 10-day ceasefire the night before Mohammad's representatives struck a deal with the provincial government of North West Frontier Province. "Maulana Sufi Mohammad's presence here is a blessing for the people of Swat as we can now hope for peace in the valley," said Zahoor Ahmed, a farmer who had come to town to join the rally. Pakistan's civilian leaders, elected a year ago in a vote ending more than eight years of rule under former army chief general Pervez Musharraf, inherited a state struggling to hold back Islamist insurgencies across the northwest. The exodus of families from Swat accelerated in mid-2008 as an earlier peace deal fell apart and the Taliban took more control. The Taliban began exercising summary executions and amputations in public, and carried out a campaign against female education by torching girls' schools. Officials say there was consensus that a compromise was the best option to pacify Swat and bring it back under the writ of the state, while the army fights the militants in Bajaur, Mohmand and other tribal regions closer to the Afghan border. Some analysts doubt Mohammad can rein in Fazlullah for long, as the younger man is believed to have fallen under the spell of other Taliban factions and al Qaeda. Mohammad led an armed uprising in 1994 for the restoration of sharia, Islamic law, in Swat, and again challenged authorities in 1999 with protests over the government's failure to honour agreements, but he forsook militancy after his release in 2008. Analysts said it was hard to make out whether the people of Swat were happy Mohammad has won another promise of Islamic law, or just relieved at the prospects for peace. "Life had almost ended for us in Swat, but now we can see a ray of hope," said Mohammad Rafq, 38, a villager in Matta
