<TITLE> Fan pressure getting to Drenthe, says Real coach Ramos </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid winger Royston Drenthe was left out of the last three squads at his own request after being heckled by home fans at the Bernabeu last month, coach Juande Ramos has said. "Drenthe's suffering from anxiety. He's a young lad that needs all the support of the people who work with him," Ramos told radio station Cadena Ser. "As his coach I will do all I can to help him because he has a lot of potential." The Dutch youth international, 21, was whistled and mocked by Real fans during their 1-0 home win over Deportivo Coruna on Jan. 25, and was visibly upset after the game. He was left out of the squads against Numancia, Racing Santander and Sporting Gijon and last Friday appealed to his own fans to get behind him. "I don't like to feel like I am playing at the Nou Camp or another rival's stadium when I am playing at home," he told sports daily Marca. "When the fans are unhappy you notice it and it makes it harder to perform well." The champions have won their last eight matches on the trot and are 10 points behind Primera Liga leaders Barcelona in second place
