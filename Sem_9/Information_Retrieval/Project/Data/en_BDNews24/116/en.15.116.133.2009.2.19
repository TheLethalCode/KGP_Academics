<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board is apparently sweating over the selection of the venue for the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup's opening ceremony and inaugural match. BCB senior vice president Mahbub Anam and director Shafiqur Rahman Munna proposed to host the opening ceremony and opening match of the cricket extravaganza at different venues and dates. Both of them attended the meeting of the Central Organising Committee of the World Cup in New Delhi on Feb. 17 and briefed journalists on the meeting outcome at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Thursday. They said they did not name the venues. "We have proposed two separate dates and venues for the opening ceremony (Feb. 18) and inaugural match (Feb. 19) to the Central Organising Committee (COC) meeting. "We hope our proposal will be accepted," said Anam. It had been learnt from the COC meeting that the opening ceremony and inaugural match would be held at a single venue on Feb. 19, 2011. Anam said of the 15 venues, 14 (co-hosts India's eight, Pakistan's four and Sri Lanka's two) have already been finalised and the lone venue of Bangladesh had yet to be decided. The BCB senior vice president said they would finalise the venue after having a discussion with the government. The press conference started an hour behind schedule as state minister for sports Ahad Ali Sarkar suddenly visited the home of cricket in Mirpur. Before leaving the stadium, Sarkar said the government had a desire to host the opening ceremony of the World Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium. "We want to host the opening ceremony of the World Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium, but everything will be finalised after a discussion with prime minister," the sports minister said. Cricket was shifted to Mirpur from the BNS in early 2005 when the then government allotted Mirpur for cricket and the BNS was set aside for football and other national events. Many organisers, some of whom are now BCB directors, took to the streets against government's moves as it was believed that the cricket was shifted to Mirpur only because of stadium's name "Bangabandhu". Bangladesh was lagging behind India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan in preparations to stage the tournament, Munna said at the briefing. "If the budget to prepare the venues is approved in two months, it will take one year to complete work," said Munna, also chairman of the BCB grounds and facilities committee. b
