<TITLE> ICC lauds Antigua test, to discuss pitch fiasco </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) will discuss ways to avoid any repeat of the pitch fiasco in Antigua last week which forced the second test between England and West Indies to be abandoned as a draw. "We never want a repeat of that situation and next week we will start the process of seeing what lessons we can learn from it when the matter will be discussed by the ICC chief executives' committee in Johannesburg," chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement on Friday. The test was abandoned after 10 balls after the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was deemed unfit and dangerous for play after just 10 balls on Friday. The hastily-arranged third test ended in a dramatic draw on Thursday at the nearby Antigua Recreation Ground, the old test venue, after last-wicket pair of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards hung on for 10 tense overs to help West Indies maintain a 1-0 lead. Lorgat praised the organisers for staging the third test at less than two days' notice. "After such a thrilling match I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who made it possible," he said. "A week ago we were all downcast after that disastrous abandonment which brought a great deal of unwanted negative publicity to the game. 'All these people typified the great spirit of cricket, made Thursday's exciting conclusion possible and every cricket fan that enjoyed the match and the finish will be grateful for their efforts.
