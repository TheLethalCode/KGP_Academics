<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb. 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea said on Sunday that Manchester City had made an enquiry about buying John Terry last year but the Londoners made it clear that their captain was not leaving Stamford Bridge. "We made it very clear that John was not for sale. We did not entertain any further conversation on the subject and nor will we in the future," chief executive Peter Kenyon told www.chelseafc.com in a statement released in the wake of media speculation over a possible move for the defender. "John is our captain and the captain of England. He is part of the heart and soul of Chelsea." Terry said: "Chelsea told me what had happened with the enquiry as a courtesy. I was very happy with their reaction as mine would have been the same. "I have always said that I want to end my career at the club which I love and we all see no reason why that cannot happen.
