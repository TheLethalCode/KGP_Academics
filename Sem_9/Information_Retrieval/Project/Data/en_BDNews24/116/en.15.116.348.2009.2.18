The hand-made doll was first made to cheer up a friend who lost a "massive amount of money" in the alleged $50 billion Ponzi fraud by Wall Street investment manager Madoff, said its designer Graeme Warring. Warring is also the president of Modelworks, which runs the action figures unit. Selling for nearly $100, the Bernie "He Made Off With My Money" Madoff action figure was handcrafted in the Philippines. He comes with a limited edition hammer that Warring said he spray-painted to match the doll. The hammer is to "pulverize Bernie Madoff," posters and the action figure unit's website said. Warring's friend, an Australian in his 40s who lives in San Francisco, did derive a few laughs out of it. The toy became so popular at the annual Toy Fair exhibition that it far outshined other Modelworks toys, Warring said. Passers-by at the event stopped to look at the doll, two of which have already been smashed to bits during demonstrations.
