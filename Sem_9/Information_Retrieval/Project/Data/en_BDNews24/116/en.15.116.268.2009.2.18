<TITLE> Global crisis may still hit Bangladesh: Chhibber </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  UNDP's assistant administrator Ajay Chhibber Wednesday said the global economic crisis could yet hit the Bangladesh economy in near future but promised continued UN support. Wrapping up his four-day visit to Bangladesh, Chhibber, also a UN assistant secretary-general, said he did not see any possibility of foreign aid to Bangladesh shrinking. "While the impact on Bangladesh had been limited so far, it could be more strongly felt in the future," Chhibber told journalists at a press conference at Hotel Sonargaon before leaving Dhaka. "In the next phase, there will be potential challenge for Bangladesh economy. "Hope for the best but be prepared. The international news gets worse every day," he warned. He said Bangladesh did not feel the heat of the global financial crisis as its banks were not so linked with the international financial system while the stock markets had a very small amount of foreign investment. Chhibber said consumers switched to low-cost Bangladeshi products since the global economic recession started in the developed world, but the advantage might go in coming days. "Developed countries are the markets of the Bangladeshi products. Slow economic activities will affect Bangladesh economy in future. "Already there are some indications of slowing the remittance flows in the country. Again, a good number of people are coming back," said Chhibber who met the prime minister, parliament speaker, chief election commissioner, finance minister, foreign minister, law minister, LGDR minister and other government officials. "I don't think the foreign aid will come down," he said and hoped the aid flow for Bangladesh would increase in future.
