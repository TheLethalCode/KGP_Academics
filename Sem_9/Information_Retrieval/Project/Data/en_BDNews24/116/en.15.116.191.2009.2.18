 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Biman and Old DOHS jointly topped the table of the Premier Division Cricket League with their fourth straight wins on Wednesday. Holders Abahani also recorded their third win in four matches when they handed Partex Sporting Club a massive 111-run defeat at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Biman also inflicted a huge 106-run defeat on Victoria Sporting Club at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground while DOHS defeated title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club by 38 runs at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Abahani vs Partex Electing to bat, Abahani openers Tamim Iqbal and Rony Talukdar put on 120 runs in quick time for the first wicket before Tamim fell to Rezaul for 53 off 87 balls studded with four fours. Rony and Imran Ahmed then took the side to 162 before the latter was dismissed also by Rezaul for a 28-ball 10. Rony was eventually run out by a substitute fielder Rizivi one run short of what would have been a deserved century. His 96-ball innings featured 11 fours and one six. Indian Venu Gopal (52), Shahagir Hossain (36) and Ziaur Rahman (32) played some quick knocks as Abahani posted 91 runs in the last 10 overs to finish on 289-6 in 50 overs. In reply, Partex were reduced to 11-4 after a fiery spell from pacman Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who bagged four for 15. Partex managed 179-7 in reply with only Rezaul Haq offering any resistance. Before becoming Mashrafee's fourth victim, he made 91 off 137 balls that included eight fours and two sixes. DOHS vs MSC Skipper Mehrab Hossain Junior led DOHS from the front with a fine 96 to help his side post a challenge total of 251 all out in 50 overs after deciding to bat. Opener Imtiaz Hossain got the DOHS innings off a brisk start with a blistering 42 off just 23 balls while middle order batsmen Kafi Khan and Abul Hasan chipped in with identical 32. Mohammedan captain Suhrawardi Shuvo grabbed three for 33 while Sajedul Islam took 2-64. Mohammedan, in reply, were reduced to 44-4 for before Marshal Ayub came to the crease to raise hopes of a fight back. Ayub made 81 off 106 balls but he hardly got any support from his team-mates and they fell 39 runs short of the target. Pacer Abdul Bashar cleaned up the tail to return three for 45. Biman vs Victoria Batting first, Biman made a modest 216-9 thanks to a 55-run knock from Mushfiqur Rahman.
