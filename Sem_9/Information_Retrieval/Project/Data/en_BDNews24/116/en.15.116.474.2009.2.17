 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka will host the inaugural match and the opening ceremony of the 2011 ICC World Cup on Feb. 19, said a BCB official on Tuesday. Bangladesh Cricket Board media committee chairman Jalal Younus told bdnews24.com the ICC meeting on Tuesday decided to stage both the inaugural match and opening ceremony on Feb 19, 2011. It had earlier decided that Bangladesh would organise the opening ceremony of the cricket extravaganza and the co-hosts are now set to stage the inaugural match as well. Younus said that the opening ceremony would be a one-and-half hour programme and then the inaugural match would take place. The BCB spokesman informed that BCB senior vice-president Mahbubul Anam and director Shafiqur Rahman Munna attended the ICC meeting in New Delhi. Representatives of the ICC, including chief executive Haroon Lorgat, also attended the meeting to discuss ongoing plans for the ICC World Cup 2011, which will take place in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in two years' time. "Among other things, it was decided that subject to final ICC Board approval, the opening ceremony for the event would take place in Bangladesh on 19 February 2011 and the tournament would be shorter than the one that took place in the West Indies in 2007," said ICC press release available here. The statement also said that the meeting also discussed the issue of safety and security. bd
