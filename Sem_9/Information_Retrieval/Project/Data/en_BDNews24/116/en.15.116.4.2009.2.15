 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Sunday granted four months' bail to former chief conservator of forests Osman Gani in a corruption case.

A special court on June 5, 2008, sentenced Gani to 13 years' imprisonment for amassing illegal wealth and concealing information in a wealth statement submitted to the Anticorruption Commission. The court also fined him Tk 10 lakh and ordered the authorities to confiscate wealth worth Tk 1.80 crore belonging to Gani and and Tk 2.80 crore and 270 tolas of gold ornaments belonging to his wife.

A HC bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir Hossain and Md. Azizul Haque granted bail Sunday upon Gani's application moved for him by Barrister Moudud Ahmed.
