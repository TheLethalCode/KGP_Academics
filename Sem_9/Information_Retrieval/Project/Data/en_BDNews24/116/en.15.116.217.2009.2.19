 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnew24.com)  A visiting ADB official says Bangladesh's export earnings could take a hit in the coming fiscal year. Exports could feel the impact of the global recession in 2009-10 as the country's overseas markets are feeling the blow, Frederick C Roche, visiting ADB deputy director general for South Asia, told bdnews24.com on Thursday. He also said the bank would extend financial help to Bangladesh, if needed, to counter any recession impact. Roche, who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on a four-day trip, spoke to bdnews24.com after a meeting with finance minister AMA Muhith. "We discussed the macro-economic situation of the country," said Roche. He said Bangladesh was still free from the impact of the recession. "The situation here is still manageable and under control," he said. "But if Bangladesh needs any help to overcome this situation, we will assist." Roche forecast that the country would be free from negative effects till June of this year. "But the world situation changes everyday," he said, adding the impact may be felt in the coming 2009-2010 fiscal year. To face that impact Bangladesh must start to prepare now, said the ADB official. He said a negative impact on the readymade garments industry could result in significant unemployment. The government should move to protect garment workers' jobs by offering necessary incentives in the sector, said Roche. The finance minister told bdnews24.com, "We are noticing a slight impact of the global economic crisis on exports of frozen food, readymade garments and a few other sectors." But, Muhith said, the government has already formed a task force to evaluate the recession impact. "The first meeting of the task force will be held next month," he said. On seeking help from international agencies, Muhith said, "We are still not thinking on that line and will only go for foreign help after evaluation of the overall situation by the task force." Roche identified eradication of poverty, bringing food prices down to a tolerable level and job creation as the main challenges facing Bangladesh. bdnews
