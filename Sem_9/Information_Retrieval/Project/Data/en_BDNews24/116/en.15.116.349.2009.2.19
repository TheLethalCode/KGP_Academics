 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering licensing more private news channels, information minister Abul Kalam Azad told parliament on Thursday. "Considering the demands of the population, scope for more private news channels is being examined," said Azad in reply to a question by Chittagong-3 MP ABM Abul Kashem. "We are working on a policy and approval for new channels will be considered as soon as possible after completing the policy, " Azad said. Asked whether the government was considering with respect to channels that received licenses during the past BNP-led regime, the information minister said, "We will consider how those TV channels are running in light of the new policy, what are their sources of income, who are the directors." "After scrutiny, we will decide which channels will be continued or scrapped." On a query from Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haq Chunnu, Azad said, "The Indian channels are being aired in our country. The necessary steps will be taken to televise our channels in West Bengal." "There has been a discussion on the issue with the foreign ministry." On another query from Chittagong-10 MP M Abdul Latif, the information minister said that a committee had already been formed to amend the existing policy of the censor board in a bid to bring movies in digital format under the policy. Azad said that as many as 575 daily newspapers were published every day and of them, 241 were published from the district of Dhaka. b
