<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition party BNP has demanded an end to negative publicity against opposition leader and party chairperson Khaleda Zia, while she is absent from parliament. "Ruling party MPs have been engaged in malicious gossip in the House about the leader of the opposition and her family members," said BNP general secretary Khandaker Delwar Hossain at a press briefing Wednesday. Delwar asked the ruling party to refrain from such activities, which are against parliamentary procedure. In a separate press briefing in parliament in the afternoon, BNP chief whip Jainal Abdin Faruk also protested the verbal "attacks" on Khaleda. Citing Section 270 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, which bars any negative statement against an MP while they are absent from the House, Jainal called on the speaker to expunge an "attacking statement" against Khaleda. On Feb. 16, Rajbari-2 MP Zillur Hakim in a supplementary question asked the finance minister whether the government would investigate Khaleda's visit to Saudi Arabia, allegedly taking with her "400 suitcases of money and gold ornaments" and the Singapore account of her younger son Arafat Rahman. Delwar said that these questions were "outside the jurisdiction of the procedural guidelines" of parliament. Saying that the main question was on the accounts of former ministers and MPs of the four-party government frozen by the caretaker government, Delwar said that the supplementary question was "irrelevant" and aimed at "degrading Khaleda Zia and her family". He also requested the speaker to omit the supplementary question from the work description of parliament. Instead of concentrating on the deteriorating law and order situation, faltering economy and smuggling of fertiliser, the government is adopting strategies to ensure that the opposition does not go to parliament, said Delwar. "BNP wants to go back to parliament and we shall do so if our previous seating arrangement is reinstated." Responding to a question, Delwar said the government has to ensure a situation conducive to the opposition returning to parliament. "A parliament without opposition is ineffective," observed Delwar. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and others attended the press briefing. bdnews24.com
