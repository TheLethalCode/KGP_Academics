<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) - The Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission, an international and independent fact-finding mission, has called for government intervention including rationing through general dealers instead of the army to tackle the region's food deficit. A visiting delegation of the commission, led by its co-chairman Lord Eric Avebury, met food minister Abdur Razzak on Monday. The two talked about implementation of the peace accord in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the outcome of the recent Geneva meeting on human rights in Bangladesh and the food crisis faced by the people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, said the UK's Lord Avebury. The food minister said the implementation of the CHT peace accord was "a very dear issue to us because it was signed in 1996 during the rule of the AL government". The minister said the government has taken an initiative to form a Hill Tract Land Commission to restore land to the indigenous communities. "The prime minister has given an order for the fast formation of this commission." Avebury said the present rationing system regulated by the army left a lot of people in the region deprived of the facility. With the presence of the army, the overall situation resembles that of a war, which needs to come to an end, he said. Local government representatives need to be involved, he added. Dhaka University professor Meghna Guhathakurta and barrister Sarah Hossain were also part of the Commission delegation. bdnew
