 Jahangirnagar, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Five people took bullets as gunfire between two rival Bangladesh Chhatra League factions broke out at Jahangirnagar University on Monday, university officials and witnesses said. The vice chancellor has called an emergency syndicate meeting, said university officials, while police sent reinforcements on the campus. The student activists also manhandled proctor Prof Nasir Uddin and ransacked his and another teacher's residence, said the authorities. The central committee of the Awami League-backed student body suspended all Chhatra League activities at the university for a month on Jan. 18, following clashes between BCL and BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal over campus control. Monday's clashes occurred between one BCL group occupying four of the halls on the campus and another "rebel BCL group" occupying two other halls, said the witnesses. Officials of the university medical centre said they were treating five people injured by bullets, one of whom was sent to Dhaka for further treatment. The bdnews24.com correspondent said the violence erupted as a member of one BCL faction was beaten in front of the Arts Building around 11am, leaving him grievously wounded. As news of the assault spread, the two feuding groups faced off around midday, engaging in a shootout for about half an hour during which some 10 to 12 rounds of gunfire were heard. They engaged in another phase of shootout at around 2:30pm. University medical centre's doctor Shamsul Alam Liton said Chhatra League activist 'Shuvo', who received a cut injury in the head, was rushed to Squire Hospital. Another activist, 'Sagar', who took a bullet in the stomach, was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. When proctor Prof Nasir tried to pacify the feuding Chhatra League groups, one group scolded and shoved him, witnesses said. They also called the proctor a BNP man and demanded his resignation. The same group had earlier ransacked the proctor and another teacher's residences. Both groups carrying firearms were in confrontational positions at around 4pm, said witnesses. But Savar police superintendent Jahangir Alam denied that the students were still armed. "No one is carrying or exhibiting any weapons," he said. The policeman said the halls maybe searched as a next step. "Hundreds of police personnel are currently stationed on the campus," he added. Sohel Pervez, JU Chatra League president, claimed Monday's events were an attempt to "destabilise" the campus. "This violence has occurred on the eve of the withdrawal of the suspension on Chhatra League activities to destabilise the situation further," he told bdnews24.com. Sohel claimed that his men had not launched any attack on the proctor's house. bdnews24.com/c
