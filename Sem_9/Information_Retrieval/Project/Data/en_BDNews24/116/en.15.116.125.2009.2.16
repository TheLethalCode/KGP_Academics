<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Jahangirnagar University students were locked in a gun battle Monday, witnesses saying the clashes occurred between two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League whose activities were banned on the campus following violence last month. The clashes sparked off between one BCL group occupying four of the halls on campus and another under the banner of a "rebel" BCL group occupying two other halls, said witnesses on campus. The feuding students engaged in a shootout for about half an hour from midday, during which some 10 to 12 rounds of gunfire were heard. Both groups carrying firearms were still in confrontational positions at around 2pm, said witnesses. bdnews24.com JU correspondent reports the violence was sparked as a member of one BCL faction was beaten in front of the Arts Building around 11am, leaving him grievously wounded. As news of the assault spread, BCL activists of Mir Mosharraf Hossain, AL Beruni, Shahid Salam Barkat and AFM Kamal Uddin Halls came out looking for the offenders from the "rebel BCL faction" of Bangabandhu and Bhashani Halls. The latter group took up positions in front of Bhashani Hall, and eventually opened fire in presence of police posted there. When JU proctor Prof Nasir Uddin was contacted, he told bdnews24.com: "I am very busy now. I'll talk to you later." bdnews24.com also called Ashulia police chief Rafiqul Islam and assistant police super Jahangir Alam, but neither would receive the calls. The central committee of the Awami League-backed BCL suspended all Chhatra League activities at JU on Jan 18, following clashes between BCL and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal over campus control. bdnews24.c
