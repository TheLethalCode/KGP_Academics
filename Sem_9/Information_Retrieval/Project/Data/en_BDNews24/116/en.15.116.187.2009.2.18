<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for home affairs Tanzim Ahmed Sohel Wednesday said "a certain quarter" was trying to upset security. Asked about the law and order, and the violence at Jahangirnagar University, he said, "We are working to establish fair justice. It is very important to establish fair justice for a country to go ahead. "But a quarter is trying to create disruptions so that we cannot move ahead," he said after a meeting of the monitoring cell on serious cases. About the incident at the university, Sohel said, "We have taken immediate steps. Immediately after the incident, we conducted room-to-room searches and those guilty have been arrested. "Through it, we let it be known whoever the terrorist nobody will be let off." About the alleged inertia of RAB and police since the government took over, the junior minister said, "Such allegation is not true. After the incumbent government took over, RAB and police patrols have been doubled because it is the responsibility of the government to ensure security of every citizen. "We are working with that objective in mind. But it is also true that there is nothing to feel complacent about law and order. "A crime-free condition cannot be expected anywhere in the preset-day world. Our target is to go one step forward in maintaining law and order. Nobody is being let off." Sohel said the monitoring cell discussed investigations and settlements of serious cases. Chargesheets of nine serious cases were given, he said and added that there was good progress in 10 other serious cases. Chargesheets given in the cases included grenade attack on Bangla New Year at Ramna, Babu murder in Paltan, bomb attack on the meeting of Suranjit Sengupta in Sunamganj, expatriate Faruque and his maid-servant murders in Banani and teacher Mahbuba Huq murder in Khilgaon.. Besides, there has been much headway in 10 cases including SAMS Kibria murder, bomb attack at Udichi rally in Jessore, maid-servant murder at the house of former minister Akbar Hossain, murder of former vice chancellor of the National University Aftab Ahmed and the killing of Awami League leader of Khulna Khan Ibn Zaman. Decisions were made to investigate the murders of NTV video editor Atikul Islam and of Purabi in Lalbagh whose body was cut into 15 pieces, the state minister said. In the next meeting, some other cases including these two would be discussed, he added said. Presided over by home minister Sahara Khatun, the meeting was, among others, attended by home secretary Abdul Karim and RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khondakar. b
