 Aminur Rahman Russell bdnews24.com Jahangirnagar University correspondent Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Chhatra League Tuesday dissolved the Jahangirnagar University unit after bloody clashes Monday over control of residential halls, the BCL president told bdnews24.com. Mahmud Hasan Ripon, the BCL president, said those who perpetrated the violence would be disciplined by the organisation. He said they asked university authorities to take academic and legal actions against the perpetrators. The ruling Awami League's student wing at an emergency meeting of the executive committee in the evening expelled Azibur Rahman, and Adnan Bhuiyan Ayon for three months, general secretary Mahmudul Haider Chowdhury Loton told bdnews24.com. Azibur is the leader of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall and Ayon of Maulana Bhashani Hall. The general secretary of the dissolved committee, Mahmud Naser Johnny, said the central body was yet to inform them of the decision on dissolution. "I, however, heard about the dissolution of the committee from people," Johnny said. Azibur earlier in the day had welcomed the dissolution. "The central body has taken a well thought-out decision. Now there will be a new committee here, and we hope that will be led by honest, competent and regular students," he said. Naming his rivals Azibur and Ayon, Johnny said, "With the break-up of the committee, the motive of the conspirators became successful." Central leaders of the Awami League-backed student body initially suspended BCL activities at the university for a month on Jan. 18 following clashes with other student bodies. Two BCL factions, whose activities were banned on the campus following violence last month, fought gun battles Monday, witnesses said. The clashes sparked off between one BCL group occupying four of the halls on the campus and another "rebel" group occupying two other halls, they added. At least five people took bullets and 16 others received other injuries during the firefight, witnesses said. One feuding faction of Jahangirnagar University's unit took control of all the residential halls Tuesday in defiance of a central committee decision on suspension of its activities on the campus. Reached for his reaction, acting vice-chancellor professor Md Muniruzzaman declined comments, saying it was an internal affair of the BCL. Twenty-four people were picked up over the clashes, Ashulia Police Station's sub-inspector Sheikh Shahidul Islam said. He said 20 students were detained from Maulana Bhasani Hall and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall Monday night. Four more were detained from the Maulana Bhasani Hall Tuesday morning. Among them, 10 were sent to jail pending trial after they had been shown arrested in the case filed by Sohel Parvez, a student leader. Sub-inspector Shafiul Alam of Savar Police Station, also investigation officer of the case, said those held under detention are Abir, Rabiul Bashar, Quazi Mahmudul Haq, Mahbubul Alam, Ziaul Haq, SM Mahbubul Alam, Almas Ali, Farhadul Islam, Shibbir Talukdar and Tanjimul Haq Mollah. The other detainees were set free after interrogation, Shahidul added. bdnews2
