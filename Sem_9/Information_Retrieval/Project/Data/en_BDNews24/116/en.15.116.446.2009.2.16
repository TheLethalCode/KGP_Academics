<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government will float shares of 40 more state-owned companies on the capital market, the finance minister said in the parliament Monday. "Investors have less scope to invest as there are less supply of basic securities in the country's capital market," AMA Muhith said in the question-answer session. "Besides, it is not possible to attract institutional investors, as the listed companies have small capital. "To overcome the situation, the process of offloading shares of 40 state-owned companies is at different stages now," the minister said. The government already listed the shares of five such companies on the stock exchange. The minister further said the government was also going to set up a 'clearing corporation' to exchange securities online and make it smoother. The government, he said, would form a surveillance team to safeguard the interest of the investors, and identify market manipulation and breach of capital market laws. Replying to another query, Muhith said the government would see whether it will investigate the allegation against former prime minister Khaleda Zia that she had taken a huge amount of money and ornaments with her to Saudi Arabia to perform Omrah there. The money of Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco confiscated in Singapore would be brought back after the resolution of the ongoing case against him with the district court in Columbia, USA, Muhith said. He said Bangladesh received $ 8,979 million in remittance in 2008, with the highest $ 2,733.63 million coming from Saudi Arabia. The foreign reserves until Feb. 5 is $ 5,670 million, he said. The minister said the National Board of Revenue, while investigating income tax-dodge charges, put a freeze on drawing funds from accounts of 398 people or institutions. Tax-evasion cases have been filed against 39 people or institutions with special courts. Verdicts have been delivered in 15 cases and the NBR has received certified copies of 12 verdicts. Orders have been given to seize nearly Tk 21.50 crore in eight cases, he added. According to a temporary account of the NBR, Tk 22,382.48 crore was earned in revenue until Dec. 2008 of the current 2008-09 fiscal, Muhith said. He said the Anticorruption Commission did not seize any account on charges of graft and irregularities during the tenure of the last caretaker government. The government was yet to decide about cancellation of certificate cases against farmers for default on their loan repayments. bdnews24.c
