<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  A review committee on repealing political cases is moving to cancel cases filed under previous governments for "harassment of politicians", the law minister said on Tuesday. "If any political leaders think cases were filed against them for political harassment they can apply to special scrutiny panels for quashing the cases," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after the first meeting of the review committee at the Secretariat. The four-member district-level scrutiny panels, led by district magistrates, will also comprise a police super, additional district magistrate and public prosecutor. On what terms and how many cases might be quashed, he said: "One can apply for cancelling any cases filed for political harassment by any past government. But the number is not fixed." "Politicians can apply within 45 days of the government gazette to notify today's decision," said the minister. "After scrutiny, the panels will send the applications to a central committee within another 45 days for further steps," said Shafiq. The central six-member body, headed by the law minister, will review the reports sent by the district-level panels. On how long it would take to repeal the cases after application, Shafiq said there was "no particular time line". "Millions of cases are jamming the trial courts," the law minister said, when asked why the committee decided on the move to quash such cases instead of relying on the courts. Asked pointedly when the country might be rid of the culture of a new government withdrawing cases filed by previous governments, Shafiq said: "Our government believes in rule of law. I think no political case will be filed during our rule." The minister said cases withdrawn during the past four-party alliance government would not be reviewed again. He evaded answering directly to a query on whether the state would give any compensation to the victims of 'political harassment cases'. "Action will be taken in line with the law," said the law minister. Home minister Sahara Khatun, LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam, state minister for law Quamrul Islam and state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed were present at Tuesday's review committee meeting. bdnews4
