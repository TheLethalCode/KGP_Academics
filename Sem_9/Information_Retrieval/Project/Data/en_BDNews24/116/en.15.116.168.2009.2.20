<TITLE> Iran slows atom plant growth but fuel stockpile jumps </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Vienna, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has slowed the expansion of its uranium enrichment plant but has built up a stockpile of nuclear fuel, an International Atomic Energy Agency report said on Thursday. The U.N. watchdog said Iran had increased the number of centrifuges refining uranium -- a process that can produce fuel for civilian energy or atom bombs -- by only 136 from 3,800 in November. "We see the pace of installing and bringing centrifuges into operation has slowed quite considerably since August," a senior U.N. official said. But Iran's reported stockpile of low-enriched uranium had risen to 1,010 kg from 630 kg in November and 480 kg in August. The heightened output rate suggested existing centrifuges were operating at higher capacity and more glitch-free than before. Western non-proliferation analysts estimate from 1,000 to 1,700 kg would be needed as a basis for conversion into high-enriched uranium to make one bomb and Tehran could reach that threshold within a few months. But it would take Iran another two to five years before it was capable of producing nuclear weapons, IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei said this week. Iran says it is producing nuclear fuel only for civil nuclear energy. Western powers, frustrated by restrictions on IAEA inspections, suspect otherwise. The report said Iran was still boycotting IAEA inspectors looking into Western allegations of past covert atom bomb research. As long as Iran continued to withhold access to documentation, Iranian officials, and sites, the IAEA would be unable to verify whether Iranian nuclear activity was peaceful or not, it said. Tehran says the mainly U.S. intelligence was forged. OBAMA POLICY Progress in the IAEA inquiry, which Iran regards as driven by U.S. pressure, looks unlikely before Iran sees what U.S. President Barack Obama has to offer under his offer of direct talks with adversaries. The IAEA report said aside from the 3,936 centrifuges actively enriching uranium, another 1,476 were undergoing tests without nuclear material in them, and 125 more had been installed but remained stationary. ElBaradei said on Tuesday Iran had not added as many centrifuges recently as it could have and the reason was probably political rather than technical. He was alluding to perceptions Iran may want to give Obama political cover for talks, not provoke harsher U.N. sanctions over its refusal to suspend enrichment. Iran's IAEA ambassador, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said he saw no slackening in Iran's nuclear drive because "you have to see the whole package", including tests at a pilot plant of an advanced centrifuge model able to enrich uranium much faster. He rejected accusations of non-cooperation with the IAEA, saying it was not legally obliged to do so. The IAEA report said Iran was barring inspectors from doing checks at its planned Arak heavy water reactor. Iran had built built a dome at Arak which made it impossible to use of satellite imagery to monitor construction. Western powers fear Iran may use the Arak reactor to derive plutonium from spent fuel rods as another source of atom bomb fuel. Tehran says the complex will be designed to produce isotopes for medicine and agriculture. Britain said the report made clear Iran has not suspended enrichment and London was worrried that Iran had refused inspectors access to Arak. Syria must also provide information about the site and related facilities, a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said.
