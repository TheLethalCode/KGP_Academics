 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)With debate raging on whether those elected to Upazila Parishads should resign their party posts before taking oath, Dhaka and Sylhet divisional commissioners have announced swearing-in of Upazila representatives on Feb 23 and Feb 22. "Oaths must be administered within 30 days under the present ordinance and those elected must relinquish their party posts before swearing-in," Election Commission senior assistant secretary Md Abdul Baten told bdnews24.com on Monday. According to local government laws passed by the caretaker government, all local representatives must resign party posts before taking office. Those who were elected in the Aug 4 2008 city and municipal elections had also to relinquish party posts before taking oath. There is some debate as to whether the provision will remain under a new elected government. "Divisional commissioners will administer oaths," Taslima Kaniz Nahida, senior assistant secretary to the local government ministry, told bdnews24.com. "Sylhet division Upazila representatives will be sworn in on Feb 22 and in Dhaka division on Feb 23, their divisional commissioners have so far informed the ministry," she said. "According to the Upazila Election Ordinance, all oaths have to be concluded by March 12." Nahida said they should all be concluded by end of February. Election results of 447 Upazila, of chairmen, vice chairmen and women vice chairmen, have been gazetted so far. bdnews
