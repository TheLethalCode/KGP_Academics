 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) - The home minister praised the Bangladesh Coast Guard on Saturday for performing well with limited resources and manpower at their 14th founding anniversary. "As land resources are on the decrease, sea resources are on the way to be opened up," said Sahara Khatun. Focusing on the coastguard's role to protect overseas shipments and secure coastal and sea resources, the minister said the law enforcers had to give more attention to ensuring security in the country's two seaports. "To protect the sea resources, the coast guard must be built as a modern and skilled service," Sahara said, speaking at the anniversary programme as chief guest. "I am aware of your problems and limitations," she said. "The government will continue its efforts to solve these." bdnews
