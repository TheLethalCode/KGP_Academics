 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  Experts have suggested extensive monitoring on production and procurement of fertiliser, buffer stock status and policy adjustment for an effective fertliser management. The recommendations came Thursday from a consultative workshop on 'Farm Level Fertiliser Management in Bangladesh', co-organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury came down hard on officials of the government's Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE). "Their monitoring support is more than worse..a few days ago I had to know problems in fertiliser management of a certain area from the local MP." She claimed supply of fertiliser was more or less adequate. "We have been able to distribute urea in every area." Chowdhury said it had been only one and a half months since the new government took over. The minister, however, admitted problems in production and management of fertiliser were still there. She stressed on setting up more fertliser plants and use of organic fertlisers. Matia also criticised promotion of spraying urea by a certain quarter. "It (spraying urea) has no scientific logic but still it has been promoted," she said and urged the news media to promote the right kind of technology. Dr Z Karim in one of the key-note presentations said fertiliser recommendation should be based on a national fertiliser recommendation guide and soil test. Karim, the chairman of the Center for Agri-research and Sustainable Environment & Entrepreneurship Development (CASEED), also focused on periodical and farmgate price reviewing as global prices of fertiliser fluctuated every now and then. Yuji Niino, land management officer of FAO's regional office in Thailand, stressed on constant information flow between farm and policy levels. He also recommended public-private as well as global partnership to enhance production and distribution capacity. The session, presided over by FAO country representative Ad Spijkers was attended by officials of DAE and agriculture ministry.
