 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Two witnesses testified on Wednesday in the August 21 2004 grenade attack case, said court sources, bringing the total to just four depositions to date in the long-protracted trial. Md Solaiman and Md Akkas gave testimony on the deaths of a brother and friend in the brutal grenade attack on an Awami League rally that year. Rickshawpuller Solaiman signed the death certificate of his brother Abdul Hanif, while Md Akkas signed that of Rafikul Islam, a friend of his father, in the wake of the blasts. The depositions were taken by judge Md Masdar Hossain of the Speedy Trial Tribunal 1, and Feb 23 was fixed as the next hearing date. After giving evidence, the witnesses were cross-examined by defence lawyers Abdus Sobhan Tarafdar, Aminul Islam Tito and Morsheduzzaman, representing accused Abdus Salam Pintu, Arif Hassan Sumon and Shahadatullah Jewel respectively. Including Wednesday's depositions, only four witnesses out of a total 408 have testifed to date in the already lengthy trial. Three more witnesses are set to go on the stand on Feb 23. Abdus Salam Pintu, former state minister of the past BNP-led four party government, Mufti Hannan, chief of banned militant outfit Harkatul Jihad, and 12 other accused were produced in court Wednesday from prison. Two separate cases, one under the explosions act and one for murder, were filed after the August 21 2004 grenade attack on the AL rally at Bangabandhu Avenue. On June 11 last year, the CID submitted two charge-sheets against 22 persons in total. Eight of the accused are absconding. bdnews24.
