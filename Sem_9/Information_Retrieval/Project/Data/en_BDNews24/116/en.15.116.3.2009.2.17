 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The UN will assist Bangladesh to retrieve stolen funds laundered overseas, a top UN official said Tuesday. The visiting UN assistant secretary general Ajay Chhibber gave the assurance after a meeting with finance minister AMA Muhith at his office. "The UN will assist if Bangladesh seeks its help to bring back the laundered money," Chhibber told reporters. The finance minister said, "Assistance has already been sought from the US, UK and a few other countries to bring back the money." In addition, he said, Bangladesh was trying to gain membership of EGMOND Group, an international organisation for prevention of money laundering. Muhith said once Bangladesh became a member of the organisation it would have to enter into an agreement with countries to bringing back money siphoned off. On whether the government had specific information on laundered money, the minister said, "We have very little information but the National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh Bank and the Anticorruption Commission have some information." He also said the government had begun sharing information with certain countries. At the meet, the UN resident representative in Bangladesh, Renata Dessalien, was also present. bdne
