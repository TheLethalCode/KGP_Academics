 PARIS, Wed Feb 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy will announce new measures for the poor on Wednesday as mounting violence in the French island of Guadeloupe adds new urgency to his efforts to avoid mass protests on the mainland. A union representative was shot dead and several policemen were wounded by protesters on the Caribbean island overnight as a month-old campaign for pay rises intensified. The government fears that the conflict in Guadeloupe could inspire similar protests in mainland France, where up to 2.5 million people took to the streets on Jan. 29 to protest against Sarkozy's strategy to combat the economic crisis. He announced in December a 26 billion euro ($33 billion) stimulus plan targeting investments and infrastructure spending, but opinion polls show a majority of people want him to do more to protect jobs, boost low wages and stimulate consumption. A BVA survey published on Wednesday in newspaper Les Echos found 60 percent of people thought the government's economic policies were bad. Under a plan announced before the Guadeloupe death, Sarkozy will meet unions on Wednesday to discuss additional measures, and he will make a televised address to the nation later. The stakes are high for the government in a country with a strong protest culture. A massive wave of strikes in 1995, for example, effectively buried a reform plan championed by the government of the day and Sarkozy fears such a scenario. "The challenge is to find solutions to all the social problems without changing our economic strategy," Sarkozy aide Henri Guaino was quoted as saying by the Le Monde newspaper. TAX BREAKS Citing a senior source at the presidency, Le Monde said Sarkozy would announce measures worth 2.6 billion euros, including tax breaks for poor families, cheques for elderly people to hire house help, and a rise in dole money for youths. The unions want a blanket increase in the legal minimum wage, but Sarkozy's margin for manoeuvre is limited by resistance from bosses who say companies battling the crisis can afford no more top ups for staff, and by budgetary constraints. Underlining the pressure on Sarkozy, the European Commission started disciplinary procedures against France on Wednesday for exceeding the EU's budget deficit limit. But the French unions have little patience with such arguments and even before their meeting with Sarkozy they had already planned a new day of strikes and protests on March 19. Sarkozy is struggling to turn the tide of his unpopularity after a disastrous prime time television interview two weeks ago that was supposed to enlighten the French public on his economic strategy. A survey released last week by the Ipsos polling group showed Sarkozy's approval rating plunged to 36 percent after the interview, 11 points down from January and the lowest reading since he won office in 2007. Desperate to keep in touch with the public, Sarkozy will go on television again after Wednesday's negotiations, at around 1900 GMT, but this time he will keep it short and it will not be an interview but an address
