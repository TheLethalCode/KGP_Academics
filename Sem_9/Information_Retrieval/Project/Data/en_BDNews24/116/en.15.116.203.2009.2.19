 KABUL, Thu Feb 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan will seek to take the lead in the war against Taliban insurgents and control foreign aid when its team goes to Washington to present its input for a US regional security review, an official said on Thursday. US President Barack Obama, who has been in office for nearly a month, has made Afghanistan his top foreign policy priority and on Tuesday ordered the dispatch of 17,000 extra troops which would increase the US force size to 55,000 by the summer. Pakistan and Afghanistan, both grappling with spiralling insurgency by the Taliban, are expected to discuss the review before their foreign ministers present their input next week in Washington. "Two key issues will be raised by the Afghan delegation," Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Sultan Ahmad Baheen said. "In addition to the war against terrorism, a focus on development and reconstruction projects, helping us with good governance and democracy," he said. "For Afghans to have the leading role in the war by accelerating the strenghtening of Afghan National Army and its equipment process." He said the two issues had long been part of President Hamid Karzai's requests to the previous Bush administration, but lamented that not much attention had been paid to them. "Since a new page has been opened with America and we have had the opportunity as an ally to raise our points, we are repeating them for we believe they are essential in bringing security," said Baheen. The Afghan delegation will also push for more US focus on targeting militant bases and sanctuaries across the rugged border region in Pakistan, he added. Since US-led troops overthrew the Taliban in 2001, Karzai's government has largely relied on foreign aid and Western troops to bankroll its economy and security. Some charities say hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid have not been spent effectively. Civilian casualties caused by foreign forces while hunting the militants have reduced support for Karzai's government and the presence of foreign forces. More control over billions of dollars of foreign aid by the Afghan government will help it win the hearts and minds of people across the country, Baheen said
