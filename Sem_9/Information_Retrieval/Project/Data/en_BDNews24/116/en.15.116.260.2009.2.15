 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The parliament should discuss budget sector by sector to get into the details, the National Board of Revenue chairman suggested Sunday. "Sector-wise discussion on budget in the parliament will help sort out details of every sector that can eventually lead to a better budget," Mohammad Abdul Majid said at a pre-budget views-exchange meeting with the small and medium entrepreneurs at NBR office in the city. A political decision was needed to implement the recommendations coming from the NBR's pre-budget discussions with the representatives from different sectors, he said. He said the Bangladesh Bank, the NBR and the SME Foundation define small and medium enterprises (SME) sector differently and called for a common definition. The SME representatives urged the government to extend the tax waiver limit for investment in SME sector. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries representative Monjur Ahmed said the tax waiver limit for small industries should be Tk 30 lakh from Tk 15 lakh while for medium industry it should be to Tk 50 lakh from Tk 24 lakh. Nasir Uddin Bahadur, chairman Timbre Merchant Association, Abdur Razzak, former FBCCI director, Ainul Haque Sohel, chairman Bangladesh Foundry Association, among others, spoke at the meeting. bdnews
