 MINGORA, Pakistan (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Islamist fighters announced a 10-day ceasefire from Sunday in Pakistan's northwestern Swat Valley, where talks were under way that could restore Islamic sharia as the main system of law in the region. A full-blown revolt erupted in Swat in late 2007, and militants control the alpine valley, formerly one of Pakistan's most popular tourist destinations. "We're announcing ceasefire as a goodwill gesture for the ongoing talks between Maulana Sufi Mohammad and the government," Muslim Khan, a spokesman for the militants, said referring to a radical Muslim cleric. On Saturday, the militants freed a Chinese man held hostage for more than five months, in a move Pakistani officials saw as a act of good faith. In another effort to heal wounds, President Asif Ali Zardari ordered on Sunday compensation be paid to people affected by the violence in Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal lands and insurgency-hit districts of North West Frontier Province. Religious conservatives in Swat have long fought for sharia to replace the state's secular laws, which came into force after the former princely state was absorbed into the Pakistani federation in 1969.
