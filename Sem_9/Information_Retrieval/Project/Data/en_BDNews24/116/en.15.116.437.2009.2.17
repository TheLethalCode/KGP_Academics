 MADRID, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Struggling Numancia sacked their coach Sergio Kresic and appointed Jose Rojo Martin 'Pacheta' in his place until the end of the season, the Primera Liga club said on Tuesday. Croatian Kresic took the helm in July after the side won promotion to the top flight last season. But their 1-0 defeat at home to direct rivals Real Mallorca on Sunday was their fifth league reverse in a row. They slipped to 19th in the 20-team standings with 20 points from 23 games, and are one point from safety. Sports director Pacheta will be presented on Wednesday, the club said in a statement on their website (www.cdnumancia.com), and his first match in charge will be away to the side one point and two places above them, Osasuna, on Sunday
