 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Hiruka Fernando struck an unbeaten 44 to help Sri Lanka clinch the Grameenphone women's cricket tri-nation series with a convincing six-wicket win over Pakistan in the final at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Tuesday. Sri Lanka raced to 124-4 in 35.2 overs after bundling their opponents out for 123 in 47.1 overs. Dedunu de Silva and Chamari Polagampala gave the Lankans a fine start adding 49 runs for the opening stand before Silva was caught behind by Bismah Mahroof off Sajida Shah for 27 off 47 balls studded with four fours. Polagamala was then joined by with Fernando and the pair put on another 29 runs for the second wicket. But Polagmala was run out for 19 leaving the side struggling at 78-2 in 21.1 overs. Despite losing two more wickets in the space of two runs, Sri Lanka eventually reached the target thanks to a defiant knock from Fernando, who smashed four fours in her 77-ball knock. Suvini de Alwis was 13 not out. Earlier, put in to bat, Pakistan were reduced to 73-5 after Polagamala ripped through the top order to return three for 16. Her all-round show earned her the player-of-the- match award. She was also adjudged player-of-the-series. Sunivi de Alwis (2/18), Rose Fernando (1/21) and Sripali Weerakkoddy (1/29) were the other wicket-takers in the low-scoring final. Middle-order Javeria Khan top-scored with 23 while Sana Mir and Almas Akram who both made 16 respectively. bd
