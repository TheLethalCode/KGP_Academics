<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  China will fully cooperate with Bangladesh in its bid to set up a nuclear power plant, the Chinese ambassador said Sunday. "We welcome the Bangladeshi side to communicate on this issue," Zheng Qingdian said at a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium in the city. Bangladesh and China had signed an agreement on peaceful use of nuclear energy in 2005. He also said in recent years the two countries have seen closer and wider exchange and cooperation in political, economic, military and cultural areas as well as people-to-people relations. "Sino-Bangladesh relation has become the model which demonstrates how the countries of different social systems and cultural backgrounds harmoniously interact," added the outgoing Chinese envoy. Zheng presented his credentials to the president as the Chinese ambassador in March, 2007. He said China had no intention to pursue trade surplus and wanted to strengthen business ties with Bangladesh. He hoped Bangladesh would take measures to increase its export to China. China is looking forward to expanding cooperation with Bangladesh, specially in agriculture, education, ICT and communications. "China would also maintain its support for Bangladesh in international and regional efforts," the ambassador said. Touching on the issue of a road link Bangladesh to the Chinese province of Kunming, he said his government was serious about it since it would facilitate trade among countries in the region. On Bangladesh's dispute over maritime boundaries with Myanmar, a close China ally, the Chinese diplomat evaded a direct answer. "Any difference of opinion should be resolved by all parties concerned sitting together," he said. Zheng declined comments on such issues as the US proposal to help Bangladesh secure its sea borders and Bangladesh giving transit facilities to India to carry goods.
