 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni clarified on Tuesday that her talks the previous day with visiting Pakistani envoy Mirza Zia Ispahani had not included trial of 1971 war criminals, and reiterated that Bangladesh would go ahead with trials. The Pakistani president's special envoy, who is on a 3-day visit, told newsmen Monday that trial of war crimes committed during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan had better not be held "right at this moment". Ispahani also said that his talks with Dipu Moni had not touched on the issue. "From what I understood from media reports is that the Pakistani envoy said Pakistani war criminals should not be Bangladesh's concern at this moment," Dipu Moni told reporters Tuesday, adding that she was not present when the comment was made to the media. As for Bangladeshis who committed war crimes during the 1971 war, she said her government was categorically pledged to go ahead with their trials. Dipu Moni was being pressed by reporters on the issue of war crimes trials after a seminar on women's leadership. As the keynote speaker, Dipu Moni shared her experience of being a politician and the country's first female foreign minister. "The attitude towards women in this country is the greatest obstacle," she said. She said there was no general objection to women working in Bangladesh as it brings in money. "But in cases like politics and similar fields, its a totally different experience," Dipu Moni added. She cited this dimension as a major barrier for women in leadership roles. On reserved parliamentary seats for women, she said she personally believed the concept was "designed to fail". "It is said women cannot do much and we are handing them the responsibility of three constituencies." Dipu Moni suggested fixing a minimum quota for political parties to nominate women candidates for parliamentary polls. Tuesday's seminar, 'Getting To Leadership: Breaking the Barrier & Removing the Obstacles', was co-organised by Bangladesh Institute of Strategic Studies (BISS) and Bangladesh Alliance for Women Leadership (BDAWL). BDAWL executive director Nasim Firdous told the seminar their alliance would continue to seek 33 percent of all leadership positions in every sector to be reached by 2015. The seminar was chaired by BISS director general Maj Gen Abu Belal Muhammad Shafiul Huq and attended by female civil servants, entrepreneurs and development workers. bdn
