 RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vanger Mancini took over as coach of Brazil's Santos on Monday, facing the task of bringing order to a team reportedly hit by internal wrangling. Mancini replaced Marcio Fernandes to become the fourth coach at Pele's former club since Vanderlei Luxemburgo quit at the end of 2007. Fernandes resigned after Thursday's 1-0 defeat by Marilia in the Paulista championship. Media reports said goalkeeper Fabio Costa and defender Fabiano Eller threw punches at each other in the dressing-room at halftime. Both were dropped for Sunday's match against Guarani which Santos won 3-1. "I've been given carte blanche," Mancini told reporters.
