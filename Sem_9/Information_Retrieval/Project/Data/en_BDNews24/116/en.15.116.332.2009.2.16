<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) - Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia has accused ruling party Awami League of failing to show broadmindedness despite its huge majority in parliament. "We want to cooperate with the government by joining the current session of parliament. But the ruling party is barring us from contributing by snatching our seats," the BNP chief said on Monday. "They want to continue with a one-sided parliament," said Khaleda in a meeting with a 52-member delegation of Rajshahi University teachers at her Gulshan office. The former prime minister heard opinions of the teachers, led by former RU vice-chancellor M Abdul Hamid, on the country's political situation, parliament and law and order. Terming teachers the 'conscience of the nation', Khaleda said, "I hope you will continue your contribution to the country, as you have in the past." She once again alleged widespread rigging in the Dec. 29 general election. "We (BNP) wanted to move forward from the crisis that had been prevailing the past two years and that was why we participated in the election," she said. "But the activities of the previous caretaker government and now the Awami League government have given rise to frustration among the people," she said. She alleged that ruling party supporters were continuing to attack BNP leaders and supporters across the country. "They've killed more than 50 of our leaders and supporters," Khaleda said. She urged all nationalist forces to be united to protect the country's independence and sovereignty. "There has been a conspiracy against our independence. We all will have to remain on guard," said the former prime minister. bdnews
