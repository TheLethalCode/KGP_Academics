 COLOMBO, Thu Feb 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations' top humanitarian official on Thursday urged the Tamil Tiger rebels and Sri Lanka's government to protect civilians as Asia's longest-running civil war nears an end. UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes arrived in the Indian Ocean island on Thursday to assess the state of around 36,000 people who have fled the war zone and are now in government-run refugee camps. Holmes also expressed concern about what he called "reports of heavy casualties among the population" as military operations near their end. The army now has cornered the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in a wedge of jungle now measuring just 87 square km (34 sq miles). The military says it has slowed its offensive and has stopped firing artillery to protect civilians. "I call on the government and I call on LTTE to do everything possible to avoid such casualties to make sure international humanitarian law is being fully respected," Holmes told reporters at a news conference with Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama. Aid agencies estimate around 200,000 people are trapped in the war zone, although the government says the number is between 50,000 and 70,000. The United Nations said this week the LTTE was shooting people trying to leave the war zone, and had stepped up forcible recruitment of children as young as 14. It also said the LTTE had forcibly recruited one of their 15 local staff still being barred from leaving by the rebels. The LTTE denied those charges and witness accounts that they were shooting people attempting to escape the war zone, and firing artillery from populated areas. The government has acknowledged some civilians may have been killed, but says figures given by the Tigers and aid agencies have been hugely inflated and included dead LTTE fighters. The Tigers have repeatedly blamed the military for killing civilians with artillery bombardments, which the government denies and says is a ploy to manufacture a humanitarian crisis to garner international pressure for a ceasefire
