<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM Wed, Feb 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's security cabinet met on Wednesday to discuss how far Israel would go to win the release of a captured soldier in a prisoner exchange with Hamas. Olmert has insisted Gilad Shalit's release precede any reopening of the borders of the blockaded Gaza Strip in a deal being brokered by Egypt for a long-term truce following Israel's offensive in the Hamas-ruled enclave last month. Hamas has demanded the release of 1,400 of its prisoners in Israeli jails, including some involved in deadly attacks against Israelis. It rejects any link between Shalit and a reopening of Gaza crossings that would be vital to reconstruction efforts. "We need to know there's an agreement in which Gilad returns home. That's a basic condition. If not, so what, let Hamas suffer, we don't open the crossings," Meit Sheetrit, a member of the security cabinet, told Israel Radio. Shalit was seized by Palestinian militants in 2006. They tunnelled into Israel from the Gaza Strip and took him into the territory, which Israeli troops and settlers quit a year earlier. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the forum would discuss "the price that will have to be paid for the release of Gilad Shalit", referring to the number and names of Palestinian prisoners who could be swapped. "We are at the moment of truth. If Gilad Shalit doesn't come home now, it could go on and on for ages. This is the moment of opportunity," the official said. "We want this to be finalised. We want this to happen," the official added, rebuffing suggestions that Wednesday's meeting would merely be the starting point in negotiations. But the official said any package endorsed by the security cabinet was unlikely to be Israel's final offer, suggesting Hamas could make a counter-proposal. Sheetrit said before the session that getting Shalit back would mean the release of hundreds of prisoners. Olmert said on Tuesday he hoped to win Shalit's freedom before he left office but a new Israeli government that will be formed following last week's national election might have to tackle the task. Before the Israeli cabinet session, its warplanes bombed seven smuggling tunnels running under the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, and a security compound in the Palestinian territory, a military spokesman said. No casualties were reported. The attack was launched after mortar bombs were fired into Israel from the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. No one was reported hurt
