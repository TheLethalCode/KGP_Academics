<TITLE> Don't rush to ration: economists to govt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 16 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a seminar Monday warned the government against hurrying to implement rationing, saying it should be introduced among target groups rather than the whole population, and must be operated with efficiency. "Some 20 percent of our total population is hardcore poor. They cannot afford they to buy rice even at 20 taka per kilo," BRAC executive director Dr. Mahbub Hossain told the seminar on 'Market Volatility, Vulnerability and Food Security in Bangladesh'. "We could distribute subsidised food, buying rice at Tk 22 from millers and selling it to the poor at 10 taka. But you cannot do it across the country. Target groups should be identified." "Rationing is a better system, but it depends absolutely on the efficiency of the government. We have had to suspend it in the past due to lack of administrative efficiency," said Hossain. "The government is talking of food rationing," said economist Wahid Uddin Mahmud. "But we don't have positive experiences of rationing in the past," he told the seminar, jointly organised by Bangladesh Institute of Development Research and the UK Department for International Development. "Rationing was started in the early 80's, but it had to be suspended. There was the question of corruption. Rations went to the local influentials instead of the needy." "Everything must be considered, if the government wants to introduce rationing again. It should not do anything in a hurry. There are other alternatives to rationing. Food could be sold in fair price markets," said Wahid Uddin, a former adviser. Dhaka University professor of development studies and economist Dr Atiur Rahman said the major challenge was to encourage the producer. "On the other hand we should keep in mind consumers who cannot afford the produce." "The two should be coordinate," said Rahman. DFID country director Chris Austin, Dr Uttam Kumar Dev of the Centre for Policy Dialogue and participants from India, Thailand and the UK were among those who attended. bdn
