 MADRID, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Espanyol denied Barcelona the 2007 title with a last minute equaliser at the Nou Camp and that has not been forgotten by Barca as the leaders prepare for Saturday's visit (1900 GMT) of city rivals now stuck in last position. "Two years ago Espanyol caused us to lose the league title and they were delighted celebrating their goals," Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets said. "It wouldn't bother me a bit if they were relegated." Espanyol's talismanic captain and striker Raul Tamudo, the player who scored the equaliser, has just returned from a long-term injury lay-off and is likely to be a substitute. His side have gone 14 league matches without a win. "I don't think it will be any tougher to visit the Nou Camp than in other seasons. They have always been a good team," he said. Real Madrid will hope to continue their winning streak when Real Betis visit on Saturday (1900). They have won eight on the trot, and conceded just once in that time. Coach Juande Ramos looks set to rest Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder, though Guti could return from injury, as he keeps one eye on next week's Champions League clash with Liverpool. Real Betis have emerged from a poor run to beat city rivals Sevilla away, and ended Barcelona's 10-match winning streak with a 2-2 draw in their last outing. "We hope we can end Real's run like we did with Barcelona. Real's defence was their weak point before Ramos came but now they are rock solid at the back and concede very few goals," midfielder Arzu said. Valencia may have to turn to their youth team for a goalkeeper when they visit Deportivo Coruna on Sunday (2000). First-choice Renan is injured and recent-arrival Cesar Sanchez twisted his knee and is a doubt from their 1-1 UEFA Cup draw away to Dynamo Kiev during the week. Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero is expected to travel to face Sevilla on Saturday (2100) after becoming a father for the first time on Thursday evening. His son Benjamin was Diego Maradona's first grandson. Strike partner Florent Sinama Pongolle is suspended. An inconsistent Villarreal have striker Joseba Llorente back from injury when they host Sporting Gijon on Saturday (1900). "If we can secure a victory it will give us a morale-boost for Wednesday's visit of Panathinaikos in the Champions League. The win is important if we aren't to slip off the pace in the league," he said. Numancia's new coach Jose Rojo Martin 'Pacheta' has promised changes when he takes the helm for his first game away to fellow strugglers Osasuna on Sunday (1600). The Sorians, 19th, are on a five-match losing streak. Osasuna have hauled themselves out of the bottom three taking eight points from a possible 12 in their last four matches
