<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and Chelsea coach Guus Hiddink has said he plans to retire from football after the 2010 World Cup. The 62-year-old Dutchman will manage Premier League Chelsea until the end of the season after taking over last week from the sacked Luiz Felipe Scolari. "I think I will quit in the summer of 2010 after the World Cup," Hiddink told the Sunday Mirror. "From then on I am just going to ride around on my Harley-Davidson and I will be more of an ambassador for Nike." "And I'll take care, privately, of my own project for the poor in Tanzania," he added. Hiddink, who watched his new side's 3-1 FA Cup fifth-round victory at Watford on Saturday, said that Champions League qualification was his main priority. "Chelsea want to qualify for the Champions League. That is the mission I have been given by (owner) Roman Abramovich  it's as simple as that." "It is a massive challenge, but I think I can handle the task when I look at the quality of the squad." Abramovich also pays Hiddink's wages as Russia coach and, if the former South Korea and Australia manager's tenure is successful, the Russian billionaire could look to extend the dual management deal. "You never know. In principle I am supposed to return to the Russian Federation (at the end of this season)," Hiddink said. "There are a couple of scenarios. I just go back or I do well and we'll see." Chelsea trail Premier League leaders Manchester United by seven points, which could be extended to 10 if United win their game in hand against Fulham on Wednesday. Hiddink, who will be based in London for the rest of the season, takes Chelsea to Aston Villa three days later in his first match in charge. "I will have to be here for about four months. I need to be close to the clubit is a day-to-day job. It will be a big job and certainly not an easy one.
