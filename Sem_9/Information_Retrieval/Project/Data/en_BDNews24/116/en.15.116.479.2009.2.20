 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Premier League ahead of this weekend's matches (all times GMT): Russian international forward Andrei Arshavin is set to make his league debut for Arsenal at the Emirates stadium against Sunderland on Saturday (1500), a relief for manager Arsene Wenger who is short of attacking options. "He will be involved but I have not decided what I will do with him yet," Wenger told the club's website (www.arsenal.com). Croatian striker Eduardo is out for two weeks with a hamstring injury while forwards Emmanuel Adebayor (hamstring) and Theo Walcott (shoulder) are also sidelined. Guus Hiddink will take charge of Chelsea for the first time for the trip to Aston Villa on Saturday (1245) and opposite number Martin O'Neill believes he will do well to combine the role with his Russia coaching duties. "I think it would be very hard to combine an international management role with one in the Premier League over the fullness of time," O'Neill told Villa's website (www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk). "Eventually, when you lose a game or two, someone will accuse you of not spending enough time in one particular camp." Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, out with a hamstring injury since Feb. 4, could return to the bench for the clash with Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday (1500). Xabi Alonso will miss the match after picking up five yellow cards this season, and the Spanish midfielder told the club's website (www.liverpoolfc.tv) Gerrard should be eased gently back into action. "It's not intelliegent to rush him back. Whenever he feels okay he will be a big part of our squad again." Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is in contention for a starting berth at home to Blackburn Rovers on Saturday (1730) after scoring on his return from injury on Wednesday against Fulham. Anderson is out with an ankle injury. West Ham's Carlton Cole could miss Saturday's game away to Bolton Wanderers (1500) after hurting his ankle in the FA Cup against Middlesbrough on Feb. 14. Defender Lucas Neill will be out after the Australian picked up five yellow cards
