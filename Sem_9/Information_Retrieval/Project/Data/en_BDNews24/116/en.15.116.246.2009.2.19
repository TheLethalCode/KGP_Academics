 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)Power plants with a total capacity of 740 MW will be running by June this year, state minister for power Shamsul Haq Tuku told parliament on Thursday. He also said the government would take legal action against alleged corrupt practices in the power sector that took place during the BNP-led four-party government. "The government has set a target of setting up power plants with production capacity of 741.5 megawatts both in the public and private sectors," Tuku told the House replying to a question from BNP MP AKM Hafizur Rahman. Awami League's MA Mannan tabled the question on Rahman's behalf during the question-answer session of parliament. Replying to another question, from Awami League MP Shajahan Khan, the junior minister said, "Thousands of crores of taka were misappropriated in the power sector during the tenure of the BNP-led alliance government." "But they could not add a single megawatt of electricity to the national grid," said Tuku. "We have enough information on their misappropriations. We will investigate them and take necessary legal actions," he said. Replying to another question from Monjur Quader Quraishi MP, Tuku said, "Uninterrupted power will be supplied during the IRRI-Boro season". bdnews
