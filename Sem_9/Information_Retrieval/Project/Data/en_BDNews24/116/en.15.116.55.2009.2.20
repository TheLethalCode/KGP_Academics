<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has sought opinions to preserve and develop Bengali language, culture and creativity, and said her administration will preserve the languages of ethnic communities. "We will welcome your constructive criticism," she said after handing Ekushey Padak to 13 distinguished persons for contributions to their fields of work at Osmany Auditorium Friday. Ekushey Padak is one of the highest civilian awards, introduced in memory of the martyrs of the Language Movement on Feb. 21, 1952. Each award recipient got a gold medal, Tk 40,000 by cheque and a citation. "The immortal Ekushey is the manifestation of our patriotism, national spirit and coordinated efforts. Ekush (21st February) means never-ending inspiration to establish self-determination and justice." The history of the Bengali nation would have been different had it not been for Ekushey, she observed. "Ekush is an shore anchor. We run to Shaheed Minar whenever we feel threatened. Shaheed Minar is not a mere installation of bricks. It is our shelter. "Once our enemies wanted to rage it down to rubble. They thought we would move away from the spirit of Ekushey. But they were mistaken. "No-one could ever dominate our nation. Ekush protects us from waves of attacks. She complained that Bengali language was not used appropriately and the culture was under threat. "Bengali language is being corrupted. Speaking Bengali with English accent has to be stopped. "Bengali has to be spoken like Bengali. Rural dialect is far better than Bengali with English accent," the prime minister said. She also said the government would start work on the International Language Institute. "We launched the institute in presence of (former) UN secretary-general Kofi Anan. But the BNP-led coalition government suspended work," the prime minister said. The award-winners are Dr Borhan Uddin Khan Jahangir (education), Dr Syed Anwar Hossain (research), late Mahbub Ul Alam Chowdhury (Language Movement), late Ashraf Uz-Zaman (journalism), Begum Bilkis Nasir Uddin (music), late Manik Chandra Saha (journalism), late Humayun Kabir Balu (journalism), Selina Hossain (literature), Shamsuzzaman Khan (research), Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman (poverty reduction), Dr Muhammad Rafi Khan (social work), Monsur Ul Karim (fine arts) and Ramendu Majumdar (theatre). Hasina handed over awards to nine of the 13 winners while the relatives of the other five, awarded posthumously, received theirs. Cabinet members, MPs, high civilian and military officials, diplomats and other distinguished personalities attended the function broadcast live by state-owned Bangladesh Television and Betar from 11am. b
