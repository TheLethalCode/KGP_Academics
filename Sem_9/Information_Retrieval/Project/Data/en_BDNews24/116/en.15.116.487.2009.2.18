 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Leader of the opposition in parliament Khaleda Zia warned of "terrible" repercussions if the by-polls were rigged. "There will be terrible consequences if the government and the Election Commission did not hold the upcoming polls fairly. "No rigging, administrative interference and irregularities will be put up with," she said in her address to a delegation of Sirajganj District Lawyers' Association at her Gulshan office. She was confident that BNP candidates would win the polls, slated for March 30, to seven constituencies, if the voting was fair. Sirajganj-2 MP Rumana Mahmud led the delegation to the meeting. Khaleda heard from the lawyers about the state of the country and asked them to play a strong role against the unjust acts in society. The former prime minister spoke of what she said were terror, lawlessness and political persecution under the incumbent government in its first month in office. "They did not stop killing and persecuting our leaders and workers countrywide. They have planned to make the parliament ineffective by taking our seats." "Awami League has forgotten the pledges it made to the people before the election. But it has not forgotten those given to the foreigners. SO the government is signing different anti-state agreements. "We will not sit at our homes if so-called (South Asian anti-terror) taskforce and other agreements are signed against the interest of the country in defiance of public opinion," she warned. "BNP and the people will not accept anything that compromises or puts at stake the national sovereignty." Khaleda said they would tackle the anti-state measure head-on, taking people on their side on the streets. Later, she met with Jatiyatabadi Tanti Dal on the 23rd founding anniversary of the pro-BNP weavers' association. bdn
