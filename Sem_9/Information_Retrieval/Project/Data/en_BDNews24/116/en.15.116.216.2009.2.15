 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com) - World Bank will provide the social welfare ministry $90 million in development assistance for social safety net programmes, the minister said on Sunday. "The money will be allocated for the welfare of the ultra poor, orphans, homeless and handicapped people," social welfare minister Enamul Haque Mostafa Shahid said after a meeting with WB country director Xian Zhu. "The money will make it possible to provide better services in these sectors," said the minister. Xian Zhu said the Bank has been working in developing the social safety net, which was why the organisation decided to provide $90 million more this year. The meeting discussed the progress of various projects under the ministry, the minister said. The government will move to resume the discarded or suspended projects and undertake new ones, Shahid said. "However, it has also been examining whether there were any irregularities in finished and ongoing projects," he said. AUSAID country representative Neda Tyreen was also present in the meeting. bdnews
