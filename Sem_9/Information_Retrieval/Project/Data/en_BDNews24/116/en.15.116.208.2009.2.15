<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Seventy-two ordinances of the caretaker government will not pass scrutiny by a special review committee, though decisions taken under those ordinances will be regarded as legal, law minister Shafiq Ahmed said Sunday "Fifty ordinances will be given final approval at a meeting of the special committee on Sunday afternoon," said the minister. "They will be presented as bills in parliament after going through the cabinet," he said. Shafiq said public welfare oriented ordinances such as the ones related to law and order, budget, separation of the judiciary and the Anticorruption Commission would be given approval. On the government's procedure to try war criminals, he said, "It's certain that war criminals will be tried but we have not decided on the process as yet." "However, the government is considering trials of war criminals through formation of tribunals." The law minister had earlier met with a UNDP delegation. On his talks with Ajay Chhibber, director of UNDP's Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, Shafiq said the main topic was courts and management of cases. "The UNDP team has assured assistance in ensuring that people seeking justice are not deprived," he said. The delegation had also discussed trade laws, the minister said. "Some 75 days are required in Bangladesh to settle a commercial case in contrast to 30-35 days in other countries," he said. "We talked about reducing the excess time keeping benefits to investors in view." UNDP resident representative Renata Lok Dessallien was present at the meeting. bdnew
