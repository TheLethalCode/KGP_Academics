 ST JOHN'S, Antigua, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The third test between West Indies and England, hastily re-arranged after the second test was abandoned on Friday, will begin at the Antigua Recreation Ground as planned on Sunday after a successful inspection. The match will be held at the Recreation Ground, the island's traditional test venue, after the nearby Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was deemed unfit and dangerous for play after just 10 balls on Friday. "I'm very happy with the ground. I think in the 24 hours they've had to prepare the ground they've done a fantastic job," match referee Alan Hurst told reporters after inspecting the field. "There are a few problems with the surface and it is not perfect, but they've done as good a job as they could have and the wicket looks great," he said. Hurst said he had spoken to both captains and informed them of his decision. "I told them there had to be a little give and take, it (the ground) isn't perfect and we are in something of an abnormal situation," said the Australian. Local safety officials had inspected the spectator areas and other facilities, added Hurst. Groundstaff had worked on the surface throughout the day and work was also carried out on the facilities for the spectators, with welding being carried out in some areas of the stands. The biggest issue is likely to be some areas of the outfield where markings from the field's use as a soccer venue have left indentations. "The soccer lines were quite deep and embedded. It was an area of concern for the players that the lines would give bad bounce. We can't guarantee that it will be perfect, but when the players see it they will be quite surprised." 'GRAVY' Certainly it would be no surprise to see some balls misbehave in the outfield but crucially the bowlers' run-up, the main problem on Friday at the original venue, were in decent condition. While television crews worked against the clock to set up broadcasting facilities and scorebox staff painted the names of the players on the slides for the old-style manual scoreboard, local fans said they were pleased to have test cricket back at their favourite venue. "We are back home," said the stadium's most famed supporter 'Gravy', whose real name is Labon Kenneth Blackburn Leeweltine Buckonon Benjamin. 'Gravy', whose clownish antics on the edge of the field in garish costume were an essential part of the match experience at the 'Rec' -- but who later was one of many critics of the 'soulless' new ground -- told Reuters he had not yet decided whether to launch a comeback for Sunday's test. "There is still time to think things over. Keep your eyes open," he said with a grin
