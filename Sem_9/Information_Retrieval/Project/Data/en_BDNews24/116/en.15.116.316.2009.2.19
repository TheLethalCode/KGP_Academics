 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government will bring about reforms in the administration system, the local government minister said on Thursday. "We will reform the system. A committee has been formed in this regard," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters. On the extensive reshuffles within the administration since the new government took office, the minister said the past BNP-led government had made sweeping replacements of civil servants during their tenure. "They singled out and excluded freedom fighters and pro-liberation forces from the administration." "We have not excluded any, but rather reshuffled within the existing administration," said the minister. Pressed by reporters on whether reform was needed, rather than reshuffles, Ashraf said: "Yes." As a member of the committee for reform, he said: "We will prepare a reform proposal and present it to parliament for approval if necessary." On recent violence perpetrated by the AL-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League, he said: "The prime minister has already warned of punitive measures if they break the law." On AL candidates for reserved women seats, the LGRD minister said: "Some 784 nomination papers have been sold." "We have to scrutinize them so that qualified candidates are elected as lawmakers," Ashraf said. The AL leader had earlier attended a meeting at the party president's office with a delegation of the Chinese Communist Party. Ashraf said: "They have many experiences that we can learn from in our country as both countries are heavily populated." "We can take advice on agriculture and education sectors from them." CCP vice minister Liu Hongchai, who is leading the nine-member delegation, said they had discussed strengthening mutual relations. bdnew
