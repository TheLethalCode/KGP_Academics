 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Executive Committee of the National Economic Commission has approved four projects on develop the road network, the planning minister said Tuesday. "The four projects include Tk 183 crore Sylhet zone road development project, Tk 106 crore rural infrastructure development project (Chittagong Hill Tracts), Tk 95 crore Chittagong development project and Tk 49 crore Rangpur-Badarganj-Parbatipur road expansion project," AK Khandker said. "The government will bear the expense of all the four projects, which will be implemented by the Roads and Highways Department" the minister said at a briefing after the sixth ECNEC meeting under the Awami League-led government. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, chairperson of the ECNEC, presided over the meeting. The much-talked-about machine readable passport and visa project was not placed before the meeting despite being on the agenda. "The project was not placed because of a few printing errors in the papers," Khandker said. He said the project would be placed in the next meeting. The papers of the Tk 350 crore project said the government needed to introduce machine-readable passport and visa by 2010 to comply with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The previous BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government did not place the project before the ECNEC. Allegations are there that that an influential quarter of that government had placed the project before the government purchase committee going around ECNEC. bdn
