<TITLE> Impatient clubs hampering young managers, says Wenger </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Impatient clubs are costing young managers the chance to establish themselves in the English Premier League, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday. Wenger, who according to his club has seen 107 Premier League bosses lose their jobs during his 12 years in north London, pointed to this season's departures of 37-year-old Roy Keane, Paul Ince (41) and Tony Adams (42). "That is not just anybody, you know, that is three massive personalities in English football with top qualitybut after six months (of this season) they are out," Wenger told his club's website (www.arsenal.com). "It is difficult for me to assess these situations but it is very easy to understand, without judging, if it's right or wrong. "The global situation makes it difficult for young managers to come through now. All of them had a different way into their jobs but each faced the same impatience." Wenger added that managers were not given the chance to develop their teams because the threat of dismissal hung over them after only a few poor results. "If you change a manager every six months you will not develop young players because he knows if he loses three games he is out," said the 59-year-old Frenchman. "Where does that end? Most of the problems are financial. So if the directors are convinced that you are not competent enough to do the job then we accept we must pay the price. "But when it is just superficial measures it is not right." Adams was sacked by Portsmouth last week after just over three months in charge, while fellow former England international player Ince was shown the door in December after six months at Blackburn Rovers. Keane spent two-and-a-half years at Sunderland before quitting in December with the club in the relegation zone
