 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Investment in national savings certificates has increased two and a half times in the first half of the 2008-09 fiscal year compared with the previous year. Reduced inflation and suspension of anti-graft drive have contributed to the rise of investment in savings schemes, experts say. According to the central bank data, savings certificates worth Tk 789 crore were sold in the first six months (July-December 2007) of the last FY, which has increased to Tk 1,707 crore for the July-December 2008. During the FY 2007-08, savings certificates worth Tk 2,518 crore were sold. In Dec. 2007, savings certificates worth Tk 96 crore were sold, whereas the amount was Tk 171 crore for Dec. 2008. Again, as per central bank data, investment in savings certificates at the end of FY 2007-08 stood at Tk 46,579 crore, which increased to Tk 47,864 crore at the end of Dec. of FY 2008-09. Zaed Bakht, senior research director at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), told bdnews24.com, "The two main reasons of reduced investment in savings certificate in the last fiscal year were spiralling commodity prices suppressing people's financial prowess and the caretaker government's anti-graft drive." "Inflation has been curbed to an extent, commodity prices also seem to have dropped to some extent and people's urge and capacity to save have increased." "The anti-graft drive has also slowed down almost to a halt now. All these factors definitely encouraged people to invest more without qualms." Bakht said, "Last year, people tended to invest more in the share market during the first six months as the bourses perked up after a period of slumber." Witnessing a reverse trend in the share market, people are investing more in savings certificates, he said. One has to furnish a lot of personal data while buying savings certificates, which discouraged many to invest in the sector and cash their investments instead, the senior researcher said. Now people are investing more in certificates as the profit rates offered by the government look good and a rate cut is not coming anytime soon. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the rate of inflation in Dec. 2007 was 11.59 percent, which came down to 6.03 in Dec. 2008. People can invest in three types of savings certificates currently. These are five-year Bangladesh savings certificate carrying 12 percent interest, three-year savings certificate carrying 11.50 percent profit and five-year pension savings certificate offering 12.50 percent profits. bdnew
