<TITLE> Maoist hopes of `new Nepal' dashed as conflict mounts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LACHHITOLE, Nepal, Wed Feb 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When Maoist chief and Prime Minister Prachanda said that governing Nepal was harder than fighting a decade-long civil war, he need have looked no further than his own parliamentary constituency for evidence. Lachhitole village is less than an hour's drive from Kathmandu and still needs roads and clean drinking water. There are frequent power cuts. Villagers say health care and joblessness are as bad as when Prachanda took office six months ago. "They have not done anything for the village yet. Now I'm starting to lose hope," 74-year-old villager Buddhi Lal Maharjan said by his mud-brick home amid the stench of open sewers. Like many Nepalis, Maharjan voted for the Maoists last year, handing a surprise victory to the former insurgents after a civil war that caused 13,000 deaths. There had been hope of a social transformation in one of the world's poorest nations, to build what the Maoists called a "new Nepal". But political tensions, such as conflict between the army and Maoists over the future of their former guerrilla force, as well as rising unemployment have helped transform that optimism into despair for many Nepalis. Nepal has suffered increasing unemployment as many migrants return home from the Middle East and Malaysia amid the global economic downturn, aggravating historic high levels of poverty and joblessness. The window for change may be closing as a result, and the nascent republic, strategically wedged between China and India, risks descending again into a new era of instability and even conflict. "Prachanda got the worst job at the worst time," said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times. "It is a job for superman. How has he done it? Pretty badly." At first the Maoists appeared astute. They got the monarchy abolished, cast aside their revolutionary rhetoric and spoke about making the Himalayan nation a new "Switzerland" of Asia. But the government is struggling with the highest inflation in more than a decade which hit 14 percent in January compared with same month last year, and is under pressure to end crippling power cuts of up to 14 hours a day. Businessmen say the Maoists have failed to rein in their labour unions and there have been frequent strikes and factory closures. Opposition parties accuse the Maoist rank and file of continuing their old habits of kidnappings and extortion. An aide to Prachanda was shot and wounded by unknown assailants this month, and insurgents in the southern Terai region, home to pro-autonomy groups, have set off bombs. Prachanda's government is struggling to find a political consensus to write a new constitution, in what was meant to be a key step in the peace process overseen by the United Nations. ARMY TENSIONS The most tense issue is rehabilitating former Maoist rebels, confined in U.N. monitored camps, as part of the peace deal. The army has opposed taking in 19,000 ex-Maoist fighters into its ranks, saying they have been politically indoctrinated, straining Maoist relations with military generals and some parties supporting the army. "That is one important indication of the wider tensions among the political parties, which could imperil the completion of the peace process," the U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said in a report to the Security Council last month. India, which sees Nepal as its diplomatic "backyard", is reported to be supporting the army in its battle for influence with the Maoists. New Delhi, a key economic partner, is worried that the Maoists could turn Nepal strategically toward China. "Prachanda has tried to play China off against India and this has made New Delhi very anxious," said Dixit. The Maoists blame "old mindsets" for the lack of progress. "There are many expectations and we are not able to do much," said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist minister for information and communications. "The bureaucracy, security forces and even politicians refuse to change their old mindsets." Whoever is to blame, it does not bode well for peace. "I don't think any of the major political parties want to return to the conflict," said Rhoderick Chalmers, Nepal chief of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. "But if they can't address these issues there are risks of further weakening of the government or even a return to conflict.
