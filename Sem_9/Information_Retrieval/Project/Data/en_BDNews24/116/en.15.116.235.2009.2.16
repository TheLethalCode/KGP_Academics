<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Local financial institutions should prepare for the near future as the global financial turmoil is still affecting the economy, the economic affairs adviser to the prime minister said Monday Mashiur Rahman stressed on implementing standards of the Basel-II to reduce banking sector's risk at a seminar on 'Basel-II and its implications on Bank Capital Raising', co-organised by the World Bank and Citibank NA. The adaptation of the standards would minimise internal risks of banks' functions in the wake of the financial meltdown, he said. "Basel-II will help identify the risky lending areas." Basel-II is the second of the Basel Accords, a set of recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Rahman told the seminar depositors always looked for banks that are good in transactions. "The regulator needs to identify the problems of banks and rank them." Published in June 2004, Basel-II aims to create an international standard for banking regulators about how much capital banks need to put aside to safeguard financial and operational risks that they face. At the inaugural session of the seminar, Xian Zhu, country director of the World Bank in Dhaka, said supervisors needed to ensure that individual banks within the group remained adequately capitalised on a stand alone-basis. "I would like to emphasise that the challenges of implementing Basel-II are heightened in turbulent financial markets, and this transition must be managed carefully to mitigate any unintended effects," he said. Mamun Rashid, managing director and chief executive of the Citi's Bangladesh operations, said implementation of the Basel-II was needed for a more accountable banking sector in Bangladesh. Citi's Asia Pacific co-head of investment banking Daniel McNamara said they were honoured to be part of such an 'important' initiative . "We are committed to the mobilisation of our global resources to facilitate transition of the banking sector of Bangladesh into Basel-II", he added. Faruk Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others, spoke at the seminar, attended by regulators as well as executives from financial institutions, market intermediaries and other stakeholders.
