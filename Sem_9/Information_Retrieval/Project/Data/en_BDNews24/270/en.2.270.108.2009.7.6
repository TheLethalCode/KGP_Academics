 BEIJING, Jul 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three people were killed in rioting that erupted in China's restive far west Xinjiang region on Sunday, when locals burned vehicles and blocked traffic in the regional capital Urumqi, the state news agency reported. "The regional government did not say how many people were involved in the unrest, but said they illegally gathered in several downtown places and engaged in beating, smashing, looting and burning," said the official Xinhua news agency. "The government sent police to disperse the crowd and arrested some rioters." The dead were "three ordinary people of the Han ethnic group", Xinhua said. "More than 20 others were injured in the incident and many motor vehicles were burned." The official reports did not specify the ethnicity of those involved in the unrest, or the reasons behind it, and calls to the Xinjiang region spokesperson's office and Urumqi police were not answered. But a witness and other sources have told Reuters it involved members of the Uighur ethnic minority, many of whom resent the Chinese presence in the region, and the cultural and religious controls imposed by China's ruling Communist Party. The eruption of anger in Xinjiang's tightly controlled capital brings into focus debate about the long-term viability of those controls. "It started as a few hundred, and then there were easily over a thousand involved," said the visitor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the rioters overturned traffic rails and smashed buses until thousands of police and anti-riot troops swept through the city, using tear-gas and high-pressure water hoses to disperse crowds. "Now the whole city is on lock-down," he said. Dilxat Raxit, an advocate of Uighur independence exiled in Sweden, said the unrest was sparked by local anger over a violent confrontation between Han Chinese and Uighur factory workers in far southern China in late June, which Uighurs said showed the discrimination they face. "There were thousands of people shouting to stop ethnic discrimination, demanding an explanation. This anger has been growing for a long time," said Dilxat Raxit. The Chinese video website Youku (www.youku.com) showed footage titled "Urumqi riot" that showed smoke rising from an expressway as a firetruck stopped at the scene. An overseas Chinese news website, Boxun (peacehall.com), showed pictures it said were of the Urumqi riot, including hundreds of civilians pressed against a row of police, burning wreckage on a city street, and anti-riot police in shields and helmets. Almost half of Xinjiang's 20 million people are Uighurs. Many of them resent controls imposed by Beijing and an inflow of Han Chinese migrants. The population of Urumqi is mostly Han Chinese, and the city is under tight police security even in normal times. Many Uighurs complain they are marginalised economically and politically in their own land, which has rich mineral and natural gas reserves. Xinjiang has been under increasingly tight security in recent years, especially in the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, when the region was hit by several deadly attacks that authorities said were the work of militants. But human rights groups and Uighur independence activists say Beijing grossly exaggerates the threat from militants to justify harsh controls restricting peaceful political dem
