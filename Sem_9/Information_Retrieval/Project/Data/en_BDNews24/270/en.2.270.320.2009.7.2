 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has recommended a new office to oversee the activities of Bangladesh missions abroad, its chairman says. A H Mahmood Ali, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on foreign ministry, on Thursday said that the ministry officials told them that the process to create the post of the inspector general of missions had started. He said his committee would hear problems of the missions after the appointment of ambassadors or high commissioners to recommend remedial measures. "The inspector general of missions will visit different missions and look into their problems," Ali told reporters after a meeting of the committee in the parliament building. The inspector general will look into allegations of Bangladeshi expatriates against the mission officials. The chairman said his committee would discuss the alleged non-cooperation of officials of Bangladesh missions abroad at the next meetings. Ali, a former ambassador, however, said the number of officials at the missions are far outnumbered by the expatriates whose number have gone up since 1980s. "The number of expatriate Bangladeshis has reached to 65 lakh which was only four lakh." The expatriates during her Saudi Arabia visit told prime minister Sheikh Hasina that the Bangladesh mission officials did not attend to the problems of the workers. Hasina warned the embassy staff of serious consequences for not cooperating with the expatriates. Foreign minister Dipu Moni last week told the parliament that her ministry did not get any proof of non-cooperation as the expatriates' allegations were not specific. The chairman said newly appointed ambassadors to Kuwait and Russia only had attended meeting to speak of their plans and problems. "Now, we have decided that we will hear from the ambassadors about their problems after the appointments," Ali said.
