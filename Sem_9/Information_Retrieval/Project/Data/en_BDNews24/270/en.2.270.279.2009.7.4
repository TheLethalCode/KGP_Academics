 Naogaon, July 4 (bdnews24.com)A man and wife committed suicide at Balahar village in Niamatpur on Saturday after falling behind on their microcredit loan repayments, Naogaon police said. Police said the bodies of 55-year-old Abdus Samad and his 45-year-old wife Zarina Bibi were recovered Saturday morning from their rented Balahar home. Samad was a rickshaw-van puller, and his wife was employed as a domestic worker, said Mofazzal Hossain, Naogaon Circle superintendent-of-police. "They had secured a total of one lakh taka in loans from the Grameen Bank and Astha," said Hossain. "The pressure of meeting the payments was the likely cause of the suicides, we think."
