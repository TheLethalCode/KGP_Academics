<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com)The government is yet to finalise plans for the new three-member Information Commission, although the Right to Information Act was passed by parliament ten days ago with retroactive effect from October 2008. "Our ministry has sent a letter to the housing and public works ministry requesting an office and logistical assistance for the commission," said information minister Abul Kalam Azad at his office Thursday. Azad said work had started following the appointment of the new commission on Wednesday, when the law in its entirety was meant to come into force. But the personnel structure of the commission, the body meant to oversee the law's implementation, was still being worked out by the ministry, while its exact rules are still to be finalised. "Transparency is vital in constituting the commission as it is a statutory organisation," he said. Newly appointed chief information commissioner M Azizur Rahman asked for media assistance for effective working of the commission in the future. Kamal Abdul Naser, acting secretary at the information ministry, said they had just received approval for funds of Tk 2.2 crore from the government to set up their offices. Information minister Azad said full rights to information would strengthen democracy and good governance and reduce corruption. He also said enacting the Rights to Information Act was a huge success for the government and pointed out that previous administrations had never got past talking about it.
