 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet has approved a law to provide lifetime security for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's family, with immediate effect, the prime minister's press secretary said on Monday. A cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the slain national hero Sheikh Mujib, gave the approval in principle to the 'Father of the Nation's Family Members Security Act 2009'. After the meeting, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters the law has been formulated in line with previous legislation enacted in 2001, when Awami League were last in power, and repealed by the BNP government which replaced them. Azad said the measures approved by the law would come into force immediately. "A handful of conspirators killed the Father of the Nation and family members on August 15, 1975," said Azad. "Countless attempts have been made to assassinate his daughter, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, which has continued to date." "The nation knows that the 2004 grenade attack (on an Awami League rally) was launched to kill Sheikh Hasina, which left 24 dead including the incumbent president Zillur Rahman's wife Ivy Rahman," said Azad. Under the circumstances, he said, the law was raised in the cabinet meeting for approval with a view to providing protection to surviving members of Sheikh Mujib's family. The law professes to provide well-protected accommodations and other security measures and services for the family. Sheikh Hasina has a sister Sheikh Rehana, who resides in London. bdnews24.
