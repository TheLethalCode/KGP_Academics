 Bagerhat, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Scores of students fell ill after eating at a girls' hostel of Bagerhat Government PC College, civil surgeon Subhash Kumar Saha said on Sunday. Saha was making an inspection of the hostel's kitchen after 63 students, who had taken lunch there the day before, underwent treatment for food poisoning at Bagerhat Sadar Hospital. Of them, 31 were admitted in critical condition, said doctors. "All the patients were suffering from food poisoning with diarrhoea and vomiting," said hospital resident Dr Bidyut Kanti Pal. They were treated and out of danger, he said. The hostel's dining hall manager Shoma Biswas, who was also admitted to hospital, told bdnews24.com the food poisoning incident only became clear in the evening as more and more students fell sick. "We then informed the hall super Umme Tahira," said Shoma. The hostel authorities formed a three-member probe committee, asking it to submit a full report by July 7. After visiting the hostel kitchen Sunday morning, Bagerhat civil surgeon Saha said they would know the cause of the food poisoning after tests. He said he suspected the food poisoning might have occurred from "lizard droppings, or some other contamination". The cook Ilias Hossain could not give any reason for the poisoning. bdn
