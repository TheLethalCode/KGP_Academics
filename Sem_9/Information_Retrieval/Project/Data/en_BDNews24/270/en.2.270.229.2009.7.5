 JERUSALEM, Sun Jul 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defense Minister Ehud Barak said he would discuss with a US envoy Monday a compromise over a peace plan calling for an Israeli settlement freeze and seek ways to promote regional peace. Barak, who last met envoy George Mitchell Tuesday in New York, travels to London later Sunday for another round of talks aimed at narrowing a rift with US President Barack Obama, who has demanded a halt to settlement activity.

But Arab leaders have so far been cool, Western diplomats said, to suggestions they might open their airspace to Israeli airliners, allow roaming calls by Israeli cell phones or let in tourists whose passports show they have also visited Israel. Obama himself spoke last month in favor of a regional peace settlement that would include not just a deal on a Palestinian state but also an end to decades of confrontation between Israel and states like Saudi Arabia and Syria. In remarks to his cabinet Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his conditions for Palestinian statehood. He said such a state must be demilitarized, Palestinians would have to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and Palestinian refugees would be resettled outside Is
