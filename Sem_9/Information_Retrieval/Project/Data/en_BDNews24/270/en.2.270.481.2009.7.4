 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - Former BNP minister Nazmul Huda, recently cleared of contempt charges over a High Court verdict, has slammed a lawyer's subsequent comments to the media. Huda on Saturday called for all media outlets to publish a statement of apology released by lawyer Manzil Morshed for saying the High Court had called Huda and co-accused Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Md Kamaruzzaman, "wrongheaded". The High Court on Thursday had dismissed a contempt petition filed against Huda and Kamaruzzaman by Supreme Court lawyer SM Zafar Ali for "speaking against" last month's ruling on the proclamation of independence. Manzil was widely quoted by the press, saying the High Court had termed Huda and Kamaruzzaman "wrongheaded" and "worthless", while dismissing Ali's contempt petition. Huda, holding a press conference at his Topkhana office on Saturday, said, "The High Court order did not use the words 'wrongheaded' or 'worthless' in its order." "The contempt case was dismissed by the court," said Huda. "But advocate Manzil Morshed described the verdict in a distorted way to the press." He said Morshed, lawyer for the petitioner, had caused Huda dishonour by distorting the High Court's verdict. Huda said, as a senior lawyer he would not demand compensation from a junior lawyer. "Filing a compensation case will not be appropriate." "But I hope in future he will not say something so carelessly and be forced to correct himself." The High Court on June 21 ruled that independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The proclamation has been a contentious issue between the Awami League and BNP for decades, with the latter claiming their leader and former president Ziaur Rahman, then a major in the Pakistan army, was the one to declare independence. Huda and Kamaruzzaman on June 29 termed the High Court verdict "personal" and "politically motivated" at a discussion meeting at the Jatiya Press Club, leading to Ali's contempt petition. bd
