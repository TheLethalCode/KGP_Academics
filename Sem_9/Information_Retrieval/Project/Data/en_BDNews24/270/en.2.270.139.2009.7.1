<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Prolific shooter Asif Hossain Khan will not defend his 10m air rifle gold when Bangladesh hosts the 5th South Asian Shooting Championship, scheduled for July 3-9 at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. "The federation on Tuesday decided to keep Asif out of the SA Shooting Championship squad to allow him to follow the new schedule made by the German coach, who has suggested not entering him in any competitions until the Islamic Solidarity Games in next October in Iran," said National Shooting Federation general secretary AN Ishtiaq Ahmed at a press conference on Wednesday. Isthtiaq said, "We are expecting something special from him in the 2012 Olympics in London and we don't want to hamper his training for the sack of his improvement." After finishing 54th out of 75 competitors in the ISSF World Cup in Milan in May, Asif went to the German city of Wesbaden to receive special training at the Olympic Training Centre for a month and recently returned home. Asif had earlier celebrated his return to the international arena on November 22, 2008 with gold in his favourite event -- 10m air rifle -- in the 4th SA Shooting Championship in Islamabad, Pakistan with his best-ever score of 694.3 out of 700 in the competition. With Asif's finest score, Bangladesh comprising of Asif, Iman and Saiful Islam Rinki also bagged the gold medal in the men's 10m air rifle event of the fourth edition meet that saw Bangladesh grab only those two gold medals. The NSF general secretary, however, said that they would try their best as well as achieve experience ahead of the 2010 South Asian (SA) Games in Bangladesh and thought that in the absence of Asif, Shuvon Chowdhury and Mahmudul Hasan would be Bangladesh's key players in the 10m air rifle event. Though Ishtiaq did not clear their position in the women's 10m air rifle, but it seemed they were also expecting a great performance from Sharmin Akhter Ratna and Sadia Sultana. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and hosts Bangladesh will be competing in 12 events as Nepal did not send a contingent due to the political unrest at home while the Maldives cannot participate for unavoidable reasons. Favourites Indian will be contesting without their star shooters Olympic gold medalist Avinab Bindra Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Olympic silver medalist Anjali Bhagwat, Jaspal Rana, Dr Karni Singh and Randhir Singh. However, India will be boosted by inclusion of Sanjeev Rajput, Samaresh Jung, Sushil Ghaley, Imran Hassan Khan, Rahunath PT and Tejaswini Sawant. Some 120 shooters and officials from five countries will participate in 13 events - 50m pistol (men), 10m air rifle (men and women), 50m rifle prone (men and wome), 10m air pistol (men and women), 50m rifle 3x40 (men and women), 25m standard pistol (men and women), sket 75 shots (men) and sket 50 shots (women).
