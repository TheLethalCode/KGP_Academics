 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)Former adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman has called for fair and transparent investigation into charges against members of the past caretaker government. Questioned by reporters after a seminar on Saturday, Hossain Zillur, who was education and commerce adviser during the interim administration, said, "I will reply to your questions as there is no reason to flee from the past." "Many discussions and reviews on the caretaker government are taking place now and will continue to be debated." Former law adviser Mainul Hosein and former home adviser MA Matin both face probes by parliamentary bodies over corruption charges. In the past few days, allegations have even surfaced against the two in connection with claims by the ruling and opposition parties that prime minister Sheikh Hasina and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia may have been fed poison during their terms in special jail from 2007-08. Since an elected government, led by Hasina's Awami League, came to power in January, many on both sides of the political divide have also called for the two-year emergency interim rulers to be put on trial for constitutional violations. Zillur, when pressed by reporters on Saturday about the charges against Moinul and Matin in particular, said, "I won't comment on the specific points that you ask." "Responsible persons will find the answers to the questions raised. A transparent process can solve this," he said. "During our period we tried to do our best knowingly and being honest in our duties," he added. He also said a common trend had been established in Bangladesh, calling it a "culture of revenge" against the past. Zillur Rahman, who was speaking after an Internet entrepreneurship seminar at the CIRDAP auditorium, urged all to focus on national identity at the end of all discussions. "We want to see a unified nation. There may be political rivalry, but everything should be out in the open." "Unity is the most important thing," said the former adviser. bdn
