<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh's entrepreneurs, particularly those involved in web-related ventures, make up an untapped resource that needs nurturing, former education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and others said at a seminar on Saturday. "Our entrepreneurs could be a big asset to the country, but remain an unused resource," Hossain Zillur said at the talks on 'Web Entrepreneurship in Bangladesh: Lessons from the Silicon Valley' at the CIRDAP auditorium. Former agriculture adviser CS Karim, presiding over the talks, said Bangladesh had huge "untapped potential" in the area. Dr Hasan Zillur Rahim, a computer scientist based in the US, presenting the keynote paper, said, "We must to look for new areas of work. Web entrepreneurship may be one of them." "The economy should be mobilised using the web," he said. Web entrepreneurship would help reduce the gap between the city and the village, he said. "It can also remove gender inequality and reduce dependence on remittances." Hasan Zillur said it did not call for big investment. "What is needed above all is internet connectivity." Citing the example of California's famed Silicon Valley, Hassan Zillur said, "We can also utilise their experience in this regard." Bangladesh Computer Association president Mostafa Zabbar said ninety-two per cent of the area of Bangladesh was within reach of Internet cover. Ninety eight per cent of the population lives in this area, he added. He said textbooks of secondary and primary level should be available by Internet. "Most countries of the world present their products, services, advertising, provide training and impart education over the web now," he said. Ex-adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said, "Our people are very entrepreneurial. We must not think because we are poor we cannot do a thing. We have a youth community that must be able to march ahead with hope." bd
