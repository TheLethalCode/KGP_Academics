 SANAA, Jul 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The flight recorder from the Yemenia-operated Airbus A310-300 that crashed into the Indian Ocean on Tuesday with 153 people on board has been located, the airline's head said on Wednesday. The state-controlled company would pay 20,000 euros ($28,140) in compensation to the victims' families, Abdul-Khaliq al-Qadi told a news conference. French and U.S. aircraft are among those hunting for survivors from the plane that crashed off the Comoros archipelago as it flew the final leg of a trip from Paris and Marseille to Comoros via Yemen.
