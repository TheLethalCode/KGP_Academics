<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)An expatriate living in Saudi Arabia has told a seminar that many Bangladeshis cannot send money home if hundi was not there. Dr Arifur Rahman, living in the Kingdom for 27 years, said on Friday that many Bangladeshis do not send their money through banks due to the stringent banking system in Saudi Arabia. Foreign minister Dipu Moni attended the discussion meeting at Hotel Sheraton on the role of Bangladesh missions and expatriate workers. Most of the speakers stressed sending money through banking channels. "There are some 50,000 Bangladeshi businessmen in Saudi Arabia. You will not believe them to be millionaires go by their clothes," Rahman said. "These illiterate people put millions of dollars in the banks. (But) when they attempt to send money through the banks, the Saudi secret police whisk them away and charge them with money laundering." So, some of them think of sending money through hundi, he added. Rahman said the Bangladeshis must leave Saudi Arabia as the kingdom did not issue citizenship to foreigners. "We have to come back. So, what will they do with the property in Saudi Arabia?" Rahman said the workers living in cities had the facility to send money through banking channels, but those from other towns have little scope. According to central bank estimate, expatriate Bangladeshis remitted over $9 billion in 2008 through official channels.
