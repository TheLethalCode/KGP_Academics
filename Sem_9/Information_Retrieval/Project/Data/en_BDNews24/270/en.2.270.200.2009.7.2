<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com)The national grid received another 33 megawatts from Thursday as Summit Utteranchal Power Company Limited launched a small independent power plant at a cost of Tk 145 crore. The prime minister's energy adviser Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury formally unveiled the plant at Maona in Gazipur. Chowdhury said the government planned to generate another 5,000 megawatts in coming years through public, private and combined initiatives. Referring to a Tk 2000 crore budgetary allocation for PPP, he said, "We also want to form a fund to assist the private sector instead of relying on the budget alone." He said about 30 million energy saving light bulbs would be distributed free throughout the country next year, which would cut 300-400 megawatts of consumption and attune the people to conserving power. On media criticism regarding slow growth in the power sector, he said, "The progress in this sector appears invisible and time consuming." Summit Uttaranchal's new plant will sell electricity to the Rural Electrification Board at Tk 2.32 per unit. The plant is expected to meet the power needs of about 112,000 consumers in Mymensingh and Gazipur. Gazipur deputy commissioner Md Kamal Uddin Talukdar, local ruling party MP Rahmat Ali, REB chairman Shafiqul Islam Bhuiyan and Summit Uttaranchal chairman Muhammad Aziz Khan were present. bd
