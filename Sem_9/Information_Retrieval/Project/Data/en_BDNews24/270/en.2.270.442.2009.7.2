<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman has called on government ministries and foreign missions to give all support to non-resident Bangladeshis so they in turn can do good for the country. He said creating a welcoming 'investment climate' for NRBs was a major means of national development. "NRB remittances play an important role in our economywe need to divert this money to a productive sector to develop the country," said Zillur at an NRB conference on manpower development in the city. "We need to train and develop the huge manpower resource we havenot only as labourers, but also as efficient engineers, doctors, IT specialist and academics," said Zillur. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said prosperity was impossible without fully exploiting the nation's huge population through proper training and development. Expatriate welfare and overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said Bangladesh was the third largest manpower exporting country. Atiur Rahman, governor of the Bangladesh Bank, said the country's foreign exchange reserves currently stood at $7.47 billion. "Most of this is contributed by NRBs," said Atiur. However, he said the safety of investments made in the country remained a critical stumbling block to investment. "This is why most NRBs opt for investing in real estate," added Atiur, who is also an advisor to Scholars Bangladesh, a co-organiser of the conference. The three-day conference on manpower development includes ten seminars, to be attended by government ministers, bureaucrats, expatriate academics and entrepreneurs. The conference will also conclude an awards ceremony, to be attended by finance minister AMA Muhith. Four awards will be given in the categories of Innovation in Remittance Collection, Migration Sector Development, Best Institute for Trade Skilled Development and Best Recruiting Agency
