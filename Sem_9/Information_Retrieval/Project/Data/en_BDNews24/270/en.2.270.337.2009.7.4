 Savar, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - Industries minister Dilip Barua has put down the recent riots by garment workers in Ashulia as part of ongoing attempts to destabilise the government. The Awami League government, which came to power in January after two years of emergency rule, has faced a number of trials in the past six months, including the February BDR mutiny, which the ruling party says were efforts to topple the government. Barua, at a meeting with garment factory owners and workers at Ashulia Saturday, in a similar vein said "certain interest groups" have been trying to attack the government. "In continuation, they have selected industrial areas and are focusing on small problems as huge." "Who will take the responsibility if the workers loose their jobs?" Thousands of protesting garment workers at Ashulia, in the Savar industrial belt outside Dhaka, clashed with law enforcers last week from Saturday to Monday (Jun 28-30). The three days of rioting left two workers dead and a factory ablaze Saturday's meeting was arranged at the conference room of Envoy Group, a concern of Abdus Sattar Khan, president the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Commerce minister Faruq Khan, the prime minister's adviser Syed Modaccher Ali and Dhaka district police superintendent Iqbal Bahar also attended. Faruq Khan also said "conspiracies" were taking place. "We have to tackle the situation." He advised raising intelligence activities to ensure security for factories and their owners. Garment manufacturers at the meeting also demanded more security for their factories. Iqbal Bahar suggested factory owners deploy more of their own security men to solve problems. He also backed a proposal to form an industrial police force. Syed Modaccher said, "Some garments owners are also liable for the instability in the sector. They have to ensure adequate payment and rights of the workers." After the meeting, the group visited the industrial site where the riots took place and the Hamim Group factory that was set ablaze. bdn
