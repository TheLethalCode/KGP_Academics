 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)A lawyer for former caretaker adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury, whom police have described as untraceable in a case of forcible occupation of a Gulshan property, filed a bail petition with a Dhaka court on Sunday. Lawyer Romel Chowdhury submitted the petition to Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Munshi Abdul Majid, who set the hearing for 2pm. Her husband, former MP Nazim Kamran Choudhury, his younger brother Mukim Choudhury and the Choudhury couple's son-in-law Adit Bhagat secured bail in the same case on Friday on a bond of Tk 50,000 each. The three were arrested on Thursday night. Police say they are still trying to trace Geeteara and the other accused, Choudhury's son Nazim Farhan Choudhury, Geeteara's brother Abu Rushd Tareq, Shamsunnahar Tareq, Sakhawat Hossain, Bipul Hossain and Yar Ali. Sunday's petition sought bail for all the remaining accused. House owners Dr Mahbubul Islam, a former professor at St Francis University in Pennsylvania, USA, and wife Farhana Islam, filed a case with Gulshan police charging 11 people with forcible occupation of their property, assault and death threats. The Islams accused the principal tenant Nazim Kamran and the others of illegally occupying the property, at 7/A, Road No 41, Gulshan-2, since the expiry of a five-year rental agreement. The prosecution lawyers told bdnews24.com that his clients had rented out the six-storied house, barring one-third of the fourth floor, in 2002, to set up offices of three firms, Adcomm, Signage and Megavision. The agreement expired on Sept 30, 2007, but the defendants did not leave the house. Lawyers for the defendants at Nazim Kamran's bail hearing on Friday told the court that the Islams had illegally asked them to leave the house without renewing the rental agreement and that the accused had been paying the rent through the court. The defendants themselves filed 15 cases against the house owners in the past, who in turn had filed eight, the lawyers added. Mahbubul Islam filed the current case last Thursday on behalf of wife Farhana, who owns the building. The case alleged that in July 2008, the accused forcibly brought a generator onto the premises ignoring the house owner's objections. The case also alleges that the accused had physically assaulted the house owner and made death threats against the Islam couple. Geeteara Choudhury was the industries adviser to the past military-installed caretaker government and one of four advisers to have controversially quit the interim cabinet in early 2008. bd
