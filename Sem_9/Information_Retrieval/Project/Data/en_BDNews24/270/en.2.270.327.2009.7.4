<TEXT>
 LONDON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea have rejected a bid from Premier League rivals Manchester City for captain and England defender John Terry. "Chelsea Football Club can confirm it has completely rejected an offer from Manchester City for John Terry," read a statement on Chelsea's website (www.chelseafc.com). "We would like to make clear, and will not do so again, that John is not for sale." City, owned by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayad al Nahyan, also had an approach for Terry, who has 53 England caps, rejected last season. City manager Mark Hughes has already added England midfielder Gareth Barry from Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers striker Roque Santa Cruz to his squad to push for Champions League qualification next season.
