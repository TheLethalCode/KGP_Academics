 Dhaka, July 06 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has protested a "police attack" on a group of demonstrators that marched on the Indian High Commission Sunday to press their demand to have high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty removed over recent controversial comments regarding the Tipaimukh dam. At least two people were arrested as the demonstrators, also demanding "a halt to construction" of the planned dam, clashed with police in the capital earlier in the day. Some 15 people including five policemen were injured in the skirmish. Gulshan police said that the group of people under the banner of an organisation called 'Lampost' staged the demonstration in the morning in front of the Indian High Commission. Police obstructed them as they tried to enter the high commission premises, leading to a brief tussle. Khaleda in statement issued later that night said it was a matter of concern if "people were harassed by the government and police when they were fighting in the national interest". Khaleda called for the speedy release of those arrested during the protest
