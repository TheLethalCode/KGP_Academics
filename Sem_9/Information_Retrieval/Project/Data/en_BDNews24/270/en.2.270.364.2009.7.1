 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Wednesday that the Indian high commissioner may have breached diplomatic norms when he spoke about the controversial Tipaimukh dam issue and Bangladesh's internal affairs last month. She also rejected high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty's view and said Dhaka could resolve the contention over construction of the Tipaimukh dam through dialogue with New Delhi in line with international laws on common rivers and Bangladesh-India relations. She said her ministry would take necessary action against the high commissioner if he had indeed breached diplomatic norms by his comments. The main opposition BNP last month demanded that Chakravarty be withdrawn for what the party said was his "meddling in the internal affairs of Bangladesh". Chakravarty, at a seminar on South Asian connectivity on June 21, had called the Bangladeshi water experts who opposed the controversial Tipaimukh dam "so-called experts" in the presence of Dipu Moni. The envoy also took a swipe at the BNP-led alliance for opposing against the Bangladesh-India Ganges water-sharing treaty and for anti-India comments, which he said were aimed at gaining "political mileage" Parameters In a press conference in her office Wednesday, Dipu Moni said foreign diplomats have some parameters on what to say and what not to say. "Personally, I think Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty might not have acted within his limits," Dipu Moni said in reply to a question from reporters. She also said bilateral treaties alone could not always resolve bilateral problems. "Many bilateral problems are resolved through discussions on the basis of bilateral relations beyond the international laws." "There are many international laws on common rivers. This issue (Tipaimukh dam) can be settled in the light of these international laws," the foreign minister said. Chakravarty had claimed on June 21 that there was no international treaty to settle the issue. He said a UN convention on shared water resources, approved by 17 countries so far, needed signing and ratification by 35 countries to be made into an international law. India's planned Tipaimukh dam is perceived by many experts in Bangladesh and abroad to spell environmental disaster for Bangladesh. Dipu Moni said on Wednesday that Bangladesh had demanded a meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission, which was formed to discuss water issues between Bangladesh and India. "We will raise the issue at the JRC's next meeting," Dipu Moni said. But, she added, Dhaka believed that India would not take any action that would harm Bangladesh's interests. 'Dual' face She also criticised the main opposition the BNP for its "dual" face in dealings with India. She said construction of the dam was mentioned at the 2003 and 2005 JRC meetings, while BNP was in power. "The BNP follow the policy of pleasing India when in power and going against when in opposition," said Hasan Mahmud, state minister for foreign affairs, supplementing the foreign minister.
