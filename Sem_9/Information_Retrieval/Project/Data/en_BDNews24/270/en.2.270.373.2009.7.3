 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)The parliament will pass an ordinance before July 9 to arm the National Human Rights Commission with judicial powers to address violation of human rights of Bangladeshis both at home and abroad, the chief of a parliamentary watchdog said on Friday. "We want to constitute an active and effective Human Rights Commission to deal with all human rights violation casesbe they committed in the country or abroad," said Suranjit Sengupta, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry. "The commission will be vested with necessary judicial authority too so that the damages can be redressed, " Sengupta said at a seminar on the second day of the 'First NRB Manpower Development and Opportunities Conference 2009' at Hotel Sheraton. The national HR watchdog will have its district chapters too, who will receive complaints on violations, carry out primary investigation and commission necessary trials, he added. On June 17, HRC member Muneera Khan after meeting with law minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters that the hands and feet of the HRC were tied because of a lack of necessary rules and regulations. Sengupta said: "In the name of a Human Rights Commission , we sure would not want another club for the retired bureaucrats or judges." "The chairman would be someone possessing adequate knowledge and thorough understanding of the human rights issues." The national HR watchdog will have its district chapters too, who will receive complaints on violations, carry out primary investigation and commission necessary trials. The caretaker government on September 1, 2008 constituted the HRC as per Section 3(1) of the National Human Rights Ordinance 2007. On December 1, 2008 the government appointed former justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury as the chairman and Muneera Khan and Niru K Chakma as commissioners to the HRC. Chaired by Sengupta, the seminar saw a paper titled 'Institutionalising non-resident workers' human rights and dealing with cheats at home and abroad' presented by Dr Abdul Momen, coordinator, Scholars Bangladesh. Dr Momen highlighted a few incidents of violation of human rights of NRBs working in a number of countries. "Because of lack of education and ignorance, the NRBs cannot seek any redress to the human rights violations they are subjected to, whereas laws in those countries mostly ensure people's protection in such cases." He presented a number of recommendations to overcome such problems including learning appropriate foreign languages and orientation about the relevant legal regimes. He also suggested that Bangladesh embassies in the countries recruiting Bangladeshi workers establish press wings, install hotlines and legal wings and start work on databases. Though Law minister Shafiq Ahmed was scheduled to be present at the event as the chief guest and labour and employment state minister Munnujan Sufian as the special guest, none turned up. Out of the 10 listed discussants, former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, BNP's acting joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, Roy Ramesh Chandra, general secretary of Jatiya Sramik League, Manusher Jonnyo Foundation chief Shaheen Anam, Supreme Court lawyer Tanjibul Haque, BAIRA secretary general Kazi Mohammad Mafizur Rahman and Dr Wazedul Islam Khan were absent. b
