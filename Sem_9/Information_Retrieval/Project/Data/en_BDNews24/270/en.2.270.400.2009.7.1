<TITLE> Murray tops bill amid glut of slam winners </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Not satisfied at being put through the wringer once, Andy Murray addicts were gearing up for another dose of heart-stopping action on Wednesday with the Scot topping the bill on men's quarter-finals day at Wimbledon. On a day when Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, Novak Djokovic and Juan Carlos Ferrero -- who between them own 19 grand slam titles -- were also out to claim semi-final places, it was a Murray who was again grabbing all the attention before he had stepped on court. So desperate are some fans to see Murray end Britain's 73-year wait for a men's champion, they joined the queue for tickets within minutes of the Scot winning his electrifying late-night blockbuster against Stanislas Wawrinka on Monday which finished in a floodlit arena. After camping out for two days, those in front of the queue were rewarded with Centre Court tickets while the rest flocked to claim their spot on Henman Hill on another sweltering day at the All England Club. Murray's mother, Judy, described watching her son's tussle against Wawrinka as "a cross between seasickness and having a heart attack" and while the fans would like nothing better than another epic, the third seed will be hoping for a less dramatic outing against Ferrero in their quarter-final since tougher challenges could lie ahead. None of those will be bigger than Federer should the two meet in Sunday's final. Seeing the all-conquering Swiss at the tail-end of a grand slam is taken for granted these days and the world number two will be aiming to reach his 21st successive major semi-final by taming Croatian ace machine Ivo Karlovic. In his 79 service games in four matches, Karlovic has not been broken once. In fact he has faced only four break points. In total he has sent down 137 aces. Such stats are enough to strike fear into most players but Federer is no ordinary opponent. Before Wednesday's match, the five-times Wimbledon champion recalled the moment he walked on Centre Court for the first time in 2001 to face Pete Sampras. So intimidated was he by the surroundings, his hands went cold, his pulse raced and his head was spinning. It is an experience that could hit Karlovic as he walks out for his first grand slam quarter-final. Over on Court One, 22-year-old Djokovic will be hoping to make his experience as the 2008 Australian Open champion count against Germany's Tommy Haas. At 31, Haas is the oldest man in the last eight but having already beaten Djokovic on grass, in the Halle final last month, he could heap more misery on the Serb. Following the battle between the youngest and oldest men left in the field, Roddick and Hewitt will be out renew a rivalry that is now into its ninth year. The Australian, 2002 champion here, leads their head-to-head 6-5 but will need all the support of his boisterous Fanatics cheerleaders as he looks to snap a four-match losing run against the American sixth seed.
