 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government will take stern action against the country's top loan defaulters, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Monday, a day after he unveiled a list of over 2,000 companies with classified loans totalling Tk 15,451 crore as of March this year. He said a Bangladesh Bank taskforce was working to take measures to stop loan defaults, including compliance with BASEL II accord for international banking standards. "The government will take proper measures against the defaulters no matter how big they are. The cabinet will discuss the matter very soon," Muhith told reporters after a meeting with a visiting Dutch delegation. He said banks must be aware of offering loans if the "culture of loan default" was to be wiped out. "I personally think it's not just the government who should be blamed for these massive defaults, the bank authorities are also responsible." "However, some loan defaults were caused by sick industries and the government will take measures on those soon," he said. Muhith also said they would start the process of getting wealth statements of ministers and MPs by the end of the month or at the beginning of the next month. "A regulatory initiative has been taken in this regard, which will get the nod by the end of the month or at the beginning of the next month," he said. Muhith rolled out a list of 2,196 defaulters, with classified loans of Tk 1 crore and above, in parliament on Sunday. Beximco Textile was the largest defaulter with around Tk 353 crore loan followed by Padma Textile Mills Limited, another company of Beximco Group, with nearly Tk 293 crore. State-run Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation comes next at number three with Tk 267.5 crore, followed by another government-managed company, Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation which has defaulted on Tk 177 crore. SDS International Limited with about Tk 140 crore is the fifth largest defaulter. Beximco's Shinepukur Holdings comes sixth with Tk 134 crore loan default, while Beximco Knitting has Tk 81 crore bd
