 GALLE, Sri Lanka, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka fast bowler Chaminda Vaas has told the country's national selectors that he is retiring from test cricket with immediate effect, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) confirmed on Saturday. SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga told Reuters that Vaas, a veteran of 110 tests, who has taken 354 wickets in a career spanning 15 years, informed selection chairman Ashantha de Mel of his decision earlier in the week. "Chaminda (Vaas) told him that he wants to concentrate on ODI's (one-dayers) and T20's (Twenty20s) in the future and he will be forwarding an official letter to that effect when he returns from abroad," Ranatunga told Reuters. "Sri Lanka Cricket's interim committee will also speak to him about his future and the role he can play in shaping Sri Lanka cricket in the future," he added, adding to speculation that he may be appointed Sri Lanka fast bowling coach in the future. Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara believes the 35-year-old Vaas still had a role in the limited-overs game. "I had a very good one-on-one chat with him (Vaas) before we went for the World Twenty20," Sanagakkara said on the eve of the match. "He has still got a role to play in our side. We just have to decide which format of the game he is going to make the most contribution in.
