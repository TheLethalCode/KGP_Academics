 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith on Sunday rolled out a list of 2,196 companies that have defaulted on repayment loans to the tune of Tk 15,451 crore as of March this year. A Beximco Group company heads the central bank's list of top defaulters, Muhith told the parliament on a question from Noor Afroz Ali MP. He said the list of Bangladesh Bank's Credit Information Bureau (CIB) comprised those defaulters who had classified loans of Tk 1 crore and above. Muhith also said the Awami League-led government had taken initiatives to realise the outstanding loans. He said Tk 591 crore 44 lakh was recovered until March 31 this year. "The Bangladesh Bank has formed a separate cell to recover the defaulted loans. The central bank is supervising the processes necessary for speedy disposal of the cases filed against the loan defaulters in loan courts." Muhith said the central bank was keeping an eye on the banks over recovery of the classified loans. Beximco Textile is the largest defaulter with around Tk 353 crore loan followed by Padma Textile Mills Limited, another company of Beximco Group, with nearly Tk 293.
