<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khondaker Delwar Hossain has called for fair and transparent investigation of charges that have surfaced of poisoned food served to prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia in special jail under the creataker government. "If the incident of mixing poison in the food of the two leaders in jail during the emergency period is true, it deserves proper investigation", Delwar said on Saturday. "As in the case of the BDR mutiny, names of the suspects should not come out before serious investigation. We should all be careful about responding to questions from the media," Delwar told reporters at the BNP central office in Paltan. Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury earlier in the week alleged that Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was given food mixed with poison by the former military-installed caretaker government while she was detained in a special jail between 2007-08. BNP has also claimed the same for party chairperson Khaleda Zia. Hasina's former personal physician, now the prime minister's health adviser, Syed Modasser Ali on Friday named two former advisers, Mainul Hossain and MA Matin as being involved in the alleged poisoning attempts. bd
