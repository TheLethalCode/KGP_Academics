 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)Two more cases of swine flu have been detected in Bangladesh, bringing the number of confirmed infections in the country to 18, IEDCR director Mahmudur Rahman said Saturday. Rahman told bdnews24.com ten of the cases identified by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research had been contracted overseas, while the remaining eight had become infected within the country. "The two newly identified cases were probably infected by relatives, who had recently returned from abroad," said Rahman The new cases are a young man and woman, aged between 20 to 22, currently residing in Dhaka, he said. Rahman said ten of the victims were yet to fully recover and remain under the supervision of the health directorate in their homes, although they are isolated from other family members. He said treatment in hospital was unnecessary as all the patients had presented with slight symptoms. "Everyone is improving," he said, adding that if they developed any problems they would be taken to hospital immediately for treatment. WHO declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 1, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 89,000 cases have so far been detected in 125 countries worldwide, with 382 fatalities on record. Incoming passengers are being screened for symptoms at Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports, Chittagong and Mongla seaports and 11 land ports as a protection measure, say officials. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the virus. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and to practice regular hand washing to curb spread of the virus. bd
