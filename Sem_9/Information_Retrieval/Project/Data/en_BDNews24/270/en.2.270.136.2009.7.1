 Dhakam July 1 (bdnews24.com)- Private bus operators temporarily called off a strike in four southern districts after a joint meeting at the Bagerhat district commissioner's office on Wednesday night. Transport leaders, BRTC officials and police attended the meeting. "The transport leaders informed us of their decision after the meeting. Buses will run as normal tomorrow," Bagerhat superintendent of police Awlad Ali Fakir told bdnews24.com. Nazrul Islam Mantu, president of Bagerhat Interdistrict Bus Owners Association, told bdnews24.com that the strike was suspended until July 8. "The district commissioner asked us to wait until a meeting at the communications ministry on July 8," said Mantu. "We will decide our next actions, after that meeting." Mantu had earlier told bdnews24.com they were continuing their strike for a second day on Wednesday as authorities had not contacted them to discuss their demands. The Combined Owners-Workers United Council called the strike on Tuesday to press home five demands that include prevention of "irregularities" in the transport sector, banning informal public transport, such as Nasiman and motorcycles, and opposition to BTRC buses. The bus operators also demanded withdrawal of cases against officials of Jhalakathi and Bagerhat Bus-Minibus Owners Association. No private bus companies were operating through Tuesday and Wednesday day on the 33 routes in four districtsKhulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur and Jhalakathicausing misery for thousands of commuters. BTRC buses were moving on the routes as usual, however, under tight security. BRTC's Khulna depot director Nihar Ranjan Majumder said six buses left the depot Wednesday morning. There were no reports of any obstruction by strikers, he said. Bagerhat police super Awlad Ali Fakir said the police had been patrolling for the smooth movement of BRTC buses in the district. bdnews24.co
