 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com health correspondent Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)Seven more cases of swine flu have been detected by IEDCR, bringing the number of confirmed infections in Bangladesh to 16, an official said Wednesday. "Three more cases were confirmed Tuesday night, while four others were identified Wednesday. They are aged between two and 46," Prof Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, told bdnews24.com. Divisional health directorate heads and civil surgeons of all districts have been asked to attend an emergency meeting in Dhaka on Thursday to plan measures to combat the spread of the virus, said Rahman. The directorate of health has also asked private TV stations to broadcast public information programmes in a bid to halt the progress of the disease. Five of the new cases were contracted within Bangladesh, although the majority of swine flu cases in Bangladesh arrived from the USA and Australia, Rahman said. Senior IEDCR official Mustaq Hossain said now that the virus was being transmitted within the country more stringent measures were required to contain the disease. Hossain said influenza can spread very quickly in Bangladesh, particularly in Dhaka where the high population density provides a perfect breeding ground. "But the virus found here appears so far to have a lower mortality rate than that found in the USA and Mexico," he added. The outbreak is at level-1 in Bangladesh for now, according to the WHO scale of epidemic and pandemic alerts, as the cases are found scattered, said Mustaq. Level-2 is declared if more than one infected is found in a family, he said. WHO declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 1, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. Approximately 77,000 cases have so far been detected in 70 countries worldwide, with 332 fatalities on record. Incoming passengers are being screened for symptoms at Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports, Chittagong and Mongla seaports and 11 land ports as a protection measure, say officials. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the virus. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and regular hand washing to curb spread of the virus. bdnews
