 SOFIA, Sun Jul 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgarians voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election they hope will restart reforms to combat endemic corruption and heal an economy severely damaged by the global crisis. Opinion polls show the Socialist party that leads the current coalition government is likely to lose due to recession and a climate of impunity for crime bosses and politicians that has turned Bulgaria into the black sheep of the European Union. Last year the ex-communist Balkan country, which joined the EU in 2007 and is the bloc's poorest member, lost access to over half a billion of euros in EU aid as punishment for graft. If opinion polls prove correct, the center-right opposition party of Sofia Mayor Boiko Borisov, GERB, will get a shot at forming a government, most likely another coalition. Borisov, 50, a former bodyguard-turned-politician, has promised to tackle crime but observers are cautious because of his limited track record and concerns his ability to introduce reforms may be watered down in any coalition talks. His party now garners roughly 30 percent of the vote, pollsters say, against 20 percent for the ruling Socialists. "I am fed up with the government," said former teacher Pepa Kozhuharova, 64, as she cast her vote in a Sofia neighborhood. "This country badly needs change. We have to show we don't want corrupt politicians anymore." Straight-talking, burly Borisov, nicknamed Batman after the fictional superhero due to his zeal for action, has won the hearts of many Bulgarians, tired of two decades of slow reforms. "I supported Boiko because he is the only man who can stand up and say what is wrong and what is right and implement it," said Maria Nikolova, 50, after casting her vote in Sofia. A new government must move fast to avoid new EU sanctions on aid, badly needed to fund Bulgaria's cash-strapped economy, and to attract investors, many of whom fled this year. It is not clear whether GERB will get enough votes for a stable majority in the 240-strong chamber with planned coalition partners, the Blue Coalition -- a group of rightist parties. SLIPSHOD REFORMS The current government took Bulgaria's 7.6 million people into the EU, lowered taxes and maintained tight fiscal policies. But critics accuse it of incompetence and lacking the will to sever links between politicians, magistrates and crime chiefs. Underscoring the depth of the problem, prosecutors have launched investigations into widespread allegations of vote-buying by virtually all parties before the ballot, and on Saturday at least five people were arrested. EU countries have also expressed concern over the participation of several suspected criminals who last month registered to run for parliament to obtain temporary immunity from prosecution and release from custody. Hit hard by the global financial crisis, Bulgaria is in recession after 12 years of growth and this has sparked mass protests. Rising unemployment is ending years of voracious private spending that has fueled a mountain of debt. The economy is seen shrinking by 2 percent in 2009, and like some of its former Soviet bloc peers now in the EU, Bulgaria will likely seek International Monetary Fund aid, analysts say. Voting started at 6 a.m. (11 p.m. EDT on Sunday) and ends at 7 p.m., with exit polls due shortly afterwards. Turnout was 29.3 percent by 6 a.m.
