 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) - Sadia Sultana of Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan finished seventh in the girls' 10m air rifle event in the inaugural Asian Youth Games at SAFRA Yishun in Singapore on Wednesday. Sadia scored 392 out of 400 in the finals, but her team-mate Tripti Datta failed to qualify for the final round. Both shooters leave Singapore Thursday for home to take part in the 5th South Asian Shooting Championship in Dhaka. Shovon Chowdhury and Mahmudul Hasan will compete in the boys' 10m air rifles on Saturday. On the other hand, Bangladesh, who got a walkover against Malaysia in basketball (FIBA 3 on 3) on Tuesday, will take on United Arab Emirates on Thursday morning and face Thailand in the afternoon on the same day.
