 Dhaka, Jul 5 (bdnews24.com)Two people were arrested as a group of demonstrators, protesting against India's planned Tipaimukh dam, clashed with police in the capital on Sunday, officials said. Some 15 people including five policemen and 10 protesters were injured in the skirmish in Gulshan, as the latter were heading towards the Indian High Commission demanding a halt to the Tipaimukh dam project and withdrawal of the high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. Gulshan deputy police commissioner Hafiz Akhtar said that a group of people under the banner of an organisation called 'Lampost' staged the demonstration in the morning in front of the Indian High Commission. Police obstructed them as they tried to enter the high commission premises, leading to a brief tussle. Gulshan police subinspector Rafiqul Islam said no case was filed immediately, but one might be brought against the protestors on charges of disturbing the peace. bdnews24.c
