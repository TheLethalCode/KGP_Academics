<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Huq said Saturday that the recent notorious triple murder at Karwan Bazar was the result of a gang related turf-war in the heart of the capital. Speaking at a press briefing at the Detective Branch headquarters, Huq said information received by police suggested that up to 30 individuals had some involvement in the murders. "We have made ten arrests so far, and three of the detained fired shots on the day of the murders. Nine handguns were recovered from different suspects on the day of the killings," said Huq. He said ten armed gang members took up positions in the market and a further eight were employed as lookouts. "Six individuals were involved in planning the murders. The remaining suspects helped the murderers in different ways through the supply of arms and other activities," said Huq. The DMP chief said huge amounts of money were extorted every day from Karwan Bazar's wholesale and retail traders in a variety of ways. Faruq Mollah, one of the murder victims, was heavily involved in extortion in and around the Bazar over a long period of time, said Huq. "He was murdered to clear the way for others who wanted to take his place." "There are some 'godfathers' involved in the killings. They were trying to spread their sphere of influence. We have learned their names and are currently trying to locate them," said Huq. "The arrested suspects have confessed to receiving an initial payment of Tk 145,000 for carrying out the murders," said Huq. Following the murders they were to have each received a motorcycle and further payments of Tk 50,000 in addition to receiving a daily income of Tk 500 from the illegal earnings of the 'new gang', he said. b
