 GALLE, Sri Lanka, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The bowlers dominated the opening day of the first test on Saturday, with Pakistan slumping to 15 for two after Sri Lanka were bowled out for 292. The visitors were on top for most of the day before Sri Lanka fast bowlers Nuwan Kulasekara and Thilan Thushara picked up a wicket apiece before the close. Kulasekara bowled Salman Butt for a duck when the opener shouldered arms to a delivery that cut sharply off the seam and left-armer Thushara trapped Khurram Manzoor leg before for two with another inswinger. Earlier, Tharanga Paranavitana top-scored for the home team with 72 while all-rounder Angelo Mathews contributed 42 in 57 deliveries. MAIDEN FIFTY Opener Paranavitana's maiden test half-century rescued the hosts after 17-year-old paceman Mohammad Aamer had struck twice on his debut to leave Sri Lanka reeling on 21 for two on the first day of the three-match series. The 27-year-old left-hander, who faced 125 balls and hit 11 fours, added 75 runs for the third wicket with former captain Mahela Jayawardene (30) who fell just before lunch when he was caught behind off another debutant fast bowler, Abdur Rauf. Jayawardene's dismissal was a relief for wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, who dropped the right-hander before he had scored. After lunch Paranavitana put on 43 with Thilan Samaraweera (31), who was making his first-class comeback after being injured in the Lahore attacks four months ago. Paranavitana then edged a rising delivery from Rauf to Misbah-ul-Haq before Samaraweera clipped a gentle outswinger from part-time medium pacer Younus Khan to the keeper. Aamer was the pick of the attack with three for 74 while captain Younus, Rauf and debutant off-spinner Saeed Ajmal all took two apiece.
