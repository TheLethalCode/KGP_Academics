 BAGHDAD, Thu Jul 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A roadside bomb blew up as an Iraqi army patrol passed by in Baghdad on Thursday, killing one soldier and wounding 10 two days after US troops pulled out of cities and handed security to their local counterparts, police said. The bomb was the first in Baghdad, police said, since Tuesday's partial US withdrawal, a day labeled "National Sovereignty Day" by Iraqi authorities elated at what they see as a major step to shaking off a foreign occupation. The pullback from urban centers is a major milestone in a bilateral security agreement that calls for the last of the US soldiers who invaded Iraq in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein to leave the country by the end of 2011.

US and Iraqi officials say they expect insurgents and militants to try to take advantage of the US pullback to launch more attacks and to test the Iraqi defense forces. The leader of the Islamic Army in Iraq, thought to be the military wing of Saddam's outlawed Baath party, claimed the US withdrawal was a victory not for the Iraqi government but for insurgents, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. "If anyone has a right to celebrate victory, it should be the resistance and its men and those who rallied around it and supported it among the children of our people and our Ummah (nation)," the "emir" of the group said in an online message monitored by SITE. "They are the ones who brought the occupation to a despicable defeat and made their remaining forces in Iraq demanding and very cos
