 NEW DELHI, Jul 1(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government unexpectedly raised gasoline and diesel prices by as much as 10 percent on Wednesday, its first increase this year, passing some of oil's rally into an economy just beginning to find its feet amid a global recession. The hike will aid margins for state-owned refiners forced to sell at government-set prices, likely further lifting shares in Indian Oil Corp and its peers, and may be only a prelude to greater free-market price reforms in next week's budget. Petrol prices in Delhi will rise by 4 rupees a litre, while diesel rates will rise by 2 rupees a litre, Oil Minister Murli Deora told reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Prices were last raised in June last year, when the average price of India's crude imports was $113 a barrel, but they were cut in December and again in January as oil tumbled. U.S. crude oil prices have more than doubled since a February low, with second-quarter gains the highest since 1990. "In view of the increase in the price of crude oil ... it has become inevitable to revisit the prices," Deora said. Petroleum Secretary R.S. Pandey said oil firms would still suffer a revenue loss even after the new rates, and this burden would fall primarily on exploration and production firms like India Oil and Natural Gas Corp. CHINA, THEN INDIA India's move comes just two days after China raised prices for a third time this year to their highest ever, meaning motorists and businesses in the world's fastest-growing oil consuming nations are facing extra cost pressure just as their economies begin to show signs of picking up speed. At about $3.50 a gallon for petrol, including India's heavy retail fuel taxes, New Delhi drivers are paying nearly $1 more than their American counterparts. While India, China and many other developing nations chose to shelter their citizens with subsidies during most of oil's six-year rally to a record $147 last summer, some are now dismantling those schemes in an effort to prevent wanton or wasteful fuel use and temper demand. Emboldened by an unexpectedly strong election victory this month, the Congress-led cabinet is due this month to consider a proposal to free state controls on transport fuel prices, one of many important reforms expected from a government now unshackled from the constraints of its erstwhile Communist partners. "This is an indication that we are moving towards linking local fuel prices to international price, which is desirable as it will help reduce the subsidy burden," said Gaurav Kapur, senior economist at ABN AMRO Bank in Mumbai. Pricing freedom would increase tax revenue and remove massive subsidies bills, helping offset the cost of economic stimulus measures that have stretched public finances and widened the fiscal deficit to 6 percent of GDP. India imports about 70 percent of the oil it consumes and accumulated a huge burden of subsidies as it kept prices artificially low when crude soared to its peak last year. Eliminating subsidies would open a domestic opportunity for private sector firms Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, which had shut own their petrol stations as customers bought cheaper fuel from subsidised state rivals.
