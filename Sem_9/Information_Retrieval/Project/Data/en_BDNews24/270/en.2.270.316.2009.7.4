 Dhaka July 4 (bdnews24.com)Awami League will ask the Election Commission to extend the deadline by another six months for the ruling party to approve its permanent constitution by holding council. Ruling party spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam spoke to reporters Saturday after a meeting of the AL presidium, chaired by party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Regarding reasons for requesting the extension, he said, "Floods may take place, which will make holding council difficult." "There are some other reasons," Ashraf said. "District level party committees also need to hold councils." "So the presidium decided to ask for six more months through a formal application." "We will send a letter to the commission soon," said Ashraf. The deadline, according to electoral laws, for all political parties to approve their permanent constitutions is July 25. With the final date looming, the Election Commission has hinted in recent months that it may extend the deadline if parties formally sought more time. "We will consider it if the parties ask for more time to make preparations for council and other things to submit their permanent constitutions," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said in April. Parties had suffered disruptions because of many incidents, including the BDR mutiny, he said. Thirty-nine parties were registered by the commission, ahead of the parliamentary elections in December last year, after submitting new draft constitutions according to amended electoral laws. The amended Representation of the People Order allows a period of six months from the day the new parliament convened, on Jan 25 this year, to submit their permanent constitutions after approval by party councils. bd
