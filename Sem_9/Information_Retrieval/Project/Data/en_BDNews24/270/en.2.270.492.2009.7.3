 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid to calm the rancour over the new committee of party's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Friday said leaders and workers who makes sacrifices will be evaluated. "There can be grievances over the new committee. The chairperson has approved the committee after discussion with the leaders," he said after placing floral wreathes at the grave of party founder Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. "Now everybody will have to work together in the interest of the party," he added. A statement released on Wednesday announced five top leaders of the new committee approved by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. It said Sultan Salahuddin Tuku will be the president of the organisation and Amirul Islam Khan Alim the general secretary. Tuku was the senior vice president in the previous central committee and is the younger brother of BNP leader Abdus Salam Pintu, an accused in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. Tuku ran in the ninth parliamentary elections from Tangail-2, but did not win the seat. General activists say the committee that consists of 'patrons of Jamaat-e-Islami and militancy'. They also say he is too old for the job, having graduated from the university years ago. Delwar congratulated the new leadership and said JCD started a new journey under the new leadership. "The new leadership will strengthen the organisation starting from the grassroots. It will also evaluate the leaders and workers." Tuku was with Delwar at that time, while Alim came to the grave with Rizvi Ahmed, the office secretary of BNP. The new JCD leaders assembled at the grave before the Juma prayers to take oath. BNP's student affairs secretary Fazlul Haque Milon oversaw the ceremony. Senior vice-president Shahidul Islam Babul, joint general secretary Amiruzzaman Khan Shimul, organising secretary Anisur Rahman Khokon, organizing secretary of youth wing Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal Khairul Kabir Khokon, MP Shahid Uddin Chowdhuru Annie, former JCD leader Nazim Uddin Alam, Habib-un-Nabi Khan Sohel, ABM Mosharraf Hossain, former JCD president Azizul Bari Helal and general secretary Shafiul Bari Babu were present among others.
