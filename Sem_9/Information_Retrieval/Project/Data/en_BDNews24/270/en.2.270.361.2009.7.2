 Thakurgaon, July 2 (bdnews24.com)Four passenger coaches of the mail train Kanchan Express derailed Thursday at Harinarayanpur of Thakurgaon Sadar, bdnews24.com Thakurgaon correspondent said. Thakurgaon Road railway station master Shamsul Haque said no casualties were reported from the mishap as the train was cruising at a low speed. The coaches derailed at Harinarayanpur, some three kilometres the south of Thakurgaon Road station, at 11am as it was travelling from Parbatipur to Thakurgaon, he said. As a result, all the trains including Kanchan Express scheduled to connect Barendra express along the accident-gripped tracks have been cancelled. Train communication will resume on Friday, the officials said. Maintaining rail communication in the monsoon on newly laid Dinajpur-Thakurgaon-Panchagarh route was becoming difficult, they added. As the tracks are yet to settle, there have been six incidents of trains being derailed this year along this route, they added.
