 MUMBAI, Jul 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Azharuddin Ismail, of the Oscar-winning movie "Slumdog Millionaire", moved into his new home in an upmarket Mumbai suburb on Saturday, a far cry from his family's former dwelling -- a shanty by the railway tracks. Ismail, 9, played the youngest Salim in British director Danny Boyle's rags-to-riches film about a slum dweller trying his luck on a TV gameshow.

"We have lived on the road for so many years. I had never dreamed that we would have a roof over our heads," Ismail's mother, Shameem, told Reuters. The Jai Ho Trust is looking for a house for Ismail's co-star Rubina Ali, who still lives in a slum with her family. Ismail's move may present one problem.
