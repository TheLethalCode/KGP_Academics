 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)Police on Friday took former MP Nazim Kamran Choudhury, the husband of former caretaker adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury, and their two close relatives to Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Gulshan police took them to the court at around 3:30pm and kept then in court prison. Geetiara's businessman husband Nazim Kamran, his younger brother Mukim Choudhury and the Choudhury couple's son-in-law Adit Bhagat were arrested on charges of forcible occupation of a Gulshan property. Police are looking for Geeteara, who was industries adviser to the past military-installed caretaker government and one of four advisers to have controversially quit the interim cabinet. House owners Dr Mahbubul Islam and wife Farhana Islam filed a case with Gulshan police naming 11 people. The other defendants are their daughter Nazim Farhana Choudhury, Abu Rushd Tareq, Shamsunnahar Tareq, Sakhawat Hossain alias Shahadat, Ripon Chandra Saha, Bipul Hossain and Yar Ali. Gulshan police chief Kamrul Alam Mollah told bdnews24.com that the three were arrested at Gulshan-1 at around 11:30pm. Asked whether Geetiara would be arrested too, Mollah said: "We are looking for all the accused in the case." Mollah said Islam had filed the case on behalf of wife Farhana, who owned the building at 7/A, Road No 41, Gulshan-2. The Islams said tenant Nazim and the other accused had been forcibly occupying the property since the expiry of a five-year rental agreement. The case alleged that in July 2008, the accused forcibly brought a generator onto the premises ignoring the house owner's objections. The case also alleges that the accused had physically assaulted the house owner and made death threats against the Islam couple. Farhana Islam had filed a similar case before with the Dhaka District and Sessions Judge's Court in November 2007, accusing three companies belonging to the Choudhurys, including advertising firm Adcomm, of illegal occupation. But the court quashed the case on Jan 25 2008, on the basis of a report by the then investigating officer saying the allegation was "not proved". Gulshan police sub-inspector Masud Karim, who is the investigation officer in the new case, quoting the FIR said on Thursday that the Islam couple had filed their complaint again under the new government as Geeteara had been a powerful figure when they had filed their previous case. In their original case, the Islams alleged that Geeteara misused power as an adviser to aid her husband to continue occupying the premises in flagrant violation of the rental agreement. bdnews24
