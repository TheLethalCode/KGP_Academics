<TEXT>
 KARACHI, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has fined pace bowler Mohammad Asif one million rupees ($10,250) for bringing Pakistan into disrepute, after he was detained in Dubai last year for possessing opium. However, Asif would be considered for the Champions Trophy in South Africa starting on Sept. 24, after he had completed a 12-month ban for a positive dope test, a senior board official told Reuters on Thursday. "The probe committee that examined his 19-day detention in Dubai last year in June has found he had violated the code of conduct and brought the country into disrepute," Salim Altaf, chief operating officer, said. "That is why he has been fined one million rupees." Asif, who has played 11 tests and 31 one-day internationals, was banned last September after testing positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone while playing for the Delhi Daredevils team in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was detained in Dubai while returning from India after a small amount of opium was found on him. He was then deported to Pakistan without the authorities pressing criminal charges. "We don't see any reason to keep him out of cricket once his ban ends," Altaf said. "As far as his Dubai detention case is concerned he has been fined for that."
