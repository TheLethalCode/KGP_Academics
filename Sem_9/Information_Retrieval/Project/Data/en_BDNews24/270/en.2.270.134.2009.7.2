<TITLE> Changing test format will damage game, says Miandad </TITLE>

 KARACHI, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan test captain Javed Miandad has urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to resist calls for a shake-up of the traditional test match format. The ICC is considering reducing tests to four days from the current five as part of a series of innovations aimed at keeping the oldest form of the sport exciting to spectators in the wake of Twenty20's growing popularity. "Any move to change the format of test cricket or the way it is played would prove very harmful to cricket in the long run," Miandad told Reuters on Thursday. "I don't think reducing tests to four-day events and playing them under lights or using coloured balls will help the sport, which needs its traditional form to survive." Despite the rising popularity of Twenty20 cricket, most players considered test cricket as the real format for the game, he added. "Twenty20 is good entertainment and has commercial value but any move to tamper with the traditional format of test cricket will prove counter productive," Miandad added. The former batsman, who appeared in 124 tests and is now on the Pakistan board, said it was important to find away to let all forms flourish. "A path must be found for all formats of the sport to survive together like test and one-day matches have done." Pakistan won the Twenty20 World Cup last month in England and the shortest format of the game is becoming increasingly popular in the country.
