 Chapainawabganj, July 3 (bdnews24.com)BDR director general Major General Mainul Islam has called for restoring order in the paramilitary border force and reiterated that those involved in the bloody mutiny will surely be put on trial. "Order should be restored in the battalion. You yourself will have to take the responsibility of your weapons," he said to members at the Darbar Hall of 39 Rifles Battalion at Chapainawabganj during a two-day visit on Friday. He urged them to become witnesses against those involved in the mutiny on Feb 26-27 when around 50 BDR officers including the chief were killed by renegade members at Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. "BDR personnel are carrying out their duties in the border areas properly. They are also playing an active role in preventing smuggling," the chief said. The process to reform the force is going on, which includes changing the name force and most of those involved have been arrested after that incident, Gen Mainul added . On the first day of the visit, he had a meeting with CS Sidhu, sector commander of Maldaha of India's Border Security Force, on the border situation. The meeting was held at Mahdipur in India on the other side of Sona Masjid land port. bdnews
