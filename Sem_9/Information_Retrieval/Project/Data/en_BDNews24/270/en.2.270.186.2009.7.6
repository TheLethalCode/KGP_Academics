<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 06 (bdews24.com)The parliamentary team set to visit to the site of the controversial Tipaimukh dam in India will include two BNP MPs, the chairman of the standing committee on water resources, Abdur Razzak, said on Monday. "I agree that we should include members of the BNP to make it an all-party team," said Razzak, after a committee meeting at the parliament building. He said the schedule of the visit would be finalised when they received the names of the BNP representatives. The move to include representatives of the main opposition party changes the initial make up of the team, which did not include any BNP MPs as none were part of the standing committee on water resources from which the team had been selected, Razzak had previously said. The new decision follows a meeting between Razzak and opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque on the issue on Sunday. Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint River Commission and Prof Monowar Hossain of Bangladesh University will also be included in the team as experts, said Razzak,a former water resources minister. The delegation is expected to visit the site of the planned dam, situated on the cross-border Barak River in the Indian state of Monipur, sometime in July. India extended an invitation to Bangladesh to send a delegation to view the site in a bid to 'allay Dhaka's fears' over the controversial dam. The opposition BNP and environmentalist groups have expressed concern that the dam in northeast India would cause an environmental catastrophe downstream in Bangladesh. India, however, maintains the Tipaimukh dam is a power generation project that would result in no diversion of water from Bangladesh. bd
