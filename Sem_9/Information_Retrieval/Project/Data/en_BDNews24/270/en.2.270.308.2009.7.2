 TEHRAN, Jul 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has hanged six people for murder, but the lives of two others due to be executed at the same time were spared by the families of their victims, an Iranian newspaper reported on Thursday. The execution of a ninth convicted murderer, who was 16 at the time of his crime in 1992, was postponed on the order of judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi, the Etemad newspaper said.

Under Iran's Islamic law, punishment for people convicted as "mohareb" is execution. Iran's police chief, Ismail Ahmadi-Moghaddam, on Wednesday said a total of 1,032 had been detained during unrest following the disputed June 12 presidential election, which was won by hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
