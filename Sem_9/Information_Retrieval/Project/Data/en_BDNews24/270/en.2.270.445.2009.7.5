 Dhaka, Jul 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman has asked banks and financial institutions to take a careful stance in a bid to keep the stock market stable. Speaking at the inaugural session of the Basic Training Course for central bank officials, Rahman also asked them to be vigilant against rumours that could destabilise the market. He called on financial institutions to advise investors to carefully consider company fundamentals, and not to part with money based on rumours or fad. Rahman told the session, held at the Bangladesh Bank Training Academy, that the capital market has recently gained huge interest from the public. "The market has regained confidence. That's why investors are leaning towards it." "But all stakeholders should keep a close eye against any sort of instability or manipulation," said Rahman. "The market regulator, SEC should strictly monitor the market situation, but banks and financial institutions also need to be watchful." The central bank would keep strict vigilance on banks and financial institutions, said Rahman. On a separate issue, the central bank boss said that farm loans would see a significant rise in the current fiscal year in a bid to raise farm output. The central bank would set the target for farm loans by banks within a few days, he said. bdn
