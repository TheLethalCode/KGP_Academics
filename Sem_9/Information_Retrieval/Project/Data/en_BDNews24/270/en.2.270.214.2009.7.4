 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)A TIB report released Saturday says over Tk 5 crore and 24 hours of time were wasted during the ninth parliament's first session due to quorum problems. The Transparency International Bangladesh report, titled 'Parliament Watch', also said adequate input by the public had not been ensured prior to the enactment of laws. The corruption watchdog said sittings began late every day, and on average 40 minutes were wasted daily because the minimum number of members required for parliamentary business failed to properly attend. During the first session, the main opposition party failed to attend parliament 17 times and walked out on another 6 occasions, citing the issue of seating arrangements as their reason, TIB reported. The report also said 3.7 percent of total parliamentary time was spent discussing points of order, during which the party hierarchy was praised 251 times, criticised 342 times and unrelated issues were discussed 503 times. Released at a roundtable meeting at the BRAC Centre Inn, the report did, however, praise the timely formation of parliamentary standing committees, which reflected positively on the state of the country's democracy. All forty-eight standing committees, in which four chairmen were selected from the opposition, were formed in the first session of the House for the first time in the parliament's history, the report said. b
