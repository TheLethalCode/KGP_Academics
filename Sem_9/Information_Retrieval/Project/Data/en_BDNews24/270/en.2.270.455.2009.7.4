<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin is likely to finalise the participating sides of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup football tournament while attending the audit committee meeting of the Asian Football Federation in Malaysia. Salahuddin is due to leave Saturday night for Malaysia to attend Monday's AFC internal audit committee meeting. The BFF boss will meet the AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam as well as Alberto Colaco, the general secretary of All Indian Football Federation. "The president may finalise the participants of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup during his Malaysia trip as he is expected to meet the AFC president and Indian Football Federation general secretary," said BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi. The BFF is trying to include two clubs from India in the eight-team tournament that will also see two local giants Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club, but the problem is now whether India send their clubs in October or November. The Indian professional football league will start in September and it would be seemingly tough to bring Indian clubs amid their league and it would be clear after the meeting between Salahuddin and Colaco in Malaysia. Salahuddin has already talked to the high-ups of different football associations such as Myanmar, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, India, Thailand, Iran, Iraq, Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia and Uzbekistan. Meanwhile, CR Belouizdad, the six-time Algerian league winners, are interested to play in the tournament and is now waiting for a response from BFF. bd
