 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  Mashrafe Bin Mortaza is set to make his debut as Bangladesh captain when he leads the side against West Indies A in the three-day practice match beginning in Barbados on Friday. The cricketers had a tough practice session at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday. The home side named a vastly inexperienced 12-member squad for the warm-up match with only three players -- Sewnarine Chattergoon (captain), Kemar Roach and Lendl Simmons  having international experience. Lendl, the nephew of Phil Simmons, was not included for the five-match ODI series against touring India despite a good performance in the ICC World Twenty20 and has now been given room in the warm-up match. Fast bowler Nelon Pascal was with the West Indies squad that toured England but only played in warm-up matches. Young Andre Creary, of Jamaica has yet to play a first-class match. The selection of the rest of the squad is down to solid first-class performances this season. Adrian Barath was the fourth highest run-scorer with 845 at 44. 47, Combined Campuses & Colleges' Omar Phillips scored 601 at 33.38, including a double-century and Kieran Powell made 567 at 37.80 for Leeward Islands. Off-spinner Ryan Austin of the CCC topped the wickets tally with 60 at 24.06 and leg-spinner Gavin Wallace had 31 at 16.96 for winners Jamaica. Devon Thomas, the wicketkeeper, had 30 dismissals to go with 376 runs. Bangladesh: Mashrafe bin Mortaza (capt), Shakib al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Imrul Kayes, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hassan, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mushfiqur Rahim, Sahagir Hossain, Enamul Haque Jr, Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain and Mahbubul Alam Robin. West Indies A: Sewnarine Chattergoon (capt), Ryan Austin, Adrian Barath, Andre Creary, Kevin McClean, Nelon Pascal, Omar Phillips, Kieran Powell, Kemar Roach, Lendl Simmons, Devon Thomas and Gavin Wallace. bd
