 Bagerhat, July 2 (bdnews24.com)Villagers in Sharankhola Upazila near the Sundarbans beat a straying tiger to death on Thursday. Isahaque Ali, Rayenda Union Parishad chairman, said a tiger strayed out of the mangrove forest in the morning, swam across the Bhola river and entered South Rajapur village. The tiger killed a dog as it neared a village home, said locals. As the residents of the house were alerted to the tiger's arrival, they started hollering and neighbours assembled to beat the animal dead. UP member Laily Kanchan said the tiger had entered Shajahan Sharif's premises in South Rajapur early in the morning, killed a pet dog and ate it. Next, the tiger went up to the neighbouring Ismail Khan's house, said the official. Meanwhile, Sharif had called in villagers who assembled at Khan's place, chased the tiger, cornered it in a room and beat her dead, said Kanchan. Bipul Kumar Das, assistant range officer, Sharankhola, said the tigress measured six feet in length. Sharankhola range office performed a post mortem. A case has been filed with Sharankhola Police Station under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1973, said Das.
