 Dhaka, Jul 3 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's personal doctor also suspects that she was poisoned in prison during the 2007-2008 caretaker government. Syed Modasser Ali, also the health affairs advisor, said on Friday that Hasina was suffering from some sort of allergy that has caused her hair to fall. "During those days [when Hasina was in prison], I had several times tried to collect her blood sample for diagnosis, but I was barred to do so," he told reporters after attending a programme on the National Birth Registration Day 2009 in Dhaka. Ali, who is also the personal doctor of the premier, added that just the day before Hasina was taken to Square Hospital the inspector general of prisons and his deputy had said that her personal doctors would treat her. "But the following day we were not allowed to enter the hospital." Asked if he agreed with the demands by some quarters that former law adviser Mainul Hosein and home adviser M A Matin should be charged over the matter, Ali said: "Since they were in charge at the time, they have to take the responsibility for the incident." "I think Matin is a [Jamaat-e-Islami] man. Because he once said he did not see nothing wrong with the Jamaat people. "I had spoken on the incident of poisoned food before, had asked for measures to find out the real perpetrators. Being an adviser, I will not say anything on the matter now. "But as the personal physician it occurred to me that she had some problems," Ali added. The adviser's comments came just six days after ruling Awami League MP and deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury alleged that party chief Hasina was fed poisoned food by the military-installed caretaker government while she was detained in a special jail. "The leader (Hasina) fell sick having taken the poisoned food and her face got swelled. But she never bent down," she said a programme in the capital. Sajeda said the prime minister still gets occasional bouts of illness due to the damage caused by the poisoning. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007 and freed on June 12 next year. Hasina and her arch rival BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who was also arrested, were kept in special prisons yards apart at the parliament complex .
