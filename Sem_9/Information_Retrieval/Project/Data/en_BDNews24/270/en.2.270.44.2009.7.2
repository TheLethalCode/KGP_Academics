 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Bank will announce a new monetary policy by July 15 to help implement the budget, the central bank governor said on Thursday. The policy will aim to maintain and encourage growth rate and boost investment, Atiur Rahman told reporters at Zia International Airport on return from London. The central bank announces monetary policy twice a year. "As the monetary policy plays a role in budget implementation we will bring changes to it and make it growth and investment-focused," Rahman said. He said the maiden budget of the Awami League-led government reflected its campaign pledges. "It will be a big challenge for them." The parliament passed the budget for fiscal year 2009-2010 on Tuesday. On the comments of businessmen and economists on sluggish investment, he said: "I am hopeful that investment will grow in the coming days as there is no political instability now." On the government borrowings from the banks, the governor said: "The central bank asks the government every year to maintain a particular limit while taking loans. "We will ask it this year too not to cross the limit." He said the expatriate Bangladeshis were keen to invest in the country. "We always look forward to the foreign investors. If we provide opportunities the expatriates will also be interested in investment." He suggested that the government considered the matter. bd
