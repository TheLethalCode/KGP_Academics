The thana and college units of the city issued the threat after staging protest in front of the BNP headquarters at Naya Paltan on Friday. In a brief meeting, the aggrieved leaders alleged that the new committee has been made with controversial leaders to weaken the organisation. They said the committee that consists of 'patrons of Jamaat-e-Islami and militancy' was not acceptable to the general activists.

Leaders of the new committee were placing wreaths at the grave of Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar at the time. b
