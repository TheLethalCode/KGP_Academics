 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)Lawyers of former BNP government adviser Mahmudur Rahman claimed on Monday that a defamation suit filed against the editor of The Daily Star and five other journalists had been transferred to another court for trial without notifying the plaintiff. Rahman's lawyers submitted a written petition on Monday, the day set for charge framing in the case, to the Dhaka Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court-1. "The case has been brought to this court without notifying the plaintiff, after a hearing of the accused in another court. The complainant wasn't aware of the case transfer," said Rahman's lawyer Sanaullah Miah. Lawyer for the accused, Ashraful Alam told bdnews24.com that the move was perfectly legal. "Under the Criminal Procedure Code, the case may legally be transferred to another court without notifying the plaintiff, if there is valid reason," said Alam. The February 6, 2007 issue of the English-language newspaper 'The Daily Star' published a report titled 'Forces search for 41 political bigwigs'. Alleging that the published news defamed him, Rahman filed a defamation suit the day after with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court against The Daily Star's editor Mahfuz Anam, then the news editors Inam Ahmed and Syed Ashfaqul Haque, city editor Sharier Khan, reporter Zayadul Ahsan Pintu and chief reporter Rezaul Karim Lotus. Charges in the case had still not been framed over two years later as lawyers of both the plaintiff and the defendants had petitioned repeatedly for more time, and because the case was transferred from one court to another, said Sanaullah Miah. bd
