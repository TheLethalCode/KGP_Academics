 LOS ANGELES, Jul 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Details of Michael Jackson's public memorial remained under wraps on Sunday as Los Angeles police braced for a huge crowd of fans expected to turn out and again warned those without tickets to stay away. About 1.6 million people registered to be one of 17,500 people inside the memorial at the Staples Center sports arena in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday or to watch it on large video screens at a nearby theater.

Asked if police will wear riot gear, McDonnell said no, but added that police will "use crowd management" techniques if that is necessary. He said he expected that the police will be able to handle a big crowd if one shows. "L.A. is used to big events. This is Hollywood," McDonnell told a press conference on Sunday.
