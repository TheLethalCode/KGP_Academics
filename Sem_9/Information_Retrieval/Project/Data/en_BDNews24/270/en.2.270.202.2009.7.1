<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 01 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has inserted a provision in the proposed city corporation bill making the MPs ex-officio advisers to six city corporations. The parliamentary standing committee on local government added the provision to the bill on Wednesday in line with demands by MPs to have a say on city corporation activities. But their recommendations will not be mandatory. The government had to cave in to similar demands to make MPs advisers to Upazila Parishads. The suggestions of local MPs are now mandatory for the local councils. Rahmat Ali, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after a meeting of the committee Wednesday, "MPs will be ex-officio advisers to all city corporations. We have made the final recommendation on the bill." "All MPs within a city corporation area will be the ex officio advisers to the city corporation. "But their recommendations will not be mandatory for the city corporations," Ali said. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam placed the bill for passage during the first session of parliament. The draft bill had no provision for the MPs to be advisers to city corporations. It was included after pressure by MPs from all parties. The government also had to include a similar provision in the draft municipality bill. The city corporation bill may be passed in the current session of parliament, said Ali. The bill is seen important as the Election Commission cannot hold the Dhaka city corporation polls which have been due since May 24, 2007. The EC has hinted that it may hold the elections by the end of December subject to the passage of the bill in the current session of parliament.
