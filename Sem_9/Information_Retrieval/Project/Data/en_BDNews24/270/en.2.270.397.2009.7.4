<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Former captain Mohammad Ashraful shone in the practice match with a fifty that helped Bangladesh make 195 all out on the first day of three-day match against West Indies A at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown in Barbados on Friday. After opting to bat, all the top order batsmen got starts, but none converted the 20s into anything substantial before the visitors fought back to reduce the West Indies' second string side to 82-4 at the close. Ashraful, batting at number five struck an exact 50 off 82 balls that included two sixes and as many fours before being one of the scalps of off-spinner Ryan Austin, who returned five for 71. Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes scored 23 and 21 respectively before paceman Kermon Roach removed both openers and then the wickets fell regularly and Bangladesh slumped to 122-5. Ashraful stood tall to construct a long innings in an hour-and-a-half stay in the middle, but got hardly any support from others before he was the seventh batsman out, leaving the side at 164-7 in 54.1 overs. After Ashraful was dismissed Roach and Austin took the last three wickets for 10 runs in the space of 11 balls. Skipper Mashrafe Bin Mortaza struck 20 to take the side near to the 200-run mark before Roach made Mashrafe his fifth scalp to wrap up the innings for 195 in 63.5 overs. However, the Bangladeshis when they took to the field, enjoyed immediate success seeing the back of young openers Kieran Powell (5) and Adrian Barath (4). Shahadat Hossain claimed the wicket of Powell and then Mashrafe removed Barath and Lendl Simmons (7) to leave the hosts 32-3 in 9.2 overs. Powell was caught at forward square-leg by Shakib Al Hassan. His opening partner Barath, was caught by Shakib at gully while fending a short ball from Mashrafe, who had Simons trapped leg before wicket. Andre Creary was the last wicket to fall when he was caught for 17 at leg-slip by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim as he swept Shakib. Sewnarine Chattergoon, the West Indies A captain, held the innings together with an unbeaten 38 at the close. bd
