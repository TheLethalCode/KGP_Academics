 BIRMINGHAM, England, June 30 (Reuters) - Captain Andrew Strauss said England's players needed to improve their timekeeping after Andrew Flintoff was reprimanded for missing a team engagement. The all-rounder missed the bus that took the players to World War I sites in Flanders on Saturday, an excursion designed to improve team bonding before the Ashes start against Australia with the first test on July 8. Strauss said the 31-year-old Flintoff, back in the squad after knee surgery, was not the only player to lapse recently in terms of punctuality. "These things happen, it's not a massive issue," Strauss told reporters on Tuesday. "(But) timekeeping is important ... you don't want to be starting things like team meetings late. "Fred (Flintoff) has spoken to the players, myself and (coach) Andrew (Flower). Of course there have been issues with Fred in the past but for us to start looking back would be counter-productive. "He feels bad about missing the bus. The matter was dealt with internally and we don't want to go into detail," added Strauss as England prepared for the three-day practice game with Warwickshire that starts on Wednesday. WORLD CUP Flintoff was stripped of the vice-captaincy in March 2007 after a late-night drinking session during the World Cup in the Caribbean. Strauss said the team would not allow special treatment for senior players like Flintoff but the captain tried to play the incident down. "We are not particularly happy dealing with these matters ... we don't need distractions like this," said the opening batsman. "But at the same time Fred has been brilliant around the guys and is really motivated and desperate to do well in the Ashes. "If he is playing well he is a massive asset to have. If he needs any more motivation hopefully he has got it now."
