The toolbox for protection is a wide one," he told the paper. He said he planned to attend this week's G8 summit of world leaders in Italy to urge governments to resist protectionist policies and to keep the channels of trade open in finance as well as industry. He said governments had to commit themselves to completing the Doha round of trade talks, already eight years in the making. The arrival of new administrations in India and the United States -- which have clashed over the special safeguard mechanism to protect poor farmers -- had given a difficult process new impetus, he said. "Getting the final agreement may be complex but in both cases they have given the feeling that they are back at the negotiating table," he said. An agreement could be reached within the next year, Lamy
