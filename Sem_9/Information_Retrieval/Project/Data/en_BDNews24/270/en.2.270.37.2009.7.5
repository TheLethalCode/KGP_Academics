<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 05 (bdnews24.com)Parliament passed a bill Sunday aimed at regulating sales of organic fertilisers in the country in an attempt to protect farmers from dishonest traders. Agriculture minister Begum Matia Chowdhury proposed an amendment to the Fertiliser (management) Act, which the House passed by voice vote in absence of the main opposition BNP and its allies. The amendment bill inserted a provision in the 2006 act, which previously had no provision to control arbitrary import and marketing of organic manures. There are allegations that a section of dishonest traders have been importing substandard materials in the name of organic manure to cheat farmers. These traders are not only cheating farmers, but also hampering agricultural production, said the agriculture minister. "Since the Fertiliser (management) Act 2006 makes no mention of organic manures, the government has no mechanism to control quality of the imported manures," she said. 'Bangabandhu National Agriculture Award' Chowdhury also proposed enacting the National Agriculture Award Fund (amendment) Bill 2009 and the House passed the same by voice vote. As per the bill, the government added "Bangabandhu" in the title of the National Agriculture Award, which was introduced in 1976 to encourage agricultural innovations. From now on the National Agriculture Award will be called the Bangabandhu National Agriculture Award. Jamuna Bridge Authority Bill Meanwhile, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain placed the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (amendment) Bill. The bill, if passed, will hand over authority of all bridges over 1500 metres length to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority created by the immediate past interim government. The bill went to the parliamentary standing committee on the communications ministry as a routine formality for further scrutiny. The bill will then be referred back to the House before its passage. bd
