 JCD divided over new central leaders Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, BNP's associate student organisation, appeared divided Thursday over the announcement of its new central leaders. A JCD faction rejected the just-formed central committee, bringing out a protest rally at the Dhaka University campus, shouting slogans and declaring 'non-cooperation' with the new leaders. Another group of JCD welcomed the announcement, greeting the leaders with flowers as they were gathered at Madhu's Canteen on the DU campus. A statement released Wednesday announced five top leaders of the new committee approved by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. It said JCD's new president will be Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, with Amirul Islam Khan Alim filling the post of general secretary. The new senior vice president will be Shahidul Islam Babul, new joint secretary Amiruzzaman Khan Shimul and organising secretary Anisur Rahman Khokon. Tuku was the senior vice president in the previous centeral committee. He is the younger brother of BNP leader Abdus Salam Pintu, an accused in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. Tuku ran in the ninth parliamentary elections from Tangail-2, but did not win the seat. Protesting JCD members, rallying at Aparajeyo Bangla on the DU campus Thursday, called on Khaleda Zia to re-evaluate the committee. President of JCD's Salimullah Hall unit, Danesul Islam, addressing the gathering, said, "The central leaders of the new committee are too old and some of them face allegations of links with militants." "We are requesting the chairperson to reconsider the committee." New organising secretary of the central committee, Anisur Rahman Khokon, said the complete 101-member central committee would be named within 15 days. "JCD will be reactivated all over the country soon," he said. Khokon led a celebratory procession at Jagannath University, where he was general secretary of the campus unit until being named for the new central committee post. The new committee is meant to operate until 2010. The previous committee was formed in 2004, with a one-year term. bdnews24.com/
