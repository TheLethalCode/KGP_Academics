<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Without making any decision on the possible players' transfer, the third meeting of the hockey league committee ended on Sunday at the Moulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium. The meeting was supposed to finalise the proposed July 8-10 transfers in a bid to start the season, but representatives of 11 participating teams want to meet the BHF president to resolve the stalemate. "They have demanded a meeting with the BHF president as they have some demands as well as some proposals to improve hockey," said league committee general secretary Anvir Adel after the meeting. General secretary Khondokar Jamiluddin told bdnews24.com that he would arrange the meeting in a week and hoped that the season curtain-raising Club Cup would get underway this month after the transfer. Jamiluddin had proposed to start the transfer without those national players who would be picked for a two-and-a-half month training in Germany and he said that the clubs had accepted the proposal in principle. Asked whether the national players would accept the proposal as it was the players' only income source, league committee secretary Anvir said, "We have already talked to the possible national players, who agreed to skip the domestic competitions." "The selection committee will sit on July 9 to pick the final squad," said Anvir adding that our main target was to do well in the 2010 South Asian Games in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the national players have been training under the supervision of German coaching staff and they are scheduled to travel in the third week of October to Germany for a two-and-a-half month training. Shahidullah Dodul, hockey secretary of Abahani, however, said that nothing had been decided as the club representatives expressed their desire to meet the BHF president first. The clubs seemingly want to reform the league committee, which is comprised of the representatives of second division teams as well as the district sports associations. bd
