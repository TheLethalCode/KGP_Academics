<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Thursday dismissed the contempt petition filed against former BNP minister Nazmul Huda and Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Md Kamaruzzaman for slamming last month's High Court ruling on the proclamation of independence, saying they were insane and worthless. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Momtajuddin Ahmed observed that the were 'wrongheaded and worthless persons'. It also said there was no need to issue any rule against those who did not have knowledge about the image and dignity of the court. The same bench spared the former Dhaka University vice-chancellor Emajuddin Ahmed of court appearance on the same charges. Supreme Court lawyer SM Zafar Ali filed the contempt petition with a High Court bench on Wednesday, accusing them of speaking against the court's judgement. The court on June 21 ruled that independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The proclamation has been a contentious issue between the Awami League and BNP for decades, with the latter claiming their leader and former president was the one to declare independence. Petitioner Zafar Ali said that Huda and Kamaruzzaman had dishonoured the court by terming the judgement 'political' and 'motivated'. He filed the petition following reports in newspapers published on June 30, quoting the two opposition leaders. The High Court, earlier on June 24, charged former vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, Emajuddin Ahmed, with contempt after he spoke against the same verdict. Emajuddin said that High Court was running "a malign campaign". bdne
