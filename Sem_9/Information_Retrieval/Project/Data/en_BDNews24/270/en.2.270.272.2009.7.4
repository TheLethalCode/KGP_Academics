 GALLE, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka bowler Chaminda Vaas has denied reports of his retirement from test cricket after his board said Saturday the paceman had told selectors he was quitting the longer form of the game with immediate effect. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) secretary Nishantha Ranatunga told Reuters that Vaas, a veteran of 110 tests, who has taken 354 wickets in a career spanning 15 years, informed selection chairman Ashantha de Mel of his decision earlier in the week. However, Vaas responded to the news of his retirement by telling cricket website crinfo.com that he had not made "any such decision yet." Earlier, Ranatunga explained Vaas's plans to focus solely on limited-overs cricket. "Chaminda told him (De Mel) that he wanted to concentrate on ODI's (one-dayers) and T20's (Twenty20s) in the future and he would be forwarding an official letter to that effect when he returns from abroad," Ranatunga said. "Sri Lanka Cricket's interim committee will also speak to him about his future and the role he can play in shaping Sri Lanka cricket in the future," he said, adding to speculation that he may be appointed Sri Lanka fast bowling coach in the future. Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara believes the 35-year-old Vaas still had a role in the limited-overs game. "I had a very good one-on-one chat with him (Vaas) before we went for the World Twenty20," Sanagakkara said on the eve of the match. "He has still got a role to play in our side. We just have to decide which format of the game he is going to make the most contribution in."
