 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, July 1 (bdnews24.com)The White House is perhaps the most sought-after place to work not only because of the power and aura that are associated with the president's official residence but also for the money the aides make. There are hundreds of people who work for the president in the building situated on 18 acres of land in the heart of Washington DC. According to recent disclosures on the White House website, 22 of the president's top aides -- most with the title "assistant to the president" -- make $172,000 a year, a big sum even by American standards. Those making the magic number include 28-year-old Jonathan Favreau, the president's top speechwriter, and 66-year-old Gen. James Jones, the national security adviser. Also included in that list are big names who earn the same amount. They are: David Axelrod, Melody Barnes, John Brennan, Elizabeth Brown, Carol Browner, Gregory Craig, Thomas Donilon, Anita Dunn, Rahm Emanuel, Patrick Gaspard, Robert Gibbs, Valerie Jarrett, Christopher Lu, Alyssa Mastromonaco, James Messina, Peter Rouse, Philip Schiliro, Susan her, Lawrence Summers and Mona Sutphen. One person in the White House -- other than the president himself, who makes $400,000 -- is listed as making more than $172,000: David E.

Both make nothing, according to the official salary list. In between are 462 other employees who make from a low of $36,000 to a high of $163,940. There are a few gems in there. Deputy Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer makes a bit more ($150,000) than his wife, Sarah Feinberg, who earns $120,000 as the top staffer to Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. But the gender tables are turned in the case of assistant press secretary Tommy Vietor, who recently proposed to Michelle Obama's press secretary, Katie Lelyveld. At $84,000 a year, she makes significantly more than her soon-to-be-husband ($57,500). The vast bulk of the employees appear to earn between $40,000 and $55,000 per year, making the White House quite a modestly paid enterprise for most of the workaholics who spend time th
