 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has said the cadet colleges are model schools. "For me cadet colleges are merit schools. Merit schools have a lot of responsibility. They play an important role in developing the intellect of a country," Muhith said on the 30th founding anniversary of Sylhet Cadet College at Cadet College Club in the capital on Friday. He observed that quality of education in the country was poor. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said there had been a disaster in the education sector. "The finance minister is spending a lot of money, but quality education remains elusive. He praised education in the cadet colleges and their role in quality education. Atiur said, "Spending in the cadet colleges is made to development of quality. Products of cadets are all around the world and playing their role everywhere." Students of cadet colleges are physically strong, disciplined and can be good executives, he commented.
