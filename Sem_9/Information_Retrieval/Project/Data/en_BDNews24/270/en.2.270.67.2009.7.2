<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  Italian-based Limonta and Bangkok-based Seara, appointed by FIFA, on Thursday inspected the 'Balur Math' adjacent to the Bangladesh Football Federation prior to laying the artificial turf on the field. David Bertoli, sports manager of Limonta, told reporters that they would provide the tango turf made from 100 percent polyethylene and Seara would lay the turf by mid November after local company, Basatkalpa, completed the base foundation. There is a fear whether the installed-turf would be flooded during rains as the grounds lie lower than the road along its southern side. "After having examined, we have agreed in principle that the turf will not be flooded if the wall of the ground's southern side has no space," BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi said. "There will be only one entrance through BFF House and it will also protect entering rainy water." Sadi informed that Limonta had 25 years experience in this field and provided turf in Japan, Korea, Malaysia. Patrick Dean of Seara said that they would give seven years warranty if the BFF maintained the turf properly. Meanwhile, AFC president Mohamed Bin Hamman had unveiled the foundation stone of that $400,000-artificial turf under the FIFA goal project-2 on March 29, 2008 but later the cost has been raised to another $ 84,000 for the 114/52 metre sized field. bd
