<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Former caretaker advisers Mainul Hosein and MA Matin have rejected allegations that have surfaced against the two of attempting to poison prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia during their detentions under the interim government. The government should immediately launch an investigation at the highest level if there is any credibility to the charges, former law adviser Mainul Hosein said in a statement Saturday. Hasina's former personal physician, now the prime minister's health adviser, Dr Syed Modasser Ali said on Friday that Hasina had been poisoned during her 2007-2008 term in a special jail facing graft charges. BNP has also alleged the same regarding party chief Khaleda Zia. Modasser Ali alleged former law adviser Mainul and former home adviser Matin, along with the then inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Zakir Hasan and deputy inspector general Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui had a hand in the poison plot. In a statement released to the press, Mainul denied the charge and questioned why it took so long to raise the allegation. "It is a groundless and motivated allegation." Matin similarly rejected the charge in a television interview. Mainul said Modasser had not pointed to any evidence to make the allegation credible. He said that Sheikh Hasina flew straight to the US, where she spent four or five months, after being let out of jail. "But no poisoning was hinted at during that time. Being her personal physician Dr Modasser did not mention a thing at that time." "He should make it clear now on whose behalf is he making such a charge, six months into the current government." Mainul said neither the prime minister nor any member of her cabinet had made such an allegation. "I believe the prime minister herself does not believe in any such plot against her by me," he said. "But if there is evidence in her hand, then the prime minister should form a top level investigation committee with experts for a fair and transparent investigation." Mainul said, "I was an adviser of the caretaker government for a year, and after my leave [Hasina] was in prison for another five or six months." "During my time as law adviser, I worked hard towards the goal of a free and fair election to hand over power to an elected government," he said. Former law adviser Mainul and former home adviser Matin both presently face probes by parliamentary bodies over separate corruption charges.
