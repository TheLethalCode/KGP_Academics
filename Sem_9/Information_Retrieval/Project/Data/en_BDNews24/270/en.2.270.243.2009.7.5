 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has called on expatriate Bangladeshis to invest in the nation's power sector as a way to contribute to the economy of the country. "Power shortfalls remain one of the main obstacles to national development," Muhith told the closing session of a three-day NRB conference on manpower development on Saturday. "Our future development is hindered in two major ways. Poor electricity supply and unskilled administrators are the main drawbacks we have," he said. "Though the flow of foreign remittances remains high, it has not been invested in productive sectors," said Muhith. He said the government backed a proposed 'expatriate bank', to be set up and run by non-resident Bangladeshis to facilitate foreign investment. The minister said measures were also being considered to ensure employment and support for NRB's who had lost their jobs due to the global economic downturn. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman also attended the closing session. bd
