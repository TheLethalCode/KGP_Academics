 (RECAST) Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)Lawyers for Drik Gallery, where police closed down an exhibition on 'Crossfire' on Mar 22, sent a notice to the government on Thursday threatening to take legal action unless the police are removed from outside the gallery within 24 hours. The legal notice has been sent to the home ministry, the inspector general of police and the director general of RAB. The Drik exhibition features 16 interpretative photographs symbolically representing 'crossfire' deaths attributed to the special force Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). Drik's lawyers sent the notice on behalf of photojournalist Shahidul Alam, the gallery's managing director. The Drik authorities say, on March 22, the day of the opening, they received calls from officers of the Rapid Action Battalion, Special Branch and the police who directed them to take down the exhibition. The law enforcers claimed the gallery had failed to obtain "official permission" to hold the exhibition. Since then, the police have remained deployed in front of the Drik premises during the exhibition opening times and have actively prevented any visitors to the exhibition from entering the building, says the notice. Human rights organisations have for years expressed concern about deaths by 'crossfire', a term, which has come to mean extra judicial killings in Bangladesh. According to local media reports, local and international human rights groups, and the government, law enforcement officials were responsible for 154 deaths in 2009, 129 of which were attributed to 'crossfire'
