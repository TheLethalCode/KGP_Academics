 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina called on all to impart the "real history of independence" to younger generations as she handed over 11 independence awards at the Osmani Memorial Auditorium on Thursday. She said that the government has passed the International Criminal Tribunal Act to try the war criminals of the 1971 liberation war. Hasina said that many war criminals had been rehabilitated after the assassination of her father and Bangladesh's founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. "Many were released from jail, some were even made ministers," she said. Ten people and one organisation received the Independence Award 2010, among them the late music maestro and Bengali cultural icon Waheedul Haque and celebrated filmmaker the late Alamgir Kabir. Senior Awami League presidium member and deputy leader of the house Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury was the lone politician on the list. The late A K M Shamsul Huq Khan for his role in the independence struggle, wartime broadcaster Belal Mohammad, writer Jatin Sarker, the late writers Romena Afaz, Dr Mustafa Nur-ul-Islam and Zillur Rahman Siddiqui, and Ferdousi Priyabhashini for culture were also honoured. Bangla Academy, for its contribution to the development of Bangla culture, was the only institution to get the award. bd
