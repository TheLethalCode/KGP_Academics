<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  A defamation suit has been filed against the National Press Club president for suggesting that the state minister for law Qamrul Islam was not a real lawyer. Bangabandhu Foundation president Moshiur Malik filed the case with Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Thursday saying that the "state minister is in fact an established lawyer". Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud, also a member of the BNP chairperson's advisory body, reportedly said at a recent meeting in Cox's Bazar that Islam was like "a lawyer under a banyan tree", Mahmud was referring at the time to a recent statement made by the state minister that action would be taken against those who still claim that BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman is the first person who declared independence of Bangladesh. The High Court last year ruled that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, not Ziaur Rahman, was the 'declarer of independence'.
