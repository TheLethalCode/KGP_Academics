<TEXT>
 Shihabuddin Kishlu reports New York, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign secretary Mijarul Quayes has said connecting to the Asian Highway can only benefit Bangladesh, rejecting concerns of some quarters about threats to 'national sovereignty'. Quayes told bdnews24.com in New York on Tuesday that US officials praised the government's various steps taken against militancy. "Bangladesh will be benefited from both sides if it joins the Asian Highway with India and Myanmar. Bangladesh will have many friends." Asked to comment on the main opposition BNP's stand on the issue, the foreign secretary said that Bangladesh would not lose its sovereignty, rather "the country will stand with its head high". He said China had been invited to use Chittagong's deep seaport. Allowing India, Nepal and Bhutan to use the Mongla Port will financially benefit the country. "When the democracy of the country is stumbling, prime minister Sheikh Hasina is working to bolster democracy and establishment of the rule of law", Quayes said. He highlighted the various government steps taken to suppress militants, saying, "Bangladesh made it clear that there is no place for militants in the country. Even US has praised the steps taken." US and Bangladesh are working jointly to fight militancy, the foreign secretary said. He also revealed that the government is seriously trying to bring back the killers of Bangabandhu, who are still absconding. The foreign secretary said there no pressure from international community regarding the 1971 war crime trials, saying, "The 1971 war crimes were offences against humanity." He also highlighted Bangladesh's ratification of Rome Statute to ensure such offences do not occur in the future. Quayes left for Bangladesh on Wednesday after a visit to the United Nations
