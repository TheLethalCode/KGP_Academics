 JERUSALEM, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended a troubled US visit on Thursday with no apparent resolution of a serious dispute with Washington over Jewish housing in occupied East Jerusalem. Despite his hints at potential compromise, Israeli commentators saw failure to secure a deal with U.S. President Barack Obama and said tensions with Washington appeared to have been left unresolved.
