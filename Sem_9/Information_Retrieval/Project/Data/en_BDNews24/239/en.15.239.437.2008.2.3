 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) - Repair of the troubled gas pipeline started Sunday morning near Daudkandi, a gas official said. Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company public relations officer Munir Hossain Khan said the engineers began repairing the line and promised to finish by Monday midnight. Khan claimed there was no big disruption in supply of gas to the city. "Three other lines are open. So far I know all parts of the city are getting gas. It's not that supplies have been stopped completely. Maybe pressure is low in some places, especially in high rises," Khan said. The chief adviser's special assistant for energy M Tamim, meanwhile, said Titas needed to repair a portion of the underwater pipeline to avoid any future gas crisis. Tamim said engineers were further connecting this portion to another line. Gas supply to some parts of the city and in parts of Narayanganj and Munsiganj has remained suspended since Saturday night for the repairs. The official gas supply agency had earlier said it needed to repair the pipeline for better supply of gas to the capital city and other nearby areas. bdnews24
