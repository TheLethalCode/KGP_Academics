<TITLE> South Korea would welcome Japan emperor visit: paper </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect has said Seoul would welcome a visit by the Japanese emperor, a newspaper reported on Saturday, despite sensitivities related to Japan's past colonisation of the Korean peninsula. "A visit to South Korea would have big meaning on various levels," Lee Myung-bak was quoted as saying in an interview with Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun. "If we ease various issues to deal with it, I would welcome a visit to South Korea by the emperor." No Japanese emperor has visited South Korea in modern history, although Emperor Akihito went to China -- another country where sensitivities over wartime history with Japan run deep -- in 1992. A visit to South Korea would be a boost to ties between the two neighbours, which have been frayed in recent years by issues stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula. Bilateral relations chilled during the 2001-2006 term of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who repeatedly visited a shrine in Tokyo considered by many in Asia as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. But ties have since warmed and current Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, an advocate of closer relations with Asian neighbours, has said he would not visit the shrine while in office. Prince Takamado, who died in 2002, became the first member of the imperial family to visit South Korea since World War Two when he attended the opening ceremony of the soccer World Cup held earlier that year, jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea.
