 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested an accomplice of Indian national Jibon Singh, one of the accused in a case that involves the theft of Rabindranath Tagore's Nobel medal, a CID officer said Saturday. The police have been interrogating Shiplu with alleged links to the theft. Additional superintendent of police (CID) Md Abdullah Arif said Shiplu was arrested in a raid on a house in Lalbagh Thursday night. He said they were confirmed that Shiplu had been hosting Jibon Singh. "Shiplu is one of the accomplices of Jibon Singh, accused of stealing the medal. Jibon Singh is evading arrest." Arif said told bdnews24.com that Indian authorities had already sought cooperation from Dhaka to arrest Singh, believed to be hiding in Bangladesh. He said Shiplu would be remanded in custody and interrogated on the location of Jibon Singh and stealing of the Nobel medal. CID Saturday afternoon asked a court for permission to take Shiplu on seven days' remand. The court sent Shiplu to jail and set Sunday for hearing the remand appeal. Shiplu recently returned from Italy. In a Nov 6 overnight operation, RAB raided Roksana Handicrafts at Gulshan-2 City Corporation Market in search of Tagore's missing medal and arrested shop owner Abul Hossain and two salespersons on suspicion. Later, the two salespersons were released. The medal was stolen from Rabindra Museum in West Bengal on March 25, 2004. RAB-3 commander Sultan Mohammad Nurani told bdnews24.com Saturday, "We don't know why Shiplu has been arrested. However, if any information about the Nobel medal is gleaned from him, we will interrogate him." bdnews24.co
