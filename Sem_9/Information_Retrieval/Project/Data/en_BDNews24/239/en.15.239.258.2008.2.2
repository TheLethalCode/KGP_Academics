 United Nations, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations sought on Friday to play down reported remarks by a senior UN official suggesting India should rein in rebel groups in Nepal, saying he did not mean New Delhi controlled them. Scores of people have died in clashes in the past year in Nepal's Terai region where ethnic groups, some of them armed, complain that they are being marginalized from the Himalayan state's political life following a 10-year civil war. The Press Trust of India news agency on Monday quoted the U.N. resident coordinator in Nepal, Matthew Kahane, as telling it: "Some of these groups that are making life difficult in Terai may have some kind of links in North India... "It would be enormously helpful if Indian authorities are able to to keep these people under control," Kahane was quoted as saying by telephone. A U.N. statement seeking to "clarify" the remark said: "His comments were not intended to suggest that the Government of India has influence over Nepalese groups that have recently been limiting the steady flow of essential goods into the Terai region of Nepal, such as food. "India is an important partner in the region and we appreciate very much the unfailing and long-standing assistance and support that India has provided to the United Nations and, more importantly, to the people of Nepal." On Thursday, the world body had said that Kahane "was not speaking on instructions," adding: "We will see that he sets the record straight upon his return to Kathmandu." On Wednesday, a bomb exploded near a government-sponsored political rally in the southern Terai plains, wounding at least 35 people, police said. The government has set April 10 for twice-delayed elections for a constituent assembly. That body, a centerpiece of a peace deal with former Maoist rebels, is supposed to prepare a new constitution, declare Nepal a republic and make laws. Terai groups have been demanding greater participation in the assembly or regional autonomy ahead of the vote. They say the fertile area which is home to nearly half of Nepal's 26.4 million people has been discriminated against by the government, which is dominated by the people from the hills.
