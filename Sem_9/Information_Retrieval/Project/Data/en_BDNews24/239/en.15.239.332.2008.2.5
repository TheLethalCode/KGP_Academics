<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury urged local government officials Tuesday to involve young people in what he said was the war against corruption. "Corruption has to be rooted out of all levels of society," he told representatives of Chittagong's district and upazila corruption prevention committees. This can not be achieved through governmental initiatives alone, the ACC chief said speaking at the auditorium Engineers Institute in Dhaka. "The war against corruption will not succeed without the next generation's involvement," Chowdhury said. "Many of those older than 60 have been involved with corruption in one way or another." "Involve young people in the corruption prevention committees," he urged. Chowdhury said the anticorruption drive has to start 'at home', with awareness building within families at all levels of society. Regarding the anticorruption drive's prospects after a political regime comes to power, the ACC boss said: "The present process cannot be stopped just considering what may happen in a year's time." Chittagong Division's corruption prevention committees have a total of 699 members from 11 districts and 99 upazilas of which 693 members were present at the meeting. bdnews24.com
