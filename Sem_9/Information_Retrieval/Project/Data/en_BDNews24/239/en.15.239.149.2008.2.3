 NAIROBI, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition called on the African Union on Sunday to deploy peacekeepers in the country as violence that has killed at least 900 people and displaced a quarter of a million continued to rage. "We need African Union peacekeepers to bring calm and peace. Given the ethnic dimension of the conflict, it would be more neutral than to selectively place the army," opposition Orange Democratic Movement spokesman Tony Gachoka told Reuters. The government could not be immediately contacted for comment.
