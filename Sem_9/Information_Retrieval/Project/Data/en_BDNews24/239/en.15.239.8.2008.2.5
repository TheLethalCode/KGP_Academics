 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Workers Party Tuesday called for the removal of the state of emergency and national polls to be held prior to local government elections. From a joint meeting at the JSD headquarters, the two parties asked the Election Commission to publish their draft electoral reforms proposals as soon as possible. As a partner of the 14-party alliance, JSD sat with the Workers Party to discuss the issues of common interest at its first preparatory meeting prior to dialogue with the EC. JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu and Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon led their delegates to the meeting. The two parties also discussed demand for the trial of war criminals, religious militancy, transparency in the election process and institutional reforms. Both parties called for dialogue with the government to begin immediately and continue until the elections are held. "Our dialogue with the government will be based on our common goal of establishing a democratic and secular government through free and fair elections," Menon said. "People must be given back their basic rights as soon as possible," he added. Inu said: "We want to sit with the government to discuss the implementation of the EC's election roadmap. It should be conducted fairly, without any party attaching strings or conditions." Both leaders said the 14-party alliance must reach a consensus over the most important things to discuss with the EC. Menon added that the 14-party alliance should not repeat mistakes made in the past. bdnews24
