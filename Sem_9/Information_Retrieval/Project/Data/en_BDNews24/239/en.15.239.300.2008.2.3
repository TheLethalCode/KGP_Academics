 JAKARTA, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian activists held a protest in central Jakarta on Sunday to protest against calls to make former president Suharto a national hero, a week after the death of the leader who ruled with an iron fist for 32 years. Suharto, who was ousted in 1998 amid political and economic chaos, died last Sunday at the age of 86 of multiple organ failure.

Indonesians are divided over the legacy of Suharto.

Critics say Suharto and his family amassed as much as $45 billion in kickbacks or deals. Transparency International put Suharto's assets at $15-$35 billion, or as much as 1.3 percent of gross domestic product. Suharto and his family always denied any wrongdoi
