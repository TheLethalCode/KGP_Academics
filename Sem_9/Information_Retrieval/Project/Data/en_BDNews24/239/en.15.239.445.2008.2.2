 MOSCOW, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia hinted on Saturday that a proposed deal with the United States over the use of Russian radar stations as an alternative to building part of a US missile defence system in eastern Europe, may not be reached. Washington wants to build elements of the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic to defend against rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. Russia says the shield is a threat to its security. Last year Moscow offered the United States use of its radar station at Qabala in former Soviet Azerbaijan as an alternative to placing equipment in Eastern Europe. "The United States wants to use the potential radars at Qabala and, possibly, Armavir not as an alternative to the third position region but to strengthen their own systems," Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Kislyak told Interfax news agency. The "third position region" refers to the eastern European segment of the planned missile shield. "A general settlement will not be reached," Kislyak said. The United States has previously said Qabala and another Russian radar at Armavir, in southern Russia, can only be used in addition to the plans in eastern Europe and on Friday Washington backed modernising Poland's defence as part of the missile shield deal.
