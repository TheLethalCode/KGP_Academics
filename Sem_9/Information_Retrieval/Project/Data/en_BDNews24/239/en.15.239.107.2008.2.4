 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)The government is thinking of formulating a national book policy to give a boost to the country's book industry, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Friday. He said a new law regarding the Bangla Academy was also being prepared. Speaking as the chief guest at the inauguration of the Ekushey Book Fair, the chief adviser said the writing, publication and marketing of books in both local and foreign markets would gain from a national book policy. It would play a positive role in encouraging the habit of reading by involving the public in formulating such a policy. Dr Fakhruddin formally inaugurated the Ekushey Book Fair Friday afternoon. Mentioning that the Bangla Academy is the symbol of the nation's intellectual and cultural achievements, the chief adviser said the law that governs the academy is very old. Work on new draft of the law is ongoing, he said, adding that if it is implemented the activities of the academy would be enhanced. Suggesting the expansion of the Ekushey Book Fair premises the chief adviser urged Bangla Academy to invite international book publishers in future. "Keeping with the spirit of International Mother Language Day the Amar Ekushey Book Fair will get an international flavour." Fakhruddin said the present government is sincere in ensuring free flow of information. "To this end, all concerned in the government have been directed to prepare a citizen's charter." "The formulation of a Right to Information law is at the final stage," he added. The chief adviser said the construction of Bangla Academy Bhaban would begin soon. The inaugural function began Friday afternoon with recitations from the Holy Quran, Geeta, Tripitak and the Bible. One minute's silence was observed in memory of the Language Movement Martyrs of 1952. The sacrifice of the Language Movement Martyrs built the dream of achieving an independent Bangladesh, Fakhruddin said. "I remember the immortal language martyrs on this day with deepest regard," the chief adviser said, speaking as chief guest at the inauguration of the Ekushey Book Fair. "The immortal Ekushey is now a source of inspiration defying time in the national and international arena crossing the boundaries of the country." "Amar Ekushey is now recognised by UNESCO as International Mother Language Day." Following his inauguration the chief adviser visited the bookstalls at the Bangla Academy and Nazrul Institute, after which the fair was opened to the public. bdnews24
