 Bogota, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian FARC rebels plan to hand over three more hostages to Venezuela's leftist President Hugo Chavez after he brokered the release of two captives last month, according to a rebel statement to local television. Colombia's hostages are at the center of a fierce diplomatic spat between anti-U.S. leader Chavez and Washington ally President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia after they quarreled over the Venezuelan leader's role in helping free captives. The FARC -- Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- said it planned to release Gloria Polanco de Losada, Luis Eladio Perez and Orlando Beltran because of their poor health after being held for more than six years in rebel jungle camps. The FARC statement given to local Noticias Uno said the release was in recognition of efforts by Chavez and left-wing Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba to reach a deal on exchanging key hostages for jailed rebels. "We ask President Hugo Chavez or Sen. Piedad Cordoba to receive the lawmakers Gloria Polanco de Losada, Luis Eladio Perez, and Orlando Beltran ... personally or through delegates in Colombian territory because of their health," it said. The statement, dated Jan. 31, said guaranteeing security for the release would take time. A initial effort by Chavez at releasing hostages fell apart. The announcement came a day before Colombians planned a national march against the FARC and against kidnapping and it could put pressure on hardliner Uribe to try to reach an agreement with the guerrillas on the hostage exchange deal. Uribe's U.S.-backed security drive has sent troops to retake areas once under rebel control, and violence and kidnapping associated with the four-decade conflict has dropped sharply. But the rebels are fighting in remote rural areas. Among key hostages held by the guerrillas are French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt, held since 2002 and three American contract workers captured in 2003. Recently released videos made by the FARC show Betancourt, the three U.S. citizens and other hostages are still alive in jungle camps though suffering from disease and stress after years in guerrilla captivity. "Very emotional, happy, content because of this unilateral act that the FARC will carry out," said Angela de Perez, wife of the former senator Perez, when asked about the news. The FARC began as a socialist-inspired peasant army in the 1960s, but U.S. and European officials say the rebels are now deeply engaged in Colombia's huge cocaine trafficking trade. Uribe and the guerrillas are deadlocked over a deal on exchanging 44 key hostages. Talks are blocked over a rebel demand Uribe pull troops back from an area the size of New York City in southern Colombia to facilitate a hostage handover. Colombia last year invited Chavez to help broker a hostage deal, but cut off his participation after accusing him of meddling. Chavez later managed to facilitate the release of two hostages and has maintained contact with the FARC since then.
