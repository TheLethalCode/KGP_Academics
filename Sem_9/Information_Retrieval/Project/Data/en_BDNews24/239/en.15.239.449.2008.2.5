<TITLE> Grateful Dead, Deadheads reunite for Obama </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 San Francisco, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saying Barack Obama embodies political hope absent since Robert Kennedy was killed 40 years ago, three surviving members of the Grateful Dead reunited on Monday to back the presidential candidate. "Every few generations a guy like this comes along," percussionist Mickey Hart told a news conference a day ahead of California's primary, in which Obama is the underdog against Hillary Clinton. "It seems like desperate times and we're desperate people." The band known for its loyal fans, known as "Deadheads," broke up in 1995 after band leader and guitarist Jerry Garcia died. They have since played together occasionally, most recently in 2004. At a San Francisco concert in front of 2,400 fans, singer-guitarist Bob Weir, 60, said the counter-culture band has never performed on behalf of a presidential candidate before, though they have often embraced liberal social causes. "The last time hope was in the air, it was ended by a bullet," Weir said, referring to Kennedy, who was assassinated on the night he won the California Democratic primary in 1968. "We've been reluctant to do political events all along." Bassist Phil Lesh, 67, said he met Illinois Senator Obama, who told him he has some Grateful Dead songs on his iPod music player, last year. Obama's dapper, clean-cut image contrasts with the tied-dyed shirts and long, shaggy hair of fans who lined up for hours to attend the "Deadheads for Obama '08" reunion. Some concert-goers, including those with gray in their hair, addressed each other as "dude." "Long live the Dead!" said Ron Svetlik, 51, who added he has attended more than 200 Grateful Dead concerts since 1974. The home builder said he had already voted by mail for the Green Party candidate, but added: "If I had to cast a write-in ballot, I'd put Jerry Garcia." The three band members neither promised more concerts nor ruled them out. "It's a lot like family," Weir said, referring to complicated relationships dating back more than 40 years. "What we have is thicker than blood."
