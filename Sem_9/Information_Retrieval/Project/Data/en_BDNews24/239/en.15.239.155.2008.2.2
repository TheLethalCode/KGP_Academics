 Addis ababa, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The African Union is deeply worried by fighting in Chad, where the army is battling rebels who have pushed to within 100 km (60 miles) of the capital N'Djamena, the AU's top diplomat said on Saturday. "We are really, deeply preoccupied by the situation today in Chad," Jean Ping, the new chairman of the AU Commission, told reporters on the sidelines of an African summit in Ethiopia. Both sides claimed victory in clashes on Friday, which delayed the deployment of European Union peacekeepers. Ping, elected head of the AU Commission on Friday, said he would work closely with his predecessor, Mali's Alpha Oumar Konare, to see what the AU could do to help in Chad. "There are UN Security Council resolutions which concern both Sudan and Chad, including the EUFOR forces," Ping said. "There is now a new situation because last night and today they are fighting. So, of course we should examine the situation. I will raise this question with my predecessor ... I will work closely with him." Ping is Gabon's foreign minister and deputy prime minister. France's military, which has fighter planes and about 1,000 troops in Chad under a bilateral defence treaty, said Friday's clashes took place about 100 km northeast of N'Djamena. Up to 3,700 EU peacekeepers were due in eastern Chad soon to protect civilians and aid workers caught up in violence spilling over from the neighbouring Sudanese region of Darfur. An EU spokesman said on Friday deployment would be delayed because of "increased instability". The rebels have previously threatened to attack the EU force if it interferes in their campaign against President Idriss Deby. EU commanders have pledged not to take sides. A rebel leader, Timane Erdimi, on Friday called on Deby to negotiate a power-sharing deal immediately or face an attack on N'Djamena by the rebels, who had raced in a column of 300 vehicles from the eastern border with Darfur. Deby's government says the rebels, an alliance of several groups, are backed by Khartoum
