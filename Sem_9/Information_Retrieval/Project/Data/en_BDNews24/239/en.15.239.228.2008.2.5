<TITLE> Doha deal gives only modest gains to India: study </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's output would grow by only an additional one half of a percent under a successful Doha round deal to open up world trade, according to a study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published on Tuesday. However this would be better than the potential gains from the most favourable bilateral trade agreements under consideration, the study said. "A Doha agreement along the lines of the study's simulation would be positive, albeit quite modest, for India," it said. Economic simulations by the US think-tank suggest a deal would boost domestic production in the world's second most populous country by only $4.5 billion, or 0.52 percent, the study said. Exports would increase by $2.4 billion or 3.8 percent, with the strongest gains seen in apparel, textiles, leather and footwear, it said. Imports would rise by $2.2 billion or 2.9 percent. India's vibrant industry and flourishing services sector mean it is well placed to benefit from any trade deal. The economy, Asia's third largest, is expected to grow by 8.75 percent in the year ending in March, the IMF said on Monday. But with almost two thirds of India's 1.1 billion people living in rural areas and over half working in agriculture, India is vulnerable to fluctuations in food prices. The study warns that the potential gains from a deal could be wiped out by falls in the price of agricultural commodities, if India binds its agricultural tariffs under the deal at levels preventing it from offsetting global price shocks. A 50 percent fall in the world rice price would have a negative impact on India's real income as large as the positive impact of the entire Doha deal, with poorest households suffering most, the study said. "These results suggest that the Indian government's concern over the potential negative effects of a Doha agreement on poverty and rural development is well founded," it said. Trade ministers plan to meet at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva in March or April to agree the outlines of a Doha deal, including the size of tariff and subsidy cuts. The chairman of the agriculture negotiations at the WTO, New Zealand ambassador Crawford Falconer, is due to issue a revised negotiating text this week. Trade diplomats expect that to leave the size of tariff and subsidy cuts open, but to focus on issues such as the extent to which rich and poor countries can shield sensitive products from price fluctuations and import surges, and how they do that. The study said that India was right to try to designate certain foods as "special products" protected from full tariff cuts, and push for a special safeguard mechanism that would shield local farmers from price shoc
