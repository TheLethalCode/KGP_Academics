<TITLE> Japan unwise to blame China in food scare: researcher </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan was too hasty to point its finger at China when people fell ill from eating Chinese-made dumplings and the criticism could harm trade relations, the official Xinhua news agency reported a government researcher as saying on Sunday. Tests in China have found no trace of a pesticide that Japan says caused at least 10 people to fall sick, a scare that has dominated Japanese media and triggered recalls and floods of queries from worried consumers. Tang Chunfeng, an expert on Japanese affairs in the Research Institute of China's Ministry of Commerce, said he was worried the dumpling case could complicate the already fraught ties between the two Asian powers. "Since the real cause is still under investigation, I don't think it wise to blame the Chinese side for it," he said, according to Xinhua. The suspected poisoning prompted Japan's government spokesman to question China's attitude to food safety only weeks after Beijing said it had improved standards with new technology and tighter inspections. Japan's foreign minister on Friday expressed hope that the effect on ties, always sensitive due to China's bitter wartime memories and present regional rivalry, could be minimised. China's Ministry of Commerce said on Saturday that the Chinese government "sincerely cares about the poisoned Japanese and hopes that they recover soon". Xinhua also reported on Sunday that the team of experts sent by China to help investigate the dumplings case had met with their Japanese counterparts and agreed to refrain from stating any preliminary conclusions. Japanese media reports said the insecticide found in the suspect dumplings was used widely in China, but not in Japan. However, Chinese food quality officials said tests on 30 samples of frozen dumplings, ingredients and packaging taken at the factory concerned had found no pesticide. Tian Yang Food Plant in the northern province of Hebei makes dumplings only for the Japanese market. The 30-year-old company was ordered this week to stop production and exports and recall its products.
