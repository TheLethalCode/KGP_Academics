<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday remanded the suspect known as Shiplu for three days to allow police to question him over the theft of Rabindranath Tagore's Nobel Prize medal. Dhaka Magistrate Abdullah Al Mamun of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court ordered the remand for Shiplu to be quizzed over his connection to jailed Indian national Jiban Singh. Police officers at the remand appeal said they would also interrogate the suspect over possible connections to smuggling archaeological artefacts and drug dealing. CID officer Shyamol Chowdhury initially sought seven days remand on Feb 2, following Shiplu's arrest from a house in Lalbagh on Jan 31. The suspect's lawyer Imaul Haque Imon appealed for bail and a cancellation of the remand order. bdnews2
