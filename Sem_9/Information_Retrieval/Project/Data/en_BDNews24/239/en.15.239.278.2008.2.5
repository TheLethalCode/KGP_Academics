<TITLE> Italy set for early election, Berlusconi ahead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy is set to hold an election by mid-April which could return media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi to power after political parties failed to agree on an interim government. "Here we go: to the polls," read Tuesday's headline in Il Giornale daily, owned by Berlusconi's brother Paolo. Italy plunged into political crisis after Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who narrowly beat Berlusconi in a 2006 election, was forced to resign last month by defections in his centre-left coalition. Reluctant to send Italians back to the polls, President Giorgio Napolitano asked the speaker of the Senate (upper house) to see whether he could muster enough support for a temporary government to reform the electoral system. But Berlusconi, sensing a swift return to the post of prime minister he has held twice before, demanded a snap election. After four days of talks with political leaders, Senate speaker Franco Marini told Napolitano on Monday he had failed to find a majority backing an interim administration. Surveys have put Berlusconi's centre right constantly ahead. On Monday, after reiterating his "No" to Marini, the 71-year old media tycoon said he had a lead of between 10 and 16 points over the centre left, which will be led to the polls by Rome's 52-year-old mayor Walter Veltroni. "LIKE OBAMA" Veltroni had supported an interim government to change voting rules that were widely blamed for the fragility of Prodi's government, Italy's 61st since World War Two. He now faces an uphill fight against Italy's richest man, but refuses to be written off just yet. "I don't believe the doom-sayers nor opinion polls. Look at (Barack) Obama -- three months ago nobody would have bet on him, now look where he is," said Veltroni, comparing himself to the Democrat fighting to become America's first black president. Many economists say another government elected under current electoral rules will prove just as unstable as Prodi's, who had been in power for only 20 months and was undermined by constant bickering between Catholic and communist allies. Some analysts also worry another free-spending Berlusconi government will undo the centre-left's work on cutting the budget deficit. Prodi won the 2006 vote by the narrowest margin in Italy's modern history. He was eventually forced to quit when the defection of a small Catholic party erased his razor-thin majority in the Senate. His government's inherent fragility resulted largely from voting rules introduced by Berlusconi in 2005 and regarded by critics as a "poison pill" for Prodi. "We should have changed the electoral law first if only to do a bit of spring cleaning," said Rome commuter Franco Zarli, on his way to work. "I don't expect anything new, everything will remain the sam
