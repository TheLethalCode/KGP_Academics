 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Illegal call termination through VoIP is still taking place despite a massive drive against the rogue businesses, an official said Monday. Officials said the number of incoming overseas calls through BTTB channels shrunk in January compared with the calls the previous month. BTTB general manager Lt Col Zia Rashid Safdar said: "From the number of BTTB calls, it is clear that call termination is taking place. Call time can vary, but not in a big margin like this." He said they informed the authorities about the practices and some new measures would come soon. Another official of the BTTB, who spoke to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, elaborated. He said shrinking of the incoming overseas calls was cutting off the official telecoms company's revenue, the official said. He also blamed the VoIP services for invading the BTTB's regimes through illegal means. "The calls are coming through illegal channels," he said. "The number of calls should have increased following the use of ITX-6, but it has not as per expectation." He said the number of calls in January fell compared to that in December. According to the BTTB, in December the total time for incoming calls was 37,15,42,252 minutes. In January it fell to 33,86,17,573 minutes. BTTB officials said that mainly incoming calls were being terminated. The calls coming illegally were entering the illegal gateway instead of the BTTB gateway. BTTB officials said that VoIP sector accounts for Tk 6,000 crore a year. The government started a drive against illegal VoIPs in December 2006. After the start of the drive, the number of BTTB calls increased. At the time, on an average every day the call time started increasing by 3.5 million minutes and stood at 11 million minutes. At present a committee with RAB, BTRC, Teletalk and BTTB members has been conducting drives regularly against the rogue business. BTRC has conducted 21 anti-VoIP drives in recent times. It has fined four mobile phone companies--- GrameenPhone, Banglalink, Aktel and Citycell for involvement in this illicit busin
