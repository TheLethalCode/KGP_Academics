 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited kept their hopes alive in the Proteeti Victory Day Football Tournament with a 3-1 win over Dhaka Wanderers Club in their must-win second match at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Jahid Hasan Emili struck two goals while Shahajuddin Tipu scored one for the sky-blue outfit. Abahani, who lost to Badda Jagaroni 1-0 in the tournament opener, were more organised in the match, and enjoyed better ball possession throughout the game against Wanderers, who held Muktijoddha Sangsad to a goalless draw Thursday. The Dhanmondi-based outfit, Abahani, took a 24-minute lead with a surprising goal scored by Tipu, who saw his low shot find the back of the opponents net after deflecting a fellow Wanderers defender. Abahani's national striker Emili doubled the margin in the 36th minute as the young striker tapped a Jahid Parvez cross from the right into the net from close range, giving opponent goalkeeper Jahangir no chance. Ashraful Islam dodged past two Abahani defenders and keeper Biplob Bhattacharya to reduce the Wanderers margin to 2-1 five minutes into the second half. Capitalising on left-side cross from Tipu, Emili sealed the match scoring his second and team's third goal in the 67th minute. Mutkijoddha Sangad lead the B Group point table with four points from two matches, one point ahead of joint second placed Abahani and Badda Jagaroni, who have three points each from two matches. Dhaka Wanderers have one point from two outings. All four teams have one match each in hand and the semifinalists from Group B will be decided Monday.
