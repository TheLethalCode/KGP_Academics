<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of thousands of residents Saturday night made desperate efforts to cope with cuts in gas supply to parts of the capital. Prices of kerosene shot up in some areas as many scrambled to buy it as an alternative to gas. Many others bought gas cylinders. The repair of a distribution line disrupted gas supply to a large swathe of the capital and some nearby areas from Saturday midnight. The disruption which will continue through Monday midnight hampers production of power in Meghnaghat and Haripur power plants during the 48-hour shutdown, said Titas Gas public relations director Munir Hossain Khan. Engineers of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company are set to repair the distribution line near Daudkandi, Khan had earlier said. He said the supply of gas to the capital would increase after the repair work is done. The areas that will be affected are Demra, Shaympur, Jatrabari, Fatulla, Keraniganj, Sutrapur, Kotwali, Lalbagh, Hazaribagh, New Market, Shahbagh, Motijheel, Paltan, Ramna, Sabujbagh, Khilgaon, Tejgaon, Gulshan, Badda police station and surrounding areas, and Gazaria, Meghnaghat, Sonargaon and Rupganj. bdnews24.com
