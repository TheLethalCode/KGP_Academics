 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Team B, led by Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Sunday handed a convincing 83-run defeat to Team C, led by Shakib Al Hasan, in the third practice match ahead of this month's home series against South Africa. The Team B bundled Team C out for 112 in 43.1 overs after putting on 195 for nine in the 45 stipulated overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Put in to bat first, the Team B put up a moderate total on the board despite a top order collapse as middle order Mahmuduall Riad struck a fine 53 runs and wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh made 45 runs. Riad smashed two sixes and one four in his 80-ball knock after the Mashrafee's side were tottering at 57 for four while Dhiman hammered three fours in 52 deliveries. Ace spinner Mohammad Rafique wrecked the top and middle orders claiming four wickets for 28. The Team C, in reply, fell in trouble losing five wickets for 30 and never recovered the damage in the face of some superb bowling from Mashrafee, Nazmul Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Riad, Alok Kapali and Shahajada. They finally folded at 112 with tail-ender Enamul Haq topscoring with 43 off 60 balls studded with three fours. Shakib (14), Javed Omar (0), Rajin Saleh (6), Aftab Ahmed (13), Tushar Imran (0), Khaled Masud (12), Rafique (3), Nayeem Islam (9) failed to live up to their reputations.
