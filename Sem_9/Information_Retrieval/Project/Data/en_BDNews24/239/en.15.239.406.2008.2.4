<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actress Eva Mendes, whose movies include "Training Day" and "Ghost Rider," has checked into a rehabilitation facility in Utah, celebrity Web sites reported on Friday. A spokesman for Mendes declined to confirm the report but did issue a statement saying the 33-year-old actress had taken time off to "attend to some personal issues." "Eva has been working hard for the past year and made a positive decision to take some much-needed time off to proactively attend to some personal issues that, while not critical, she felt deserved some outside professional support," said the statement from spokesman Brad Cafarelli. Celebrity Web site TMZ.com said Mendes had checked into the Cirque Lodge rehab center in Utah, which is the same facility in which actress Lindsay Lohan sought help late last year. The news of Mendes' stint in rehab came on the same day that Calvin Klein Inc. said Mendes would be featured in an upcoming advertising campaign for Calvin Klein Fragrances. "We support Eva during this difficult time and respect her decision to seek professional help," Calvin Klein Inc. said in a statement. The actress starred in four movies in 2007 including the thriller "Ghost Rider" and the cop drama "We Own the Night." She has two films planned for this year, "The Women" and "The Spirit."
