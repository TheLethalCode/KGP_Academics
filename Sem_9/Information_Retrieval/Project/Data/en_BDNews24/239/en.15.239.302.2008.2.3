 SYDNEY, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brett Lee captured five wickets with his blistering pace to help Australia bowl out India for 194 in their tri-series limited overs match at the Gabba on Sunday. Fresh from winning player of the series in the tests, Lee took 5-27 from nine overs, including two wickets in his final over, as India collapsed to be dismissed in the 45th over after their innings had been interrupted by rain. The umpires had already reduced the match to 45 overs per side but under the Duckworth Lewis method of scoring, the Australians will need 196 from 45 overs to win. Gautam Gambhir topscored for India with 39 while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni made 37 and spinner Harbhajan Singh chipped in with a valuable 27 between Lee's three explosive bursts. The express paceman captured the vital wicket of Sachin Tendulkar for 10 in his first spell when India's master batsmen stepped on his own stumps after fending off a short-pitched ball. He dismissed Rohit Sharma for 29 then debutant Manoj Tiwary for two with an inswinging yorker in his second spell as India crashed to 102 for six before the rain settled in. Play was stopped for 90 minutes but India's tailenders fought back with Dhoni and Harbhajan adding 41 for the eighth wicket before Lee dismissed them both in the final over. Lee's 5-27 was his seventh five-wicket haul in one-day internationals and lifted his career tally to 285 wickets, the third highest by an Australian behind Glenn McGrath (380) and Shane Warne (291).
