 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks closed upbeat Monday led by issues in oil, mutual funds, power and banking as regulatory moves to inject more funds into the market took effect. Headline corrected The Securities and Exchange Commission Sunday decided to lift restrictions on merchant banks margin loans from Feb 10, which allows the banks to offer loans to investors at a one to one ratio. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmad told bdnews24.com that the readjustment was made as the market was behaving normally after restrictions were lifted on netting facilities and financial adjustments. "The one to one ratio will be effective from February 10," said Farhad. On Nov 25, the SEC adjusted the ratio to 1 to 0.5, to counter the overheating market. The market watchdog lifted netting facilities restriction on Jan 30. The same day retail investors took to the streets to demand regulatory interventions to stabilise the slumping market. However, many analysts feel the measures will not be effective in the long run. "These initiatives may stabilise the market for now, but in the long run they will not yield any benefits," said economist Prof Abu Ahmed, who teaches at Dhaka University. "The regulator has only reversed earlier decisions, which were intended to cool down the overheated market," said Ahmed. The economist stressed the need for further integration between operators, brokers, merchant banks and retail investors to stabilise the market. "What we need are more quality issues and institutional investors to mature the market. These regulatory moves are of no use in the long run," he said. Yaweer Sayeed, who manages over Tk 1 billion in funds for AIMS of Bangladesh, said: "The market needs to mature a lot." "Our market is driven by rumours, which is not at all good. The regulator should come up with initiatives to make institutional investors stronger." "More merchant banks are required to reduce the influence of rumours in the market," added Sayeed. The benchmark DGEN or general index rose 49.67 points, or 1.71 percent, to end at 2939.92. The DSI or all share price index closed at 2476.92, up 37.09 points, or 1.58 percent.
