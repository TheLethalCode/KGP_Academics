 NAIROBI, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in Kenya to throw his weight behind talks to end a bloody political crisis, urged Kenya to restore international confidence by immediately stopping violence. "What is important at this time is to maintain peace and security," Ban told reporters. "You have lost already too much in terms of national image, economic interest ... This is unfortunate for a country that has been enjoying freedom and stability."
