<TITLE> Mohammedan stumble against Victoria </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Minnows Victoria SC held Mohammedan SC to a no goal draw Sunday in the Proteeti Pharman Victory Day Football Tournament at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Victoria goalkeeper Golam Mostafa denied Mohammedan's few attacks to force the black and white outfit to share points with the minnows. Mostafa first denied Liberian striker Charles Figo by blocking a close range shot for a corner in the 38th minute. Two minutes into the second half, Mostafa stunned Mohammedan's medio Faisal Mahmud as the young goalkeeper incredibly caught a eight-yard shot by Faisal to frustrate the Mohammedan fans. Motijheel-based outfit Mohammedan were not up to mark compared to their Friday's performance against Youngmen's Fakirerpool in their tournament opener. Victoria could have left the field with a triumph had their striker Mithun not slipped inside the danger zone. In the day's other match, a seven-minute strike from Iddi powered Arambagh KS to a 1-0 win over Youngmen's Fakirerpool, who quit the tournament after losing the second match. It would have been a 2-0 margin for Arambagh had Liton not missed the penalty shot in the 73rd minute. bd
