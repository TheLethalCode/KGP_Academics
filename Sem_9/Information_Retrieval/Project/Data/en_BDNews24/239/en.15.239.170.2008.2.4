<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  A patient fifty from Nadimuddin powered the Bangladesh Under-19 team on Monday to a convincing six-wicket win over the visiting West Indies counterparts in the third build-up match ahead of this month's ICC U/19 World Cup in Malaysia. Bangladesh raced to 155 for six in 38.2 overs in reply to West Indies' paltry total of 154 all out in 42 overs at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Nadimuddin scored 53 off 109 balls with six fours while Nasir Hossain made a 57-ball 33. They together put on 71 runs for the third wicket after Bangladesh were reduced to 26 for two in 4.4 overs. Opener M Mithun and Mahmudul Hasan hammered identical 20. Earlier, the visitors made a paltry total in the face of some tight bowling from the hosts. Spinners Suhrawardi Shuvo (3/4) and Nasir Hossain (3/30) shared six wickets to wreck the opposition top and middle orders before pacer Rubel Hossain wrapped up the tail with two for 34. Opener Kieron Powell topscored with 44 followed by Adrian Barath on 26 and S Brooks on 22 not out. The four-match series will be decided on Wednesday as the series opener was abandoned due to wet outfield.
