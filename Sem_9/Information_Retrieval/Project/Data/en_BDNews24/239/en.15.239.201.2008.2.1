 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh has turned down a human rights situation report published Thursday by a US watchdog. The World Report 2008 of the Human Rights Watch said that the Bangladesh army-backed government failed to protect rights with security agencies committing serious human rights violations. Foreign secretary Touhid Hossain rejected the report saying, "It is not true." Contacted by bdnews24.com, the secretary said: "If data on the report are analysed comparing with the home ministry's report of 2006 and 2007, it will be clear that the report on human rights is not true." "It is their job to publish reports on human rights situation," he added. Elaine Pearson, Deputy Director for Asia of the Human Rights Watch, said, "Sadly, 2007 marked serious setbacks for human rights in Bangladesh." She said that there were widespread allegations against security officials of arresting, detaining and killing civilians. "Bangladesh's interim government used the pretext of emergency rule to continue a historic pattern of impunity," she added. The Human Rights Report said that tens of thousands people were arrested in a few weeks after the state of emergency was declared. Security agencies did not comply with the emergency rules in detaining people, it added. The report also said that army and intelligence agencies threatened journalists to stop writing against the government and the army. Pearson said that journalists and political activists were scared of the army. bdnews24.com
