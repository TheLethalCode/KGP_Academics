 LONDON, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Attorney General is appealing an "unduly lenient" sentence given to a London dentist who had planned to fight for the Afghan Taliban against British and US forces, her spokesman said on Friday. Baroness Patricia Scotland said she was appealing the sentence given to Pakistan-born Sohail Qureshi, who was jailed for 4-1/2 years last month for preparing to commit terrorist offences. Her appeal is expected to be lodged shortly. Under British law Qureshi is likely to be free in a year, after serving half his term and allowing for time in custody. "After careful review the Attorney General, Baroness Scotland, has decided to refer the sentence given to Sohail Qureshi to the Court of Appeal as she considers the sentence to be unduly lenient," her spokesman said. Qureshi, 30, was arrested in October 2006 at London's Heathrow airport as he prepared to fly to Pakistan carrying around 9,000 pounds ($17,800) in cash, medical supplies and night vision gear. Describing him as a "dedicated supporter of Islamist extremism", prosecutors said material on his computer's hard drive showed he had intended to fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan against British and US forces. Police also uncovered a discussion with an associate on a militant Web site referring to his Pakistan trip, which read: "All I know is that it is a two- or three-week operation. Pray that I will kill many, brother. Revenge, revenge, revenge." Prosecutors said he also had fighting and first aid manuals, theological notes justifying terrorism, a book he had written called "My Dad the bomb maker" detailing how he had become a militant, and CD-Rom pictures of him brandishing an M16 rifle. "There were also appalling pictures and videos of mutilated corpses and videos of executions and the 9/11 atrocity," Prosecutor Jonathan Sharp said. "He was taking it on the trip to keep his mind focused on his terrorist goal." Qureshi pleaded guilty to preparing for the commission of terrorist acts, possessing an article for a terrorist purpose and possession of records likely to be useful in terrorism. It was the first conviction under a 2006 law covering cases where suspects are preparing to commit an act of terrorism but fall short of having a concrete plan in place. The court was told his arrest also led to the conviction of Samina Malik, a 23-year-old woman who had written poems praising Osama bin Laden, supporting martyrdom and discussing beheading. Police had uncovered Internet contact between Qureshi and Malik, who worked at a shop in Heathrow's Terminal 4. The court was told that before his planned Pakistan trip, he e-mailed her and asked: "What is the situation like at work? Is the check-in very harsh or have things cooled down a bit?" Malik was found guilty of possessing terrorism-related documents and was given a suspended sentence last month.
