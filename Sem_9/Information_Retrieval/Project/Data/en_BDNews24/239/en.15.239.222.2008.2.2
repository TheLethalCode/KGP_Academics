<TITLE> US job losses in January raise recession fears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US employers cut payrolls for the first time in 4-1/2 years in January, the Labor Department said on Friday in a report that showed the slowing economy was at growing risk of sliding into recession. A separate report showing a modest revival in manufacturing took some sting out of the jobs loss but financial markets were betting the Federal Reserve will have to keep cutting interest rates to try to keep growth on track. "The economy is very weak. It's on the edge of recession but the data are mixed enough so that you can't say a recession has begun," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. "It's hanging by a thread but it hasn't been cut yet." President George W. Bush acknowledged to a Kansas City, Missouri, audience there were "troubling signs, serious signs that the economy is weakening" and said Congress should speed up work on fiscal measures to get tax rebates to consumers. Some 17,000 jobs were cut last month, sharply contrary to Wall Street analysts' forecasts that 80,000 would be created. December's new-job total was revised up to 82,000 from 18,000, but October and November gains were revised lower. At midmorning, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 50.7 in January from 48.4 in December, a sign of expansion. Consumer sentiment also rose, according to a Reuters/University of Michigan Survey, though not as much as had been forecast. Financial markets were whipsawed by the contrasting reports, but stock prices closed higher to cap Wall Street's best week in almost five years as Microsoft Corp's $44.6 billion bid for Yahoo Inc stirred investor optimism. TEETERING ON THE EDGE The better tone on Wall Street, however, followed several brutal weeks as investors sought to gauge whether the slowing economy, weighed down by a deep housing slump and tight credit, was going to turn down. Some analysts said the weak jobs data virtually sealed the case for recession. "We are on the brink of a recession now," said Daniel North, chief economist for Euler Hermes ACI in Owings Mill, Maryland. "The job market is always a lagging indicator. This is a nail-in-the-coffin." Still, the jobs report was not without a bright spot. The national unemployment rate eased to 4.9 percent in December from November's 5 percent. The jobless rate is calculated using a survey of households, while the payrolls count is based on a poll of employers. The Fed cut interest rates again this week in a bid to spur the economy and the Bush administration and Congress are wrangling over the fiscal stimulus plan. But analysts said more policy action may be necessary to try to avert a stall. Boris Schlossberg, chief currency strategist for DailyFX.com in New York, said the jobs total "shows that the economy is at a virtual standstill." "It is very negative from a long-term perspective because clearly the Fed is going to have to continue cutting rates," Schlossberg added. Lower U.S. interest rates could put further downward pressure on the dollar's value. Manufacturers cut 28,000 jobs in January, a 19th straight month of contraction, while the number of construction jobs dropped by 27,000. The department said construction industries have shed 284,000 jobs since employment peaked in September 2006, largely reflecting the continuing decline in home building. The private sector added 1,000 jobs in January but 18,000 government jobs were lost. The job report showed that after holding steady for six months, the average workweek fell to 33.7 hours in January from 33.8 in December, another sign of weakening in labor markets. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed an unexpectedly steep 1.1 percent drop in construction spending in December, as home construction continued it steep fall. Sales, construction and prices of both new and previously owned homes are in sharp decline with no early end in sight.
