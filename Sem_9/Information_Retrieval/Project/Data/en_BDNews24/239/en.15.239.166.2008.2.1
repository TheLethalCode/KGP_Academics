 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh looks to set up a shared connection through Myanmar with another submarine cable, in an alternative move to stay wired with the rest of the world via the internet. Bangladesh will send a proposal to Myanmar government this week to ensure the substitute communication channel, acting post and telecommunication secretary Iqbal Mahmud said Friday. An official from the telecoms ministry, requesting anonymity, said Bangladesh would build necessary infrastructure up to the border, while Myanmar would complete the work on their side. The proposal will ask Myanmar to bear the cost of installing the link from Zialong Landing Station to the border, while Bangladesh will fund the remainder from Cox's Bazar to the border. Mahmud said both countries would provide equal bandwidth under the plan. The SE-ME-WE-4 cable that connects Bangladesh was recently damaged in the Mediterranean Sea resulting in a disrupted service to users in the Middle East and South Asia over the last two days. On the other hand, Myanmar is connected to the SE-ME-WE-3 cable that links South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe. The new connection will provide a back-up to the existing system that Bangladesh uses. Telecommunication ministry officials confirmed that Myanmar had agreed in principle to the scheme, which will be discussed further during the foreign secretary's visit to Myanmar by the end of January. bdnews24.c
