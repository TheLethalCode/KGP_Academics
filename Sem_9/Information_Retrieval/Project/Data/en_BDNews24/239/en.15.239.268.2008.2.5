<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britney Spears, who has been hospitalized for mental evaluation, will be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist to determine if the troubled pop star understands the legal proceedings surrounding her, a judge ruled on Monday. Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Scott Gordon ordered that the psychiatrist file a report on the 26-year-old singer's mental condition by February 13, the eve of a hearing to decide how much longer her assets should remain under the temporary control of her father and his attorney. Gordon also said a restraining order against Spears' self-styled manager and confidant, Sam Lutfi, forbids him from any contact with her, including telephone, texts messages and e-mail, amid reports the two were still in contact. The child custody battle between the Grammy-winning pop star and her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, has been put on hold until her mental issues can be resolved. Spears was taken to UCLA Medical Center in an ambulance for a 72-hour mental evaluation last week as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. That stay has since been extended to two weeks. Her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew Wallete were granted control of her assets, including her house. Gordon said that ruling would remain in place until further proceedings, but he rejected a bid by the conservators to fire her defense attorneys. Spears, a former Disney child star and chart-topping singer, has seen her personal life descend into turmoil since she filed for divorce from Federline in 2006, while Lutfi has become an almost constant presence in her life in recent months. The Louisiana native was hospitalized in January for a mental evaluation after going into hysterics when Federline's representatives tried to retrieve their children after a visit. Spears' antics have made her a regular target of the paparazzi. Two weeks ago, four photographers were arrested on suspicion of reckless driving while trailing her. It cost local authorities $25,000 to keep photographers at bay during her trip to the hospital last week, police said. On Friday, a Los Angeles city councilman proposed a municipal ordinance to restrict the paparazzi's movements when photographing stars in public. Los Angeles police are investigating a theft report filed on Friday by Spears' father, a police spokeswoman said. She said several personal items were reported taken from her home
