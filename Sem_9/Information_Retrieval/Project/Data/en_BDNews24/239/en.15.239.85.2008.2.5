<TITLE> Hamas armed wing says carried out Israel bombing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Gaza, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility for a Palestinian suicide bombing that killed a woman in southern Israel on Monday, the first such attack inside Israel claimed by Hamas since 2004, a Hamas source told Reuters. The source said the two Palestinians who died during the attack in the Israeli town of Dimona came from the West Bank city of Hebron, rather than from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Other details were not immediately available. The last time Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility for suicide bombings inside Israel was August 2004, when 16 people were killed and 100 wounded in explosions on two buses in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba.
