 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com) -- The government is set to provide financial support to help residents of the five monga-hit districts migrate abroad for jobs, a government official said Monday. The initiative includes a drive to help provide overseas employment for those hardest hit, particularly in Rangpur district, as well as creating recruitment quotas in the area. The government will form a steering committee which will recommend the best way to export manpower from Rangpur district. The decision was made at a ministerial meeting at the foreign ministry chaired by foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. "We will provide micro-credit facilities through the Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation to facilitate the overseas work and reduce poverty," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com following the meeting. "The interest rate for micro-credit will be reduced. We have also decided to form a steering committee, headed by the ministry of expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary," he said. The adviser said the steering committee will have representatives from the Bureau of Manpower and Employment Training, the Bangladesh Overseas Employment Service and the foreign ministry among others. Iftekhar, who used to head the overseas employment ministry, said a technical education centre in Rangpur will be operational within two months. "Another training centre will also be started in Lalmonirhat. The centres will produce skilled and semi-skilled workers," the foreign adviser said. Md Jasim Uddin, a deputy general manager at the Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation, told bdnews24.com that the interest rate for micro-credit under the initiative will not exceed eight percent. "We have already funded such programmes on limited scale and we got satisfactory results," he said. The government Saturday announced a 14-point plan to develop the region, while on Sunday the chief adviser met with local people in the area. bdn
