<TITLE> Fitch plans CDO overhaul, sees 5-notch downgrades </TITLE>

 LONDON, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said it planned to change its methodology for rating corporate collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), resulting in an expected average downgrade of five notches for static synthetic transactions. The proposed change follows criticism that rating agencies were partly to blame when investors failed to appreciate the risks of the complex products, which played a major role in creating the U.S. subprime debacle and the credit crisis. It comes a day after rival Moody's Investors Serivce said it might change how it rates thousands of structured credit products, including moving to a numerical system and flagging which structued debt might have volatile ratings. Fitch said numerous tranches of synthetic CDOs currently rated AAA were likely to be affected. "With the structured credit markets under unprecedented stress, Fitch wanted to proactively challenge existing CDO rating assumptions," said John Olert, managing director of the credit ratings agency, in a statement on Tuesday. "The intention is to provide CDO ratings that perform similarly in terms of default risk and ratings migrations with the markets' expectation for other asset classes," he added. "This is particularly true for AAA and other highly rated CDO tranches". A CDO is a portfolio of debt divided into tranches, or slices, by degrees of risk. The riskiest and highest-yielding tranche is exposed to the first few percent of default losses from any credit in the pool. After it has been wiped out, losses then move to the next tranche. The tranches at the top of the ladder are typically rated triple-A. Synthetic CDOs are based on portfolios of corporate credit derivatives known as credit default swaps, and static deals are those without managers in which the portfolio does not change. "Static synthetic CDOs are expected to be the most affected by the revised criteria, with an average expected downgrade of five notches," Fitch said. It expected downgrades to be less severe for CDOs based on portfolios of high-yield assets such as leveraged loans. Most of the top tranches of these are likely to be affirmed, but their lower, riskier tranches may be downgraded by one to three notches, Fitch said. "Ratings are not expected to be lowered below B- in the absence of actual portfolio deterioration." The agency said it was seeking feedback from the market on the proposed revisions and would publish the final criteria by March 31. It will then take three months to review all CDOs based on the new criteria. The criteria would apply to portfolios of 50 to 500 borrowers, Fitch said. Updated criteria for other types of CDOs such as those based on emerging markets assets, asset-backed securities and small and medium-sized business loans will follow in the coming months, it sa
