<TITLE> US backs modernizing Polish air defenses: Rice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States supports modernizing Poland's air defenses, a key Polish demand for hosting part of a planned missile defense system, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Friday. The Bush administration wants to locate 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar installation in Czech Republic under a $3.5 billion plan to defend Europe and the United States against a possible missile attack from Iran and other "rogue states." Russia fiercely opposes the plan and has said it will take unspecified "tangible" measures if construction begins on the system's infrastructure -- prompting Poland to ask Washington for more security guarantees if it goes along. "We understand that there is a desire for defense modernization in Poland and particularly for air defense modernization in Poland," Rice told a joint news conference with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. "This is something that we support because it will make our ally, Poland, more capable." Sikorski, on his first trip to Washington as foreign minister of Poland's new center-right government, said there were more negotiations to come but he was satisfied that his country's arguments had been accepted. "We have an agreement in principle." he said. "There is still a great deal of work for our experts. ... But yes, I am satisfied that the principles that we have argued for have been accepted." Rice said negotiations with Poland would resume as soon as possible on details of the missile defense project. She said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk would visit Washington in early March and he and President George W. Bush could then "go forward" on the matter. Sikorski said Tusk would make final decisions for Poland. Neither Sikorski nor Rice detailed how the air defenses could be modernized. Poland's Defense Minister, Bogdan Klich, has suggested Washington bolster the air defenses with new short- and medium-range systems like the Patriot missile in exchange for Warsaw's missile shield cooperation. Sikorski has said Poland feels no direct threat from Iran but takes seriously U.S. concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology. During his visit, Sikorski has expressed concern about saber-rattling from Moscow -- Poland's Warsaw Pact overlord for nearly a half century after World War II -- and whether the Polish government would be able to sell the missile shield plan to a skeptical Polish public. To do so, he said, any deal must make Poland and the United States more secure. Rice emphasized the United States' commitment to Poland's security was sealed when Poland joined NATO in 1999. "Of course, our commitment to Poland's security and to Poland's defense is unassailable," she declared. But she also sought to assure Moscow the missile shield was not a threat to Russia. She said the world was in "a completely different environment" than during the Cold War, when the United States had a Strategic Defense Initiative antimissile program aimed at the Soviet nuclear threat. "This is not that program. This is not the son of that program. This is not the grandson of that program. This is a very different program that is meant to deal with limited threats," Rice said. "There is no way that a few interceptors in Poland and radars in the Czech Republic can degrade the thousands of nuclear warheads that the Russians have. And there is no intent to do so."
