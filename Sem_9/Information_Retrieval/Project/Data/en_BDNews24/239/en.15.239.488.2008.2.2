<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)Justice Syed JR Mudassir Hossain Saturday said the police must provide services for people, inspired by humane values. "If all spheres of society are not reformed, only reform to the police will not succeed," the former chief justice said. Speaking as chief guest at a seminar Saturday, he said: "If reform is brought to the police and other sections of society do not see much progress, reform will be an ill-reform." However, Mudassir said the police as member of the republic have to make efforts to cut crimes. Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights and Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh co-organised the seminar on "Study on Duties and Obligations of the Law Enforcing Institution" at Dhaka Reporters Unity. Pointing to what he said was moral erosion in society, the former Supreme Court judge said: "There are lots of sections of law but the police should not work only in the light of those sections. The police have to have humane values to provide service for people." He stressed that salaries and allowances for police should increase, so should their efficiency. "If salaries and allowances were increased, the mindset of police would change," he said. Mudassir said the police could not perform properly in some areas due to political influence during the past regimes. bdnews24.
