 HONG KONG, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most Asian stock markets rose on Friday after one of their worst months on record as concerns eased about the outlook for top bond insurers hit by the US subprime mortgage crisis and credit-related losses. The dollar steadied near an all-time low against the euro as markets awaited US jobs data for a further steer on whether a recession will hit the US economy following a succession of weak indicators. But stocks began February brightly, pushing MSCI's index of non-Japan Asia up 1.7 percent by 0623 GMT, although markets in China and Japan remained weak. Financial bookmakers said major European stock markets were expected to open 0.2-0.9 percent higher. "There is a perception that markets have already reached troughs and are cheap, but on the other hand, nobody is sure about how much further the U.S. economy will deteriorate. So it will be difficult for markets to move in either direction in February," said Samuel So, an analyst at Samsung Securities in Seoul. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index led the pack in Asia, closing up 3.4 percent. Investors scrambled for rival miners BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto with only two full sessions before BHP's deadline to launch a formal bid for Rio. "It would be embarrassing for BHP to walk away after having put so much effort into it," said Peter Chilton, an investment bank analyst with Constellation Capital Management. Recently battered banks and property trusts also rebounded. The financial sector won a reprieve late on Thursday when MBIA Inc, the top U.S. bond insurer, said it had enough cash to run its business of guaranteeing payments on corporate and municipal bonds, dispelling fears about its credit rating and pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.7 percent. But Wall Street's gains could not salvage the Dow's worst January since 2000, and since 1990 for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index It was also the worst January ever for the Nasdaq Composite Index, down 9.9 percent on the month. HAUNTED MARKET With the spectre of a U.S. recession haunting the market, investors were also cautious about U.S. jobs data and a reading of factory activity later in the day, fearful that more signs of economic decay could spark another downward jolt in stock prices. Traders are looking to the numbers to help them decide whether to keep dumping the dollar, which last month hit its lowest in nearly three years against the yen "Basically, the payrolls figures must be very strong to spur any significant dollar buying," said Hideaki Inoue, a forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking. Thursday's fresh concerns over the U.S. financial sector spurred safety bids for U.S. Treasuries, with Japanese government bond futures following suit on Friday. But gains were limited as many investors stayed on the sidelines before the U.S. economic data. "At least for February, it's hard to think of reasons for bonds to come under selling pressure," said Hiroki Shimazu, market economist for Mizuho Securities, referring to the outlook for Treasuries. Apart from the uncertainty over U.S. bond insurers, market players were awaiting earnings announcements by major European banks coming up in February, Shimazu said. The dollar hovered around 106.4 yen, little changed from late New York trade, when it slipped as far as 105.71 yen, while the euro was little changed at $1.4865. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 0.7 percent, with Sony Corp stumbling on a lower profit forecast and a downgrade from HSBC and Mizuho Financial Group losing 5 percent because of ballooning subprime losses. Japan's enthusiasm wilted further at the sight of a sharp fall in Shanghai's SSE Composite, where a $3.6 billion listing by China Coal made a lacklustre impression by adding a lower-than-expected 30 percent to its starting price. US economic worries have also battered oil prices Crude fell by more than $1 to below $91 a barrel in Asian trade, with an OPEC meeting later on Friday expected to give consumer nations no respite from high prices. Gold traded around $926 an ounce, down from Tuesday's record high above $933, while platinum held near its record peak of $1,741 an ounce as investors believe the worst is far from over in main producer South Africa's power cris
