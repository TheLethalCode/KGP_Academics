 DURBAN, South Africa, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Commanding innings by Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers guided South Africa to a fourth consecutive win in their one-day series against West Indies on Friday. South Africa, who have already claimed the five-match series, won by five wickets with 13 balls to spare. West Indies totalled 263 for nine, and South Africa replied with 266 for five in 47.5 overs. Opener Smith scored his 50 off 37 balls with 10 fours, while De Villiers marshalled the middle order with his 77, the product of 86 balls. A career-best 43 not out off 21 balls from Jerome Taylor boosted West Indies to their defendable total. Tail-ender Taylor smashed five fours and two sixes after the visitors had won the toss and chosen to bat. Taylor, whose previous best score was the 13 he made against Sri Lanka in Providence in 2006-07, shared 57 runs for the unbroken 10th wicket with Fidel Edwards (12 not out). The last pair helped West Indies recover after their middle order squandered the solid start made by Brenton Parchment and Sewnarine Chattergoon, who put on 97 for the first wicket. The West Indian openers, who each scored 48, gathered runs comfortably until the 24th over, when Chattergoon drove at a delivery from medium pacer Shaun Pollock and was caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. West Indies were 206 for nine when Edwards joined Taylor in the 45th over. Suddenly the runs began to flow, and in the process fast bowler Makhaya Ntini conceded 80 runs off his nine overs, the most expensive one-day analysis by a South African. The previous record was held by fast bowler Jacques Kallis, who went for 70 runs in the six overs he bowled against Australia in Johannesburg in 2005-06. RUN CHASE Smith and Herschelle Gibbs (39) launched South Africa's run chase in style with a stand of 77 off 71 balls for the first wicket. Smith was dismissed with the next delivery after reaching his half-century when he pulled a ball from paceman Darren Sammy and was caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul at midwicket. South Africa slipped to 119 for three before De Villiers and JP Duminy (44) put them back on track with a partnership of 99. Pollock and Mark Boucher, who were both 21 not out, finished the job for the home side. The last match of the series will be played in Johannesburg on Sunda
