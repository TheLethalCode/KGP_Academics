 Pradip Chowdhury bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court is likely to indict former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday in the barge-mounted power plants case. Dhaka Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque on Jan 28 transferred the case to the Special Judges' Court-1 set up on the defunct Sangsad Bhaban premises for trial. "The indictment is supposed to be held [Sunday], but as we could not prepare for not receiving any documents, we will appeal to the court to defer the date," Hasina's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman said to bdnews24.com. The other accused persons are former power secretary, Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of Power Development Board Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddikur Rahman. All of the accused have been shown fugitives besides Hasina and Elahi. Hasina was shown arrested on Sep 19 last year while Elahi turned himself in to the court on Jan 16. Deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission SM Shabbir Khan filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2. According to case details, the accused took bribe of around Tk 3 crore to buy a house and land in the name of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in exchange for awarding work permits to two companies to set up three power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. The work permit was given to Wartsila Power Development Ltd Consortium instead of New England Power Company, despite it being the lowest bidder. Hasina, during her 1996-2001 term, took Tk 3 crore in bribes in eight cheques and pay orders from Oct 24, 1996 to Nov 24, 1997, the case alleged. She purchased 19 kathas of land including a two-storey building on road no 32, Dhanmondi in the name of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Trust on Oct 8, 1997. The previous day, owners of Summit Group and United Group paid the land owner Tk 1.45 crore and Tk 55 lakh in cheques and pay order. The police pressed charges on Jan 10 where the curator of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust was made an accused. On Oct 28, Hasina challenging in the High Court the legality of the case as it had been taken under the emergency powers rules. The court on Nov 4 cleared the former prime minister of the charge and stayed all proceedings of the case. The Supreme court on Nov 26 halted the High Court order, clearing way for the resumption of the proceedings of the case in the trial court. bdnews24
