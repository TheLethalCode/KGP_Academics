 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday asked authorities to explain why information on an individual's faith should not be put for voter registration, national ID cards and birth registration. The court asked the chief election commissioner, the cabinet secretary, home secretary, LGRD secretary and law secretary to come up with a reply within the next four weeks. A two-member HC bench comprising justices Najmun Ara Sultana and Ashfaqul Islam gave the ruling after hearing a writ petition filed by lawyers Sharif Ahmed and Parvez Hossain. Advocate Tajul Islam, acting on behalf of the petitioners, said at the hearing the constitution named Islam as the state religion; it also said all other religions will be practiced in communal peace and harmony. He added the constitution reiterated that the choice of and conformity to a religion was a citizen's basic right. He further pointed out that a citizen's religious identity should be mentioned in all the national documentation processes such as those mentioned above. It was a citizen's basic right to be identified by their religion too; otherwise, he claimed a citizen without their religious identity might feel deprived of a basic civic right. The writ details said the forms used for voter registration and national ID cards did not have any space for recording information on a citizen's religious faith, which may be termed as 'obliterating one's religious identity carried forward through centuries. It also said that the government and the Election Commission had 'fallen prey to a conspiracy having far-reaching implications'. Barrister Belayet Hossain and advocates MK Murad and Shamsul Arefin assisted advocate Tajul Islam at the hearing. Unwilling to be named, an EC official told bdnews24.com that the commission did not incorporate any column for obtaining information on religion as per directives contained in the Article 121 of the Constitution, which said that voter lists must not be based on differences of religion, caste, sex. bdnews24
