 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League presidium Friday endorsed senior leader Amir Hossain Amu's proposal that dialogue with the government must be free from conditions and be broadcast live. Amu made the demand from a January 28 press conference. From Friday's meeting, the Awami League asked the government not to scuttle scope for talks by imposing any condition. The meeting did not approve of another presidium member Motia Chowdhury's Jan 25 speech that the party must not go to the polls without detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "We won't go to the polls without Sheikh Hasina. It's imaginable to have polls without Sheikh Hasina but it's unrealistic," she said. After the meeting, AL's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam briefed reporters on the meeting's decisions and said the meeting completely approved Amu's comment on dialogue. "We want the dialogue free from conditions. Let not the dialogue be spoiled through conditions. The purpose of the dialogue is to hold elections as quickly as possible in line with the Election Commission roadmap." He said the discussion must be open and transparent. "Not only politicians, but professionals should be engaged in it." Islam came down hard on education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman saying his speech was motivated. "We don't want any speech that disrupts the purpose of dialogue. The election roadmap will derail without If dialogue." Islam said the Awami League would soon hold talks with allies to finalise agenda for dialogue. On why Motia's speech was not endorsed by the presidium, he said: "We will ask the government to lift the state of emergency as soon as possible. We believe our leader will come out through a legal process and will take part in the election under her leadership." bdnews
