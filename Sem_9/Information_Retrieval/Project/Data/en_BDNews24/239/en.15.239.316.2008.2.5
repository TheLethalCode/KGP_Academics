<TITLE> Cold War arms forum to get new lease of life </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Genava, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An effort has been launched to revive the main Cold War forum for disarmament talks in Geneva, dormant for a decade, a UN official said on Monday. Over the next two weeks, officials from Russia, the United States and Britain will submit proposals at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament for pacts on halting production of fissile nuclear material and on banning conventional weapons from space, the official told reporters. Tim Caughley of the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs said the drive by several countries and the United Nations itself was aimed at putting the conference -- which some have suggested should be closed down -- back into international focus. "There will be a huge amount of effort to break the deadlock," said Caughley, former New Zealand ambassador to the 65-nation conference, where key Cold War arms treaties were negotiated, and now its deputy secretary-general. The body last completed a pact -- on chemical weapons -- in 1997 but has since become bogged down in bickering over what to do next. On its overall agenda for the past decade have been four central issues: stopping the production of fissile nuclear material, space weapons, security assurances to non-nuclear states and general nuclear disarmament. No progress has been made on any of these because member countries, which make decisions by a consensus process under which any one can block accord, cannot agree on how they should be handled and in which order. The main differences -- on fissile materials which are a prime ingredient in nuclear weapons, and on banning the deployment of non-nuclear weapons in space -- are between the three largest nuclear powers, the United States, China and Russia. Other smaller powers such as India and Iran want to see progress across the board on all four issues. In January, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attended the start of the conference's 2008 session -- the first time a chief of the world body has done so in years -- and appealed for "top level political leadership and cooperation" to break the logjam. This week Britain's Defence Secretary Des Browne and U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration chief Thomas d'Agostino will speak. Next week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will present a draft treaty to ban space weapons.
