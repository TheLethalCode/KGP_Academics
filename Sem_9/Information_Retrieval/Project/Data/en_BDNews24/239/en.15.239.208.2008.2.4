 NAIROBI, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Kenyan legislator accused First Lady Lucy Kibaki of physically assaulting him at a meeting at the official State House residence three weeks ago and said he planned to sue her. Government-allied legislator Gitobu Imanyara, a lawyer who unsuccessfully sued the first lady on behalf of a television cameraman who said she slapped him in 2005, told reporters he had been the latest target of Lucy Kibaki's ire.

Lucy Kibaki, known to be fiercely protective of her husband, has been at the centre of controversy on several occasions. In December, local media reported that she slapped a protocol official who called her by the name of a woman widely reported to be the president's second wife. In 2005, she stormed Nation Media's newsroom to complain about a story and slapped cameraman Clifford Derrick while her security detail and police looked on helplessly as she kept journalists there for hours. In fact she had the wrong newsroom, as the source of her anger was a story by the rival Standard media group. In 2004, she publicly upbraided Vice President Moody Awori, who called her the "second lady." She also shouted down a former World Bank country director for playing loud music at a party at the home he had rented from the Kibaki fami
