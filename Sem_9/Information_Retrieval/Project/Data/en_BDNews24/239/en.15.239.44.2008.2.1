 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com) The Asian Development Bank and other development partners will fund a $190 million project to help Bangladesh recover from the havoc wreaked by natural disasters last year, ADB said in a statement Thursday. ADB will give $120 million in loan and a $200,000 technical assistance grant to the Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation Project. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation will give $60m in loan and the Canadian International Development Agency $10 million. ADB expected other partners to cooperate with the project, which will be implemented in five segments. The first part covers essential commodities and inputs, particularly for agriculture, to ensure quick recovery and $75.56 million will be spent, the statement said. The second component, which has an allocation of $33.57 million, has been designed to rebuild rural infrastructure in 23 districts. This part includes reconstruction of 3,000 kilometres of rural road, 9,000 metres of bridges and culverts, and renovation of 300 flood and cyclone shelters. The third part covers rebuilding of urban infrastructure, including 700 kilometres of road, 65 kilometres of drainage system, 850 metres of bridges and culverts. The fourth component, which would be provided with $46.43 million, would involve repairing 800 kilometres of damaged national, regional and district roads, as well as 64 bridges and culverts within the country's seven road zones. The last component, which was allocated $31.70 million, includes repairing embankments, drainage and providing irrigation facilities. Flood control structures, protective works and canals in 47 districts would also be replaced. In addition, $9.85 million will be used for project implementation support, the statement said. The government of Bangladesh will pay $30 million to complete the funding requirement. "The project will contribute to sustainable economic growth by minimising devastating impact of the severe floods and cyclone that hit the country last year, and at the same time reduce future risk from similar catastrophes," said Stefan Ekelund, senior transport specialist of ADB's Bangladesh Resident Mission. The floods and cyclone last year affected 25 million people in 51 districts and cost Bangladesh $3 billion. The geography of the country makes it vulnerable to natural disasters, including cyclones, storms, floods, droughts, and earthquakes, the statement said. bd
