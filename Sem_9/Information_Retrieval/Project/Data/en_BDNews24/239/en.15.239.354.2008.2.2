<TITLE> Spain PM warns of dangers of Church power in vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's Socialist Prime Minister said on Saturday that extremists in the Catholic Church would have too much power if the conservative main opposition Popular Party (PP) wins next month's general election. "The most right-wing representatives in the Church ... already call the shots in the PP and they want to call the shots in Spain. It's that simple. That is basically what's at stake in these elections," Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said in an interview in free newspaper 20 Minutos on Saturday. Zapatero's remarks came in response to a statement from Spanish bishops this week which urged Spaniards to vote for parties that did not negotiate with violent Basque separatists ETA -- an apparent swipe at the Socialists who held failed peace talks with ETA in 2006. The bishops also slammed the legalisation of gay marriage and the reduced weight of religion in schools, all measures carried out by the ruling Socialists in its attempt to modernise Spain, which is nominally Catholic but more liberal socially. While the Socialists accused the Church of taking sides, Zapatero's reaction could boost his lead in opinion polls. The Church is widely associated with the conservative establishment for historical reasons -- it supported right-wing dictator Francisco Franco for most of his rule. With the March 9 elections looking like a close race and many centrist voters still undecided according to polls, the Church's statement and Zapatero's response could push more secular voters towards the Socialist camp. Many of Zapatero's social policies, such as legalising gay marriage, have also gained kudos with Spain's youngest non-church-going voters, while causing continual rows with the Church and the PP. The PP has remained silent about the bishops' remarks, although its members and traditional PP voters widely support the Church's views on the traditional family and ETA. "The bishops' attitude will open a debate on the possible revision of the relationship of the government with the church," Zapatero told a dinner on Friday, as reported in local media. But Zapatero said it would be wrong to break ties with the Church now as a reaction to the criticism.
