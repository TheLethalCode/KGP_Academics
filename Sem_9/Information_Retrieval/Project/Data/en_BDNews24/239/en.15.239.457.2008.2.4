 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Monday stayed former secretary Toufique Elahi Chowdhury's High Court bail order in the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust corruption case. Justice MA Matin, chamber judge for the Appellate Division, stayed Toufique's bail for a week following an appeal from the Anticorruption Commission. Appearing for the ACC, senior advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan told the court that if the bail was not stayed Toufique would be released. Rafiq-ul-Haque, the former secretary's counsel, argued that the HC had granted his client bail in consideration of his contribution to the country during the Liberation War, and should therefore be upheld. The HC granted Toufique bail on Feb 3. The ACC filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station against eight people, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Summit Group managing director Aziz Khan. The case alleges that the accused illegally received Tk 3 crore from Wartsila Power Development to purchase land for Bangabahdhu Memorial Trust in return for awarding the company with a contract to build three barge-mounted power plants. The case was included under the emergency power rules on Sept 20 last year, and Toufique surrendered to court and was sent to jail on Nov 16. bdnew
