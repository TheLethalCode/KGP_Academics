<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) - Sheikh Hasina's lawyers said Sunday the former prime minister was not getting proper medical treatment in special jail from specialist physicians. Allowed to meet with Hasina Sunday, advocate Yusuf Hossain Humayun said: "Sheikh Hasina has said that the jail authorities are not allowing her to get medical advice from any specialist physician." "Those who are providing her treatment are all junior doctors." However, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui denied the allegations. "Prisons doctor Suraiya Bulbul is treating Sheikh Hasina following the advice of the four specialist physicians of Hasina's choice," Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. "There is an arrangement of a round-the-clock physician for her. And everything is provided as per the Jail Code." Hasina's two personal lawyers Humayun and barrister Fazle Nur Taposh met her at the special jail for about one and a half hours, leaving around 5:30pm. Taposh told reporters: "Sheikh Hasina is suffering from eye and ear problems." Speaking in front of a police barricade on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, he said: "She is also suffering from high blood pressure. If such situation continues she might suffer more serious problems including kidney disease." The two lawyers demanded that the government and prisons authorities provided proper specialist treatment for Hasina. bdnews24.c
