 ANKARA, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of secular Turks rallied on Saturday against a plan by the government to allow women students to wear the Muslim headscarf at university, a move they say will usher in a stricter form of Islam in Turkey. Parliament is expected to approve a constitutional amendment next week sponsored by the ruling AK Party, which has Islamist roots, and a nationalist opposition party that is aimed at easing a 1989 headscarf ban for students in higher education. Secularists fear lifting the ban would, over time, lead to heavy pressure on uncovered women to wear the Muslim garment. "Turkey is secular and will remain secular," shouted protesters as they waved national flags and banners of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, revered founder of the republic which separated religion and state, at his mausoleum in the capital Ankara. Turkey's powerful secular establishment, which includes army generals, judges and university rectors, sees the headscarf as a symbol of radical Islam and believe it threatens the country's secular order. Turkey is 99 percent Muslim. As recently as 1997, Turkey's army generals, acting with public support, ousted a government they deemed too Islamist. Last year's secular rallies against the AK Party's choice of a former Islamist as president sparked an early parliamentary election. Opinion polls suggest a majority in the country of 70 million, where some two thirds of women cover their heads, back a relaxation of the headscarf ban. The headscarf debate is central to Turkey's complex identity, as the young democracy struggles to meet the demands of both a pious Muslim population and also a secular, pro-Western elite that sees Islam as backwards. Financial markets are nervously watching the debate. PERSONAL FREEDOMS? Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, which denies any Islamist agenda, has long wanted to lift the ban on the headscarf, saying the issue is a matter of religious and personal freedom, but has been wary not to irk the generals. The decision by the AK Party to push the reform reflects its confidence after it won a sweeping re-election last July. But pressure has intensified this week with university rectors warning that allowing female students to wear the Muslim headscarf at university would provoke campus chaos and street violence and end up destroying the secular state. Secularist professors have also threatened not to allow women into class if they wore the garment. "The headscarf is not about giving women more rights, it is about forcing women to wear an Islamic garment that makes clear that women are inferior to men. Keep the headscarf in private, not at university," said Ezgi Cakan, 22, graphic design student at Baskent University. "Turkey is a democracy, Ataturk made sure religion was out of public life and now the government wants to bring it back." The government wanted to expand freedoms to turn Turkey into a "first-class democracy where freedoms in all fields are enjoyed fully", Foreign Minister Ali Babacan told a news conference on Saturday before the rally. Turkey's judiciary and top businessmen have already criticised the headscarf plan and the main opposition party, the secularist CHP, which has close ties to the army, has said it will go to the Constitutional Court to block the reform.
