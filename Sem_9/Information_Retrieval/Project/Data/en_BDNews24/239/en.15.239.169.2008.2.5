<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to expunge Monday's deposition given by Azam J Chowdhury in the extortion case proceedings against Sheikh Hasina. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque denied the plea verbally at 11:40 am and adjourned the court for 15 minutes, retiring to his chamber to issue the ruling in writing. Earlier in court, the defense lawyers argued that Azam J Chowdhury's deposition had been completed on Jan 30, and that recording the plaintiff's deposition anew Monday was illegal. Any additional testimony by a witness can be recorded only after the cross-examination of the witness is over, not before, the lawyers said. They also pointed out that the government had skipped filing an appeal in writing for recording Azam's testimony afresh. The prosecution lawyers countered that recording of the witness's deposition had not been completed on Jan 30 and hence supplementing the testimony was warranted Monday. They argued that there is no legal provision to expunge what has been recorded already in the court and they should be able to proceed with the deposition taking with the court's permission. The judge at that point turned down the defense's plea to expunge Monday's deposition given anew by Azam, and adjourned the court for a quarter of an hour. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim were produced in court Tuesday morning as proceedings continued in the extortion case filed against them by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. Sheikh Hasina followed Sheikh Selim into the makeshift courtroom set up in the Sangsad Bhaban premises, both arriving by 9:30 am. Proceedings had been interrupted the previous day (Monday) when Special Judge Md Azizul Haque left the courtroom at around 10:00 am amid altercations between prosecution and defense lawyers. Defense lawyers had vehemently opposed the recording of a fresh deposition by plaintiff Azam J Chowdhury. bdnews24
