<TITLE> Tadic grabs narrow victory in Serb election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Belgrade, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's pro-Western President Boris Tadic narrowly won re-election on Sunday against nationalist challenger Tomislav Nikolic in a vote that will determine the country's future ties with the European Union. The election commission said it was a narrow victory for Tadic, with a projected 50.5 percent of the vote. Final results are expected in the early hours of the morning. The election was seen as a referendum on how Serbia should deal with the West after the imminent loss of the breakaway province of Kosovo. Tadic says European Union membership must remain Serbia's priority whatever happens. Nikolic advocates turning to Russia instead of the West. "We want to go to Europe. We want to cooperate with the world," Tadic told a victory rally in downtown Belgrade. "We want to say to the people of Kosovo that we'll never let them down. We need to work together to fulfil Serbia's potential." Nikolic conceded defeat despite the narrow margin and offered Tadic his congratulations. "I would like to thank all those who voted for me, who understood how much Serbia needed a change," he said. "This result gives us a reason to be optimistic." Monitors put turnout at about 67 percent, compared with 61 percent in the first round two weeks ago. This would be the highest turnout since the 2000 election that ousted Slobodan Milosevic after more than a decade in power. Political analysts had said only a strong turnout could counter the dedicated voters of Nikolic, who beat Tadic by 40 percent to 35.4 percent on Jan 20. Both oppose Kosovo's independence drive. Nikolic wants Serbia to turn to Russia to punish the West for backing Kosovo's majority Albanians. Tadic is asking Serbs to swallow their pride and pursue EU membership. EU president Slovenia -- like Serbia once part of the former Yugoslavia -- congratulated Tadic on his re-election and welcomed "the fact that the Serbian people seem to have confirmed their support to the democratic and European course of their country". It did not comment on the narrow margin. ALL EYES ON KOSOVO Kosovo's 90-percent Albanian majority was looking to set a date for a declaration of independence after Sunday's result. Political sources say that with Tadic the winner, they will wait a few weeks in line with EU wishes. If Nikolic had won, a declaration could have been made as early as next weekend. The province, Serbia's medieval heartland, has been run by the United Nations since NATO drove out Serb forces in 1999 to halt ethnic cleansing during a counter-insurgency war. A Nikolic victory could have ended the fragile coalition of Tadic and nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, but the incumbent's narrow win was no guarantee of stability either. Kostunica has made the defence of Serb sovereignty over Kosovo the keystone of his policy. He has attacked an EU plan to send an 1,800-strong mission to supervise the transition to U.N. rule as a prelude to recognising the new state. This week he said he could not support Tadic's re-election bid because his coalition ally had refused to commit himself to pledging that Serbia would refuse a deal with the EU if the bloc went ahead and supported Kosovo's independence. Analysts said the EU mission could be Kostunica's red line, possibly leading to new elections. "Unless Kostunica backs off, or the EU gives up on the mission, this could become the reason for the coalition's fall," said political analyst Djordje Vukadinovic. Neither the EU nor the United States has shown any sign of backing down over Kosovo's independence, despite warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he will never accept it.
