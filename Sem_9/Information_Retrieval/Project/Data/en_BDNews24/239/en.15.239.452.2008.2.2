 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)Members of the European Parliament have expressed "deepest" concern over the recent political developments in Bangladesh. In a recent joint statement, they said: "The caretaker government of Bangladesh has declared to have taken several measures to fight corruption, restore law and order, and reform institutions." The statement said the members came from different states and political groups. "We have learned that the human rights situation in Bangladesh is deteriorating day by day. We believe that the government can make progress through negotiations and dialogue with all the political actors." The statement expressed concern over reports on alleged repression and detention of political leaders under emergency rule. "Furthermore, we are faced with alarming reports on the physical conditions of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in jail for several months now, even though she is advised by specialists to get medical treatment abroad." "We therefore emphasise the need for additional measures to address shortcomings in the implementation of justice." "We urge the caretaker government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency, which was declared on January 11th, 2007, to help create the ground for elections, and to announce an election date as soon as possible." As members of the European Parliament, they said, they were ready to support further cooperation with Bangladesh as a long lasting development partner if the government restores civil and political liberties. bd
