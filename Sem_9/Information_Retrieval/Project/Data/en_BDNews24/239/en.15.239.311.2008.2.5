 KIEV, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko was forced to postpone his annual state of the nation speech on Tuesday when opposition members protesting against his plans to seek NATO membership blocked proceedings in parliament. Yushchenko and other leaders associated with the 2004 pro-Western "Orange Revolution" have asked NATO to grant the ex-Soviet state a "Membership Action Plan" -- the first stage of a long-term scheme to join the alliance. But after decades of Soviet-era anti-NATO propaganda, public opinion remains broadly opposed to membership, particularly in Russian-speaking eastern and southern Ukraine. It was the second major disruption over NATO in the parliament in less than two weeks by the opposition, led by the president's rival, former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. Opposition deputies swarmed round the speaker's rostrum after hanging up posters reading "NATO will not pass". Speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced the speech had been removed from the agenda. The president's press secretary said another day would be set for the address outlining strategic objectives for the year. With deputies milling about the chamber and work at a standstill, Yatsenyuk called for a consensus on an agenda. "If we do not reach an agreement, we will turn parliament not into a circus, but rather into a boxing ring. And we certainly do not want that," Yatsenyuk said. Debate later proceeded to set an agenda for the session. Yushchenko flew to Geneva to sign documents to give Ukraine the go-ahead to join the World Trade Organisation, a first step in his primary aim of moving Ukraine closer to the West. The president sees future NATO and European Union membership as cornerstones of his pro-Western policies. NATO and Ukraine have held various joint programmes since the mid-1990s. Opposition politicians say a letter sent last month by Yushchenko, Yatsenyuk and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko asking to start the membership process disregarded public opinion. The president and his allies say any decision on joining NATO would be put to a national referendum and have called for a campaign to explain the role of the alliance. Recent polls show about 60 percent of respondents are opposed to membership. Most issues in Ukraine split opinion between the national west and centre backing closer ties with the West, and the Russian-speaking, industrial east, more sympathetic to Russia. Russia, long opposed to NATO's eastward expansion, says Ukrainian membership would force it to take "appropriate" measures. Yushchenko has said he will take no action to upset Kiev's important relationship with its giant neighbo
