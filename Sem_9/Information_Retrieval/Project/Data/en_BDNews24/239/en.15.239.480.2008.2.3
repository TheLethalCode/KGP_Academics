 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Teachers and students of mass communication and journalism department of Dhaka University Sunday held a meeting to protest Saturday's bomb attack at the home of Professor Arefin Siddique, a department teacher. "Why attack the teachers time and again?" read the banner carried by the teachers assembled at the foot of Aparajeyo Bangla at noon to protest the attack. Students carried placards too which read, "Why Prof Arefin has been attacked? Will the administration please explain?", "We want security of all teachers and students" and "We demand justice." Dr Abdus Salaam, chairman of the department present in the meeting, said, "Unidentified miscreants have launched attacks on Prof Arefin on six occasions so far. We protest such heinous incidents and request the government to find the villains and punish them." "We have already lost about half an year because of the 2007 disturbances at the university. Hence the request to ensure the safety and security of the teacher-student communities," said Salaam. After the meeting was over, students formed a human chain starting at Arts Building up to the Central Library under the banner of Bangladesh Chhatra League. Unknown miscreants exploded a homemade bomb Saturday evening in the porch of the Green Road home of Prof Arefin, a former president of Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA). "Unidentified persons threw two cocktails into the porch at 7:25pm. One cocktail exploded with a bang while the other is lying there unexploded. However, none has been injured," Prof Arefin told bdnews24.com after the incident. bdnews24.co
