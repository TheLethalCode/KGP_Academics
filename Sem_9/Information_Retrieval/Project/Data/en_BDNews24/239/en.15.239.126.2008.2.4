<TITLE> Judge suspends Hasina trial amid chaos </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) -- The judge who presided over an extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina left the courtroom Monday morning after defence and prosecution lawyers ended up in a brawl. Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim were taken to the makeshift court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises at 9:45am, in connection with the case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. Amid altercations between the lawyers for the plaintiff and the accused over depositions, judge Md Azizul Haque left the courtroom around 10:00am. The chaos stemmed from a move to rerecord the deposition of plaintiff Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, which the defence lawyers opposed. Kamrul Islam, a defence lawyer, said: "Honourable court, you had asked us to quiz the plaintiff after taking his deposition. But you are now saying that the plaintiff's testimony will be rerecorded." The lawyer accused the judge of issuing a "biased order". "This is not fair." As Azam continued to speak, the judge walked out on the trial of Hasina without saying a word. In his Jan 30 deposition in court, Azam said that Sheikh Selim was the only one he could recognise and that the other accused were not known to him in connection with the case. Earlier on Jan 24, Azam said in a press briefing that he had not filed any case against Sheikh Hasina. "I had sued only Sheikh Selim." bdnew
