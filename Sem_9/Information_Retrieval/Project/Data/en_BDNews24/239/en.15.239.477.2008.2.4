<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Switzerland-based ICB Financial Group has made the highest bid to buy troubled Oriental Bank, a central bank official said Monday. Local company Domestic Investors Consortium Bangladesh is also interested to buy the bank but its offer is much lower than the ICB's, said Bangladesh Bank's deputy governor Murshid Kuli Khan. ICB offered Tk 350.67 crore for a 50.1 percent stake in the bank, while the Bangladeshi company was ready to pay Tk 251 crore, Khan said. Bangladesh Bank is likely to approve the highest bid on Feb 11 while a final announcement will come on Feb 14. "The deal will be signed on Feb 28," Khan told reporters in a press briefing after opening the bidding box. On Sept 23, six companies had showed interest to buy the bank but only two of them took part in the bidding. Local market players BRAC Bank and Summit Industrial & Mercantile Corporation were among the four other candidates. The UK-based East Investment Private Equity and Sri Lanka's Hatton National Bank were the other contenders. On June 19 last year, the central bank took over Oriental Bank to protect depositors' interest in the wake of the bank's several financial irregularities and mismanagement. A central bank official was appointed as the bank's administrator to conduct emergency operations. The central bank removed Oriental's managing director and suspended the board of directors' activities on Aug 6, 2006. After intensive investigations, the bank's shares of its sponsors Obaidul Karim and Abul Khair Litu were confiscated as per the Banking Companies Law. They were found responsible for pervasive irregularities. Later the central bank took a scheme to rebuild the bank, which increased its paid-up and approved capital. On Aug 2, 2007, the BB invited 'Expression of Interest' for Oriental's 50.1 percent stake with a minimum target price of Tk 350 crore. On Dec 12, 2007, the regulator floated tenders for a new management for Oriental, which was originally Al Baraka Bank when it started operations on May 20, 1987. bdnews24.c
