 Tokyo, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There has been no progress in a search for a Japanese man who has gone missing while trying to cross the Pacific Ocean alone in a hot air balloon, his support group said on Sunday. Michio Kanda, 58, left eastern Japan on Thursday, aiming to reach Portland, Oregon in 60 hours. But satellite phone contact with Kanda, a balloonist with 30 years experience, was lost early Friday morning, shortly after he crossed the international dateline. "So far, there's been no progress," Kaoru Kamishima, a support group member, said by telephone. "He would have run out of fuel by now, so we are assuming he's had to make an emergency landing somewhere." Kanda was carrying an emergency locator transmitter, but the group had received no signals from the device, which can only be switched on manually, Kamishima said. The group has contacted over 20 authorities in Japan, the United States and Canada, and the U.S. Coast Guard has said a rescue plane was searching around Kanda's last known position, while a patrol boat was also being sent to the area. In his last call with the support group, Kanda said that it was raining a little but that "things were going well". Kanda was aiming to become the first Japanese balloonist to cross the Pacific Ocean alone. His balloon, measuring 50 metres (yards) high and 40 metres wide, is designed to carry around 100 people. Kanda tried to make the same voyage in 2004 but failed after bad weather and a fuel shortage forced him to ditch in the sea.
