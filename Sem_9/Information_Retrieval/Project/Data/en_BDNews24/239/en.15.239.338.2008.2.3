 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Sunday deferred to Feb 13 the hearing on a government appeal over the detentions BNP leaders Tarique Rahman and ASM Hannan Shah. Chamber judge Justice MA Matin passed the ruling after hearing the government appeal seeking a halt to the High Court order that declared the detentions illegal. Additional attorney general Hasan Foyez Siddiqui represented the government in the court. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq, who defended Hannan Shah, said the High Court had earlier granted bail to his client in the case under emergency powers rules. The Appellate Division also upheld the bail, he added. Barrister Huq said Khaleda Zia's political adviser Hannan Shah's detention order had been given to obstruct his release from jail. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan and Advocate AHM Mizanur Rahman assisted Rafique-ul Huq in the hearing. Senior advocate Mahbubuddin Ahmad stood for BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman. The High Court on Jan 30 declared the orders of detention against Tarique and Hannan illegal. It also asked the government to free them immediately if there were no other cases against them. Tarique's lawyer said his client would not get released immediately as there were six others cases in which he had not been granted bail. But there was no obstacle to Hannan's release as there was no other case against him, his lawyer said. Joint forces arrested Tarique on March 7 last year. On April 13, authorities ordered his detention under the Special Powers Act. On Dec 2, Tarique filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging validity of the detention order. Hannan was arrested on Nov 7 and received detention order on Nov 25. He also challenged its legality in a writ petition with the HC on Dec 2, 2007. bdnews24
