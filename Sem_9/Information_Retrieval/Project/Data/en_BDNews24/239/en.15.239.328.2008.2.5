<TEXT>
 PARIS, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters - A French court ordered budget airline Ryanair to pay damages to President Nicolas Sarkozy and his new wife Carla Bruni for using a picture of the couple in an advertisement but the sum was less than Bruni had sought. The court on Tuesday ordered Ryanair to pay Sarkozy symbolic damages of one euro and 60,000 euros to Bruni, a former fashion model, who had been seeking damages of 500,000 euros. Sarkozy and Bruni sued Ryanair over an advertisement for cut price tickets in Le Parisien newspaper last week, featuring a photo of the smiling pair. The advertisement shows a cartoon bubble above Bruni, the scion of a rich Italian industrial dynasty, reading: "With Ryanair, my whole family can come to my wedding."
