<TEXT>
 N'DJAMENA, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chad's army fought rebel forces northeast of the capital N'Djamena on Friday to try to halt a rapid rebel advance on the city. The deployment of the first European Union peacekeepers was delayed due to "increased instability" in the country, a spokesman for the EU force said. As one rebel leader called on President Idriss Deby to negotiate an immediate power-sharing deal, there were conflicting reports about the exact location of the fighting. "We've been in combat this morning with the rebels at Massakory, 150 km (95 miles) northeast of N'Djamena," one senior army officer told Reuters. In a separate statement on a Chadian opposition Web site, the rebels said they had taken Massaguet, just 78 km (49 miles) by main road from the capital, but there was no independent confirmation of the rebels' exact positions. The EU spokesman said the situation would be monitored "hour by hour" to work out when to deploy. "At the moment we don't want to blow this out of proportion, but yes a flight of Irish troops yesterday and two flights today have been postponed as a consequence of the increased instability in Chad," the spokesman said in Brussels. In the dusty capital on the banks of the Chari river, residents stayed at home or ventured out to try to stock up on food. Most employees stayed at home and residents said streets were virtually deserted apart from reinforced military checkpoints and patrols. Helicopters clattered overhead. The army deployed to defend the capital, in western Chad, on Thursday after a rebel column of 300 vehicles raced across the landlocked African country after advancing from the eastern border with Sudan's conflict-torn Darfur region. Chadian officials accuse Sudan of arming and backing the latest attacking force of several united rebel groups, which have fought a hit-and-run guerrilla war for years against Deby, who himself seized power in a revolt from the east in 1990. The rebels appeared to be trying to seek a quick military victory before the EU troop deployment. After advancing to within some 250 km (150 miles) east of N'Djamena on Thursday, rebel leader Timane Erdimi told Radio France International on Friday the rebel forces had split up and taken up positions around the capital. "Even if we're at the gates of the palace, we're ready to negotiate a real sharing of power," Erdimi said. "If not, well, we'll be forced to launch hostilities to chase M. Deby from power. It's simple," he added. "It's up to Mr. Deby to choose between peace and war." There was no immediate response from Deby. Government military sources said an army cordon was in place around the city, which was last directly attacked by the rebels in April 2006, when several hundred people were killed. The presidential palace in N'Djamena was heavily guarded by soldiers, residents said. Mobile phone networks had been cut off and residents were sending information by e-mail. Foreign embassies in the Chadian capital were advising their nationals to stay at home and avoid travel. Up to 3,700 European Union peacekeepers, around half from France, are due to deploy in Chad's turbulent east in the coming weeks to protect hundreds of thousands of refugees from violence spilling from Sudan's Darfur. Chad and Sudan accuse each other of supporting rebel groups in their respective territories, though each denies the charge. Chadian rebels have previously threatened to attack the European force if it interferes in their campaign against Deby, although European commanders have pledged not to take sides. Several of Chad's main eastern rebel groups abandoned a Libyan-brokered ceasefire late last year, triggering pitched battles in November and December that both rebel and government sides said killed hundreds of fighte
