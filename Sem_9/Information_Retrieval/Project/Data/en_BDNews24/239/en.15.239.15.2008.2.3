<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government is hoping to import gas from Myanmar to supplement the shortfall in domestic production, said a government official Sunday. "We are trying to find ways to overcome the gas crisis by 2009," said M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources. "This is a very critical issue," he said. Tamim added new gas fields would have to be exploited at home if gas is not imported from abroad. He said that Bangladesh's daily demand for gas stands at 1,833 million cubic feet, while production currently provides only 1,738 million cubic feet. The special assistant said new pipelines are being installed which would allow gas to be imported from neighbouring Myanmar. bdnews
