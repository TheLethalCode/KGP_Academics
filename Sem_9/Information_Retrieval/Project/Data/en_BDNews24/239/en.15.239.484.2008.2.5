 BELGRADE, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's prime minister on Tuesday denounced plans to sign an accord with the European Union as a trick to lure it into rubber-stamping an independent Kosovo, piling pressure on a creaking ruling coalition. The statement by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica exposed a deep rift with pro-Western President Boris Tadic over Serbia's EU accession drive and could threaten plans to sign a deal that would put Serbia on the road to membership. Tadic won re-election on Sunday on a pledge of pursuing EU membership no matter what happens with Serbia's breakaway province where the 90-percent Albanian majority is poised to declare independence this month, with the West's backing. The EU, which on Monday formally authorised a major supervisory mission to Kosovo ahead of its independence declaration, had hoped to sign an accord with Serbia focusing on trade, visa and education issues on Feb 7. "The EU's proposal to sign a political agreement with Serbia while at the same time sending a mission to break apart our state is a deception aimed at getting Serbia effectively to sign its agreement to Kosovo independence," Kostunica said. By putting its signature to the agreement, Serbia would "thus become the first state to indirectly recognise an independent Kosovo," he added. Serbian media said the clear splits in the coalition would be difficult to heal. "The political agreement offered by the EU will be a test for the government's stability," Serbia's respected daily Politika said in a Tuesday editorial. It quoted government sources as saying Kostunica's party could maybe be outvoted in the cabinet by Tadic's party and its allies, but if that was the case, the 9-month old coalition would not last and "general elections would be held soon". The unease was underlined in the fledgling stockmarket, with the main index down some four percent. BRUSSELS "MUST CHOOSE" Kostunica said Brussels would have to choose between ties with Serbia and support for Kosovo's Albanian majority. "This decision to send a mission means that the EU, together with the Albanian separatists, is creating a fictitious Albanian state on Serbian territory," Kostunica added. "Parliament must convene immediately." Kosovo has been ruled by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO forces pushed out Serb troops accused of killing civilians while fighting a brutal counter-insurgency war. Serbia, which sees the province as its heartland, rejects a breakaway. Tadic's Democratic Party and its technocrat sidekick G17+ have made it clear they are not prepared to back down on the EU after months of being pushed by Kostunica into making Kosovo the main issue. "After the referendum confirmation of our country's European orientation, not a single party or politician can prevent what our citizens want and that is that we sign this agreement and join the EU as soon as possible," said deputy PM Bozidar Djelic, referring to Tadic's victory. Mladjan Dinkic, the Economy Minister and leader of G17+ said "there could not, and would not, be any compromise on Serbia's European futur
