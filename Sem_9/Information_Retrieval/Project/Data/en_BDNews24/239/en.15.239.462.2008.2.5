 PARIS, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks slipped in early trade on Tuesday, ending a three-day winning streak as miners surrendered some recent gains on mixed metal prices while banking shares fell, tracking a drop by US peers overnight. But the fall was cushioned by rising energy shares, led by BP as news of a more generous dividend policy by the oil firm eclipsed weak quarterly results. BP gained 2.6 percent, Total rose 1.3 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 1.9 percent. At 0958 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent at 1,347.35 points. The index has lost about 10 percent so far in 2008. In the mining sector, Anglo American fell 2.3 percent, Rio Tinto shed 1.8 percent, and Xstrata lost 1.4 percent. The DJ Stoxx basic resources index has lost 3.4 percent since the start of the year, the best relative performance among European sectors. Shanghai copper prices were up in anticipation of healthy demand after the Chinese New Year holidays, while zinc and aluminium dropped as investors took profit following recent gains. Gold prices were also on the downside in London, falling more than 1 percent on profit-taking after hitting a record high on Friday. Among the banks, UBS dropped 2.3 percent and Credit Suisse lost 2.4 percent. Both Citigroup and JP Morgan cut their share price targets on the two Swiss banks. "The sharp swings on shares of financial institutions is a sign that uncertainty is still really high. People use every bit of news to buy or sell. But the subprime crisis is far from over and I don't see how the market could rally," Jean-Francois Virolle, chief strategist at Global Equities, in Paris. "People are waiting to see what the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will do and say later this week." Interest rate decisions by both central banks are expected on Thursday. The drop in the European banking sector followed a similar decline among U.S. banks on Monday, falling after brokerage downgrades on signs consumers are falling behind on debt payments. WEAK PMI IN EUROPE Adding to the gloom on Wall Street, data showed new orders at US factories rose at a slower-than-expected 2.3 percent rate last month. After stripping out the transportation sector, the gain was a modest 0.7 percent, fuelling worries over the prospect of a US recession. Weak data also dampened the mood in Europe on Tuesday. Euro zone services sector growth slowed much more than expected to a four-and-a-half year low in January although growth in prices charged barely slipped, a key survey showed on Tuesday. Spain's service sector shrank at its sharpest ever rate as evidence grew that the economy is slowing more than anticipated. "The sky is tumbling in on the Spanish services sector," Bear Stearns analysts wrote in a note. "If the ECB are listening to problems in Southern Europe they should be racing to the tape to cut rates. With Italy heading for recession this year, Spain's economy in trouble and growth prospects slowing sharply in Portugal, the ECB should be tipping the policy pendulum to easier rates a lot sooner than expected," they wrote. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.7 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.7 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.7 percent. Corporate Express jumped 27 percent after Dutch newspaper Telegraaf reported that the Dutch office goods supplier was in early talks to be bought by US rival Staples. Heidelberg tumbled 9 percent after the world's biggest maker of printing machines lowered its outlook and reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnin
