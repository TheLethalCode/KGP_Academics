 CANBERRA, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While the US economy teeters on the brink of a recession sending a chill around the globe, Australia keeps powering ahead, underlining its economy's new focus on China and India and away from the United States. On Tuesday Australia's central bank highlighted the contrast between the global gloom and the domestic economy's robust health by lifting interest rates to a 11-year high only days after the Federal Reserve slashed its rates to avert a sharp downturn. Over the past 10 years, China's booming economy has seen Australia break from its traditional economic reliance on the US and Japan, helping to shield Australia from any global slowdown. "Until a decade ago, the Australian and US economies were blood brothers. They went, we followed," said economist Chris Richardson from Access Economics. "That is no longer true." The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted official interest rates by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent to curb inflation in an economy which is running at full capacity: with unemployment at 30-year lows, strong consumer spending and booming house prices. Economists believe at least one more hike may be needed to cool demand and price pressures. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve has cut its interest rates by 1.25 percentage points over the past two weeks trying to head off a recession in an economy hit by a housing slump and a credit crunch caused by defaults on risky mortgage loans. There are expectations for a rate cut in Britain this week, while the outlook for economic growth in Europe is also easing, suggesting the US slowdown is starting to dent global growth. HEALTHY CHINA, HEALTHY AUSTRALIA Much of Australia's post World War Two growth was based on growing exports to Japan and the United States, but China is on the brink of replacing Japan as Australia's top trading partner. Latest figures show two-way trade between Australia and Japan to be worth just over A$50 billion ($45 billion) in 2006-07, with exports to Japan, led by coal, iron ore, beef and aluminium, growing by about 5 percent on the previous year. At the same time, two-way trade between Australia and China was worth A$49.94 billion, with exports to China accounting for about 14 percent of Australian exports and with staggering export growth of about 26 percent compared to the previous year. The United States remains Australia's third-largest trading partner, but accounts for only about A$10 billion worth of Australian exports, or 5.8 percent, with exports growing only 0.2 percent in 2006-07 despite a free trade agreement between the two countries. Highlighting the importance of China to Australia, China's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi was in Canberra for bilateral talks as interest rates went up, and he pointed to further growth in mutual trade and investment. "The two economies are really cut out for each other. We can try to benefit from each other's strong points," Yang told reporters. Access Economics' Richardson said the rate rise was a reminder that while Australia's financial markets were driven by the United States, the economy was being driven by China. "As long as China is healthy, so is Australia," he said, adding Australia was well placed to ride through any global downturn. "There are risks for China, but 2009 is the earliest I would really worry about China. And the same is true for Australia," he said. "In both places there is an enormous pipeline of work still to be done. ($1=A$1.
