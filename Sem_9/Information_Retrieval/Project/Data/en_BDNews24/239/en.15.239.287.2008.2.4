<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited and Badda Jagaroni Chakra Monday moved into the semifinals of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament beating their rivals at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The sky blue outfit, Abahani, handed a 2-0 defeat to Muktijoddha Sangsad in their must-win match after Badda stepped into the knock-out stage inflicting a 4-1 defeat to Dhaka Wanderers Club in the day's first match. After becoming the first team to reach the last fours, Badda made Abahani's semifinal path difficult and threw them into a must-win situation against Muktijoddha Sangsad, who needed just one point for the semifinal berth. Had Badda and Wanderers played a goalless draw, Abahani would have needed a draw against Muktijoddha and be thrown to the semifinals by virtue of goal difference against Badda, who upset Abahani 1-0 in the tournament opener. However, Badda with six points emerged Group B champions by virtue of goal difference, forcing Abahani to follow them from the same group. Both Abahani and Muktijoddha looked nervous in the first half with displaying rough play and referee Ram Krishna warned four players in first 25 minutes. Muktijoddha made the first move in the 26th minute, but an Alfaz Ahmed shot went outside kissing the Abahani cross-bar while the sky blue outfit took a lead in the 44th minute. Jahid Hossain found the back of the opponent net with a left footer after his fellow striker Mehdi Hasan Ujjal failed to break the Muktijoddha defence marshalled by Rajani Kanta Barman, Hasan Al Mamun, Din Mohammad and Parvez Babu. After the breather, Muktijoddha came close to an equaliser in the 49th minute, but Abahani keeper Biplob Bhattacharya frustrated Parvez Babu fisting his close range short for a corner. Muktis Alfaz narrowly missed the target in the 72nd minute while Jahid Hasan Emili sealed the match five minutes later with heading a Jahid cross home. In the first match, Mintu struck two goals while Nasir and Rana netted one goal apiece for Badda Jagaroni. Ashraful Alam scored the lone goal for Wanderers Club.
