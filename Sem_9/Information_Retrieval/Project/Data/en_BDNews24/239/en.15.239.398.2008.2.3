<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)The High Court ordered the Anticorruption Commission Sunday to explain why the case against former public works minister Mosharraf Hossain was not illegal. The court also asked the ACC to explain why its notice asking Mosharraf to submit a wealth statement should not be regarded unlawful. The bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam gave the ACC four weeks to reply, upon a writ petition filed by the detained Awami League leader Mosharraf. The anti-graft watchdog issued a notice on Feb 2, 2007, asking Mosharraf to submit his wealth statement. Law enforcers arrested him on Feb 25, as he left the ACC offices after submitting his wealth statement. On Nov 25, ACC assistant director Jahangir Alam filed a case with Ramna police against Mosharraf on charges of concealing wealth of over Tk 3 crore. Barristers Shafiq Ahmed and Sheikh Hassan Arif moved the writ petition on behalf of Mosharraf. bdnews
