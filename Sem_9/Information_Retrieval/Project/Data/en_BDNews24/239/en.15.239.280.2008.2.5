<TITLE> Govt to allot cancelled plots afresh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 05 (bdnews24.com)  The government will reallocate 897 RAJUK residential plots which were allotted by the last BNP-led administration. The move comes following the discovery of irregularities in the RAJUK plot allotment process, housing and public works adviser Ghulam Quader said Tuesday at a meeting with RAJUK officials. After sifting through and checking the related documents, 300 plots are to be reassigned to those whose papers are in order. The remaining plots will subsequently be duly allotted, the adviser told reporters after the meeting. Quader said the irregularities were unearthed when taskforce officials investigated the allotment process. Asked if nepotism was behind the questionable allocations, the adviser said: "I can't say that, but I can say that not everything was done according to the rules." The adviser said a decision is yet to be made regarding the cancellation of NAM apartments allotted to former members of parliament. "A decision in this matter will have to be taken soon. As the former lawmakers are no longer serving MPs, they either have to vacate their residences or pay rent as tenants," Quader said. Government owned properties in Dhaka which were unoccupied have been reclaimed; the sites will be redeveloped with high-rise buildings to ease the accommodation crisis faced by government officials, the adviser said. bdnews24
