 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-19 team Saturday suffered a 73-run defeat against the touring West Indies counterparts in the second build-up match ahead of this month's ICC Twenty20 U/19 World Cup in Malaysia. The hosts were bundled out for 112 in 36 overs, chasing West Indies total of 185 all out in 42 overs at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium in Fatullah. West Indies fell in trouble in the curtailed 43-over-a-side affair as pacer Dollar Mahmud struck double blows to reduce the visitors to seven for two in 2.5 overs. But, the hosts failed to keep the momentum as West Indies opener Miller top-scored with 66 followed by Baravo on 26 and Brooks on 22. Dollar returned four for 26 while Nasir Hossain took two for 20. Bangladesh, in reply, never recovered the damage after losing five wickets for 36, and eventually ended up their innings with 112 in 32nd over. Middle order Mahmudul Hasan made the highest 30 while M Shakil scored 21 not out. Pacer Dawes wrecked the top order with four for 25 while Brooks and Jacobs cleaned up the middle and late orders taking three wickets each for nine and 28 respectively.
