<TITLE> Doha deal would give world economy a boost: USTR </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A breakthrough soon in world trade talks would give the global economy a much-needed boost at a time when many are worried about a possible downturn, top US and Australian trade officials said on Friday. A deal "would be a show of confidence in the global economy and investing in economic growth and development," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab told reporters after meeting with her Australian counterpart. The actual benefits of a trade deal that cuts farm subsidies and opens markets around the world to more trade in agriculture, manufacturing and services would take years to fully materialize. "But there's also near-term benefit, which is as much psychological as it is commercial and economic," Schwab said. Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean said countries were closely watching efforts in Congress, and by the Federal Reserve, to bolster the U.S. economy. The United States for years has been world's leading engine of economic growth, and a prolonged slowdown here could hurt other countries by reducing U.S. demand for imported goods. "I think one of the ways we could stem the threat of the downturn here is to liberalize the trade" by completing the six-year-old round of world talks, Crean said. Both Schwab and Crean said they believed a long-awaited breakthrough was within reach if countries are willing to negotiate on the basis of revised texts in the agriculture and manufactured goods talks due out soon. "I think it's fair to say we're trying to get a commitment (on key details in the agriculture and manufactured goods negotiations) by Easter and then move forward from there," Crean said, referring to the Christian holiday next month. Schwab gave a less precise time frame, but noted that once a breakthrough is reached it would take another six to eight months for countries to finalize individual commitments for opening markets in agriculture, manufacturing and services. That suggests the earliest a final deal could be reached is shortly before the U.S. presidential election in November.
