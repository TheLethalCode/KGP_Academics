<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Muktijoddha Sangsad almost became a certainty Saturday for the semifinals of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament with a 2-1 win over Badda Jagaroni Chakra at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Muktijoddha need just a draw against Abahani in their last group match on Feb 4 to romp to the knockout stage. Veterans Alfaz Ahmed and Hasan Al Mamun struck one goal apiece for the freedom fighters' team while Rana reduced the margin for Badda Jagaroni. Muktijoddha looked hungrier, more organised in their second match to keep the giant-killers Badda, who upset Abahani Limited 1-0 in the opener, at bay. Having been held to a goalless draw by Dhaka Wanderers in the first match, Muktijoddha kept Badda under pressure from the beginning. Three matches in four days appeared to have taken a toll on Badda who had tired legs. Play was mostly confined to the midfield in the first half amid a low turnout of spectators at the big bowl and the two goals came from three chances. Badda, however, made the first move when winger Nasir was set by Kamol but he missed from a close range in the 21st minute. Marksman Alfaz gave Muktijoddha the lead in the 28th minute when he placed the ball at the top of the box. Four minutes later, defender Mamun doubled the margin from a rebound. The national team's captain did not hesitate to take a powerful shot inside the box when Arman Mia's shot came in his way after hitting a fellow Badda defender. After the breather, Badda re-grouped and kept the Muktijoddha defence marshalled by Rajani Kanta Barman, Din Mohammad, Hasan Al Mamun (Firoz Mahmud Titu) and Parvez Babu busy. Muktijoddha goalkeeper Aminul Haq thwarted an Imon Babu effort to a corner in the 64th minute. Badda intensified pressure with Rashed and Milon rattling the woodwork in the 85th and the 89th minute. They finally pulled one back in the stoppage time when Rana headed a Milon cross home giving Aminul no chance. bd
