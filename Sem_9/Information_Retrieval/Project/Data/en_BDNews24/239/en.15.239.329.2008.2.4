<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Herschelle Gibbs struck an imperious century to spur South Africa to an eight-wicket win over West Indies on Sunday and a clean sweep in the five-match series. After play was stopped twice by rain, South Africa were set a revised target of 211 in 31 overs in reply to West Indies 295 for seven and Gibbs blazed 102 off 84 balls, with 13 fours and three sixes. South Africa lost an early wicket before the first rain interruption when captain Graeme Smith was bowled by Daren Powell for five. A 65-minute delay occured when they were 19 for one and, after they had advanced the score to 34 for one, there was another interruption of 70 minutes. Play resumed with South Africa needing another 177 runs in 23 overs but Gibbs and Jacques Kallis made light of the challenge. In the first five overs after the second rain delay they lashed 66 runs. Kallis finished with 74 not out, facing 70 balls and hitting seven fours. Gibbs fell with 26 more runs required, allowing Shaun Pollock, who is retiring from international cricket, a fitting send-off. He hit the winning runs for the second match in succession and finished on 10 not out. Powell was the only West Indian bowler to emerge with some credit, taking two for 39 in seven overs. Devon Smith's career-best score had earlier inspired the West Indies to a reasonable total. Opener Smith lashed 10 fours and three sixes in his 91 off 76 balls, while Patrick Browne made a bright 49 not out and Shivnarine Chanderpaul a more sedate 51. Pollock stood out amongst a South African attack that was mostly expensive, taking one for 33 in 10 overs to finish his one-day career with 393 wickets in 303 matches with an economy rate of 3.67 runs per over. Pollock struck the first blow when he had Brenton Parchment (2) caught at a short backward point but Smith hammered the rest of the attack in his second half-century in 25 matches, improving on the 61 he scored against England in Bridgetown in 2006/07. Pollock's first spell of seven overs cost 14 runs while 66 runs were pummelled at the other end. The West Indies were in control and Smith and Chanderpaul put on a run-a-ball second-wicket stand of 137 before Charl Langeveldt struck two blows in successive overs, having Smith caught behind by Mark Boucher and trapping Chanderpaul leg-before. Dwayne Bravo, with 40 off 34 balls and then Browne and Rawl Lewis (28 not out) in an unbeaten eighth-wicket stand of 54 off 33 balls, hit out enthusiastically in the closing overs. Langeveldt was the other successful South African bowler with three for 61 in 10 over
