 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)Film actor Manwar Hossain Dipjal's wife Romana Manwar was sentenced to eight years in jail Monday in a tax-dodge case. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Judge's Court-2, sited on the Jatiya Sangsad complex, delivered the verdict. The court also fined Romana Tk 20 lakh and ordered a further six months in jail in case of failure to pay the money. Both Romana and Dipjal are on the run. The judge asked the related authorities to confiscate the money Romana evaded tax on. Ayesha Siddiqui, deputy tax commissioner of the National Board of Revenue, filed the case against her on Dec 30 for dodging Tk 18.8 lakh in tax. Charges were framed in the case on Jan 15. On Nov 29, the same court sentenced Dipjal to eight years in jail in a separate tax-doge case. Dipjal and Romana had earlier been sentenced to seven years in jail in an arms case. On July 26, Dipjal was jailed for 17 years for possessing arms. bdnew
