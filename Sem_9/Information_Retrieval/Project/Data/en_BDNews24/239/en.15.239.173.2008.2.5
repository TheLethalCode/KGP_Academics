<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) - The defence decided Tuesday to appeal for a transfer of the trial of the extortion case filed against Sheikh Hasina by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury to another court. Updates with changes "As our appeal to expunge the plaintiff's testimony was turned down, the defence is doubtful about getting justice in the lower court," defence lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman said. "We decided to file an appeal to get the case transferred to another court and submitted the application notifying our intention." The defence requested the court to adjourn proceedings for two weeks to allow them time to file the appeal. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque, however, adjourned proceedings until Feb 11 and asked the defence to submit a copy of the appeal that would be filed with the High Court. Earlier Tuesday, the court turned down a request by defence lawyers to expunge Monday's deposition given by plaintiff Chowdhury against the former prime minister. The defence argued that Chowdhury's deposition had been completed on Jan 30 and that recording the plaintiff's deposition afresh Monday was illegal. They also pointed out that the government had skipped filing an appeal in writing for recording Chowdhury's testimony anew. The prosecution countered that recording of the witness's deposition had not been completed on Jan 30 and hence supplementing the testimony was warranted Monday. They argued that there was no legal provision to expunge what has been recorded already in the court and that they should be able to proceed with the deposition with the court's permission. The judge at that point turned down the defence's plea to expunge Monday's deposition by Chowdhury. Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim were produced in court Tuesday morning. She followed Sheikh Selim into the makeshift courtroom set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, both arriving by 9:30am. Proceedings were interrupted Monday when special judge Md Azizul Haque left the courtroom around 10:00am amid a brawl between prosecution and defence lawyers . Defence lawyers had vehemently opposed the recording of a fresh deposition by the plaintiff of the case. bdnews24.co
