 N'Djamena, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chadian rebels fighting to overthrow President Idriss Deby battled their way into the capital N'Djamena on Saturday and were heading for the presidential palace, a foreign resident in the city said. Rebels with a column of 300 vehicles have closed in on the capital of the central African oil producing country in their most determined offensive in two years. They fought confused battles with Deby's troops on Friday northeast of the city. "Rebels are headed for the palace and are about two blocks from here. The rebels are winning," the resident said in an email sent from the compound of a western embassy in N'Djamena, adding she could hear heavy weapons fire. The French and U.S. embassies were preparing their nationals for evacuation. France's diplomatic mission instructed its citizens to assemble at three designated sites in the capital. France on Friday reinforced its military contingent stationed in its former colony, which has a population of around 10 million. The U.S. embassy asked those American nationals who wanted to be evacuated to come to the embassy immediately. Chad says the rebels, who advanced rapidly this week across the country from the eastern border with Sudan's war-torn Darfur region, are armed and backed by the Sudanese government. Khartoum routinely denies such accusations. Deby himself seized power in a revolt from the east in 1990. He won elections in 1996, 2001 and 2006. Government forces repelled a rebel attack on the capital in 2006, when hundreds of people are thought to have been killed. PEACEKEEPERS DELAYED In Addis Ababa, where African leaders have been meeting, the African Union expressed its concern over the escalation of the fighting in Chad, which has delayed the imminent deployment of European Union peacekeepers bound for eastern Chad. "We are really, deeply preoccupied by the situation today in Chad," Jean Ping, the new chairman of the AU Commission, told reporters on the sidelines of the summit in Ethiopia. Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, told reporters at the summit that the leaders of Chad and Sudan had been invited to Tehran for talks. Chadian Foreign Minister Ahmat Allam-mi accused Sudan's government of launching the latest Chadian rebel offensive in a bid to block the deployment in eastern Chad of the EU peacekeeping force, which has a United Nations mandate to protect thousands of refugees from the conflict in Darfur. "Since this (EU) force was announced, the Sudanese government has stepped up its attacks," he told RFI in Addis Ababa on the sidelines of the AU summit. Allam-mi said Khartoum wanted to stop the European force from focusing international attention on what he called the "genocide" in Darfur, where Sudanese government forces and allied militia have fought rebels for five years. International experts say some 200,000 people have died in Darfur and 2.5 million have been uprooted from their homes. Khartoum says the West is exaggerating the conflict. Chadian officials say Sudan has repeatedly backed offensives by several Chadian rebel groups, which have fought a hit-and-run guerrilla war for years against Deby. Khartoum accuses Chad in turn of backing Sudanese insurgents in Darfur. Said Djinnit, the outgoing Peace and Security Commissioner of the African Union, said delegates meeting in Addis Ababa were likely to condemn the rebels' attempt to take power by force.
