 DUBAI, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/fhb/Reuters) - A bomb attack on the residence of the Saudi ambassador in Chad killed the wife and daughter of an embassy employee, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya Television said on Saturday. It said an explosive was hurled in the direction of the house in N'Djamena, where rebels seeking to overthrow President Idriss Deby battled their way toward the presidential palace. A minister said government forces still controlled the city but heavy gunfire could be heard in the background on telephone dispatches aired by Al Jazeera and Arabiya television stations through the day.
