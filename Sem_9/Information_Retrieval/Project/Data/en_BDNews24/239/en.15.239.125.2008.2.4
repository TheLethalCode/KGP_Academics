 ZAGREB, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia is determined to step up the reform of its ailing judiciary, a key move demanded by the European Union, in the next few months, Justice Minister Ana Lovrin said on Monday. "Our goal is to present the first draft of our action plans to the European Commission in two months and have the final document by the summer. I'm confident their quality will satisfy Brussels," Lovrin told Reuters in an interview. Reforming the judiciary, as well as fighting corruption and cutting high state subsidies, is a crucial task for Zagreb if it wants to stick to its plan of joining the EU by 2011. Brussels has criticised Zagreb's slow progress on the judiciary, where cases drag on for years and often expire, and asked Croatia to submit improved action plans for the reform and fight against corruption.

We must make people see that it is better to have efficient courts than to have a court in virtually every town," she said. Croatia has among the highest number of judges and courts in Europe, but also among the biggest number of unresolved cases per capita, with a backlog of more than 1 million cases. To reduce corruption, perceived as widespread by most Croats, Lovrin said the ministry was aiming for the highest possible transparency in public administration, land registries or public procurement. A new law on public procurement is already in the works and a good legal framework for fighting corruption is in place. "Now the focus is on implementation," she said.
