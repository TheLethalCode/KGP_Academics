 CANBERRA/SYDNEY, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's move to become the single largest shareholder in Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc, which has vast resources in Australia, may warrant investigation under Australia's foreign ownership rules, the country's prime minister, Kevin Rudd said on Tuesday. "The reason we have Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) guidelines and a foreign takeovers act is to ensure that the Australian national interest is always met," Rudd told reporters. "Deliberations on any significant foreign equity in an Australian firm, whether it's from the United States, Japan, China...those guidelines are there, they will be applied," Rudd said. Chinalco's 12 percent stake in Rio's London listing, giving it a holding of just over 9 percent in Rio's dual-listed entity, does not automatically require a FIRB review. The president of the state-owned Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco), Xiao Yaqing, on Tuesday met with Australian ministers to try and explain why Chinalco had bought the stake in Rio, and ease concerns the group may try to take over one of Australia's biggest companies. The meeting came a day after Xiao insisted in a briefing for reporters that the $14 billion purchase of Rio stock, in partnership with Alcoa Inc, was only aimed at diversifying Chinalco's business beyond aluminium into other commodities, such as iron ore and copper, where Rio is strong. The stake purchase spurred speculation Chinalco may bid for Rio, which has spent the last three months fighting a takeover proposal from BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc pitched at $139 billion. Under Australian regulations any company must declare its intentions once it acquires more than 19.9 percent of another company's stock. That could pose a tricky problem for the government, which would be caught between a commitment to good relations with China, a major trading partner, and the loss of an iconic local company to a foreign, state-owned entity. "This is an independent decision made by the two companies, one Chinese, one American," China's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told reporters in Canberra after meeting with Rudd. "They did it, I guess, for their companies' own good and I think you can deduce it would help the development of their business," Yang said. Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, who would have to act on any FIRB advice, said that if he was required to make a decision it would be made on national interest considerations. Australia in 2001 blocked an attempted takeover of Woodside Petroleum Ltd by Anglo-Dutch oil firm Royal Dutch/Shell on similar grounds. Xiao has said Chinalco has no immediate plans to buy more Rio stock. BHP has until Wednesday to declare a formal bid for Rio or refrain from pursuing a takeover for at least six months under a "put up or shut up" regulation imposed by Britain's Takeover Panel. Chinalco lodged notification documents with FIRB last week and will this week hand over supplementary documents, after which FIRB officials can ask for responses from BHP, Rio and Alcoa. Rio shares dipped 0.6 percent on Tuesday to end at A$127.35 in Australia, in a broader market that fell 1.3 perce
