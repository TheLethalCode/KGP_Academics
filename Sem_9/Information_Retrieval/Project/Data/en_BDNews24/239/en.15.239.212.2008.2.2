 Peshawar, Pakistan, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two policemen and a pro-Taliban militant were killed in a firefight in northwestern Pakistan on Saturday, the latest in the spate of violence in the volatile region on the Afghan border, police said. The shootout near the town of Mardan in the North West Frontier Province erupted after police raided a house where militants were hiding. "The militants refused to surrender and opened fire on police, forcing us to retaliate," Abdullah Khan, a senior police officer in Mardan said. "Two policemen were killed and two were wounded. One militant was killed," he added. Mardan, a town around 40 km (25 miles) northeast of the provincial capital, Peshawar, has relatively been free of the militant violence, though in 2005 security forces arrested a senior al Qaeda leader, Abu Faraj Farj al-Libi, from the town. Violence has spread from the remote Pakistani tribal areas on the Afghan border, well known sanctuaries for al Qaeda and Taliban militants, to the cities and towns across the province in recent weeks, triggering US concerns that militants were increasing their efforts to destabilise its staunch ally. A suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden car into a security force checkpost in North Waziristan tribal region on the Afghan border on Friday, killing at least six men. The attack came hours after US officials and an al Qaeda-linked Web site said that a senior al Qaeda leader, Abu Laith al-Libi, was killed in the same region this week. Libi was killed in a missile attack apparently fired by a US drone. US officials have said they were willing to send troops to Pakistan to join its fight against the militants but Pakistani leaders have rejected such suggestions, fearing that it could trigger a backlash from the fiercely-independent Pashtun tribes living on the border
