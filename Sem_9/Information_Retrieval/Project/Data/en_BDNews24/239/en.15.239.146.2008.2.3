 BIJELO POLJE, Serbia, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polling station No. 8 in Bijelo Polje was a metal container donated by the Russian government, with a view down through the thin morning mist to the hardscrabble town of Pec in western Kosovo. Albanians hold the town, but a few hundred Serbs have resettled over the past five years in a scattering of villages on the mountain slopes on the border with Montenegro -- returning to ruined homes they fled in 1999. They were voting without fail on Sunday, in a knife-edge election for Serbian president that could decide whether Serbia turns its back on the West when the Albanian majority in breakaway Kosovo declares independence, possibly within days. The race between pro-Western President Boris Tadic and nationalist challenger Tomislav Nikolic is too close to call. To Kosovo's 120,000 remaining Serbs, one wonders whether it really matters. Albanians, as in the first round, ignored the vote. "Neither the Serbian president nor anyone else can prevent Kosovo's independence," said Vinko Arsenijevic, who returned to rebuild his razed village in 2003. "Others decide whether Kosovo gets independence. It's up to us to just live on our land. That's what we're fighting for. Kosovo's status will be resolved by others." He voted for Tadic, putting him in the minority among Kosovo Serbs, who traditionally vote for Nikolic. Nikolic takes a harder line on the Western powers who bombed Serbia in 1999 to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two-year counter-insurgency war. Tadic too opposes independence, but says Serbia must pursue membership of the European Union regardless. NATO PEACE FORCE Almost one million Kosovo Albanians temporarily fled over the mountains to Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania in 1998-99, driven out by a brutal offensive by Serb forces under late strongman Slobodan Milosevic. After bombing for 11 weeks, NATO deployed in June 1999 on the heels of retreating Serb forces. Up to 200,000 Serbs and other ethnic minorities packed up and left, many of their homes burning behind them. Bijelo Polje, Brestovik and Ljevosa are 'return' villages, where cheap red-brick homes have been built with European money on grey-stone ruins above Pec. Some villagers have returned, many of them men who left their families in Serbia proper where jobs and schooling are easier to come by. Romanian soldiers, part of a 16,000-strong NATO peace force, drove slowly around the church grounds in Bijelo Polje, where a few dozen voters had cast ballots since early morning, stray puppies snapping at their feet. "It won't help, but it's our public duty," said Miki, a farmer in Brestovik. Russia last year blocked Kosovo's independence at the U.N. Security Council. But the West is backing a declaration of independence by Kosovo Albanians, who say they will make the move within weeks, even days of Sunday's election. In Gorazdevac, south of Pec, photos of semi-naked women adorned the pink walls of the local cafe, where a pig roasted on a spit and a drunk Serb vented the kind of anger that could propel Nikolic to victory. "I don't hate Albanians, Hungarians or Muslims - I hate the Americans and the British," he shouted. "They want to give Kosovo away. Let them give California away!"
