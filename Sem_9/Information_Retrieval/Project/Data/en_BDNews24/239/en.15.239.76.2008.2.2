<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Two fifties from Shakib Al Hasan and Rajin Saleh Saturday propelled the C team to thrash the A team by six wickets in the second practice match ahead of this month's home series against South Africa. The C team, led by Shakib, raced to 191 for four in 39.3 overs in reply to the A's 190 in 44.4 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Shakib and Nayeem Islam remained unbeaten on 57 and 44 to steer their side home after Javed Omar (9), Aftab Ahmed (6) and Tushar Imran (17) failed to live up to their reputations. They together put on 99 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket after the C team were reduced to 92 for four. Shakib smashed a six and six fours in 56 balls while Nayeem struck four fours in 55 balls. Earlier, makeshift opener Rajin Saleh contributed 51 off 70 balls including eight fours before being bowled by Mosharraf Hossain Rubel, who returned two for 35. The A team's opener Junaed Siddique shone again, but saw his side restricted below 200-mark after captain Ashraful opted to bat first after the toss. Left-handed Junaed fell just eight runs short of what would have been a deserved century after he smashed 82 against the B team Saturday. The national team opener struck eight fours and one six in 124 balls before he was the fifth batsman out to leave the side at 158 for five in 38.3 overs. The A team, led by Mohammad Ashraful, added only 32 runs for the remaining wickets in the face of some accurate bowling by left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior, who returned four for 37. Habibul Bashar (three-ball duck), Ashraful (22 off 25 balls), Mehrab Hossain Junior (30 off 51 balls), Mushfiqur Rahim (nine off six balls), Farhad Reza (11 off 28 balls) and Sajedul Islam (one off two balls) were other A team scorers. bd
