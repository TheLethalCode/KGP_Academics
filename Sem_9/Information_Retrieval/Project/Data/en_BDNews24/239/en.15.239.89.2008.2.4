 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker administration is seeking to abolish all municipalities that were created without meeting the necessary conditions, an adviser said. A decision has already been taken in principle to cancel Moksedpur Municipality in Gopalganj, although the move will not be finalised until vetting by the law ministry. Deputy commissioners will also be consulted prior to abolishing seven other municipalities. The eight municipalities under review were formed during the tenure of the last BNP-led government. "There are specific rules to follow when creating a municipality. It has been discovered these rules were not followed in many cases," LGRD adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal told bdnews24.com Sunday. "Reports are being taken from the deputy commissioners concerned. We will decide how to go about abolishing the municipalities on the basis of those reports," Iqbal said. The adviser said a new ordinance on municipalities, recommended by a committee tasked to strengthen local government bodies, will be completed after necessary scrutiny. "After the ordinance is promulgated, municipalities which do not meet the specified condition will be cancelled," Iqbal said. The Shawkat Committee was formed by the caretaker administration and states that municipalities which fail to meet conditions specified in the 1977 Municipality Ordinance will be considered defunct following their discovery. The immediate-past BNP-led administration established 61 municipalities. There are 309 municipalities in the country. According to the ordinance, the government will not declare any rural area an urban area unless three-fourths of the adult male population is mainly employed in the areas other than agriculture. Such areas must have no less than 15,000 population, with per square mile home to no less than 2,000 residents, according to the ordinance. Many municipalities fall short of the criteria. The other municipalities under review are Hatiya Municipality in Noakhali, Mongla in Khulna, Kalkini in Madaripur, Sundarganj in Gaibandha, Homna in Comilla, Keshobpur in Jessore and Satkania Municipality in Chittagong. bdnews24.c
