<TITLE> Hasina hopes to come out clean in a fair trial: lawyers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina thinks the trial of the barge-mounted power plants case has been rushed as authorities realised that chances to get her convicted in the extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury were slim, her lawyers said Saturday. They said she wanted her trial completed in appropriate and legal way and was confident that she would come out clean if the court was impartial and not influenced, her lawyers. Advocates Golam Arif Tipu and Kamrul Islam made the remarks to reporters after visiting the Awami League chief in the special jail. They entered the special jail at Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises at 3:30pm and stayed there for about two hours. The lawyers said the detained former prime minister was hopeful of things going in her favour after the statements of the legal experts. Tipu said, "We discussed several issues from the perspective of law. She gave some directions. He is in good mental and physical condition." "She wants the justice to take its own course. She thinks the allegations against her are simply a travesty of truth." Kamrul said, "[Hasina] has grown confident after the statement of plaintiff and businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. If the court is not influenced and if the court functions impartially, then the verdict will be in her favour." "She strongly believes that the Awami League would come to power if the election is free and fair. They have already understood that they can't trap Hasina in this case anymore, so they started the trial of another case," he added. bdnews24.c
