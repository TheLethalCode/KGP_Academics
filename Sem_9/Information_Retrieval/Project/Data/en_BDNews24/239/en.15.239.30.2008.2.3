<TITLE> Afghan police surround house of ex-warlord Dostum </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kabul, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan police surrounded the house of former ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum in Kabul on Sunday after he and a group of up to 50 armed men abducted a former ally, the private Tolo TV said. Dostum, a fierce warlord who changed sides and alliances many times during Afghanistan's 30 years of war, had abducted his former election manager Akbar Bay late on Saturday. Bay has since been freed and is in hospital, the station said. The burly Dostum rose to command ethnic Uzbek fighters allied to the Soviet Union during the 1979-89 occupation, then switched sides to the mujahideen at the end of the war, then formed and broke alliances several times during the civil war, meanwhile running much of northern Afghanistan as his personal fiefdom. Dostum ran for president in the 2004 election gaining 10 percent of the vote. Since then President Hamid Karzai named him as a top military advisor, a post largely seen as an attempt at co-opting a powerful and unpredictable figure.
