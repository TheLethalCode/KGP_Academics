 MILAN, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's outgoing government has called a crisis meeting next week on the future of Milan's Malpensa airport as Alitalia cuts flights there under contested plans for its sale to Air France-KLM. "We confirmed the decision to call the Milan round table to discuss Malpensa as soon as possible, next week for sure," Equal Opportunities Minister Barbara Pollastrini said after a cabinet meeting under Romano Prodi, who quit last week. Talks are under way to try to form an interim government and the political uncertainty has raised concerns over loss-making Alitalia's sale discussions with Air France-KLM, which should end mid-March. Already, a snubbed rival has taken legal action. Air One, backed by Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo, has gone to court to try to annul the decision to talk with Air France-KLM. Alitalia, which needs over $1 billion this year to keep flying solo, said late on Thursday it was giving up runway slots at Malpensa, its northern Italy hub -- a decision which could prompt the airport's operator, SEA, to seek damages. "Infrastructure for a hub was built and now it's been cut back for just point-to-point flights," a source at the operator told Reuters. Newspapers suggested SEA might seek up to 1.2 billion euros ($1.78 billion) in damages from Alitalia. Alitalia has so far declined to give details of the planned cutbacks, which have enflamed regional politicians whose electoral heartland of the industrial north and Milan, the country's financial and fashion capital, is served by Malpensa. Business daily Il Sole 24 Ore said the airline could slash weekly intercontinental routes to 47 in 2008 from 181 in 2007. Alitalia was not immediately available for comment. Italy's airport slot coordinator, Assoclearance, is likely to give details of summer slots early next week. KILLING MALPENSA The finance ministry -- which control's the state's stake in Alitalia -- said it approved of the airline giving up the slots, a move which was included in Alitalia's "survival plan" announced last year before it entered talks with Air France-KLM. Air France-KLM backed the plan in its proposal for Alitalia. Postponing the cuts would be "incompatible with the delicate situation the company is in and with the exclusive talks with Air France-KLM", the finance ministry said. "Moreover, it would expose Alitalia to legal actions by other airlines interested in the slots in question." Roberto Formigoni, governor of the Lombardy region which includes Malpensa, hit out at the cuts. "This is how you kill Malpensa," he was quoted by saying in La Repubblica newspap
