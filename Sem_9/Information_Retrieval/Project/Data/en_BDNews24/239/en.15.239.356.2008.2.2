"We all wanted him to do so well today and there were lots of times, especially when he was bowling his last over, when he was very emotional," captain Graeme Smith told a news conference. "It worked perfectly that he was able to go in and finish the game like he did." Pollock, who made his international debut more than 12 years ago, will play his last match for South Africa in the fifth and final game of the series in Johannesburg on Sunday. Smith was wary of the match being overshadowed by the sentiment surrounding Pollock's retirement.

"Already today there were a lot of lumps in throats, and Sunday could be very interesting for us and for Shaun."

The result was South Africa's fourth consecutive win in the serie
