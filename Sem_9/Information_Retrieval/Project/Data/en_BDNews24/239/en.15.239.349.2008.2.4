 Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a Pakistani military mini-bus in the city of Rawalpindi on Monday and at least three people were killed and about 10 were wounded, military officials said. Violence has intensified in Pakistan in recent months with the army battling militants in the northwest and suicide bomb attacks in towns and cities, raising concern about prospects for the nuclear-armed country in the run-up to Feb. 18 elections. The bomb went off during the morning rush hour outside the army's National Logistics Cell in the city, where the army has its headquarters. "The bomber was apparently on a motorcycle and rammed into a military vehicle," said a military official at the scene. Several vehicles were badly damaged and army caps were scattered on the road at the site of the blast, about 100 metres (yards) from the back of the army headquarters compound, a witness said. Suicide bombers have struck in Rawalpindi at least five times in the past year, including an attack on a bus taking staff of the main military intelligence agency to work. Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was assassinated as she was leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi on Dec. 27. Parliamentary elections, which are meant to complete a transition to civilian rule, were scheduled for early January but were subsequently postponed to Feb. 18. The government has blamed an al Qaeda-linked militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud, who is based in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border, for the attacks. The military has stepped up operations against Mehsud in recent weeks after his men attacked and captured a remote fort.
