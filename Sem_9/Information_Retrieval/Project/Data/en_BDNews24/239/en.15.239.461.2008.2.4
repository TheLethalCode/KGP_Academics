 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to set up a special monitoring cell to watch the import data and output of nine essential commodities, an adviser said Monday. The decision came from a meeting at the commerce ministry, chaired by commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. The nine commodities are rice, edible oil, pulses, powder milk, flour, salt, onion, potato and sugar. After the meeting, the adviser told reporters that production and import data of the commodities would be monitored by the special cell. "The decision is meant to cut risks to the market and bring transparency to the import process," Zillur said. The government is trying to find out ways to initiate special arrangements for "poor consumers", he said. The adviser said the decision would allow the government to create a databank on the consumption pattern. "The government has no actual statistics on production and import of these daily essentials. We want to create a databank based on the observations of the monitoring cell which would help us assess demand for commodities and local production," Zillur told reporters. "I am asking everybody, especially the media, to use the databank and avoid confusions," the adviser said. NBR chairman Muhammad Abdul Majid, FBCCI administrator Syed Manzur Elahi, Bangladesh Bank representative, business leaders and government officials attended the meeting. bdnews2
