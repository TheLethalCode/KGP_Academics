<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim were produced Tuesday morning in court as proceedings continued in the extortion case filed against them by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. Sheikh Hasina followed Sheikh Selim into the makeshift courtroom set up in the Sangsad Bhaban premises, both arriving by 9:30 am. The previous day's (Monday's) proceedings had been interrupted when Special Judge Md Azizul Haque left the courtroom at around 10:00 am amid altercations between prosecution and defense lawyers. Defense lawyers had vehemently opposed the recording of a fresh deposition by plaintiff Azam J Chowdhury. Defense lawyer Kamrul Islam reminded the court that defense lawyers were scheduled to cross-examine Azam's previous testimony. "But you are saying today that the plaintiff's testimony will be recorded afresh. It appears that you are ordering this in connivance with the government lawyers. We cannot expect justice to be meted out in this manner," Kamrul remonstrated. Soon after this, the judge left the courtroom while Azam J Chowdhury's deposition continued. On January 30, Azam J Chowdhury testified in court that of those accused in the case, he only recognised Sheikh Selim and that the other accused were not known to him. Some days before Azam had said in a public statement to the press: "I haven't filed any case against the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. I had sued Sheikh Selim." The case proceedings after being halted for 12 days resumed on January 30, after the Supreme Court had overturned a High Court order staying all proceedings of the case. On June 13, 2007, businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed a case with Gulshan police station against Sheikh Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Selim accusing them of extorting Tk 3 crore from him. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007, and the case was included for trial under Emergency Powers Rules the same day. On July 24, a charge-sheet was submitted to the court accusing Sheikh Hasina, Sheikh Selim as well as Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana who resides in the UK. Charges were framed on January 13, 2008. bdnews24.com/pc/e
