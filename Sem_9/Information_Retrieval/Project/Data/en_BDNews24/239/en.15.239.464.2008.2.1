<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ex-prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov will appeal to the Supreme Court against his disqualification from running in a March election against President Vladimir Putin's chosen candidate, his spokeswoman said on Friday. The Central Election Commission barred Kasyanov last month, ruling that hundreds of thousands of the two million signatures he had to submit in support of his candidacy were forged, incorrect or spoiled. "Kasyanov is appealing to the Supreme Court because more than two million people voted for him when they signed his petition and he needs to see this out to its conclusion for them," said Yelena Dikun, Kasyanov's spokeswoman. Kasyanov was Putin's first prime minister but became a vocal critic after his dismissal from the government in 2004. Polls show he enjoys little popular support but analysts said his outspoken criticism annoyed the Kremlin. The March 2 presidential election is widely expected to be won by Putin's chosen candidate, Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev has a huge lead in polls and enjoys blanket coverage on state media. The Supreme Court dismissed a claim last month from another independent candidate against disqualification. Former Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky's candidacy for president was denied on residency grounds, as he had not lived in Russia for the past 10 years. Bukovsky has British residency. He was deported in 1976 after spending 13 years in Soviet labour camps for exposing the use of psychiatric hospitals as a tool to silence critics. Three candidates remain -- communist Gennady Zyuganov, nationalist Vladimr Zhirinovsky and the little-known Andrei Bogdanov. None is likely to garner enough votes to threaten Medvedev, who profits from the popularity enjoyed by Putin. Putin is barred by the constitution from standing for a third successive term, but seeks to retain influence. Kasyanov denied the charge of submitting invalid signatures and said Putin had personally decided to bar him from the election. His spokeswoman said Kasyanov would file his appeal on Friday and the court would respond within five days. For more on Russia's presidential electi
