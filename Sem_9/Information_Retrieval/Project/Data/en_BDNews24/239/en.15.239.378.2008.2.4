 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The youth and sports ministry Monday asked importers and sports businessmen not to import or sell footballs inscribed with a Quranic verse to avoid offending the faithful in the predominantly Muslim country. The directive came after some dailies carried news that "footballs inscribed with Quranic verse are being sold in the market". "Marketing such footballs is condemnable and offense as well," the youth and sports ministry said in a statement. The statement also asked the importers and sports businessmen not to import such footballs that hurt the sentiments of devout Muslims. They also sought cooperation from the home and commercial ministries so that no-one could import or market such footballs in the country in future. The youth and sports ministry also formed a two-member committee to probe how such footballs were imported and sold in the country. The committee is comprised of youth and sports ministry deputy secretary M Mahfuzur Rahman and National Sports Council's sport director M Haiul Quaium. Some Islamic parties in a joint statement demanded punishment of the people who allegedly marketed such footballs. They also warned that the government would be responsible if the authority did not take specific steps in the next 48 hours. bd
