<TITLE> Tourists endangered species in violent Kenya </TITLE>

 NAIVASHA, Kenya, Feb 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gilbert Korir has spent the last two years learning to rattle off bird species ranging from pelicans and yellow-billed storks to cormorants and African fish eagles so he could be a guide at a Kenyan country club. But with his country embroiled in post-election violence that has killed over 850 people and brought a $1 billion a year tourism industry to its knees, the ornithologist worries whether his new job will last. "You can see there are no boats out here," he said, as he navigated towards hippos emerging from the glassy waters of Lake Naivasha, in Kenya's Rift Valley. "Normally, when there are tourists here, you can find 10 or 15 boats on the lake in the morning." It is high tourism season in Kenya, but the only visitors at the Lake Naivasha Country Club are fleeing refugees or journalists covering ethnic clashes just outside its gates. Earlier this week, metres from the lake, army helicopters opened fire to disperse crowds of armed Kikuyus who were trying to attack people from several of Kenya's western ethnic groups. The clashes around Kenya began after Dec. 27 elections, which were officially won by Kikuyu incumbent President Mwai Kibaki but rejected by his rival Raila Odinga. What started as riots has degenerated into a cycle of killings and lootings which the United States has called ethnic cleansing. Tourism has suffered before here from bomb blasts and political violence, but the scale of unrest over the last month, which has displaced more than 250,000 people, is unprecedented. "From what I can see they will have to close (the hotel) as the violence is going on," Korir said. He said he and other staff no longer left the site because it was too dangerous. Hotels on Kenya's pristine Indian Ocean beaches -- where tourism only recently recovered from the impact of the 1998 and 2002 blasts in Nairobi and Mombasa blamed on al Qaeda -- are also beginning to close and lay off staff. "Even those that are open have maybe 10 percent occupancy," said Michael Mathenge, who runs a tour firm targeting European visitors to nearby Nakuru, also a lakeside safari hotspot. "We have lions, flamingos, African heritage. Now all the tourists have fled, especially the big spenders. The only foreigners are press people -- and you don't spend much." The rival sides have agreed to try and seek a political solution but, even if one is found, it will take time for Kenya to draw back tourists like before. Korir steers his boat around an island where wildebeest and waterbuck graze. A piece of land jutting out into the lake is home to impala and giraffe and was used in "Out of Africa", a film that highlighted Kenya's tourism potential. "There were so many tourists last year. We used to have 30 or 40 a day. Now we are just hustling," he said.
