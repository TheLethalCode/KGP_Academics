 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Saturday reiterated his party's demand for the immediate release of political detainees, including Sheikh Hasina. Zillur also asked the government to lift the state of emergency and hold the national election as early as possible. "We formed a relief committee after Cyclone Sidr struck the country, with presidium member Abdur Razzak as chairman, and relief and social welfare secretary Nazma Rahman as secretary," said Zillur following a meeting at the AL president's office in Dhanmondi. "The committee was formed on the orders of Sheikh Hasina. She asked the government to allow her to stand beside the affected people." "But the government did not allow this, and that hurt us," Zillur said. The acting AL president wound up the party's post-cyclone relief effort during the meeting, claiming they had reached the most affected areas with aid. Zillur said the party received Tk 1.79 crore in relief funds up to Jan 31, of which Tk 15 lakh has already been disbursed for agricultural rehabilitation and a further Tk 40 lakh is to be targeted to the four most affected areas. "If anyone wants to donate money, it will go directly to the central relief fund of the party," he added. Presidium member Abdur Razzak told the meeting that the Jubo League had collected Tk 5 lakh towards the relief effort, the Jubo Mohila League supplied Tk 1.6 lakh, Sechhasebok League Tk 3.4 lakh and Chhatra League supplied education materials. bdnews
