 HONG KONG, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has freed a Hong Kong-based reporter for a Singaporean newspaper jailed for five years for spying for Taiwan after intense lobbying from activists and politicians for clemency ahead of the Beijing Olympics. Ching Cheong, reportedly in poor health since his detention in 2005 and whose family had pushed for an early release on medical grounds, was freed ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday -- the most important on the Chinese calendar -- and was expected in Hong Kong on Tuesday afternoon, a Hong Kong official said. "We have informed Ching Cheong's family about his release," Susana Kwong, Principal Information Officer for the Chief Executive's office, told Reuters. But she said the conditions of the release were not clear. Chief Executive Donald Tsang "was particularly happy to see Ching could reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year", she said. Ching, a reporter for Singapore's Straits Times newspaper, was detained in April 2005 and later sentenced to five years in jail in a high-profile case underscoring the country's curbs on the media and dissent. Beijing says strict controls are necessary to preserve stability. Ching was accused of spying for Taiwan, the self-ruled island over which Beijing claims sovereignty. He was detained in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong where, his wife has said, he had travelled to collect documents related to disgraced former Chinese Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang. Calls from around the world have persisted for Ching's early release, many citing China's express intention of fostering a more open media environment -- itself an effort to play down accusations of draconian controls over journalists. "I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but this news has definitely come all of a sudden," said Mak Chai-ming, a spokeswoman for the Ching Cheong Incident Concern Group. "He was definitely not happy and not adapting to that kind of (prison) life." Ching's release comes after Beijing freed New York Times reporter Zhao Yan in September -- a case that became the focus of intense campaigning by international human rights groups and U.S. diplomats. "The family got a call from the government this morning. He will be paroled and back in Hong Kong today," a source close to Ching's family told Reuters. China holds 35 journalists and 51 cyber-dissidents in prison, according to Reporters Without Borders. The International PEN, which champions writers' freedoms in 101 countries, urged Chinese President Hu Jintao to free 40 jailed dissident writers and journalists, including Ching, ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And on Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists, a leading media watchdog, blasted Beijing for again leading the world in jailing journalists, decrying the government's "vast system of censorship" and continued jailing of reporters. In an open letter to Hu, the Hong Kong Journalists' Association said Ching suffered from arrhythmia and recently learned that his illness has worsened in jail. Hong Kong's status as a special, autonomous territory of China's has complicated Ching's case. Like many residents of the territory, Ching holds a passport of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as well as a British National (Overseas) passpo
