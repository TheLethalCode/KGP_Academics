 KABUL, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan police lifted a brief siege of the house of former ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum in Kabul on Sunday after he and a group of up to 50 armed men beat up a former ally, a police chief said. Dostum, a fierce warlord with a reputation for brutality and switching sides, beat up his former election manager Akbar Bay late on Saturday, said Kabul police chief Salem Hasaas. One of Bay's bodyguards was shot and Dostum and his men escaped to the warlord's house, Hasaas said. Bay was taken to hospital, Afghan television said. Dozens of police armed with assault rifles and machine guns mounted on pick-up trucks surrounded Dostum's house in a relatively upmarket part of Kabul and other officers took up positions on the roofs of neighbouring houses. One shot was fired, but it was unclear where it came from. Shortly afterwards, police began to withdraw. "We have received orders to hand the case over to the judiciary for investigation," said the head of the Kabul police criminal investigations Ali Shah Paktiawal. The burly Dostum rose to command ethnic Uzbek fighters allied to the Soviet Union during the 1979-89 occupation, then switched sides to the mujahideen at the end of the war. He then formed and broke alliances several times during the civil war, meanwhile running much of northern Afghanistan as his personal fiefdom. Dostum ran for president in the 2004 election gaining 10 percent of the vote. Since then President Hamid Karzai named him as a top military advisor, a post largely seen as an attempt at co-opting a powerful and unpredictable figure. A spokesman for Dostum said there was no truth in the accusations against the former warlord and warned of unrest if police tried to arrest him. "This is a plot against General Dostum, the government is trying to undermine him," said spokesman and member of parliament Mohammad Alem Saleh. "The government should know that if it tries to capture Dostum, then seven or eight provinces in the north will turn against the governmen
