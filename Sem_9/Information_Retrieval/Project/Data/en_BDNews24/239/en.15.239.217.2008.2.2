 Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Factbox on Mali striker Frederic Kanoute who on Friday became the first European-born player to win the African Footballer of the Year award. Born Sainte-Foy-les-Lyon (France), Sept. 2, 1977. Began his professional career with local team Olympique Lyon, and played for his native France as an Under-21 international while at the club. Moved to West Ham United in 2000, scoring 29 league goals in four seasons, but left when they were relegated in 2003 and made the short trip across London to join Tottenham Hotspur. Switched international allegiance from France to his father's country Mali in 2004 and played in the African Nations Cup that year. He was joint top scorer with four goals in four matches as Mali reached the semi-finals. Scored 14 league goals in two seasons at Tottenham but never developed any consistency and moved to Sevilla in 2005 for 6.5 million euros ($9.66 million). The striker has played a key role in Sevilla's success in the last three seasons, scoring in all five of cup triumphs. Netted in the UEFA Cup final wins against Middlesbrough in 2006 and Espanyol in 2007 and in the 3-0 victory over Barcelona in the European Super Cup at the start of last season. Grabbed a coolly taken winner in Sevilla's 1-0 win over Getafe in the King's Cup final last June and got a hat-trick against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in a 6-3 aggregate victory in the Spanish Super Cup at the start of this season. Despite suffering from a long-running groin problem, the rangy forward was Sevilla's top scorer with 21 goals in the league last season and got another eight in cup competitions. Helped Mali qualify for 2008 Nations Cup but they failed to get past the group stage after losing 3-0 to Ivory Coast. Kanoute is a practising Muslim and helped save a local mosque in Seville by buying the property after its lease ran out.
