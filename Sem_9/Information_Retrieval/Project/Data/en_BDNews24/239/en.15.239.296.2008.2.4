<TITLE> Saudi family seeks damages for minor's execution </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIYADH, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The family of a Saudi teenager tried and executed for murder in an apparent violation of a ban on executing minors is seeking compensation of 10 million riyals ($2.7 million), their lawyer said on Monday. The case highlights legal problems in Saudi Arabia, where King Abdullah has unveiled plans to overhaul the court system and formalise what is now an unwritten penal code.

And if you are between 15 and 18 there is a special court with a 'minors' judge'. This did not happen," Zmami told Reuters, a day after a Riyadh complaints court began an appeal filed by the family. "To this day the body has not been delivered to his family and they do not even know the place of burial." He said the murdered boy had disappeared after performing evening prayers with his father, and his body was found the next day showing signs of sexual assault. Hakami was arrested five days later after a number of men were also questioned. Zmami said the boy was beaten until he made a confession that became the basis for his trial and guilty verdict.
