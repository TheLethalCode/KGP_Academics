 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Fears of arrest among the country's contractors and rising costs of construction materials are slowing implementation of the current fiscal year's Annual Development Programme, according to a government report. The review of the progress in ADP implementation to December 2007 was presented at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) Wednesday, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. The report prepared by the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the planning ministry identified a total of 30 causes for slow implementation of ADP in 10 major ministries. Increase in the price of construction materials, last year's floods and Cyclone Sidr and delay in preparation of schedules for tender, evaluation, approval and work order have been cited as the causes of slow pace in implementation of the ADP. The report said of the education ministry: "The work of infrastructure development is being hampered as the contractors at the field level have gone underground due to the overall situation in the country." The report also said overall ADP implementation was low as projects on roads and embankments were hindered in the affected areas due to two floods in September-October and the devastating cyclone Sidr on Nov 15 of 2007. According to the report's figures, there are 931 projects under the current ADP, with a total allocation of Tk 26,500 crore. During the first six months to December only 21 percent of the government's ADP was implemented, the report said. This rate is the lowest for the past four years. During the July-December of the previous fiscal (2006-07) the rate of ADP implementation was 25 percent. In 2005-06 and 2004-05 the rates were 27 and 29 percent respectively. The post and telecommunication ministry's performance is worst among the 10 major ministries and divisions in terms of implementation. The ministry has implemented only seven percent of the total allocation during July-December. In the last fiscal year, the rate of ADP implementation in the post and telecommunication ministry was 11 percent. Other reasons for overall slow implementation are: complexities in selection of projects, acquiring land, delay in release of money pending different conditionsincluding for aid-dependent projectsfrequent transfer of senior ministry officials and lack of monitoring by the ministry/division/organisation during implementation of a project. bdnews24.c
