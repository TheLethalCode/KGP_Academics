 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)-The two-day National Poetry Festival 2008 was launched Friday at Dhaka University Library premises with the slogan "The spirit of poetry, victory for democracy". Noted national poet Syed Shamsul Huq inaugurated the 22nd annual poetry festival organised by the National Poetry Council. Visiting Indian poet Sathi Chattopadday, who joined the festival from Mumbai, said: "I feel very happy to be at this festival for the first time." "The intensity of this love for the Bangla language is really amazing." Tushar Chowdhury, another Indian poet from Kolkata said: "I have long wished to visit the poetry festival in Dhaka Today that wish has been fulfilled." "I am happy to have the opportunity to get acquainted with the poets here." "The difference between this festival and Kolkata's poetry festival is that the sincerity is much greater here," Tushar said. Referring to the theme of this year's National Poetry Festival, Syed Shamsul Huq said: "I have been observing over recent years that there is no initiative for new construction in our poetry. There is no risk-taking for inventing new horizons for poetry." "Our poets have to come out of this inertia." He also urged people to revive democracy in the country. "For this the people have to be united. Let us stand up with the same spirit with which we did in 1971," said the poet. Earlier in the day, floral wreaths were offered at the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and artists Joynul Abedin and Quamrul Hasan at the Central Shaheed Minar. The festival opened with the singing of Ekushey songs. Poets Rabindra Gop and Rabiul Hossain, National Poetry Council president Habibullah Shiraji, and festival convenors Asad Chowdhury and Tariq Sujat were among those present at the inauguration. bdnew
