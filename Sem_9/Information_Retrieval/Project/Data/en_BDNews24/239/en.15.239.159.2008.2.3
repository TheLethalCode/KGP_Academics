<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday said detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had given no guidance on the unification of the two factions of the party. "BNP is united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. I didn't find any message from the leader in jail through lawyer. The leaders and workers have questions about what is being circulated," the Khaleda-appointed BNP secretary general said in a press briefing. Khaleda's lawyer barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan after visiting her at special jail Friday told reporters: "She has asked for uniting the party. She has urged the nationalist forces to unite for the sake of the country and the party." But when Delwar was asked about the matter in Sunday's press briefing, he declined having received any such message. "If lawyers after meeting her go public before informing me it cannot be a message in any way. Besides, a lawyer does not have any scope to speak with any detainee on any political matter except the issues relating to the case." In the briefing at his Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat, he demanded immediate release of the former prime minister and arrangement of better treatment for her sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman. Delwar alleged that Khaleda and sons had been unjustly detained in false and fabricated cases. On the schism of two factions of the party, he said, "[Khaleda] does not think BNP has split into two factions. The chairperson will decision on those who strayed by working against the party constitution. There have been several instances of [such dissidents] returning to the party in the past." "I cannot do anything about those expelled for disobeying the chairperson's decision." Delwar alleged torture on Tarique in remand. "Torture in the name of interrogation is against the laws of the land and existing rules of International Human Rights Commission. Tarique Rahman is devastated physically and mentally because of the torture." Quoting the pathological test of Tarique and Arafat at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, he said their condition was serious. He demanded that authorities either arranged better treatment or allowed them to get better treatment by freeing them. Replying to a question, Delwar said, "There is no constitutional basis of forming a national government before elections. If that is done it will be unconstitutional." bdnew
