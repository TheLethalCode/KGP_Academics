 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has asked the government for a copy of the draft independent Election Commission Secretariat ordinance. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda wrote Thursday to the Chief Adviser's Office for the copy, an election commissioner said preferring anonymity. "We understand from media reports that the chief election commissioner has been given the sole authority in the ordinance, which is not expected at all," the commissioner said. "Besides, we have questions about different things including accountability of the secretariat and recruitment. That's why we need to see the draft. Then the EC would make a formal reaction," he said. On Jan 30, Huda told reporters that he believed the ordinance did not have any provision describing the qualities of people to be appointed to the main polls office. On Jan 29, the interim cabinet approved the "Independent Election Commission Secretariat Ordinance 2008." According to the ordinance, chief election commissioner would have overall control of the Secretariat. The secretary would be administrative chief of the commission, which would recruit people in line with the rules and regulations. A committee headed by the CEC would work to review the organisational structure of the secretariat. The secretary would act as member secretary of the committee. bdnew
