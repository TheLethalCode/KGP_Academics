<TITLE> Italy Senate leader to decide Monday on govt chaos </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italians will know on Monday whether their squabbling politicians can unite in an interim government long enough to improve the electoral system, or if a snap election is closer than ever, Senate speaker Franco Marini said. Marini -- charged by the president to seek a way out of political chaos after the collapse of Romano Prodi's centre-left government -- met business and labour representatives on Saturday to sound their opinions on the country's future. Before coming to a verdict on Monday, he will consult members of Italy's three biggest parties, including Silvio Berlusconi, the billionaire opposition leader who is demanding an immediate election that polls indicate he would win. "I confirm that I will have all the elements for a comprehensive evaluation by Monday," Marini told reporters on the third day of consulting politicians. "There's a weekend, let's spend it well, me by reflecting, you by enjoying yourselves, and on Monday I will give you this comprehensive evaluation." With Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the second biggest centre-right party National Alliance refusing to join an interim administration, Marini has said he faces an almost impossible task in trying to form a viable government. Newspapers speculate that President Giorgio Napolitano could dissolve parliament as early as Wednesday and call an election. The centre left is in no hurry to face voters whose support waned during Prodi's 20 months in office, which were marred by incessant bickering within a coalition of nine parties that stretched from Catholic centrists to communists. BUSINESS LIMBO Walter Veltroni, the Rome mayor who leads Italy's biggest centre-left party, insisted everyone would lose under the current electoral system, which risks producing another unstable parliament and which Berlusconi himself criticised in the past. "Rushing in to vote with an election law that they themselves consider a bad one. Why?" Veltroni asked supporters at a meeting in Sicily. "'Let's vote now!' -- it's a kind of frenetic anxiety that has gripped the centre right. What would it do? It would create a coalition made up of dozens of parties." Veltroni challenged Berlusconi to wait until June before holding an election. The chaos comes as business confidence in Italy -- the third biggest euro zone economy and a G8 member -- is at a two-year low and consumer morale at its gloomiest since August, 2005. In addition to the general uncertainty and the fact that any economic reforms are now on hold, the political limbo leaves a question mark over the future of Alitalia, Italy's loss-making flag carrier, which was due to be sold to Air France-KLM. Alitalia CEO Maurizio Prati said the sale was safe. "The talks (with Air France) are going ahead," he told Il Sole 24 Ore. But opponents of the sale, including rival airline Air One and Milan airport operator SEA, hope it can be derailed. A Rome court will hear on Tuesday Air One's argument that it should be allowed to make an offer and SEA is suing Alitalia for 1.25 billion euros ($1.86 billion) over its decision to scale down its Milan hub in favour of Rome in a cost-cutting overhaul. Prati said Alitalia may counter-sue SEA and anyone else who tried to stop the privatisation.
