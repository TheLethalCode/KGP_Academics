 BELEK, Turkey, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guus Hiddink has accused some of his fellow coaches of self interest in the latest club versus country row that has threatened Russia's preparations for the Euro 2008 finals. With Russia not playing a game this week, Spartak Moscow coach Stanislav Cherchesov refused to allow striker Roman Pavlyuchenko and winger Vladimir Bystrov to attend the national team's training camp in Turkey's Mediterranean resort of Belek.

"We're trying hard to put together the best Russian team, so that it can compete on equal terms with all the major European powers and we need everyone pulling together, not trying to disrupt our preparation." Other club coaches, including Dick Advocaat of Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg, and CSKA Moscow boss Valery Gazzayev were also initially reluctant to release their players. "I don't think you can call what they'll be doing in Belek training -- it sounds more like a social get-together for a barbeque by the pool," Gazzayev said sarcastically. "But I'm a law-abiding citizen so I must let my players go." Three players, Sevilla striker Alexander Kerzhakov, Nuremberg winger Ivan Saenko and Sporting midfielder Marat Izmailov, had still not arrived at the camp by Monday. "Saenko is injured, so he's not coming because he can't train anyway," said Hiddink. "But I hope that both Kerzhakov and Izmailov will still come, probably on Monday after they have played their league matches. "What is important for me that every single player wanted to come here. They understand the importance of this training camp. "I just hope that some of our coaches would also understand such simple things
