 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Slain Awami League leader Shah AMS Kibria's son Reza Kibria Sunday alleged that the government was shifting the responsibility of his father's killing onto militant outfit Harkatul Jihad to save the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami. Reza slammed the interim government at an AL-sponsored discussion meeting in the city on Kibria, a former finance minister. He also made a tacit attack on the Awami League, as well. "Had Awami League waged a movement after the August 21, 2004 grenade attack, my father would not have to die this way," he said. Blaming the latest BNP-led coalition government for the killing, senior AL's policymaking presidium member Abdur Razzak said, "Kibria was killed as he was uncompromising on principle." "They (the four-party alliance) staged the killing in a planned way to deprive Awami League of leadership." In the meeting at the AL's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue the party leaders demanded immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency and announcement of election date. They said they were preparing for election and wanted to cooperate with the government in all areas including unconditional dialogue. They demanded release of party president Sheikh Hasina and other political detainees. Reza said, "After independence killing intellectuals has become a trend. He said one or two killers of my father can now be seen hobnobbing with the BNP faction that claims to be pro-reform." Presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury demanded immediate withdrawal of emergency and announcement of election schedule. Her colleague Amir Hossain Amu said, "If all follow the decision of the Awami League presidium, the unity of the party will remain intact. Unity in Awami League is necessary to thwart any conspiracy." Calling for the trial of the killings of intellectuals, he said if the trial was held many war criminals will face the music. AL presidium members Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam also spoke. bdnews
