<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday granted bail to detained former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury in the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust corruption case. The court also ordered the government and Anticorruption Commission to explain why inclusion of the case under emergency powers rules should not be declared illegal. The case accuses Sheikh Hasina and Toufique-e-Elahi, among others, of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes in the name of the Bangabahdhu Memorial Trust in exchange for illegally awarding contracts for three barge-mounted power plants. The bench of justices Shah Abu Naeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam ruled upon the writ petition filed by the former energy secretary. It asked the home secretary and ACC chairman, among others, to come up with a reply in four weeks. On Sept 2, 2007, ACC deputy director ASM Sabbir Ahmed filed a case with Tejgaon Police Station against eightpersons, including former prime minister Hasina, Toufique-e-Elahi and managing director of Summit Group Md Aziz Khan. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 20. Toufique-e-Elahi surrendered to the trial court on Nov 16 and was sent to jail. Barristers Rafiq-ul-Haque and Fazle Nur Taposh moved the writ petition for the former secretary. bdnews
