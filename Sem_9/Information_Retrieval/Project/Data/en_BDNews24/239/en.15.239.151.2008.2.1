 Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)  Friday marks the beginning of February's month long commemoration of the sacrifices made by the Language Movement Martyrs in 1952. The names of Salam, Barkat, Rafique, Jabbar and Safiur are remembered for their enduring sacrifice to the nation. Social, cultural and political organisations have drawn up various programmes to mark the events of February 1952, when the former East Pakistan fought for the right to speak in their mother tongue.
