 Dhaka, February 01 (bdnews24.com)  The Higher Secondary Examinations scheduled to begin in April have been postponed until May, a senior HSC exams controller said Friday. The final day for exam registration has also been extended to Feb18, Md Jainul Abedin, deputy controller of HSC examinations for the Dhaka Board, told bdnews24.com. Abedin said that the 2008 examinations will now start on May 29, rather than April 29. The exams controller said one of the reasons for the delay was the amount of time pupils had lost from their schooling in areas hit by Cyclone Sidr. The move follows the earlier postponement of the SSC exams by a month. They are now scheduled to begin on March 27. bdnews
