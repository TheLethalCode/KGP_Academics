<TITLE> Kenya's bickering sides back at bargaining table </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former UN chief Kofi Annan brought Kenya's rival sides together again on Monday after a weekend of clashes cast a pall over a skeleton deal meant to stop a month of post-election bloodshed. Annan, 69, mediated an agreement between the parties on Friday to take steps to end violence that has killed around 900 people, plus a commitment to resolve the crisis within 15 days. The talks resumed on Monday with a Red Cross briefing on the extent of the bloodshed, officials said. Underscoring the difficulty Annan faces, President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga traded harsh words on Friday. Clashes between groups of youths claiming allegiance to one side or the other raged over the weekend. Kibaki says he fairly won the Dec. 27 election that returned him to power and accuses Odinga of fanning violence. Odinga says Kibaki stole victory from him and refuses to recognise him as president. Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister Moses Wetangula, who just returned from an African Union summit where his country was in the spotlight, said the east African regional bloc IGAD -- chaired by Kenya's government -- would be involved in efforts to end the crisis. "IGAD countries are sending their foreign ministers to Kenya on Wednesday to express solidarity with the people of Kenya and the dialogue that is going on," he told reporters. Wetangula said people on both sides had made statements "that could spoil the mediation talks" and urged a rapid solution. "We cannot afford to be a permanent feature on television screens for all the wrong reasons," he said. Kenya's image as a stable and prosperous African state has taken a serious hit as a result of a crisis that has harmed the economy and exposed bitter tribal divisions. At least 900 people have been killed in politically-sparked ethnic clashes and police response to protests, and some 300,000 forced to flee their homes in one of Kenya's worst periods since independence from Britain in 1963. In the volatile and ethnically mixed western region, gangs fired arrows and threw rocks at each other in front of police who were unable or unwilling to intervene on Sunday. On Monday, residents said calm had returned save for a little looting, and urged the politicians to get to work. "Raila and Kibaki must be serious. They must not talk together and then go to the press saying something different. They should agree on what they tell Kenyans. We are confused," farmer Sylvester Barake said, sitting in an empty gas station. In an indication of gangs being organised, a white pickup delivered food and milk to youths in Chebilat before they used tyres, petrol and straw to torch a medical centre. Despite Annan's efforts, Kibaki and Odinga remain at loggerheads, their bitter feud still raging over who won a vote observers said was too badly run for anyone to know. If Annan achieves a compromise, it is unclear how quickly that will quell ethnic tensions, now in a cycle of attack and revenge that police appear unable to contain. What started as a political dispute has uncorked decades-old divisions between tribal groups over land, wealth and power, dating from British colonial rule and stoked by Kenyan politicians for personal gain during 44 years of independen
