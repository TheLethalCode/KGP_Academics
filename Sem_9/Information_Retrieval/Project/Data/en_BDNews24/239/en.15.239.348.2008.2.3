<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The University Grants Commission is set to introduce courses in Bangla language, culture and history in the private universities. "Bangla is a neglected language in most private universities. There is often no Bangla department," UGC chairman Prof Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com. "We have asked the universities to at least introduce some courses on Bangla language, culture and history if it is not possible to introduce a fully-fledged Bangla department," said Nazrul. The UGC chairman said a limited number of private institutions have already introduced courses on Bangla language and culture, while some others were considering the move. English, however, remains the dominant academic language in the 51 private universities of the country. Private universities currently concentrate on business and computer science courses, where the market demand is greatest. "Educationists consider it unwise to neglect Bangla, although they acknowledge the importance of English," said the UGC chairman. Prof Muhammad Samad of Dhaka University's Social Welfare Institute, told bdnews24.com that he thought Bangla should be the main academic language in Bangladesh. "When we speak in another language we decode it into the mother tongue in our minds," said Samad. "It will help economically and socially as well as in the political sphere if Bangla is the main academic language of the country," he added. bdnews24.
