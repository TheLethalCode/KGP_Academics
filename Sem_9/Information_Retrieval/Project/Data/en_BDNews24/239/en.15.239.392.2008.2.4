 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) - The judge who presided over an extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina abruptly left the courtroom Monday after defence and prosecution lawyers ended up in a brawl. Full Story Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim were taken to the makeshift court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises at 9:45am, in connection with the case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. Amid altercations between the lawyers for the plaintiff and the accused over depositions, judge Md Azizul Haque left the courtroom around 10:00am. The court sits again Tuesday, a court official said. The chaos stemmed from a move to rerecord the deposition of the plaintiff, which the defence lawyers opposed, saying it was just an unnecessary repeat. Kamrul Islam, a defence lawyer, said: "Honourable court, you had asked us to quiz the plaintiff after completing his deposition. But you are now saying that the plaintiff's testimony will continue. You have done it under influence of the state side. You can't deliver justice this way." The lawyer accused the judge of issuing a "biased order". "This is not fair." As Azam continued to speak, the judge walked out on the trial of Hasina without saying a word. In his Jan 30 deposition in court, Azam said that Sheikh Selim was the only one he could recognise and that the other accused were not known to him in connection with the case. Defence lawyers said Monday was the day for them to record the plaintiff's testimony. Earlier on Jan 24, Azam said in a press briefing that he had not filed any case against Sheikh Hasina. "I had sued only Sheikh Selim." Both sides traded blame for triggering the chaos. Defence counsel Golam Arif Tipu said the judge's leaving the courtroom was "unprecedented", adding: "There's no example of any judge leaving the courtroom without saying anything." State counsel Syed Shamim Ahsan said: "Defence counsels were responsible, and they did so to delay the trial." It all began immediately after the judge took his seat to preside over the case. Defence counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman sought permission to quiz the plaintiff on his deposition he had given earlier. State counsel ABM Sharfuddin Ahmed Mukul said their deposition did not end and hurriedly started questioning Azam, which prompted protests from the defence counsels. Azam continued to speak amid chaos, explaining why he had not filed the case during political regimes. "If I would have filed the charges during a political government there had been a very chance of political interference." Mukul said: "The plaintiff erroneously mentioned June 10 instead of June 13 in his case documents. It needs a correction." Amid protests by the defence, the judge said: "Such a correction is not possible now." Then the state counsel asked Azam if he was the local agent of a Russian company that had signed the agreement with the Power Development Board for building the power plant. Azam said: "Yes, I am." The defence continued protesting the move, saying: "The matter was settled earlier. There is no need to repeat." The judge immediately looked at the previous day's proceedings and ruled: "It was recorded the previous day." State counsel Mukul reacted sharply, tossed case papers on the table and angrily said: "I won't handle this case." One defence lawyer said: "The public prosecutor's motive is not fair. He is even threatening the court." Amid unfolding scenes of chaos, the judge walked out. Hasina, standing in the dock, was quick to say: "How can fair justice come when the prosecutor reprimands the judge?" Later the defence side submitted an appeal to a court official to expunge Monday's part of the plaintiff's deposition by the state, but the official initially refused to accept it. Hasina stepped in and announced she would not leave the court until the defence appeal is accepted. The official listened to her. bdnews24.co
