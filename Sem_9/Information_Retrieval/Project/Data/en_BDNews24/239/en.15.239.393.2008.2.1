 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Energy Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Power generation in the country has fallen during the crucial irrigation season due to problems in gas supply. Current levels of production are on average 400 to 500 megawatts less per day. Power Division officials, who requested anonymity, said the Shikalbaha Power Plant had closed due to shortfalls in gas production. Gas production has also fallen in Rauzan in Chittagong, RPCL in Mymensingh as well as in Ghorashal and Haripur. Gas production fell by 560 megawatts on Jan 30, while the previous day's production dropped by 355 megawatts. Power Division secretary M Fauzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com Friday that the problem would not be long term. "The busiest part of the irrigation season starts from February 15. A number of units will be producing by then, which will increase power generation," said Khan. "We hope we will be able to meet the power demands for irrigation. From March gas demand in fertiliser factories and households will decrease," said the secretary. Officials at the Power Division said the crisis has mainly hit power plants in the Chittagong and Dhaka areas. A further reason cited for the production shortfall was repair work being carried out on gas pipe lines. Power Development Board officials said ten electricity generation units are currently operating on limited capacity for different reasons. Of them, two units located in Shikalbaha with a capacity of 88 megawatts are currently producing only 50 megawatts. Rauzan Power Plant in Chittagong, which has a capacity of 360 megawatts, is now producing only 120 megawatts, while the Rural Power Company in Mymensingh is supplying 150 megawatts, out of a capacity of 210 MW. A meeting at the power, energy and mineral resources ministry Wednesday was told that the highest gas production so far in 2008 was 1734 million cubic feet on Jan 22, while current demand stands at 1865 million cubic feet. The power sector's demand is 739 million cubic feet, of which it is currently receiving 643 million cubic feet. Fertiliser factories require 289 million cubic feet, although supply now stands at only 249 million cubic feet. bdnews
