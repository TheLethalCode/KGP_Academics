 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union on Monday welcomed with relief the re-election of pro-Western Boris Tadic as president of Serbia, saying it would speed up moves towards EU candidacy for the biggest former Yugoslav republic.

Solana said he would speak to Tadic later on Monday to discuss the possible signing this week of the interim accord, offered by EU foreign ministers last week because Belgrade has not yet met the condition for a formal EU Stabilisation and Cooperation Agreement. The Slovenian EU Presidency said on Sunday it welcomed the high turnout in an election which appeared to be "free and fair" in a preliminary assessment. It said the EU wished to deepen its relationship with Serbia and to accelerate its progress towards the EU, including candidate status. EU foreign ministers agreed last week to invite Belgrade to sign the interim political accord on Feb. 7 but the Serbian government has not yet taken a decision.
