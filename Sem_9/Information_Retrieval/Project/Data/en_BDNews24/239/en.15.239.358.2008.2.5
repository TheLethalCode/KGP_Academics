 BAGHDAD, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's temporary new national flag was raised over the country's parliament for the first time on Tuesday in a symbolic break with the past, but many ordinary Iraqis remain unhappy their old banner has been replaced. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki presided over the flag-raising outside his offices in central Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone during a ceremony watched by cabinet members and leading dignitaries.

"Our so-called leaders have been doing nothing for us so far and now they want to erase our symbolic flag and make a new one," Um Ahmed, a woman in her 60s from southern Baghdad's Doura neighbourhood, told Reuters. "That's the only thing that they want to do," she said. The new flag, which has been approved for a year after which a permanent replacement will be chosen, looks much like the old one, first flown after the coup by Saddam's Baath party in 1963.
