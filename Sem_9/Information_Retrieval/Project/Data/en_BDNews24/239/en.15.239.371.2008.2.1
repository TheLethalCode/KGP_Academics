 LONDON, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose towards $92 a barrel on Friday as OPEC oil producers decided against raising production, despite fears of a looming recession in top consumer, the United States. U.S. light crude for March delivery rose 1 cent to $91.76 a barrel by 1151 GMT, rebounding from lows of $90.64 earlier in the session. It settled 58 cents lower in New York on Thursday, after rallying on the back of a rising stock market. London Brent crude was 19 cents down at $92.02 a barrel. OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna agreed to keep oil supplies unchanged, rejecting calls from consumer countries to pump more oil amid worries that high fuel prices are adding to recessionary pressures in the West. The decision was widely expected, with a chorus of ministers reiterating ahead of the meeting that the oil market was well supplied, and a small group -- Iran and Venezuela -- even calling for a production cut at their next gathering on March 5. Analysts said OPEC appeared keen not to repeat its experience of 1997 when it boosted supplies ahead of an economic slowdown and prices collapsed to $10 a barrel. "I absolutely expect them to consider cutting output in March... To me the only question is will it be a formal cut or...just cut informally," said Mike Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale. "A lot depends of the price itself. If prices drop another $10 it's easier for them to have a formal cut." Simon Wardell, analyst at Global Insight said OPEC could decide next month to cut output by as much as 750,000 barrels per day from April 1. OPEC's decision comes as concerns mount the United States is headed for a recession after a slew of recent economic data pointed to a deteriorating economy. A major US recession could impact the world economy and with it oil demand and prices. "OPEC will not see their roles as defending economic growth but as that of providing a stable flow of oil at a fair price," said Robin Batchelor, managing director at BlackRock Merrill Lynch Investment Managers. A gloomy outlook for the US economy has sent many speculative investors, who helped propel oil's rally above $100 a barrel last month, into safer havens. Business activity in the US Midwest expanded in January but at a slightly slower rate than expected, as new orders dropped and price pressures accelerated, a report showed on Thursday. Additionally, the number of US workers filing new claims for jobless aid surged last week to the highest since October 2005, and consumer spending softened at the end of last year, government data showed. Analysts said the market was awaiting fresh data on US non-farm payrolls later on Friday for further clues about the pace of deterioration of the economy. The US Federal Reserve has sought to ward off a recession by a series of interest rate cuts. It has cut rates by 125 basis points in two tranches in the last nine da
