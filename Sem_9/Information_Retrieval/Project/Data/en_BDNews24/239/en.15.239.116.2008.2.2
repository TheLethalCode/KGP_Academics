<TEXT>
 Barisal, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Sector Commanders of the 1971 Independence War have announced to press on with their campaign for holding of the war crimes trial. The campaign was bolstered Saturday when some 1500 freedom fighters of Barisal Division expressed solidarity with the movement against the killers and collaborators of Pakistani occupation forces in the nine-month war. From a rally at an auditorium, held from morning to afternoon, they said they had waged war against the collaborators. The divisional rally of the freedom fighters started at the auditorium with the offering of floral wreaths by five sector commanders at the killing ground in the city. Sector commander AK Khandaker said, "Our struggle will continue until the present caretaker government takes the responsibility of trying the war criminals and start the process." "About 80 organisations of the country have so far showed support to our demand for trial of the war criminals." Another sector commander, former army chief KM Shafiullah said, "Ignoring the liberation war means ignoring the constitution of Bangladesh. "So alongside filing sedition cases against those who ignore the constitution trial for audacious statements of identified war criminals [Jamaat-e-Islami stalwarts Matiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid] must be held." "If we were defeated in the liberation war the collaborators of the Pakistani occupation forces would have hanged us. Now they have been defeated and so they must be punished." He added the collaborators were trying to hinder the efforts to bring them to justice by making the false claim that independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had granted general amnesty to war criminals. Those who make such statements are belittling the leader, he said and added that the process of the trial of the war criminals had been halted after his assassination. Addressing the interim government, he said, "You have done many good things. We request you to start the trial of the war criminals so that the elected government in future can complete the process." He hoped that the political parties would include the issue of the trial of the war criminals in their election manifestoes. Sector commander Chitta Ranjan Dutta said the political parties were responsible for the division among the freedom fighters; they had used the freedom fighters for their own interest. He said now was the time to put pressure on the government to try the war criminals. Datta said if necessary a war like that of 1971 would be declared to restore the 1972 constitution. He argued that peace would be established if the war criminals were tried. Sector commander Amin Ahmed Chowdhury said the trial of the war criminals is a pre-requisite for fair elections, thriving democracy and robust development. Sector commander and former army chief M Harun-or-Rashid said the country would live in peace the day the trial of the war criminals started. He said precedence was there that war criminals had been tried even 100 years after the war. He commented that the war crimes trial could even be held on a foreign soil. He quoted Amnesty International secretary general Irene Khan to say that trial of war criminals is going on through the UN in 31 countries. Harun said a group was making excuses in favour of Jamaat-e-Islami that any such trial now would derail the next election. Sector commander M Masudur Rahman said the present government could start the trial of the war criminals in special tribunals. "If you (the government) cannot try the war criminals take international assistance. It is not our demand, the people of the country and the international community are demanding trial of the war criminals." Dr Sarwar Habib, Mahbub Uddin, Rashed Khan Menon and sub sector commander Ziauddin also spoke in the rally organised by Barisal District Mukitjoddha Command Council. Sheikh Kutubuddin chaired the rally. bdnews2
