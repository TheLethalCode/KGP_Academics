 Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia is among 24 states taking part in "Super Tuesday," the Feb. 5 contests in which voters will choose nominees from the Democratic and Republican parties for the November US presidential election. With a population of 9.4 million, Georgia has been one of the fastest growing U.S. states since 1990. Atlanta and its suburbs have grown by 67 percent during that time. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Tuesday showed Democratic Illinois Sen. Barack Obama leading rival New York Sen. Hillary Clinton by 20 points. Among Republicans, recent polls showed a close race between Arizona Sen. John McCain, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Polls close at 7 p.m. EST (2400 GMT). Democrats award their delegates on a proportional basis, while Republicans award all their delegates to the winner. Both primary contests are open to independent voters. Georgia voters favored Democrats from the end of the Civil War through the 1990s, but the governor's mansion, state legislature and two US Senate seats are now in Republican hands. The state has voted Republican in the past two presidential elections. Famous political figures from Georgia include former Democratic President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jimmy Carter and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1990s. Atlanta, home to Coca-Cola and CNN, has emerged in recent years as a hotbed of hip-hop music. Georgia is now home to more blacks than any state except New York and Texas. Median household income in the state is $48,388, slightly higher than the national median of $44,334. About 13.3 percent of the population live below the poverty line, compared with 12.3 percent nationally. The median age is 35.7, slightly younger than than the national average.
