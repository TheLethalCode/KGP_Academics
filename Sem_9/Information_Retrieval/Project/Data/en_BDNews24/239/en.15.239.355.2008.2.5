 TASHKENT, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uzbekistan, criticised by the West over its human rights record, has pardoned three activists in recent weeks, including a man jailed for seven years after he briefed foreign media about a crackdown in the town of Andizhan. Saijakhon Zainabitdinov was imprisoned in 2006 on charges of conspiring with "terrorists", defaming the state and religious extremism. On Tuesday, Zainabitdinov's son Zakirjon said his father was freed in the latest high-profile amnesty in the Central Asian state. "He is feeling fine," Zakirjon told Reuters by telephone from Andizhan. Justice officials could not be reached for comment. Uzbek leader Islam Karimov, re-elected in December in a vote judged neither free nor fair by Western monitors, has softened his stance towards the West over recent months in what diplomats say is part of a bid to emerge from isolation. In Andizhan, witnesses said hundreds of people were killed when troops opened fire on a demonstration in May 2005. Karimov blamed the violence on Islamist rebels. He put the number of dead at 187 and said most were terrorists or security forces. Zainabitdinov was one of few witnesses who agreed to have his name printed by independent reporters. Umida Niyazova, a translator for New York-based Human Rights Watch, said on Monday she had received an official amnesty letter over the weekend. Niyazova received a 7-year suspended sentence last year after she agreed to criticise international human rights groups publicly. Her case was described as disturbing by the United States. The independent human rights group Ezgulik said one of its activists, Karim Bazarbayev, was also pardoned and freed from jail last month. After the Andizhan riot, Western states condemned Karimov for excessive use of force. In exchange, he effectively severed his ties with the United States and evicted US troops from a military base in Uzbekist
