 Chittagong, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  About 100 people Monday formed a human chain in front of Chittagong Press Club, demanding the release of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. Protesters who identified themselves as residents of Fatikchhari and Chittagong took to the streets carrying banners and placards around 11:30am. The human chain lasted seven minutes. The demonstrators wore black cloths around their heads. Some demonstrators told reporters that the government must release all political detainees, including Hasina and Khaleda. The demonstrators also demanded a quick end to the state of emergency and protested the rising prices of essential commodities. If the government does not respond to their demands, they will launch a broader movement in Chittagong, the protesters said. They left the scene before the police arrived. bdnews
