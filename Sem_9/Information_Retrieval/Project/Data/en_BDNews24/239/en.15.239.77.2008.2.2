 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Mizan Uddin Ahmed Saturday stepped down from the post of Brothers Union general secretary and general membership, citing personal reason. "I have stepped down from the post of Brothers Union general secretary and its general membership due to personal reason," Ahmed read out a written paper at the press conference in a city hotel Saturday. He, however, later said that the last year's club failure in the Premier Division Cricket League and the B. League prompted him to step aside from the club activity. In the last season, Bothers Union relegated to the First Division Cricket League from the 12-team Premier League, and finished fifth in the 11-team B. League. "No man is beyond mistake, and I might have mistaken during my tenure and all should take it with a grace," said Ahmed giving thanks to club's governing boy, executive committee and well-wishers. Ahmed, who took over as the general secretary in 2003, hoped a dynamic person would step in and carry on the success of the club. The Gopibagh-based outfit emerged champions twice in the Premier Division Football League, clinched the title in the National Football League, became runners-up in Bordoloi Cup in India and played AFC Cup during the four-year stint of Mizan Uddin Ahmed.
