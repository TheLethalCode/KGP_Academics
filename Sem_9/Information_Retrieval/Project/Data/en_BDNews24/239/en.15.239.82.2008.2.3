<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday said detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had given no guidance on the unification of the two factions of the party. "BNP is united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. I didn't receive any message from the leader in jail through her lawyer. The leaders and workers have questions about what is being circulated," the Khaleda-appointed BNP secretary general said in a press briefing. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokan after visiting the party chairperson at the special jail had told reporters Friday: "(Khaleda) has asked us to unite the party. She has urged the nationalist forces to unite for the sake of the country and the party." But when Delwar was asked about the matter in Sunday's press briefing, he declined having received any such message. On the schism between the two factions of the party, he said: "[Khaleda] does not think BNP has split into two factions. The chairperson will decision on those who strayed by working against the party constitution. There have been several instances of [such dissidents] returning to the party in the past." "I cannot do anything about those expelled for disobeying the chairperson's decision." Barrister Khokan, however, at a press briefing at his Dhanmondi chamber later Sunday evening again reiterated: "[Khaleda Zia] has asked that the party be unitedit has not been fabricated by me." "Those who do not want unity have tactfully influenced secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and made him misunderstand." At the same time he also refuted Delwar's that the BNP leader did not have any contact with former finance minister M Saifur Rahman for the last one and a half years. Khokan told reporters that before meeting with Khaleda Zia at the special jail on Friday he had talked with Khandaker Delwar at his NAM flat for more than one hour Thursday evening. He said, "During my talks with Khaleda Zia in connection with the case regarding the Election Commission she discussed some political matters and asked me to tell the party secretary general and leaders and workers of the party. " "Accordingly I told reporters after coming out of the jail. BNP has to be united forgetting all misunderstandings for the sake of the country and the party. At the same time nationalist forces have to be united," Khokan said. "This is not my statement, but [Khaleda Zia's]. But I don't know whether Khandaker Delwar as a senior leader and secretary general could understand the message of the statement," the lawyer added. Refuting Khandaker Delwar's statement earlier Sunday, Khokan said: "They gave the secretary general wrong information. He should have sent another lawyer to meet Khaleda and check what I reported." "It would have brought out the truth. But instead of doing that the secretary general being influenced by those who want to destroy party unity has raised questions about me." However, Khokan said emphatically that BNP would be united soon under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. He added that he had been Khaleda Zia's lawyer since 1996. At present also he is representing Khaleda and Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco in various cases. Meanwhile, in Delwar's earlier press briefing at his Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat Sunday, the BNP leader demanded the immediate release of the former prime minister and arrangement of better treatment for her sons Tarique and Arafat. Delwar alleged that Khaleda and sons had been unjustly detained in false and fabricated cases. He also alleged Tarique had been tortured in remand. "Torture in the name of interrogation is against the laws of the land and existing rules of International Human Rights Commission. Tarique Rahman is devastated physically and mentally because of the torture." Citing test results of Tarique and Arafat at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, he said their condition was serious. He demanded that authorities either arranged better treatment or allowed them to get better treatment by freeing them. Replying to a question, Delwar said, "There is no constitutional basis of forming a national government before elections. If that is done it will be unconstitutional." bdnews24
