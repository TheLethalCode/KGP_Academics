<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government will encourage export of manpower from the monga -hit districts in the greater Rangpur region, the foreign affairs adviser said Sunday. People depending on agriculture face a seasonal poverty or monga for two months from October every year because of a lack of work. As part of the measure, the government will set up more technical schools in the Monga-hit region to produce skilled and semi-skilled manpower to be sent to labour-receiving countries. Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said he had convened a special meeting at foreign ministry Monday. Representatives from the ministries, agencies and NGOs are expected to attend the meeting to find out ways. "The government will take special measures to encourage export of manpower from monga -stricken areas," Iftekhar told journalists at the foreign ministry Sunday. "This goal has been included in the 14-point package for North Bengal announced by the chief adviser following the recent advisory council meeting in Rangpur," he added. "We have decided to strengthen the technical training centres in the north as part of this programme by enhancing capacity and adjusting the curriculum." The government announced the labour export programmes from the greater Rangpur districts as countries like Oman, Qatar, Canada, Russia and other countries have asked for skilled and semi-skilled manpower from Bangladesh. Districts of Rangpur, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram and Gaibandha, known as greater Rangpur region, are considered poorest in Bangladesh. Unlike in the southern Bangladesh, people of Rangpur region are not interested in going abroad for work. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday said monga had to be eliminated through creation of employment and poverty alleviation. He said the government has mounted an intense vigil on the near famine-like situation in the impoverished swathe of land. Stressing creation of temporary employment to face monga , the chief adviser said, "If necessary employment has to be created abroad to face the situation." He was speaking as the chief guest at a views exchange meeting with the local officials, noted persons and common people at Gangachara upazila sadar in Rangpur Sunday morning. The meeting was held on Gangachhara Upazila Parishad premises. The chief adviser said for combating monga 1.40 lakh VGF cards had been allocated for Rangpur this season. Of those, 30,000 have been allocated for Gangachhara and each cardholder will get 15 kg rice every month for next five months. Expressing satisfaction at the record potato cultivation in Rangpur this season, the chief adviser said, "This is a happy and encouraging instance. It will increase the farmers' income on one hand and meet the demand of other areas on the other." He urged the agriculture officials to perform their duties properly including advising the farmers. He expressed concern at the shrinking cultivable land in the region and stressed maximum utilisation of land. Fakhruddin said steps had been taken to increase boro harvest. The Power Development Board (PDB) and Rural Electrification Associations have been given necessary allocation to ensure uninterrupted irrigation through collecting more power transformers. He said the people of the region did not get scope for employment abroad, which was why his administration was going to take initiatives to export skilled manpower. Local people demanded nationalisation of different educational institutions of Gangachhara Upazila and permanent measures for checking river erosion and supplying gas through pipeline. The chief adviser, who is on a two-day visit, later distributed rice among the destitute under the VGF programme. bdnews24.com/co
