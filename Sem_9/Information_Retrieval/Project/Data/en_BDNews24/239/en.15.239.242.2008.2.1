 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com) - A group of people Friday vandalised three makeshift outlets of Grameenphone on Dhaka University campus, protesting what they said was an "imperialistic force". Students said that up to eight people, believed to be students of Dhaka University, attacked the outlets near the university's Central Library around 3.30pm. Grameenphone is the sponsor of the 22nd Kabita Utsab (Poetry Festival), organised by Jatiya Kabita Parishad. One of the protesters, Mujib, who gave one name, accused the country's largest mobile operator of turning national culture into a commodity by financing the poetry festival. The protesters snatched GP banners from the stalls and burnt them. The poetry festival began on the DU Central Library premises Friday. bdnew
