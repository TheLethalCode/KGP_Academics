 CYANGUGU, Rwanda, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aid workers pulled bodies from collapsed buildings in southern Rwanda on Monday after an earthquake that killed at least 43 people and injured hundreds across the Great Lakes region. Near simultaneous quakes ripped through eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Rwanda on Sunday, toppling buildings and driving people from their homes. The first quake, with a magnitude of 6.0 and its epicentre in Congo, came at 9:34 a.m. (0734 GMT), followed by a 5.0 quake in densely populated southern Rwanda at 1:56 p.m. (1156 GMT). "Until now we lost 37 people and have around 500 people injured who are in Gihundwe Hospital and hospitals in other districts," said Jean Pierre Turatsinze, the mayor of Rusizi district, of which Cyangugu is the capital. In Congo, the acting governor of South Kivu province, Bernard Watunakanza, said at least six people had been killed and 238 seriously injured. MORE SUPPLIES NEEDED Watunakanza said they needed more supplies to treat so many wounded at the hospitals. "We need surgical kits, X-ray film and other medical material. We need a lot of these kinds of things," he told Reuters by telephone. South Kivu provincial health minister Timothe Kwalya said most Bukavu residents slept outside last night, and many still worry there could be more tremors. "People are looking for their belongings amidst the rubble. They try to go into their houses, but they don't stay very long. They are still afraid," he said. Earthquakes are common in the western Great Rift Valley -- a seismically active fault line straddling western Uganda, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and neighbouring Tanzania. In 1994, a magnitude 6 tremor in the foothills of western Uganda's Rwenzori mountains killed at least six people. In 1966, a magnitude 7 earthquake killed 157 people and injured more than 1,300 in the Semliki Valley, also in western Ugan
