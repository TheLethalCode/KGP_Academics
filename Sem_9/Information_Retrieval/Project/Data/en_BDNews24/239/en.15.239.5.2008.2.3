 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Devon Smith's career-best score inspired West Indies to 295 for seven in the fifth and final one-day international against South Africa on Sunday. Opener Smith lashed 10 fours and three sixes in his 91 off just 76 balls, while Patrick Browne made a bright 49 not out and Shivnarine Chanderpaul a more sedate 51. Shaun Pollock, playing his last one-day international, stood out among a South African attack that was mostly expensive, taking one for 33 in 10 overs to finish with 393 wickets in 303 matches with an economy rate of just 3.67 runs per over. Pollock struck the first blow when he had Brenton Parchment (2) caught at a short backward point but Smith hammered the rest of the South African attack in his second half-century in 25 matches, improving on the 61 he scored against England in Bridgetown in 2006/07. Pollock's first spell of seven overs cost just 14 runs while 66 runs were pummelled at the other end. West Indies were in control as Smith and Chanderpaul put on a run-a-ball second-wicket stand of 137 before Charl Langeveldt struck two vital blows in successive overs, having Smith caught behind by Mark Boucher and trapping Chanderpaul leg-before. The West Indies batsmen battled to keep the scoring momentum going although Bravo, with 40 off 34 balls, and then Browne and Rawl Lewis (28 not out) in an unbeaten eighth-wicket stand of 54 off 33 balls, did hit out enthusiastically in the closing overs to hand the visitors a respectable score on a flat pitch
