 Chittagong, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Another case of bird flu was detected in a dead crow in Pathantooly in the port city Monday. The discovery prompted an emergency meeting of senior officials from Chittagong's district administration, Chittagong City Corporation and district livestock office Friday night to draw out prevention measures. The entry of poultry and eggs from outside the district has been strictly controlled and two check posts have been set up at Shubhapur Bridge and Mirersarai Police Station to spray disinfectant. Chittagong's district administration and city corporation have opened control rooms in addition to spraying Vircon in high-risk markets of the city every day. "Bird flu has been found in a crow, but the virus has not been found in any chicken or eggs anywhere in the district," Chittagong deputy commissioner Ashraf Shamim. He said the district administration had directed upazila officers to ensure the cleanliness of markets and spray disinfectant in poultry retailers' shops. Initiatives have also been taken to monitor all poultry farms and raise awareness among the workers and owners. CCC chief executive officer Khairul Alam said the cleanliness drive had been intensified in the city from Saturday. "Not only poultry shops, but also market refuse areas are being sprayed. Ward commissioners are supervising the work," Alam told bdnews24.com. Chittagong district livestock officer Abdul Mannan confirmed that no bird flu virus had yet been detected in any chicken or duck in Chittagong. The district livestock officer said Chittagong had no laboratory to test for the virus. "Specimens have to be sent to FDIL in Feni for testing. It takes a few days to get a report back from them," he said. The livestock officer added that only the dead crow found in Pathantooly had been sent for testing. "The Directorate of Livestock has the necessary vaccines and medicines to meet any epidemic, including bird flu," said Mannan. bdnews24
