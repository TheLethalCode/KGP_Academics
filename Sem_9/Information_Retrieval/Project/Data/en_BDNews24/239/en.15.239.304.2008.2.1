 Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association convened a meeting with garment factory owners and workers Friday over the death of a worker. Deputy police commissioner for Mirpur zone Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that the owners of World Dresses, representatives of workers, BGMEA and law-enforcement agencies met around 10am in the face of the situation. The meeting discussed different demands of the workers. Another meeting was scheduled at the BGMEA Bhaban for 5pm Friday, but was later postponed. In another development, the chairman of Vertex Group, MA Gani, told bdnews24.com: "We have already given Tk 1 lakh in compensation to the family of the victim, Khokan Thursday. His family will be given another four lakh takas. Besides, if necessary all grown-up members of Khokan's family will be provided with work. We will also cooperate with police for the trial of the persons involved in the incident. Meanwhile, agitating workers tried to put up barricades on the Mirpur Mazaar Road Friday morning, but police foiled the move. The workers, however, barricaded the road in front of World Dresses at Mirpur-1 for about an hour. Three Bangladesh Rifles pick-up vans were seen patrolling the area in the afternoon. Police, meantime, picked up three youths from Pallabi area with two firearms suspecting that the arms were brought in to spread labour unrest in the area. The arrestees were Nayan, Rubel and Babu. They were carrying a revolver, a single-shooter gun and eight rounds of ammunition. The deputy police commissioner also said: "We were tipped that three young men would be arriving in the restive zone in a black cab. They would then open fire on the demonstrating workers and raise hell in the area." "The arrested youths belong to the same group led by one Jumman, who had incited the workers to resort to unrest in the preceding week. Police are trying to arrest Jumman," he said. Demonstrating workers alleged that hooligans employed by a factory owner beat co-worker Khokan, 30, to death Wednesday night. In the same incident, another worker Malek, 30, suffered severe injuries and was admitted to hospital. Senior police officers and BGMEA leaders sat at an urgent meeting Thursday to discuss the death of the worker, where a decision to pay Tk 5 lakh to the family of the deceased was taken. Malek told bdnews24.com that Mosharraf, elder brother of their factory owner, and Ashraf, the production manager along with some hooligans, beat them (Khokan and Malek) up severely, accusing them of stealing money. Severely wounded, they were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital late at night where doctors declared Khokan dead prompting the alleged attackers to flee the scene immediately. Hearing of their colleague Khokan's death, workers went to the DMCH morgue and identified the body. Unwilling to be named, the factory workers said that they were told Thursday that the factory would remain closed for some days as the generator had gone out of order. In a statement, BGMEA regretted the untoward incident and said: "The security personnel found two workers hiding in the toilet area after the factory had pulled down the shutters. As the sentries beat them up badly, Khokan suffered severe injuries. He was taken to a local clinic first and then to the DMCH where the duty doctors declared him dead." Mirpur police chief Mohiuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "Around 8am Friday, the agitated workers of World Dresses started gathering in front of the factory. At the time workers from some nearby factories also tried to join them. But they could not assemble due to police obstruction." Mohiuddin Ahmed said the workers barricaded the road leading to the disruption of traffic movement for about half an hour on the Darus Salam Road. Later additional police force was brought in and the workers were chased away. Besides, three BDR pick up vans came to assist the police at about 11 am. Mostafa, a shop owner in front of World Dresses, said that when the workers tried to block the road in front of the factory in the morning, police clubbed them and drove them away. Agitated workers also hurled brickbats at police. bdnews24.com
