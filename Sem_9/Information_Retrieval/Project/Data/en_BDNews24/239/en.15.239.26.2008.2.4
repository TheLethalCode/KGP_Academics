 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank will make a clear policy for retail banks to cut interest rates to grease the wheels of investment amid complaints by businessmen that rates are too high. In a news briefing Monday, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam unveiled various changes to lending and borrowing practices and said the changes were imminent. Charges on bank drafts, credit cards and letters of credit could also be lowered, the adviser said. But the authorities are still undecided on the new rates and the sectors to be covered by the new decision. All will be fixed in consultation with the banks, Azizul said. He specified that the move would reduce the gap between the rates of deposits and loanscalled "interest rate spread" in banking jargon. The banks hugely profit from the gap between the interest rate they pay on deposits and the higher rates they charge for loans. The adviser said he had unveiled the plan after a meeting with top bankers and other market players. The economy is growing at slow pace, but the banks are making good profit, the adviser charged. "The banks are not lowering the interest rates on loans. Lower rates would fuel investment," Azizul said. Bangladesh Bank will prepare a policy for the banks after discussing with the chief executives of the banks, he said. A central bank official said chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed sent a letter on Jan 29 to governor Salehuddin Ahmed asking him to take necessary steps on an emergency basis for narrowing the gap between the rates of deposits and loans. The letter asked the central banker to take measures to cut interest rates on bank loans but the rates for deposits would remain the same. The adviser accused the retail bankers of not lowering charges despite repeated reminders and said the banks often charge "illogically" for various services, which often bordered on "harassment of clients". Meanwhile, the central bank governor separately told reporters that a policy direction would soon go to the banks for cutting the interest rates. bdnews24.
