 COLOMBO, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels bombed a civilian bus in north-east Sri Lanka on Monday, killing at least 12 people, the military said. The blast occurred just hours after the armed forces held a defiant show of military prowess to mark independence day in the capital. "It was a Tamil Tiger claymore mine targeting a civilian bus in Weli-oya. Twelve were killed and 17 admitted to hospital," a military spokesman said. Weli-oya is in the north-eastern district of Polonnaruwa, about 200 km (120 miles) from the capital Colombo. A defiant Sri Lankan military paraded tanks and troops as fighter jets flew overhead on Monday to mark the country's 60th anniversary of independence amid fears Tamil Tiger rebels would attack the celebrations. Thousands of police and troops were on high alert in the capital Colombo as the island's armed forces put on a show of military might along a promenade by the Indian Ocean. The parade came a day after a suspected female Tiger suicide bomber killed 11 people and wounded 92 in an attack on the island's main train station, which sits a few hundred metres from the site of Monday's parade. Hours after the parade, a soldier was killed and three were wounded when a suspected Tiger roadside bomb hit an army tractor near the south-eastern town of Buttala, the latest in a litany of attacks as a 25-year civil war escalates. "Two years ago no-one believed that terrorists could be defeated but during the last two years we made it a reality in our motherland," President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in an address to assembled military top brass, politicians and diplomats, referring to territorial gains against the rebels in the east. "We have had the cancer of terrorism for three of the six decades since independence," he added. "The challenge bestowed on us by history is the defeat of terrorism and the development of the country." Troops and brass bands marched by after he spoke, accompanied by multi-barrel rocket launchers, armoured personnel carriers and artillery pieces. Navy fast-attack boats cruised past and attack helicopters and jets flew overhead to mark independence from Britain. Sri Lanka's education ministry, which shut 12 schools ahead of Independence Day because of security operations, said about 40 state schools in Colombo district would remain shut this week because of fears of violence. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said the armed forces expected the rebels to try to mount attacks to disrupt the celebration, which comes just weeks after Rajapaksa withdrew from a 6-year-long ceasefire pact with the rebels. ATTACK FEARS "There have been recoveries of suicide jackets and an LTTE cadre (fighter) last week. They are trying to disrupt the independence celebrations," he said. "We are expecting some kind of sabotage activity from the Tigers. A caller claiming to be from a group Sri Lanka's military says is a wing of the Tamil Tigers on Monday warned of bomb attacks in a phone call to Reuters. Sri Lanka's military said the group, Ellalan Forces, was a codename sometimes used by Tamil Tiger rebels behind attacks in the capital. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were not immediately available for comment. A man claiming to be from the group called Reuters in January 1996 one minute before suspected Tigers rammed a truck packed with explosives into the Central Bank in Colombo, killing up to 100 people and wounding 1,400. Police said attackers destroyed an electricity transformer on the southern outskirts of Colombo early on Monday with explosives, but no one was injured and it was unclear who was responsible. Fighting between the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE rebels has intensified since the government scrapped the truce last month, saying the rebels were using it to rebuild and re-arm and were not sincere about talking peace. Hundreds of people have been reported killed in recent weeks and analysts say both sides tend to exaggerate enemy losses in a propaganda war that runs parallel to a conflict that has killed an estimated 70,000 people since 19
