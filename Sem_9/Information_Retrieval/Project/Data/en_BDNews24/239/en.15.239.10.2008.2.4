 LONDON, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell further below $89 a barrel on Monday, adding to sharp losses the previous session, as fears over a possible US economic recession prompted more profit-taking. US light crude for March delivery eased by 51 cents to $88.45 a barrel by 1230 GMT, after tumbling more than 3 percent on Friday. London Brent crude fell 45 cents at $88.99. Mounting US economic problems, including high energy costs, have prompted analysts to cut forecasts for oil demand growth. Crude prices have fallen by more than 10 percent from the record $100.09 hit Jan. 3, but declines below $90 have been limited and oil has traded around the $90-a-barrel level for much of the past three weeks. Earlier in the session, oil found some support from a rebound in world equity markets. World stocks hit a 2-1/2 week high on Monday and emerging market assets also rallied as last week's news of major company deals eased concerns the credit crisis might be hurting corporate and economic activity.

"But in the longer term, oil prices are expected to fall further because of a slower U.S. economy. I think the market will be seeing a few more knocks in the coming months."

Crude speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange last week trimmed net long positions -- or bets that the market would rise -- according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. Net crude long positions fell to 29,845 in the week to Jan. 29, the lowest level since mid-November. Also on Friday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at a meeting in Vienna agreed to leave its output unchanged for now. But Gulf producer Kuwait said a supply rise would be discussed, while Iran and Venezuela suggested a cut might be in order when the group next meets in a month's time. Senior OPEC officials on Monday downplayed talk of any change in oil output, saying a decision would hinge on the health of the global economy. "Everything is possible according to the market. We really cannot decide at this time," OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri told reporters on the sidelines of a London energy conferen
