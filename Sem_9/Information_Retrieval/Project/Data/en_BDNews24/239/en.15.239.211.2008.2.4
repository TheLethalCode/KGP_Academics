<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  A blazing 88 from skipper Mohammad Ashraful guided the Team A to a five-wicket win over the Team B in the fourth practice match ahead of this month's home series against South Africa. The Team A reached home scoring 200 for five with 11 balls to spare, chasing the Team B's modest 199 for nine in the stipulated 45 overs. Ashraful gripped the paddle after makeshift opener Habibul Bashar continued his shaky performance to be trapped lbw by Shahazada for 13, leaving the side at 18 for one in 8.3 overs. Five balls later, opener Juaned Siddique (12) followed Bashar, but the collapse could not stop Ashraful, who remained unbeaten on 88 off 104 balls with seven fours and one six to steer his side home. Mehrab Hossain Junior and Rakibul Hasan supported their skipper with 26 and 36 in a way to their second triumph in three outings. Earlier, the Team B could manage 199 for nine after Mashrafee Bin Mortaza opted to bat first winning the toss. Mashrafee's side got off to a fine start riding on top order batsmen Imrul Kayes (41), Shahriar Nafees (17), Nazmus Sadat (28) and Nazimuddin (52), but the middle and late orders failed to keep the momentum. The B team added only 22 runs in the last five overs despite having scored 177 in 40 overs as they suddenly collapsed to 192 for nine from 177 for five in the face of some accurate bowling and tight fielding from the opponents. Pacer Sajedul Islam grabbed three wickets for 46 while Mehrab Hossain and Farhad Reza each took two wickets for 33 and 43.
