 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Book lovers, enjoying a more organised and people-friendly environment at this year's book fair, have sent first day book sales soaring. The annual book fair, as one visitor says, is one of the few places in Dhaka that is ideal for the family, to chat and roam as well as buy books. Mahmud Sharif and Reazul Bashar report from the bdnews24.com mobile newsroom that Bangla Academy have worked hard to make this year's book fair more comfortable for the public. This may already be reflected in the soaring sales recorded on the first day of the fair. The academy's coordination and public relations department said that first day sales amounted to Tk 91,600 compared to Tk 32,800 in 2007. This, despite the organisers having decreased the number of book stalls by 40 this year for the convenience of the public. "We have been able to move around the book fair very comfortably this year," visitor Mobina Sultana said. Cultural adviser Rasheda K Choudhury and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman both visited the fair Sunday. The queue began forming at 2.00 pm on the third day of the fair; no sooner had the clock struck 3.00 than the public poured in through the gates. Rasheda told bdnews24.com: "I am enjoying moving around the fair as the management is very disciplined and tidy." Hossain Zillur Rahman unveiled three new books. Shahad Ali who came to the fair with wife and children said: "There are a very few places in Dhaka where we can spend time as a family. Coming to book fair it seems to me is an ideal place for that. People can buy books as well." Tareq, a student of a private university, who was gathered with friends in front of the information centre said: "I have come here to buy books but hanging out with friends is a bonus." Some 84 books were launched on the third day of the fair. The Bangla Academy sales centre saw a good response this year compared to past years. Sales development officer Azizul Haque told bdnews24.com English and Bangla dictionaries occupy the top positions. "The English to Bengali dictionary sold the most," Azizul said. He added that it had been reprinted 31 times and some 50,000 more copies are being printed. Public relations officer Murshid Anwar said that the total sales last year amounted to Tk 41,71,045. The amount might increase this year, he hoped. bdnews24.
