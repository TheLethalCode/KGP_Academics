 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com) - Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday said city corporation polls were not possible amid the state of emergency. "How is it possible to hold the polls if the emergency rules are not lifted? Candidates need scope for a campaign," Huda told reporters replying to a query on the matter if the emergency would go before the local government polls. He spoke to the media when he was on his way to the chief adviser's office to meet interim leader Fakhruddin Ahmed. Polls to Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet city corporations are expected in April. About the agenda of the meeting with the chief adviser, the CEC said: "I'll discuss everything with him." He would not specify what "everything" actually meant but said: "You (reporters) will know tomorrow what was on our table." Huda was quick to repeat that the ninth national polls would be held by year-end, a promise also made by the chief adviser. The CEC however would not comment on the reported resentment by the EC on the ordinance that freed the EC Secretariat from government control.
