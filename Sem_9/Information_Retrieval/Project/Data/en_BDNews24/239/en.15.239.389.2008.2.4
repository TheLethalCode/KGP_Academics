 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)The US government wants the lifting of the state of emergency and holding of general elections as early as possible, a visiting US official said Monday. But the US stresses the need for carrying out reforms of political parties prior to holding elections by year-end, said Donald Camp, United States principal deputy assistant secretary for South and Central Asia. "The US government has been very clear that our view is the sooner the state of emergency is lifted, the better," Camp told reporters. "The sooner the election can be held, the better," he said, following a meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. The senior US official also met separately Monday with the chief adviser, the army and the chief election commissioner. The state of emergency should be lifted as early as possible to reestablish the rights of the people, Camp said after meeting CEC ATM Shamsul Huda. In their one hour meeting they talked about the progress of the elections, he added. Earlier, Camp said the chief adviser ensured him that the government would hold elections as early as possible. In talks with army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed, the US secretary said the two discussed the role of the caretaker government and holding of national elections. The US official said the discussion with Moeen was "very fruitful". Camp said they spoke of how the role of the caretaker government has been important for institutionalising reforms. The two also discussed how the reform of political parties could be carried out, and elections held by the end of the year, Camp told reporters. He said he welcomed the caretaker government's commitment to political dialogue, and praised the government for its institutional reforms and fight against corruption. On the trial of the two former prime ministers, Camp said: "Our view is that any trial in this country, including that of the two former prime ministers must be carried out in fulfillment of the due process and as per the constitution." Replying to a question on whether the political parties would take part in the elections with Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia in jail, Camp said the political parties of Bangladesh were capable enough to make their position clear in this regard. The foreign adviser did not comment on whether they had discussed the holding of the general elections. "We discussed the issue of duty-free access for our ready-made garments in the US market," Iftekhar told reporters. Donald Camp leaves Dhaka Monday ending his two-day visit to Bangladesh. bdn
