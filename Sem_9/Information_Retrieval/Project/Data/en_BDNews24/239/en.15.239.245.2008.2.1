 BRUSSELS, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union and South Korea have made good progress in negotiations on a free trade agreement, the EU executive said on Friday. "Negotiations in many areas are now well advanced, in some cases coming close to agreement, or giving important direction," the European Commission said in a statement after a round of negotiations between the 27-nation bloc and the Asian country. "This includes economically important areas like services and establishment, and intellectual property rights where the Commission sees welcome progress though important questions remain to be resolved," it added. The next round of talks has been set for spring, it said.
