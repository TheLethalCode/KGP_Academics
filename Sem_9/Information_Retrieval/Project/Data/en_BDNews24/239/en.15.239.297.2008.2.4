 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser M Anwarul Iqbal Sunday hinted at the possible merger of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment. There can be two separate divisions such as Expatriates Welfare Division and Labour Division and the ministry would then be called the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Labour, he said. Briefing reporters at the local government ministry, Iqbal said the two ministries worked at the same place and in many cases had the same staffers. The expatriates welfare and overseas employment ministry was imparting training for the technical training centres set up by the labour and employment ministry. Hence, the employees were running to and from both ministries, he added. The director general of Bureau of Manpower and Employment (BME) oversaw both the ministries and needed to split his time between the two ministries, which created complications for the employees as well as the ministry. Iqbal, also labour adviser, said that he had spoken to higher-ups in the government on the issue and that the administration will benefit if the governments took the initiatives. He also said that political governments created new ministries manned by their own people to implement political commitments. Iqbal also said there was demand for Bangladeshi workers overseas and added that steps had been taken to ensure their employment after training. "That's why workers are being trained through technical training centres around the country. The training makes them more efficient workers abroad," the adviser told reporters following an inter-ministerial meeting. The training centres will provide potential overseas workers with tuition in English, Arabic, Korean and Japanese. Funding will be sourced from the Expatriates' Welfare Fund, he added. bdnew
