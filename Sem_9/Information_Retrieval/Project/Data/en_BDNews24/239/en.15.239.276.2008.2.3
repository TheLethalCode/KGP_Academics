<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) - Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said Sunday his party would press on with anti-graft drive and reform programmes of the interim administration if it was elected to office in the next elections. Zillur made the comment to reporters after meeting detained party chief Sheikh Hasina on the Jatiya Sangsad premises, after a special court judge allowed the former prime minister to meet with him. The judge allowed Zillur, lawyers and relatives to speak to Hasina for an hour, after the court deferred to Feb 7 indictment proceedings in a corruption case filed by the ACC. Hasina has been suffering from various complications including high blood pressure, Zillur said, adding that she needed "proper treatment". He demanded the government free the AL president first and then announce the election schedules. He promised to curb the prices of daily commodities by at least half if his party was voted to power. The special court was scheduled to hear extortion charges involving awarding of contracts for three barge mounted power plants in Khulna during Hasina's term in 1996-2001. The judge deferred the hearing to Feb 7 after defence lawyers appealed for more time. Hasina was taken to the makeshift court at 9:25am Sunday. bdnews24.com/pc
