 JAKARTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Two policemen and a soldier were killed when Indonesian troops attacked a police station in eastern Indonesia on Saturday after a misunderstanding that a soldier had been kidnapped, army and police officials said. More than 100 soldiers surrounded a police station in Masohi on Seram island in Maluku province and opened fire, provincial military chief Major-General Rasyid Qurnuen Aquary told Reuters by telephone. The army sent about 200 soldiers from Ambon, the provincial capital about five hours away by sea and road, to restore order and reduce tension between soldiers and police, he said. "One from the army was killed, one badly wounded, and two from the police were killed and one was wounded," he added. The wounded were sent to Ambon for treatment, Aquary said. National police spokesman Sisno Adiwinoto said: "It was because of a misunderstanding that a member of the armed forces had been kidnapped by police." Maluku, also known as the Moluccas, was one of the areas where conflict between Christians and Muslims erupted after the fall of former President Suharto in 1998. A truce was signed in 2002.
