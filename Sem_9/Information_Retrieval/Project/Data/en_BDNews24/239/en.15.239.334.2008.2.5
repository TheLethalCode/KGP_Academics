<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday ended the hearing of a writ petition filed on behalf of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging the legality of her ongoing trial under the emergency powers rules. Justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam began deliberating on the verdict, which will continue into Wednesday. The court on July 30 had ordered the government to explain why the case should not be declared illegal following the filing of the writ petition. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed, acting for the government, told the court Tuesday that the government had included the case under EPR as per the provision in Section 3 (1) of the Emergency Powers Ordinance. The court questioned why the case was considered of such public importance as to be brought under EPR. Salauddin replied that Hasina and defence counsel could not resent the fact that the case was considered of public importance. The court however pointed out that as the case was brought under EPR it deprived her right to get bail. Salauddin pointed out in return that the case was brought under the EPR for a quick resolution and that the EPR provision is not unconstitutional. The additional attorney general also claimed in court that the lawyers who had made their statements as amici curiae were not neutral. Additional attorney general Monsur Habib presented documents in court regarding why the case was considered of public importance. The High Court had asked the prosecution lawyers on Jan 31 to present such documents to the court. Examining the documents, the court said the case was thought to have public importance for the social status of Hasina, not for the severity of corruption or crime. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq said that there was no specific guideline in the EPR to consider any case of public importance. If there is no guideline for public importance in the law, a move to take a case under emergency rule on the grounds of Hasina's public importance breaches a constitutional principle of equality, the lawyer argued. Businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the case with Gulshan Police Station against the former prime minister and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim for extorting Tk 3 crore on June 13 last year. Hasina was arrested on July 16. The next day the case was taken under emergency rule and she was shown arrested. On July 24, a chargesheet was submitted to the court accusing Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and Sheikh Selim. bdnews24.com/
