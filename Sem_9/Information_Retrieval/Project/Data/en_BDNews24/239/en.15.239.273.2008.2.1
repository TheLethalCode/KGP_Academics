<TEXT>
 MADRID, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona were pitched against Valencia and Getafe drew Racing Santander in Friday's draw for the King's Cup semi-finals. With Real Madrid nine points clear at the top of the Primera Liga, the Cup has taken on inflated importance for second-placed Barcelona, who knocked out Villarreal 1-0 on aggregate in the quarter-finals on Thursday. The 24-times winners have home advantage for the first leg later this month, when troubled Valencia will visit the Nou Camp. Ronald Koeman's outfit edged out Atletico Madrid on away goals during the week, providing a rare moment of positive news for a side who have only won once in 10 matches in the league. The other tie sees high-flying Racing Santander, in their first semi-final appearance, visit last season's finalists Getafe in the first leg. Racing beat Athletic Bilbao 5-3 on aggregate in the last round, while Getafe put out 2003 finalists Real Mallorca on away goals. The first legs are scheduled for Feb. 27 with the returns on March. 1
