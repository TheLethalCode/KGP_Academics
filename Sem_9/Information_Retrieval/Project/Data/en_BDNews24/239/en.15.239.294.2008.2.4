 NEW DELHI, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is set to raise retail petrol and diesel prices this week for the first time in 20 months, a senior oil ministry source said, as the government risks political capital to ease losses at state oil refiners. The source, who did not wish to be identified ahead of a decision by the cabinet, said on Monday that petrol prices were likely to rise by 4.6 and diesel by 3.3 percent, small adjustments that are unlikely to add significant inflationary pressures. But the decision, which follows months of debate, could trigger protests from communist allies who provide the ruling coalition with a parliamentary majority. "The decision will be taken at a cabinet meeting this week," the ministry official said of the expected price revision. The cabinet usually meets on Thursday but can be convened earlier. If it approves the measure, petrol will go up by 2 Indian rupees ($0.05) a litre and diesel by 1 rupee. World crude oil prices that hit a record above $100 last month retreated to below $89 a barrel last week but are still sharply higher than a year ago, forcing many Asian nations to increase their heavily subsidised domestic pump prices. New Delhi held out longer than most. Beijing caved in to pressure and raised prices by 10 percent last November, while Vietnam has also increased rates. Malaysia, the biggest oil exporter in Asia, has warned that it may follow. WELCOME FROM RETAILERS India's increase will be welcome by state-run retailers like Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp, which say they have been losing millions of dollars a day due to the jump in crude prices. Those shares rallied by between 5 and 12 percent on Monday in a Mumbai market that ended up 2.3 percent. India forces state retailers to sell widely consumed fuels cheaply to protect poor consumers and help curb inflation and did not increase prices in 2007, even though the cost of crude rose by more than 50 percent in the year. The government issues bonds to oil retailers to cover 42.5 percent of their revenue losses on fuel sales, while upstream companies bear another 33 percent of the burden. Like Beijing, the Congress party-led government has had to balance the need to pass on higher import costs against macroeconomic stability in Asia's third-largest economy, which is expected to grow close to 9 percent in the year to end-March. India's central bank, concerned about price pressures stemming from rising food and fuel prices, kept its key lending rate at its highest since November 2002 last week, warning that crude prices had not yet been fully passed on to consumers. The Indian crude basket has risen about 175 percent since April 2004, but retail prices of petrol went up by just 29 percent and those of diesel by 40 percent in the same period. Inflation in mid-January stood at just below an annual 4 percent, comfortably below the central bank's target for the fiscal year. India's last increase came in June 2006, when retail petrol prices went up by 9.2 percent and diesel by 6.6 percent. That prompted the central bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points a few days later to curb inflation pressures. The ministry official said no restructuring of duties on oil and its products were being considered. India imports about two-thirds of its crude consumption. Ministers have met regularly in recent weeks to discuss politically risky increases. But the government has hesitated to raise prices with state and parliamentary elections due this year and next, when it hopes to bag the votes of millions of poor people. Analysts have been expecting prices to rise for some time. On Monday, petrol in Delhi cost 43.52 rupees ($1.10) a litre while diesel was selling for 30.48 rupees. ($1=39.46 rupe
