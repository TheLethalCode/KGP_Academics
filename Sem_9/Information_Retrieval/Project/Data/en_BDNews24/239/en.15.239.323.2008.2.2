 ACCRA, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria attempt to reach a fifth successive African Nations Cup semi-final on Sunday but will need to get past hosts Ghana to keep up their record of consistency. The Super Eagles scraped into this year's quarter-finals despite scoring just two goals in the group stage and delivering a series of indifferent performances. They come up against the confident Black Stars, who have won all their three matches so far and will have a capacity 45,000 crowd behind them at the Ohene Djan stadium on Sunday (1700 GMT). Coach Claude LeRoy said his team produced a near-perfect tactical performance in their last game, a 2-0 win over Morocco that ensured a clean sweep of their first-round group. "In terms of skill and team spirit, this Ghana is very close to winning sides of past years," the Frenchman said. "This team has the dedication and purpose it needs to progress in this competition." Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien remains the cog of the team's midfield, which has Laryea Kingston back after a one-match suspension. Ghana's top strikers Junior Agogo and Asamoah Gyan, battling with minor ailments, have been restricted to light training over the last few days. LAST SUCCESS Nigeria coach Berti Vogts told reporters on Friday he would stick with a three-man midfield, in which Essien's club mate John Obi Mikel is the pivot. Nigeria have been to every Nations Cup semi-final stage since 2000 but their last title success was 14 years ago. This year they had to rely on the Ivory Coast beating Mali in the last group match on Tuesday to reach the last eight on goal difference. Vogts was pressured to resign by angry Nigerian journalists earlier in the tournament. The match renews a long-standing rivalry between the two west African giants in which Nigeria have had the upper hand in recent years. Ghana were eliminated in their last two Nations Cup finals appearances after losing to the Nigerians, in the 2002 quarter-finals and in the first round in Egypt two years ago. However, Ghana inflicted a demoralising 4-1 defeat on Nigeria in a friendly in London 12 months ago. The winner of Sunday's quarter-final will play the winners of the Monday match between Tunisia and Cameroon in the semi-final
