<TITLE> Clinton appears on Letterman on eve of Super Tuesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made an appearance on David Letterman's late-night TV show on the eve of Super Tuesday and took the opportunity to explain the influence her husband would have if she becomes the first woman president of the United States. "In my White House, we will know who wears the pantsuits," the New York senator told the talk show host, who asked if former president Bill Clinton might return to the presidential mansion and "be going through stuff." Making television appearances on CBS' Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows has become a popular way for presidential contenders to show their lighter side to an audience of millions of viewers. Such appearances have practically become a rite of passage since Clinton's husband famously wore sunglasses and played a saxophone on a talk show during his 1992 presidential campaign. Letterman introduced the former first lady by saying he agreed with her campaign slogan that "making change is hard" because he had worked a cash register in high school. "Making change is more than a little hard, it's virtually impossible," he said. Clinton described her campaigning as "both exhausting and exhilarating" as she and rival Democrat Sen. Barack Obama prepared for Tuesday's contest in 22 states to help choose the party's presidential nominee. "You feel like you're getting an energy transfusion," she said. "And then when it's over, you get back in the car, you get back in the plane and you try to get some more sleep." She said she was so tired she opted not to drink a beer while watching the Super Bowl football championship on Sunday with supporters at a bar in Minneapolis. "I was so tired. I thought I might still be there if I had," she said. Steered by Letterman's serious questions, Clinton talked mostly about problems like home foreclosures and affordable health care -- issues she has raised throughout her presidential effort.
