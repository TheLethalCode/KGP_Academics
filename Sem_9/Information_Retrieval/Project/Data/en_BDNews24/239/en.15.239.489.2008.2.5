 NAIROBI, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan business leaders on Tuesday urged politicians to move quickly to end a post-election crisis that has killed 1,000 people and threatens progress in east Africa's biggest economy. Cycles of ethnic violence that started as political protests have displaced some 304,000 people and hit key economic sectors like tourism, horticulture, tea and transport to landlocked neighbours. The crisis was triggered by President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election. Opposition leader Raila Odinga says the president stole the Dec. 27 vote and demands that he step down. "Every day that they continue to pontificate, to strategise, to dance, another little bit of Kenya (is) disappearing," said Michael Joseph, chief executive of leading mobile telephone operator Safaricom. "We may reach a point of no return when there may be no country to govern, no people to touch ... and give Kenyans what they really want, an equal place in the sun for all to share." The month-long violence has caused the local currency to ease against the dollar, once almost hitting a three-year low. Inflation in January rose to 18.2 percent year on year from 12 percent in December, and interest rates have also crept higher. Tourism, a key foreign exchange earner, has not been spared. Tourists visiting Kenya for safaris or the beaches have dried up, threatening a sector that employs two million people. Business leaders warned they were already losing market share in the region and said some manufacturers were already considering relocating their plants elsewhere. "Let's face it, many firms don't have to manufacture here in Kenya," said Steven Smith, managing director of battery maker Eveready. "There are questions already being asked, why are you there? What gives you the advantage to stay in Kenya?" He said productivity in January was down as much as 50 percent. What started as an electoral dispute has uncorked decades-old divisions between tribal groups over land, wealth and power, dating from British colonial rule and stoked by Kenyan politicians during 44 years of independence. The ethnically mixed Rift Valley has been worst hit and horticulture and tea farm workers there have been displaced as rival communities allied to either leader fought. Although Kenya does not have vast amounts of natural resources like many African countries, it is endowed with a good climate, an educated workforce and is well-placed as a regional hub. Years of relative political stability in a region used to turmoil have encouraged multinationals to set up shop in the country to serve eastern Africa. But the sudden spiral into chaos has damaged Kenya's image of stability. Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, in the country to negotiate between the government and the opposition, told the business leaders to keep pressing for stability. "Keep your voices high, let your leaders know you need peace," Annan said. "Individuals may be prepared to destroy themselves, but we should not let them destroy Keny
