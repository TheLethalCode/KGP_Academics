 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government plans deeper cuts in the Annual Development Programme for fiscal 2007-2008, an adviser said Tuesday. "Six months into the current fiscal year, ADP implementation is not satisfactory," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters after a meeting of the budget monitoring and resources committee. The government will keep the ADP somewhere between Tk 22,000 crore and Tk 23,000 crore, down from Tk 26,500 crore, meant for the current fiscal year. Only 21 percent of the annual allocation of Tk 26,500 crore will be implemented in the first half. Azizul said the government's non-development expenses had increased, but the ADP implementation was far from satisfactory. Subsidy to different sectors had caused the increased expenditure, he added. Earlier, the government would heavily subsidise the energy sector, but it now it needed to give subsidy to fertiliser and food, he said. The government had been splashing huge amounts on subsidies, which had pushed the budget deficit to 4.7 percent from 4.4 percent, the adviser added. The total budget deficit for the current fiscal has been put at 4.2 percent. He said revenue collection grew 22 percent in the first half of the fiscal year. On whether the ADP execution was being hampered as many field level contractors had gone into hiding, the adviser said some ministries had spoken to him about the problem. However, he said that was not the main reason for the sluggish ADP implementation; there were other problems. Finance secretary Md Tareq, National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid, Economic Relations Department secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan, planning secretary Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury and top officials of the finance ministry were present at the meeting. bdnews24.com
