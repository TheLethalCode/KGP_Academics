 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)The home ministry Monday decided to launch a comprehensive drive integrating the army, navy, coastguard, police and BDR to stop fertiliser smuggling out of Bangladesh. A number of other law and order interventions were also taken up for serious consideration at a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order. After the meeting, additional home secretary Sheikh Abdur Rashid told reporters that the related agencies had been alerted on the prevailing law and order and asked to take positive steps to improve the situation. They had also been directed to stop theft and smuggling and keep an eye on the RMG sector to maintain productivity, he said. "The meeting discussed security measures to be taken for the observance of Ekushey (International Mother Language Day)," Rashid said. "A decision was taken to dismantle illegal installations beside the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University," he added. Another official who was present at the meeting said that despite improvement of overall law and order countrywide, theft in all categories including of automobiles and power transformers as well as robberies had increased. The official said the meeting directed the police, Ansars and Rural Electrification Board officials to be more vigilant especially about the clandestine buyers of stolen transformers and unearth such markets in different districts. If necessary, transformers installed at vulnerable locations should be welded to their bases, the meeting suggested, as shortage of transformers was seriously hampering power supply across the country. The agencies apprised the meeting that the high prices of fertiliser in Myanmar, five times higher than in Bangladesh, was encouraged the smugglers to smuggle out chemical manure, especially urea out to Myanmar. The meeting also instructed intelligence agencies to watch suspected saboteurs in the RMG sector and foil their designs so that the sector could live and thrive. Police officers, including local police chiefs and district police bosses, had been alerted against the exacerbation of eve-teasing leading to hapless girls committing suicide. The police have been instructed to watch educational institutions at the district level in this regard. Most of the 613 firearms issued for the protection of private banks were outdated and the banks approached the home ministry for permission to replace the weapons with more efficient ones, the meeting was told. The newly appointed chief judicial magistrates and judicial magistrates have applied to the ministry to be provided with gunmen for safety and the meeting asked the law ministry to initiate a full proposal in this connection. The meeting also decided to clear 474 plots at Rupnagar in Mirpur of their illegal occupants. bdnews24.com/
