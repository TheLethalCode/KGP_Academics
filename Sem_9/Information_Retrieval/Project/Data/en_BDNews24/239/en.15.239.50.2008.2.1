<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering conducting a nationwide literacy census, according to primary and mass education adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury. "A literacy survey would be helpful in creating a realistic picture of our national literacy profile," the adviser told bdnews24.com Thursday. "All concerned parties, including civil society, have been calling for a literary census," Rasheda added. Abdullah Ahsan, director of the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics said the latest figures put the national literacy rate at 65.5 percent. The governmental figure, however, is disputed by non-governmental organisations working in the sector. Gano Shakkharata Obhijaan (mass literacy campaign), an umbrella organisation for NGOs working in the field, puts the national literacy rate at between 41 to 42 percent. The adviser said there was a need to conduct up-to-date research in the field to establish accurate statistics across the country. bdnews
