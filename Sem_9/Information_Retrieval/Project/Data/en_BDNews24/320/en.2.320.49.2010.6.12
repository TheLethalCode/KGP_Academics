 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  A case has been filed against eight persons including the husband and father-in-law of the victim suspected of being poisoned. The case was filed on Saturday with Jurain Police Station for provoking to commit suicide in Kadamtali. Rita and her two children were found dead in a house. The accused are Rita's father-in-law Shafiqul Kabir, former chief reporter of the Bengali daily Ittefaq, mother-in-law Nur Banu, Rita's husband Rashedul Kabir, Rashed's second wife Smriti, Rita's two sisters-in-law Kabita Kabir and Sukhan Kabir, Sukhan's husband Delwar Hossain, and Mannan the private car driver. Earlier on Friday, the police recovered three bodiesof Rita and her two children from the first floor of a three-storey building at 229, Alambag at around 10am. The deceased were identified as Farzana Kabir Rita, 35, her son Ishrak Kabir Paban, 13, and daughter Raisa Sharmin Payel, 12. The police suspect that they might have poisoned themselves over a family conflict. "We are trying to arrest the accused. Further steps will be taken against them if signs of torture are found in the autopsy report," investigation officer Aiyubur Rahman told bdnews24.com. He informed that the bodies were handed over to the relatives after autopsy. The case has been filed under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act. Aiyubur Rahman further said that they suspect the accusations found on the walls against Rashedul, Shafiqul and other family members had been written by Rita and her two children before they committed suicide. Some of the wall-notes bearing the name of Paban and Payel accuse their grand parents of compelling them to kill themselves. The police also recovered a paper bearing Rita's signature that says that she has no objection regarding her husband's second marriage. The police official said that Rita's husband remarried and resided elsewhere with his second wife. The owner of the house, Shafiqul Kabir, had ordered Rita and her children to leave the house within a month. bdnew
