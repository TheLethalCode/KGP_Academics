 Chittagong, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Obaidul Kader has said that mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is not above errors. The senior AL leader, however, said: "Mohiuddin does not symbolise 'bad governance'." Kader's comments about Mohiuddin came in contrast to his comments about the BNP-backed mayoral candidate M Manzur Alam whom he termed as a 'honey bee', suggesting that he was merely a friend of good times. Kader was speaking at a press briefing at Chittagong Club. "While Mohiuddin Chowdhury was in jail after 1/11, the bee [Manzur] made an entente with those in power and sat in as the acting mayor," he added indicating the military-backed interim government. He termed Mohiuddin as 'tried and tested' while he said Manzur was 'controversial'. "The 'tested' person might have some faults but he wants to modernise Chittagong." Kader also claimed that the modern Chittagong owed much to Mohiuddin Chowdhury and urged the port-city residents to vote for their 'friend in need.' "Many want to make Chittagong like Singapore and Malaysia. However, I want to see Chittagong become a modern and developed city retaining its own unique characteristics." Noakhali MP Ekramul Karim Chowdhury, the prime minister's former personal secretary Allauddin Nasim and others were also present. b
