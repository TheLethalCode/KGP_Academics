<TEXT>
 Chittagong, June 12 (bdnews24.com) -- At long last, ruling party MP Nurul Islam BSc has joined the campaign for ruling Awami League-backed mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. Nurul Islam on Saturday in presence of Mohiuddin Chowdhury and the party's central leaders at a rally declared his support for Mohiuddin. The rally was hosted by Nagorik Committee at Bahaddarhat in the port city on Saturday evening. Later, Mohiuddin and Nurul Islam embraced each other, and pledged to settle their dispute placing their hands in each other's. In his speech, Nurul Islam urged the cadres loyal to him to launch door-to-door campaigns for Mohiuddin, who is running in the June 17 city corporation polls seeking an unprecedented fourth term as mayor. Mohiuddin said there was no conflict between them though some difference of opinion developed in the past over certain issues. There has been a long rivalry between Nurul Islam BSc, MP from Chittagong-8, and city AL president Mohiuddin. The rivalry took a serious turn over the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation election. Nurul Islam and his followers sent a list of three likely candidates to the prime minister Sheikh Hasina separately. AL president and prime minister Sheikh Hasina sat with the Chittagong leaders in Dhaka where Nurul Islam BSc was absent because he was abroad. Nurul Islam, however, did not participate in the campaign for Mohiuddin despite the central leaders' efforts to resolve the dispute several times. After submission of his nomination paper, Mohiuddin embraced Nurul Islam at a party programme at the Chittagong Press Club but their relations remained cold. Awami League's advisory council members Suranjit Sengupta, Amir Hossain Amu, organising secretary Ahmad Hossain, Shamsul Haque Chowdhury MP and former Chhatra League leader Mainuddin Hasan Chowdhury were also present at the rally. bdnew
