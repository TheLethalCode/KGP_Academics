 Savar, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Three garment factories at Ashulia have declared a holiday after workers went into a movement demanding pay raise. Authorities of Envoy Group's three factories in Ashulia's Jamgora  Envoy Fashions Limited, Envoy Design Limited and Manta Apparels Limited  declared the closure on Saturday morning. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) chief Abdus Salam Murshedy is one of the owners. The group's manager (administration) Manzur Morshed confirmed bdnews24.com about the holiday declaration at the factories. He also said that the workers placed their demands for a minimum wage limit of Tk 5,000 at around 8am to the authorities. They waited for an hour and around 9am some 4,000 workers launched a demonstration in the factory premises. Fearing large scale movement and agitation, the authority declared the factory closed. However, a number of workers took position at the main gate. Police arrived at the scene hearing the news and dispersed the agitating workers. The official also said that demands from the workers would be settled through discussions. Roughly 8,500 workers are employed in the three factories. A number of workers, on condition of remaining anonymous, told bdnews24.com that they will launch stronger movements if their demands were not met.
