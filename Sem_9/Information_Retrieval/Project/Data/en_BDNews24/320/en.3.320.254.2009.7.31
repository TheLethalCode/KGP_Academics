 BIRMINGHAM, England, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ricky Ponting became Australia's highest Test run-scorer on the second day of the third Ashes Test against England on Friday. Ponting passed Allan Border's mark of 11,174 runs when he reached 25 but he added only 13 more runs before edging a catch to wicketkeeper Matt Prior off England seamer Graham Onions. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland led the congratulations for his captain. "I have heard Ricky talk about being inspired to win the right to wear the baggy green when, as a kid, his uncle, Tasmanian fast bowler Greg Campbell, was chosen to tour England in 1989," Sutherland said in a statement. "He is now on his fourth tour to England and while I know personal records are not an interest for him, I also know cricket fans everywhere will celebrate this milestone as a worthy achievement by this extraordinary cricketer." Former captain Border also praised Ponting. "Clearly, I am a great admirer, having been involved in Ricky's selection in many great Australian sides, and having enjoyed watching him closely on more occasions than I can remember as a cricket media commentator as well," Border said. "It is not just the number of runs he has made, it is how he has made them as a dominant force, leading from the front and scoring at a rate previous champions would have regarded as unthinkable." Ponting moved up to third on the all-time list with 11,188 runs, behind Indian Sachin Tendulkar, who has scored 12,773, and West Indian Brian Lara, on 11,953.
