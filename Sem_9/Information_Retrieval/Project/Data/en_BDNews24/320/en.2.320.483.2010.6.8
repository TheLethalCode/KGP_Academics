 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)--Almost two crore people in Bangladesh are at risk of arsenic poisoning, a minister has told the parliament. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Monday in reply to a question that about 13 percent of the country population are vulnerable to arsenic contamination. He said a number of measures were being taken to address the menace. These include deep tube-wells, wells, pond sand filters and rainwater harvesting plants. "One lakh 30 thousand safe water sources have already been constructed and at least one arsenic-free source has been established at almost all the arsenic-affected villages," Ashraf said. In response to another query by Lakshmipur-4 MP ABM Asrafuddin, he said, Dhaka, including Narayanganj, needs around 220 crore litres of water per day. On average WASA provides around 200 crore litres a day. Ashraf said that the Sayedabad water treatment plant currently supplies 22.5 crore litres of water per day. Following completion of its second phase another 22.5 crore litres of water will be added to its daily output. Also the ruling Awami League spokesman, Ashraf revealed additional measures taken by the government to resolve the water crisis. Following construction of plants at Savar's Bhakurta and Manikganj's Singair, 30 crore litres of water will be added to the supply. The feasibility study of two proposed projects is already underway, he said. One of them is at Khilkhet, which will add 50 crore litres of water to the daily supply from Meghna River, and another at Pagla, which will add further 45 crore litres from the Padma River. Regarding the questionable water quality, Syed Ashraf said that supply water is pure. But many customers route their supply lines as they see fit without following the necessary procedures. Responding to the query from Feni-2 MP Jainal Abedin, he said building owners routed their water supply lines along sewerage lines which increases the risk of contamination. "Many do not clean water tanks regularly. That is another probable source of pollution," Ashraf said. The minister also revealed that Sylhet's daily water supply shortage is about 3.8 crore litres of water in response to a query from Sylhet-3 MP Mahbub-us-Samad Chowdhury. bdnew
