<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com) A Rajshahi University journalist was injured early on Tuesday as local pro-goverment activists attacked him when students were protesting about incessant loadshedding. The power supply was distupted at night for several hours at the Binodpur area adjacent to the university where lots of students reside in different messes. At about 11.30 pm agitated students blocked the Dhaka-Rajshahi highway using burning tyres. At one stage, local Juba League activists confronted the protesting students and started to chase them. As the power supply was restored at midnight, the students withdrew their blockade. The local pro-government activists, however, attacked Belal Hossain, the university correspondent of the Financial Express, with sharp weapons when he was collecting information on the student protest issue. Critically injured, Belal was later taken by other students for admission in the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. Shah Makhdum Hall residents and Belal's friends alleged that local Juba League activists led by Sujan and Suman hacked him with machetes as they had some old grievance against him. University proctor Chowdhury Mohammad Jakaria said the university authorities were holding discussions with the students, local people and the police administration. Matihar police station chief Abul Khayer said additional police forces were deployed in Binodpur area. He claimed that the situation was under police control. bdn
