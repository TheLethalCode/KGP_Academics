 Johannesburg, June 12 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -  Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira gave the South Africa World Cup squad Saturday off and turned his attention to the Group A clash with Uruguay. Opening-day draws between South Africa and Mexico in Johannesburg and France and Uruguay in Cape Town on Friday left each team with one point and all to play for in the second series of mini-league matches. South Africa tackle the South Americans at the Loftus Versfeld home of Super 14 rugby union champions Northern Bulls in Pretoria on June 16 and France confront Mexico 24 hours later in Polokwane. Parreira said a draw was a fair outcome against Mexico - 66 places higher on the FIFA rankings - in a game the visitors controlled until South Africa improved dramatically after half-time and nearly won. But the 67-year-old Brazilian who led his country to the 1994 World Cup title knows a repeat of the opening 45-minute showing could lead to South Africa becoming the first hosts not to make the second round. Bafana Bafana (The Boys) appeared to be suffering from stage fright for much of it, perhaps because the starting line-up included eight local-based players unused to the pressure placed on them by an expectant nation. Parreira wanted some big opponents like two-time World Cup winners Argentina and big crowds in his warm-up schedule, but the closest he came was Colombia before a 75,000 Soccer City crowd. Assuming his team become more assertive, and the second half against Mexico suggests they are quick learners, Parreira will concentrate on defence and midfield concerns. TV replays of the Mexican equaliser are something captain Aaron Mokoena will want to avoid as three opponents could have scored the goal claimed by veteran defender Rafael Marquez. As a Mexican prepared to cross, the 102-cap South African urged his team-mates to push forward and create an offside trap. They did, but the slow skipper forgot his own command and played the Mexicans on. Central defenders Mokoena and Bongani Khumalo looked vulnerable during the warm-ups and sharper first-half finishing by the Mexicans could have taken the game beyond the reach of Bafana. The half-time introduction of Tsepo Masilela for Lucas Thwala at left-back also helped as Mexico had tormented the Orlando Pirates defender to deliver a string of crosses. South Africa were also found wanting in midfield where Kagisho Dikgacoi from Europa League finalists Fulham struggled against livewires Giovani dos Santos and Carlos Vela. A half-time tweak by Parreira saw Reneilwe Letsholonyane reinforce the defensive side of the midfield equation and the possession balance changed in favour of the hosts. Given a shortage of goals against quality opponents ahead of the World Cup, Parreira will draw comfort from the second half with Teko Modise coming close twice and a post depriving Katlego Mphela of a late wi
