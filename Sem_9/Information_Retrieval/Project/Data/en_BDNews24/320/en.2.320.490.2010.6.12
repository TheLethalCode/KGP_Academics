 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Detained acting editor of daily Amar Desh, Mahmudur Rahman, has alleged tortured in remand. Mahmudur made the allegation when he was produced before a court at 3.30 pm at the end of his remand on Saturday in a case for obstructing police duty. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court sent him to jail after his bail petition was rejected. Meanwhile, Uttara Police Station's sub-inspector Nur Amin took him on a four day remand in the case relating to his alleged link with banned militant outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The remand was granted earlier. Mahmudur on Saturday told the court that although he was put on remand in the case filed with Tejgaon police, he was taken to the Cantonment Police Station and tortured there. On the night of June 9, five to six men stormed the room and hit him by the elbow, he alleged. Then they took his pants off, he alleged saying that they did not question him on that day. Lawyers for Mahmudur appealed to the court for issuing a 'show cause notice' to the investigation officer of the case, Rezaul Karim. The lawyers sought explanation as to why he was taken to Cantonment Police Station, where he was tortured although he was on remand in the case filed with another police station. The judge, however, did not give any order in this regard. Binoy Kumar and Hafizur Rahman Tota represented the state. Dhaka Bar Association president, Sanaullah Mia, Masud Ahmed and others argued for Mahmudur. Earlier on Friday, his lawyers Nasir Uddin Ahmed Asim and Sanaullah Miah alleged at a press conference that Mahmudur was being tortured in remand. "He [Mahmudur] was grilled at Cantonment Police Station instead of Tejgaon Police Station by persons other than the investigation officer," Asim had claimed. Miah alleged that Mahmudur was being subject to inhuman behaviour. "We found him lying with a book under his head when we visited him at the court's jail on Thursday. "He had no bed, no chair or table that he was supposed to be provided with," he said. The High Court on Thursday disposed of the plea to cancel Mahmudur's remand, but asked the authorities to follow instructions of an Appellate Division verdict of 2003. The 2003 verdict had given a number of directives, including medical exams before and after interrogating anybody, approval of remand by the metropolitan sessions judge, not torturing the person in remand, not quizzing by anyone other than the investigating officer, presence of a lawyer during remand and presenting the suspect before a magistrate between two remands. Mahmudur is currently facing several charges and in remand for interrogation. The police in the early hours of June 2 closed the BNP-leaning daily. They arrested Mahmudur on fraud charges brought by its publisher Hashmat Ali Hashu. Earlier the government sealed off its press. bdne
