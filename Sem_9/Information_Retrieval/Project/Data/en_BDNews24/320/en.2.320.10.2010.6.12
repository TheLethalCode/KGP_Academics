 Moulvibazar, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Heavy rain and increased water flow from the upstream have partially disconnected the Juli-Kulaura road in Moulvibazar. Road communications between Juri, Baralekha, Kulalura and Bianibazar sub-districts of Sylhet along with other places have been snapped due to inundation of the last few days. Manish Chakma, Upazila Nirbahee Officer (UNO) of Juri Upazila, informed that large tracts of land in 52 villages under six unions--Jaifarnagar, West Juri, East Juri, Sagarnal, Fultola and Goalbari--have been inundated. The Aatlighat road of the upazila is currently submerged under three to four feet of water. The Upazila Parishad premises are also under almost two feet high of water. Jaifarnagar Union is the worst hit. Around 28 educational institutions have been closed because of the inundation. Meantime, eight shelters have been opened. More than 1,000 families have taken shelter there. "The water is rising because of incessant rain and increased water flow from upstream. Around 460 homes have already been damaged totally and 3,969 houses in six unions have been partially damaged. Around 8,000 families have been affected," the UNO told bdnews24.com. Approximately 489km of earthen roads and 16.50km of concrete roads have been submerged under water. Around 489 tube-wells have completely become submerged.
