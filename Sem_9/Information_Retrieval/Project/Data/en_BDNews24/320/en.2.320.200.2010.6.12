<TITLE> 'Budget should be 20pct of GDP' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Krishi Bank chairman and a former deputy governor of the Bangladesh Bank, Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled thinks that the proposed budget is not ambitious at all. "In fact, it should be far more ambitious," he said suggesting the budget could well be about 20 percent of the GDP. The current outlay is equal to about 17 percent of the economy. Khaled made the comment at a post-budget discussion session on Saturday organised by Unnayan Samannay, which was founded by the central bank's current governor Atiur Rahman, and is currently headed by his wife. The comments came two days after the main opposition BNP termed the budget too ambitious. The BNP had suggested in their comments that the budget lacked substance and would not be much effective in generating economic growth. Finance minister AMA Muhith on June 10 proposed a net outlay of Tk 1321.70 billion for the next fiscal year beginning July 2010. Khaled, also an emeritus fellow of the non-governmental organisation that organised the discussion, stressed for more allocation to develop the state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Limited (BAPEX). "There is no alternative to increasing gas production for power generation." BAPEX, a company under Bangladesh Oil, Gas & Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla), is charged with the exploration and drilling of fossil fuel, mostly natural gas. Khaled said emphasis was given on public welfare rather than pure capitalist economy. He pointed out that the rural areas received more attention in terms of budgetary allocation compared to the urban areas as in the previous budgets. This was a positive shift in the government's policies, he said. The government has increased the target for disbursement of agricultural loans, which he thought would benefit poor farmers, he said. The budget proposes to allocate Tk 67.42 billion for agriculture and Tk 120 billion has been fixed as farm loan target for the next fiscal, up from Tk 110 billion in the outgoing fiscal. Tk 40 billion has been proposed as subsidies. Analysts think that execution of ADP (annual development programme) would be challenging. Khaled said only a few projects had been added to the list under ADP and urged the government to implement them swiftly.
