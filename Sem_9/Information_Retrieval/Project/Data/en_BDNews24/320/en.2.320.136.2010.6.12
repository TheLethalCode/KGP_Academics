<TITLE> Search for survivors in deadly US floods resumes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, June 12 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Rescuers resumed their search on Saturday for survivors of a flash flood that tore through campsites in a remote forest in the southern US state of Arkansas, killing at least 17 people. Survivors described a torrent of water that arrived without warning, sweeping through the Ouachita National Forest and catching campers and families vacationing in hillside cabins completely unaware in the dead of night. On Saturday morning, rescue teams recovered another body, raising the death toll to 17, Chad Stover from the Arkansas department of emergency management told AFP. Officials were still hopeful that survivors could be found, but it was impossible to know how many people were missing because the Albert Pike campground, which bore the brunt of the massive surge of water, had no registration system and records at other sites were simply swept away by floodwaters. "Our feeling is that there were around 300 people" at the sites, Stover told AFP, but it was also unclear how many people had escaped the area. Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, who was to tour the flood-stricken area Saturday along with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsak, said the forest's remote location complicated rescue efforts. "There wasn't a lot of warning time at all to anybody there," she told CNN. "Cell service is spotty at best." Stover told AFP that "cellular sites on wheels" were being sent to the area to improve reception in the hope that stranded survivors could call for help. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe said rainwater funneled down hillsides into the valleys where people were camping at the beginning of the busy summer vacation season, raising the river level before dawn from one meter (three feet) to seven meters in about three hours. "I've seen flooding before, but I've never seen water do this kind of damage," he said in a statement after visiting the sites. On Friday, three helicopters helped rescuers on foot and horseback recover at least 30 people, but a refrigerated truck bought in to act as a temporary morgue was a grim reminder of the flood's deadly toll. President Barack Obama issued a statement Friday offering "heartfelt condolences" to the families of those killed in the disaster and offering help from federal emergency officials if needed. The American Red Cross mobilized disaster teams to the southern edge of the park, offering assistance to at least 200 people displaced by the flooding. "We have mental health volunteers who are counseling the families, and tending to their emotional needs. These people have lost everything. It's all been washed away," said spokeswoman Brigette Williams. The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood alert Thursday, but the more serious flash flood warning did not go out until 2:00 am on Friday morning. Survivors had incredible stories to tell of how they escaped the deadly torrent or stepped in to help others. Local resident Janice McRae said she and her husband had rescued two little boys from the roof of a cabin and plucked the children's grandparents alive from the raging waters below. "We were in bed asleep at about 2:30," McRae told CNN. "The call came in from one of our cabin owners saying that the water was coming up in his cabin. "So we jumped out of bed and got dressed and went down there. And we rescued two little kids, two little boys off of that cabin right there that's on TV right now," she said, watching footage of the washed out ruins as she spoke. Chad Banks, who was camping with four friends when the water started pouring into their tent around 11:00 pm Thursday, said the power and the speed of the flood was unbelievable. "All five of us got into the truck. In 15 or 20 minutes the water was up above my truck. It started carrying me downstream." The campers abandoned the truck "and tied ourselves to trees and waited for the water to go down. It was still waist deep in daylight but then we could at least see to find our way out," he said. "We barely made it out." The Ouachita National Forest sprawls over 1.8 million acres (700,000 hectares) of western Arkansas and southeastern Oklaho
