<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury has asked the prime minister's intervention in removing the BNP-Jamaat supporters from administration immediately. Sajeda alleged that supporters of these opposition parties were positioned everywhere. "The government's efforts are not succeeding because of them. They delay the files intentionally," deputy leader of the parliament said Saturday. She was speaking at a discussion at Bangabandhu Avenue marking the 2nd anniversary of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's release from jail. Sajeda also claimed that these people were disconnecting power, for which people were suffering a lot. Addressing the party president, she said, "It will not do if you show kindness. You have to be strong and remove them." The senior AL leader said, "They [BNP-Jamaat government] filled the administration with their people in different tiers." Calling on the party supporters for a united movement against militancy, Sajeda said, "Plots are on to destroy us by triggering militancy." The rally, organised by the City AL, was also addressed by acting president M A Aziz, general secretary Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya and law state minister Kamrul Islam among others. bdn
