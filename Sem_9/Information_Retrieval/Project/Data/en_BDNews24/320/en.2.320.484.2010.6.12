 Rangamati, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  At least 18 people, including three journalists, were injured Saturday during a strike on road and water ways in Rangamati, imposed by the Hill Women's Federation (HWF). Kanika Dewan, the general secretary of HWF, a front of the United People's Democratic Front (UPDF), alleged that Bengali settlers attacked leaders of the blockade programme unprovoked. Dewan claimed that the organisation leaders had brought out a procession from Sapchari of Manikchhari and took position on the Rangamati-Chittagong Highway, near Manikchari Check Post, when Bengali settlers attacked the hill people and activists with sticks at around 11.20 am. "The policemen and army soldiers were present," she added. The HWF general secretary alleged that at least 15 people from her organisation were injured in the attack. Among them Sajib Chakma, 22, Jiban Chakma, 23, and Mita Chakma, 25, were injured seriously. In addition, three journalists  Bangla Vision's Rangamati correspondent, Nandan Dev Nath, Naya Diganta correspondent, Md Solayman, and ATN Bangla cameraman, Milton Bahadur, were injured. Solayman and Nandan were admitted to the Rangamati General Hospital. Rangamati Sadar police chief Babul Uddin Sarkar confirmed the incident and told bdnews24.com that the police have taken control of the situation. But although the situation is under control, tension prevails in the area, he added. HWF enforced the blockade in observance of 'Kalpana Chakma Kidnapping Day' at the district headquarters. The hill women are also demanding publication of the investigation report of Kalpana's kidnapping, back in 1996. The blockade programme got under way at 6am and was scheduled to continue until 2pm, a HWF spokesperson said. Hill Women's Federation leader Kalpana Chakma was kidnapped on June 12, 1996 and the organisation has been observing June 12 as Kalpana Chakma Kidnapping Day for a year later. The HWF general secretary told bdnews24.com that the blockade programme was taken up after the district administration refused to allow the organisation to hold a women's gathering at the local municipality auditorium in observance of the day. bdnews
