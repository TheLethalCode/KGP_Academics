 Johannesburg, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- South Africa woke up with a smug satisfaction on Saturday despite only drawing in the opening World Cup match. The 1-1 draw for the host nation in the tournament's first match against Mexico at Soccer City on Friday has been hailed as a successful start, even though South Africa's team spent much of the match on the back foot and provided just occasional glimpses of their potential.
