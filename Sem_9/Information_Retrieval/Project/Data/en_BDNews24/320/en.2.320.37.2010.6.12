 Johannesburg, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Two-thirds of soccer enthusiasts in 23 nations feel the first World Cup finals on African soil has become too expensive for fans to enjoy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

"The reality is something else," he said, adding he had been surprised at how inexpensive the country was. "I only hope that people did not come just because they thought it was too expensive." Organisers have revised down the estimated number of fans expected to attend the month-long tournament from some 450,000 to around 350,000 to 375,000, partly because of the global financial down
