<TITLE> Britain withdraws Prince Harry from Afghanistan </TITLE>

 London, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry flew out of Afghanistan on Friday after news leaked that he had been fighting on the frontline for 10 weeks, defence sources said. The 23-year-old grandson of Queen Elizabeth and third in line to the throne left early from his troop deployment amid fears for his security and for those soldiers fighting alongside him. He was sent to Afghanistan in December. But for security reasons and in agreement with the Ministry of Defence, the British media did not report his deployment. That agreement collapsed after Web sites in Australia, Germany and the United States leaked the news on Thursday. "Following a detailed assessment of the risks by the operational chain of command, the decision has been taken ... to withdraw Prince Harry from Afghanistan immediately," the defence ministry said in a statement. "This decision has been taken primarily on the basis that the worldwide media coverage of Prince Harry in Afghanistan could impact on the security of those who are deployed there, as well as the risks to him as an individual soldier."
