 Bangkok, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said on Friday he may go to Beijing at the weekend to meet his North Korean counterpart for talks on ending Pyongyang's nuclear programmes. "I think we will have an announcement on that at some point," Hill told reporters in Bangkok. "We had some very good discussions with the Chinese. There is an idea we might try to arrange something this weekend." North Korea committed to abandon all nuclear weapons and programmes in exchange for economic and diplomatic benefits under a 2005 multilateral deal. But the accord between the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States has become bogged down by Pyongyang's failure to produce a declaration of its nuclear programmes by the end of last year. US officials, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the diplomacy, said on Thursday Washington did not know whether Hill's North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, had agreed to fly to Beijing for a meeting. Hill, Washington's point-man on North Korea, also referred to this week's landmark orchestral visit to Pyongyang by the New York Philharmonic, saying the trip had helped the frosty Cold War relationship, but resolved nothing concrete. "I am a strong believer in music, especially sometimes if they don't like the words, maybe they will like the music," he said. "Right now it is an unfinished work. I think artists can sell unfinished work, but diplomats cannot." Hill visited Thailand as part of Washington's restoration of links to Bangkok following a December election that returned democracy after a September 2006 coup.
