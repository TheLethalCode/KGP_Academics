 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) -- The Bangladesh under-19 cricket squad ended their ICC World Cup campaign in disappointment, failing to qualify for the play-off final at the Bayuemas Oval in Kuala Lumpur Thursday. The second play-off semi-final between Bangladesh and Australia was called off due to rain, which propelled the Aussies into the final of the Super League play-off on a net run-rate, according to the ICC website. Bangladesh began steadily enough, scoring 51 for one in sixth over after opting to bat first. However, Australia's bowlers went on to decimate the remaining nine Bangladeshi batsmen for just 64 runs. Bangladesh's dramatic collapse went from 87 for three to 115 all-out in just 41.2 overs. Left-arm spinner Clive Rose (2/18) shared six wickets with medium pacer David King (2/17) and fast bowler Josh Hazelwood (2/34). Opener Amit Majumder was the match's highest scorer with 43, followed by Nasir Hossain on 15 not-out, no other Bangladesh batsmen crossed the double digit mark. In reply, Australia stood at 18 after six overs without loss when rain stopped play for the first time in the tournament. Bangladesh got off to a flying start in the group stage, winning all three matches against Bermuda, Ireland and England. However, the junior Tigers conceded a humiliating 201-run defeat to South Africa in the quarterfinal, which ended their title race bid. Bangladesh finished fifth in their previous meet in Sri Lanka. bd
