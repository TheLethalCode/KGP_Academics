<TEXT>
 Chittagong, March 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh got off to a horrible start after South African openers Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie set a new world record for a Test opening partnership in the second and final Test against the Tigers Saturday. Bangladesh were 60 for three at stumps on the second day after the visiting Proteas declared their first innings at 583 for seven, midway through the day's third session at Brishreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Shahriar Nafees (7) and night-watch Abdur Razzak (8) remained unbeaten at the close of Day 2 after Daly Steyn caused the damage, dismissing both openers Tamim Iqbal (14), Junaed Siddique (18) and Mohammad Ashraful (first-ball duck). Pacer Steyn also reached his 100 Test scalps having Junaed caught by keeper Mark Boucher in his 20th Test appearance after Bangladesh's left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique earlier achieved the same milestone in this his farewell 33rd Test match. South Africa declared their first innings in the third session after posting a monumental total in the port city. In the morning, opener Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie had put on 415 runs for the opening stand to break the 52-year old opening record of 413 by Indian openers Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy against New Zealand in Chennai in 1956. South Africa took 18 balls scoring nine runs to seize the world record from India Saturday morning. The Smith and McKenzie pair was also just 14 runs short of South Africa's any wicket highest record of 429 made by Jacques Rudolph and Boeta Dippenaar for the third wicket against Bangladesh in Chittagong in 2003. Smithwho also eclipsed late Hansie Cronje's record of leading South Africa for 53 matchesresumed overnight on 223 and finished on 232 off 277 balls. He smashed 33 fours and one six before being bowled by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, leaving the side at 415 for one in 94.3 overs. After the departure of Smith, McKenzie pairing with Hashim Amla added another 99 runs for the second wicket before Shahadat Hossain struck quickly removing three batsmen in three successive overs. McKenzie converted his overnight 169 to 266, his maiden double hundred, which was studded with 28 fours and three sixes from 388 balls, sticking on placid pitch for almost nine hours. The opener, however, was dropped by bowler Mohammad Rafique on 131 Friday. Soon after the lunch break, Shahadat first bowled McKenzie, then trapped Amla (38) and uprooted Aswell Prince's stumps for one before left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan bowled AB de Villiers (1) in the next over and the visitors were reduced to 524 for five in 129 overs. Afterwards, it was an essay of Mohammad Rafique, who reached 100 Test scalps as the first Bangladesh bowler, that dismissed Mark Boucher (21) and Robin Petersen (1). Rafique, who started his farewell Test with two wickets shy of the milestone, remained wicketless on Friday, but achieved the landmark in his last Test as Junaed Siddique caught Petersen at first slip off Rafique. Jacques Kallis remained unbeaten on 39 off 120 balls. After the dismissal of Petersen, South declared their innings as they added 178 losing seven wickets after having resumed the day on 405 for no loss. Shahajada, who took nine wickets in the Dhaka Test, returned with three for 107 while Rafique chipped in with two for 132. bd
