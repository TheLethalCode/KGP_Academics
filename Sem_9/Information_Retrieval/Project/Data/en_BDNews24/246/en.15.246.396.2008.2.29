Rightmove, which runs Britain's busiest property Web site, said underlying pretax profit rose to 31.4 million pounds ($62.3 million) as the number of advertisers rose by 18 percent, boosting revenue to 56.7 million pounds, up 69 percent. In January, the company said its full-year results would be towards the top end of analysts' expectations of between 29.3 million and 32.2 million.

Shares in Rightmove, which went public in March 2006, closed at 529 pence on Thursd
