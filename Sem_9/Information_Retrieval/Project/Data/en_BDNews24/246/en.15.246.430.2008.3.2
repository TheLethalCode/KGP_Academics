 Dhaka, March 01 (bdnews24.com) Former US ambassador to Bangladesh Patricia Butenis arrived in Dhaka Saturday on a "personal visit", an official with the US embassy said. "She (Butenis) has come to Dhaka on a personal visit," the official said. Butenis, a witness to Bangladesh's bickering politics leading to a state of emergency, left Dhaka in June 2007, ending her 14 months of an "eventful and exciting" assignment. She is now working as the US embassy deputy chief of mission in Iraq. bdnews2
