 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com) The deadline for voter registration in the Dhaka metropolitan area has been extended to March 10, election officials said Saturday. This marks the third time that voter registration in Dhaka city has been extended beyond the original Dec 1 to Jan 31 timeframe. It was initially extended till Feb 10, and again to Feb 29 to accomodate all the voters. Dhaka divisional deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com Saturday that voter registration centres will now close on March 10. "Anybody that has been left out can register by contacting a registration centre." "If any centre remains closed, the thana election officer, district election officer or deputy election commissioners' offices can be contacted until March 10," he said. "Approximately 34.25 lakh voters have so far been registered," he added. On Feb 11, the central control room of the project for voter registration and national ID cards told the Election Commission that the work of voter listing in the DCC area had been completed. The control room said that those who had not yet been registered would have until Feb 29 to do so. Thirteen information booths were opened at that time to provide unregistered voters with assistance. However, the telephone numbers of some of the booths were unreachable, which left a considerable number of voters unregistered. "In light of this, work will continue in those booths until March 10," deputy election commissioner Rahman said. An officer at the public relations section of the project told bdnews24.com Saturday that the project's director has been informed of the faulty contact numbers. Shahid, one of the army personnel working at the Ramna, Shahbagh and Tejgaon information booth, spoke to bdnews24.com Saturday. "We have a new schedule to register left out voters until March 10. Laptops, scanners and other equipment will remain at the thanas until then," he said. "Anyone left unregistered can contact us." Unregistered voters living in the above areas can contact 01730020520. Those living in Kotwali and Sutrapur can contact 01730020508. Sanjay Dey, an unregistered voter, said the information booth for Mohammadpur and Adabar had remained closed for some time. "I failed to register as a voter in the first round due to a personal problem. Although the secretariat gave a contact number for a second chance of registration, the number remained closed," Sanjay said. The deputy election commissioner added that 15 days would be allowed to settle outstanding concerns after the voter list is published. bdnews
