Israel pulled troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005, 38 years after capturing the territory in the 1967 Middle East war. It still controls the Gaza Strip's borders, airspace and coastal waters. Hamas Islamists, who won a 2006 election and formed a unity government with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, seized control of the territory from his secular Fatah faction in fighting last June.

Islamist militants have frequently launched rockets and mortar bombs into southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, a territory about 45 km (25 miles) long and 10 km (six miles) wide.
