<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were bowled out for just 131 on the opening day of their final warmup match for next week's first test against New Zealand. Kevin Pietersen top-scored with 50 but the other batsmen struggled in Dunedin after the touring side were put into bat by New Zealand Selection XI captain Jamie How. How then struck 10 fours in a fluent 65 to lift the hosts to 177 for four at the close in the three-day match. England captain Michael Vaughan lasted just two balls, Alastair Cook made 19, Andrew Strauss five and Ian Bell 10 before Paul Collingwood scratched around for just two runs from 40 balls. Pietersen was the only batsman to look comfortable at the crease, hitting nine fours from 72 deliveries. Seamer Iain O'Brien took four wickets and Mark Gillespie three. The first of three tests starts in Hamilton on Wednesday
