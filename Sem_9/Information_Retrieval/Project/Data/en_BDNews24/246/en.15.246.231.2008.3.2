 Dhaka, March 02 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday set March 19 for a final hearing on a writ petition seeking national polls within a "reasonable timeframe". A panel of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam made the order as the petitioner, barrister Masud Reza Sobhan, sought a date for the hearing. Sobhan himself argued in court on the petition filed on Jan 24. On Jan 27, the High Court asked the government to explain why the Election Commission would not hold elections within a "reasonable timeframe". The court also asked the chief adviser of the caretaker government, the Election Commission secretary and the law secretary to explain why they failed to hold the polls in 90 days after dissolution of parliament. Barrister Sobhan said Sunday the constitution made it mandatory to hold national polls within 90 days after the parliament was dissolved. "Holding dialogue with political parties for the national polls is not mandatory," he told bdnews24.com after the court fixed the date for the final hearing. He said the process of making a fresh electoral roll was delaying the elections while a lingering state of emergency was also a setback to the polls. bdnews24
