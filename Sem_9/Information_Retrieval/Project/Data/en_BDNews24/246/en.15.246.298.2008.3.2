<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)The interim cabinet Sunday provisionally approved a new contempt of court ordinance to fast-track cases under it. Also, the government gave final approval to a money-laundering ordinance, at a regular weekly meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. In a post-meeting briefing, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said: "If a contempt of court case is filed against any ordinary citizen it must now be settled in two years. If the case is not settled in two years it will be considered void." Contempt of court cases generally revolve around potential conflicts between the judiciary and executive. If officers of the executive body disrespect court orders, they may face contempt of court charges and be punished. By definition, the Contempt of Court Act 1926with only three sections effective in the countrydoes not protect a judge as a person but safeguards the seat of justice. Munaim said: "If such a case is filed against any government employee it must be settled within one year, otherwise it will be dismissed." If a contempt charge against any person is proved he will get six months in prison, which may be either simple or rigorous; a fine of Tk 20,000 may also be imposed on top of the sentence, the press secretary explained. "Appeal to the High Court must be made within seven days of delivery of the verdict in the case." The council of advisers also gave the nod to the Rangpur University Ordinance 2008. Munaim said the council gave approval to set up a fully-fledged public university at Rangpur, which would be built on a 75-acre site beside Carmichael College. Rangpur's Carmichael College students had long made demands for a university in the district town. The chief adviser approved a proposal on Feb 5 for establishing a fully-fledged university in Rangpur. bdnews24.com/ahd-e
