 WELLINGTON, March 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African-born all-rounder Grant Elliott has been called into an injury-hit New Zealand squad for the first test against England, starting in Hamilton on Wednesday. The uncapped Elliott was included in an expanded 13-man squad after Peter Fulton, Michael Mason and Jesse Ryder were ruled out with injuries. Jamie How and Ross Taylor were both recalled to the squad as a reward for their impressive performances in last month's one-day series, which New Zealand won 3-1. How, who has not played a test since December 2006, joined the squad to partner Matthew Bell in opening the innings after scoring a century in the one-dayers. Ross Taylor, who was overlooked for last month's two-test series against Bangladesh, ensured his place in the squad by topping the batting averages in the limited-overs series. New Zealand are due to host England in three tests in March, with the second match in Wellington and the last in Napier. New Zealand - Daniel Vettori (captain), Mathew Bell, Grant Elliott, Stephen Fleming, Jamie How, Chris Martin, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Mathew Sinclair, Ross Taylo
