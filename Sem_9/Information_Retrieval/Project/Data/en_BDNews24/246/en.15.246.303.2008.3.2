<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com) Awami League opposes the government decision of holding local election before the national election, the party acting president Zillur Rahman said Saturday. If the government sticks to its decision the party forum will discuss the matter before deciding to participate in local polls, he said. The responsibility of the present caretaker government was to hold national elections, not local elections, Zillur said at a meeting with the AL Munshiganj unit at his Gulshan home Saturday afternoon. "The right to hold local government polls lies with the Parliament. So only an elected government can hold such election," he said. "This government has not been entrusted with holding local government elections. The responsibility of this government is to hold national elections." Replying to reporters' questions, Zillur said the party would oppose the holding of local polls before national polls, and also the delimitation of parliamentary constituencies. Urging the government to withdraw the state of emergency the AL acting president said: "It does not make any sense to prolong the state of emergency now." "It has snatched away fundamental rights. The government speaks of elections by December but we cannot go to the voters due to the state of emergency." "The voters have to be told why they should vote for us." He also urged the election commission to announce the election date as soon as possible to remove any kind of doubt. On the critical condition of AL general secretary Abdul Jalil's health, Zillur said: "We needed his advice most now that the top leadership are detained." "Our general secretary has been arrested without any cause," the party acting president said, adding that Jalil was now in a life and death situation. Zillur demanded immediate release and proper treatment of party president Sheikh Hasina and Jalil, saying: "If anything happens to them the government will have to bear the responsibility." Asked whether he had had any talks with anybody in the government about sending Jalil abroad for medical treatment, Zillur said he had not spoken to anyone in the government on the matter. He added: "Doing politics is not a crime. There is no case against Abdul Jalil." bdnews
