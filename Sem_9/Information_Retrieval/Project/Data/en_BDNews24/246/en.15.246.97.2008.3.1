 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Abahani Limited, last year's runners-up Mohammedan Sporting Club and City Club got off to a fine start on the opening day of the Premier Division Cricket League Friday. An unbeaten 66-run from skipper Tushar Imran powered Abahani to a comfortable six -wicket win over newcomers Surjo Torun at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium while an unbeaten 87 runs by Faisal Hossain Dickens helped Mohammedan beat Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) by 53 runs at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. City Club recorded a tense two-run win over Sonargaon Cricketers at the BKSP ground-2. Abahani vs Surjo Torun Put in to bat first, Surjo Torun fell in trouble losing opener Uttam Kumar for nought before opener Shakil Haider (60) along with middle orders Nizamuddin (29, Shamsur Rahman (29 and Nayeem Islam (27) repaired the damage. But, the late order failed to carry on the success to be folded at 178 all out in 49.2 overs after losing the last four wickets for 21 runs in the face of some tight bowling from the Dhanmondi-based Abahani. Arafat Sunny and Rezaul Karim took two wickets each for 33 and 45 respectively. Abahahi, who reached the Premier League Twenty20 final, reached 180 for four with 7.4 overs to spare as opener Mahbubul Karim laid a solid foundation of 41. Tushar Imran and Nadif Chowdhury remained unbeaten on 66 and 16 to steer the holds home. Mohammedan vs BKSP After being invited to bat first, Mohammedan, who lost all five Twenty20 matches, once again fell in trouble to be reduced to 42 for four in 14th overs. Middle order batsmen Chandana (20) and Dickens (87 not out) and Suhrawardi Shuvo (35) rescued the Motijheel-based outfit to take their side to 203 for nine in 50 overs. Moshiur Rahman led the attack with four for 52 while Mahmudul Talukdar and Latiful Khan grabbed two wickets each for 23 and 35 respectively. In reply, BKSP, who upset Mohammedan in Twenty20 opener, managed 156 for seven in 50 overs despite a top order collapse. Saimon Ahmed (47), Nazmul (31), Raihan Anas (18) and Mominul Haq (18) were remarkable scorers after Tapash Kumar Bhaisya rattled the top order taking three for 40. City Club vs Sonargaon Imran Ahmed struck first ton and Sumon Barua hammered an explosive fifty as City Club posted a fighting total of 244 for four in 50 overs after deciding to bat first. Imran smashed 128 off 155 balls featuring nine fours and four sixes while Sumon played a 56-ball 67 that included seven fours and two sixes. In reply, Sonargaon got off to a fine start with openers putting on 72 runs before Mehrab Hossain Opee fell on 32. Opener Elias Sunny (64), Arman Hossain (37), Fahadullah (35) and Sharifullah (11) took their side to 193 in 42.4 overs before Fahadullah was the fifth batsman out. Afterwards, Sonargaon needed 51 runs in 46 balls with five wickets in hand, but they finally saw two runs short of the target though Mostafizur Rahman (23 off 22 balls) and Saif Mahmud (13 off 12 balls) took Sonargaon to the close.
