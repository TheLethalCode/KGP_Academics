 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar found some traction on Thursday after falling to a record low against a basket of currencies, but worries about the US economy cast a shadow over global stocks and looked set to keep Wall Street pressured. Fears of a US recession were supported by a recent flow of negative US economic data while comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke bolstered expectations for more US rate cuts to come. Already fretting about the health of the US economy, European stock markets lost ground with shares such as Europe's second biggest insurer AXA further hit by disappointing earnings results. "European equities are vulnerable to a slowdown in the (United) States spreading to Europe, exacerbated by the euro's strength and on a currency-adjusted basis, they don't look massively attractive," said Andrew Bell, strategist at Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.9 percent, with Germany's DAX and London's FTSE both also down about 0.9 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei lost 0.8 percent as investors sold exporters like Toyota Motor Corp on worries that a stronger yen would hurt profits, while MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets edged 0.2 percent lower. MSCI's main world equity index slipped 0.4 percent. U.S. stock futures were down between 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent, signalling a softer start for U.S. stocks. DOLLAR STEADIER, GOLD OFF HIGHS The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance against six major currencies, nudged up 0.1 percent to 74.261, but remained not far off Wednesday's record low of 74.070. The euro hovered near $1.51 after hitting an all-time high of $1.5144 on Wednesday, while the dollar traded just below 106.50 yen, steadying after dipping below 106 yen in the previous session to three-week lows. "We've just had a big move driven by Bernanke who confirmed market expectations of a rate cut of 50 basis points and probably more to come," said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at BTM-UFJ. "Now markets are inevitably pausing and consolidating, but any pause will be fairly brief as breaking through these levels provides a catalyst to go further," he added. Delivering the Fed's semi-annual report on the US economy to Congress on Wednesday, Bernanke said it was "important to recognise that downside risks to growth remains", signalling a readiness to lower rates to prevent further damage to the economy. Bernanke will continue his testimony later on Thursday, this time to the Senate Banking Committee. Markets are giving a strong chance of a 50 basis point cut to the 3.0 percent fed funds rate at the March policy meeting and a small risk of a bigger 75 point cut. US crude edged up 49 cents to $100.13, but remained off the record high above $102 set on Wednesday, while gold was at $959.20, down from the record high of $964.70 set in the previous session. Weakness in stocks gave government bonds a slightly bid tone as investors sought the relatively safety of sovereign debt. The March bund future climbed 21 ticks, while the benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.06 perce
