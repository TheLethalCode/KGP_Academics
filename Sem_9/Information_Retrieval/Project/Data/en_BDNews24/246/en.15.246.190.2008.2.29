 Johannesburg, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African electricity utility Eskom has awarded two contracts worth 31.5 billion rand ($4.07 billion) for its Bravo project coal-fired power station to be completed by 2017, the group said on Friday. Eskom said in a statement it had awarded the 18.5 billion rand contract for the construction of the power plant's boilers to Hitachi Power Africa, a unit of Hitachi Ltd. A 13 billion rand contract for the turbine island works was awarded to France's Alstom. South Africa is gripped by a power shortage as Eskom struggles to meet demand. The country's mining industry ground to a halt for five days in January as rolling blackouts intensified and millions of homes were left without power. Eskom plans to spend 343 billion rand increasing its generating capacity over the next five years. Eskom said first activity on the Bravo site in South Africa's Mpumalanga province is expected in 2008, with the first generating unit due for completion late in 2013, with other units coming into operation at eight-month intervals.
