<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)Senior Awami League leader Amir Hossain Amu Friday sought an immediate decision from the interim administration to send both Sheikh Hasina and Abdul Jalil abroad for treatment. Hasina and Jalil, both detained, have been suffering from health complications, some of them are critical. The party has repeatedly demanded their treatment abroad over the past few weeks. Amu, a member of the Awami League's presidium, was particularly worried about the reported deterioration of Jalil's condition. "We demand both be sent for overseas treatment," he told reporters in the party's headquarters after attending a namaz-e-janaza of party colleague advocate M Shamsul Haque. Replying to a query on the move to hold city corporation polls ahead of parliament elections, Amu said the Election Commission was mainly meant to hold national elections first. "If the commission wants to do otherwise, we'll discuss the matter inside the party and with our allies (for our stand)," he said. On the EC's move to re-demarcate the parliamentary constituencies, Amu said that the commission assured them of not going for any big change. "It will affect a small number of constituencies," he said of the EC assurance. bdnews
