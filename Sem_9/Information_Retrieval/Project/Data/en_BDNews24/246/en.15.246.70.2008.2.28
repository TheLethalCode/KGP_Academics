 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club began their IFA Shield campaign Thursday with a goalless draw against Kolkata Mohammedan SC at Salt Lake in Kolkata. Mohammedan created two scoring opportunities against their namesakes, but both efforts were in vain, according to reports received after the match. The popular black and white outfit were deprived of a goal in the 50th minute when a powerful shot from defender Wali Faisal rattled the opponents' woodwork. Twenty minutes later, Adil Mohammad spoiled another easy chance to lead and the Dhaka outfit left the field with a draw. Mohammedan formed a strong side for the IFA Shield by hiring three foreign recruits, five players from Muktijoddha -- Aminul Islam, Hasan Al Mamun, Rajani Kanta Barman and Aram Aziz -- Brothers' Faisal Mahmud and Abahani's Wali Faisal. Mohammedan will play their second match against Churchill Brothers on Saturday. bd
