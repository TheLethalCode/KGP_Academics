 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British newspaper publisher Trinity Mirror said it expected advertising revenue to have fallen around 3 percent in January and February this year and unveiled flat underlying pretax profit for 2007. "The uncertain economic outlook for the UK, together with the volatility, has contributed to a weak start to 2008 in the advertising market," Trinity said on Thursday. The owner of the Daily Mirror tabloid said the monthly volatility seen in the advertising market was likely to be an ongoing feature this year. Chief Executive Sly Bailey said that while Trinity was cautious about trading in 2008, the company expects a satisfactory performance for the year.

A Reuters Estimates poll of 10 analysts forecast pretax profit prior to exceptional charges of 178 million pounds. Trinity said in mid-December that it confidently expected its full-year results to be in line with expectations. The company said on Thursday it aims to substantially boost its digital-related revenues via new launches and acquisitions. Digital revenues currently account for 3.7 percent of total revenues and 6.7 percent of advertising revenues on Trinity's retained businsses. Trinity sold its sports division and several regional newspaper assets during 2007 and decided to keep its a clutch of papers in southern England and the Midlands after it did not get high enough offers. Trinity's shares trade on around 7.5 times forecast 2009 earnings, which appeared to be relatively undemanding, UBS said ahead of the results, adding that its "sell" rating was due to the downside risks to short-term estimates as the industry shifts to online ads. The company said it proposed to keep the final dividend at 15.5 pence per sha
