<TITLE> Defence deal delay raises talk of India-Russia unease </TITLE>

 NEW DELHI, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has agreed to pay Russia a higher price for a delayed aircraft carrier, but analysts said problems with the deal underlined growing unease between one of the world's biggest arms buyers and its most trusted supplier. The delivery of aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov has been pushed back four years to 2012 and would cost India an additional $1.2 billion in refitting costs, Vijay Singh, India's defence secretary, told reporters late on Wednesday in New Delhi. In 2004, India and Russia signed a $1.6 billion deal to bring the Admiral Gorshkov to India by 2008. But the Russians have postponed delivery, citing technical problems and overhead costs, while pushing the price up to $2.7 billion.

TRIED AND TESTED FRIEND India plans to spend $30 billion on imports over the next four years to modernise its largely Soviet-era arms and is looking beyond Russia for new weapons systems. Indian military officers have privately criticised the government for bowing to Russia's demands, but analysts said Russia was a tried and tested friend. Joshi said India should remember the "friendship prices" from Russia that enabled it to equip the world's fourth largest military since the late 1960s, and other analysts said New Delhi was wise to maintain a close relationship with Russia. "There are some changes with more players like the US entering the Indian market," Brahma Chellaney of the Centre for Policy Research said in New Delhi.
