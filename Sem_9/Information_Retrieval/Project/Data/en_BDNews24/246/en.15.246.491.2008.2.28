<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 28 (bdnews24.com)The National Acid Control Council Thursday discussed implementation of the Acid Control Act 2002, which has lain largely dormant since it was passed. "No rules have been finalised since the act was passed, although a set of draft rules does exist," home secretary Abdul Karim told reporters after the council met. The secretary said a draft of the rules for implementation would be finalised soon. A total of 1,440 acid attack cases have been filed since the law was promulgated, Karim said, adding that 322 of those cases were currently under trial at different courts in the country. Charge sheets have been submitted in 842 of the cases and final reports in 568, while investigations are ongoing in 30 cases, he added. The secretary said 254 people, from only 13 percent of the cases, had so far been sentenced, 11 of whom were awarded the death penalty. The accused were acquitted in the remaining cases as the allegations against them could not be substantiated, often because of social pressures. Further reasons for the poor prosecution rate, Karim said, was a lack of witness depositions and negligence by investigation officers. A monitoring cell established at the police headquarters as well as district-level acid attack prevention committees have been instructed to investigate possible cases of police negligence. "Officials will be dealt with in cases where they are found guilty," he said. The secretary advised the victims of acid attacks to pursue their cases on appeal to the higher courts if they felt the offenders had not initially received an adequate sentence. The health ministry has also been advised to review hospital forms relating to acid attacks and rethink the process for transferring them from government to private hospitals, said Karim. The secretary highlighted the lack of beds and inadequate facilities in government hospitals for treating burn and acid attack cases. "This means seriously injured patients generally require relocation," said Karim. bdnew
