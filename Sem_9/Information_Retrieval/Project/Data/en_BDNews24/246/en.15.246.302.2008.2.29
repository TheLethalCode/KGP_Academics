 LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar hit record lows against the euro, Swiss franc and a basket of major currencies on Friday, weighed down by worries about the US economy and expectations of further aggressive interest rate cuts. A surprisingly large rise in weekly US jobless claims on Thursday and confirmation that the world's biggest economy barely grew in the final quarter of 2007 fuelled recession worries. This has contrasted with upbeat releases from other countries, such as German retail sales growing at their strongest pace in over a year in January. Markets are now fully pricing in a 50 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve in March and are giving a more than 1-in-3 chance of a bigger, 75 basis point move. "The market seems very keen on buying the idea of decoupling...that US weakness is U.S. specific and that's playing out through a weaker dollar," said Adam Cole, global head of FX currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets. The dollar index hit a record low of 73.560 and was en route to its biggest weekly loss in more than two years, of 2.5 percent.

Bernanke told the U.S. Congress he expected "some failures" among small U.S. banks due to the financial stress of housing market woes and mortgage losses. Analysts also said Bernanke's comments that the weak dollar was helping to shrink the United States' trade deficit were seen as a green light for continued dollar selling. ECB VS FED With the European Central Bank seeming to give an equal weight to rising price pressures as slowing growth final euro zone inflation data for January at 1000 GMT will be closely watched by markets. Euro zone February sentiment data and January unemployment data are also due at the same time. "Basically (the data will show) a resilient growth picture and higher inflation environment - all euro supportive," CIBC World Markets said in a research note. Traders said the US currency would continue to take a beating as investors speculate that the Fed may prioritise growth over inflation risks in the near term, clearing the way for further aggressive rate cuts after 225 basis points worth of easing since September. "The only way forward for the dollar is down as recent ranges have been broken completely," said a senior trader at a European ba
