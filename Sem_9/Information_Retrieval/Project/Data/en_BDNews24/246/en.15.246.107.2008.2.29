<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan both scored half centuries to help Sri Lanka post 221 in their triangular one-day series against Australia on Friday. Dilshan scored 62 while Jayawardene made 50 for Sri Lanka, who have already been knocked out of contention for the best-of-three series finals that start on Sunday in Sydney. Chamara Silva chipped in with 35 while he combined in a 60-run partnership with Dilshan, though he slightly derailed his side's final few overs when he ran Dilshan out in the 45th over while attempting a cheeky single. Explosive opener Sanath Jayasuriya, playing his last match in Australia, appeared to be preparing to sign off in style when he smashed two lofted boundaries and a six but was dismissed for 23 as Australia's bowlers ripped the top off Sri Lanka's innings. Left arm seamer Nathan Bracken was particularly parsimonious, with his first spell of eight overs consisting of three maidens while he conceded just nine runs. He finished with 4-29 off 10 overs. Jayawardene had won the toss and elected to bat but his side found the going tough when Dilruwan Perera was trapped lbw for five by Brett Lee before Jayasuriya was caught by Mike Hussey off Bracken to leave them 32-2 in the 10th over. Kumar Sangakkara was then dismissed by an athletic full length diving catch by Hussey for 11 before Chamara Kapugedera was caught by wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist off James Hopes. Kapugedera's 33-minute, 23-ball innings for just two runs was indicative of his side's inability to get after the Australian attack early on and they crawled to 61-4 in the 20th over. Jayawardene and Dilshan then increased the run rate before the captain played across the line against Brad Hogg and was trapped in front just after he reached 50. Dilshan and Silva then put on 60 in 13.2 overs but Silva's decision to dab the ball down and take off for the quick single ended their partnership when Hopes followed through and his diving underarm flick ran Dilshan out by about a metre. Australia and India will contest the finals serie
