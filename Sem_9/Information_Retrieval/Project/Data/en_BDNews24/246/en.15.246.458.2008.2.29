 Peter Apps LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) Women on bended knees, commitment-shy men and very long odds on a royal proposal will top Leap Year 2008 antics on Friday. One in five women told Australian magazine New Woman they believe that February 29 is the time to take marital matters into their own hands even as the British government said single men are far more reluctant to get married than 10 years ago. And the tradition which dictates that women can propose marriage to a man on Leap Year day might not be such a bad thing if you're a thrifty single chap, whose main objections to popping the question are the cost of a ring and a honeymoon. More than half the women surveyed by New Woman said they would willingly split the cost of an engagement ring, 27 percent said they would go down on bended knee to ask and one in four would ask their partner's family for permission first. "We all love a bit of old-fashioned romance, but the days of waiting around for men to sweep us off our feet are long-gone," New Woman editor Donna Armstrong said. The latest British government figures on marriage revealed the number of single men getting married for the first time fell to 22.2 per 1,000 from 32.4 more than a decade ago. And some said they don't relish a tradition which puts their fate in the hands of their girlfriends. "I don't think it's a good idea," said Nick Soldinger, deputy editor of British men's magazine Nuts. "Proposing marriage is a big deal for blokes and they like to feel in control. Take that away and most young guys would run a mile even if they really wanted to get married." A survey by Nuts found that more than a fifth of men cited fear of long-term commitment as the primary reason for avoiding marriage. A fear of the best man's speech also ranked high alongside the expense, hassle and the risk of nuptial tears. Royal romance watchers should know that British betting shop William Hill put the odds of Kate Middleton asking Prince William to wed at 50-1 and his royal cousin Zara Phillips was a 25-1 shot to ask England rugby player Mike Tindall. Troubled U.S. pop singer Britney Spears came top of the list at 6-1 on her asking paparazzi boyfriend Adnan Ghalib to wed, William Hill said. Not that it's all hunt or be hunted on the big day. Leap year babies began celebrating their birthdays on the Internet like never before, gathering on social network sites like Facebook and Myspace to trade bad jokes. Facebook's Leap Year group now counts some 800 members and has a list of statements and questions for "leaplings". "I am pretty excited because I am buying my first house on Friday, my 7th birthday!" one Facebook member wrote. And on www.leapyearday.com, Leap Day babies wish each other a happy birthday, urge people to party like it only happens once every four years, and campaigned for U.S. calendar publishers to add "Leap Day" to every Feb 29. Back in Britain, hotel chain Malmaison is offering a free suite at a choice of 10 hotels for the first honeymoon night if a man accepts the offer of betrothal. They have a dozen bookings from women whose boyfriends are, presumably, unaware of what will unfold. "I think any guy being taken away by his girlfriend on February 29 all-expenses-paid should watch out," said Malmaison spokesman Nigel Massey. "It could be the last free night of your life."
