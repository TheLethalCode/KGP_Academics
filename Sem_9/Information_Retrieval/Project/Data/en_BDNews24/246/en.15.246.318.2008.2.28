<TITLE> Dollar steadier; oil, gold off peaks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar found a steadier footing on Thursday after having slumped to a record low against a basket of currencies, and both gold and oil took a breather as investors cashed in on the recent run to all-time highs. A mixed bag of corporate results kept European stock markets under a bit of pressure with investors, already fretting about the health of the US economy, keeping a close eye on profits. A recent flow of negative economic data that fed US recession fears and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke bolstered expectations there will be more US interest rate cuts to come. Delivering the Fed's semi-annual report on the US economy to Congress on Wednesday, Bernanke said It was "important to recognize that downside risks to growth remains", signalling a readiness to lower rates to prevent further damage to the economy. Bernanke will continue his testimony to the House Finance Services Committee later on Thursday. "We've just had a big move driven by Bernanke who confirmed market expectations of a rate cut of 50 basis points and probably more to come," said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at BTM-UFJ. "Now markets are inevitably pausing and consolidating, but any pause will be fairly brief as breaking through these levels provides a catalyst to go further," he added. The dollar index, which tracks its performance against six major currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to 74.298, but was still not far off Wednesday's record low of 74.070. The euro, which broke through the psychological $1.50 level on Wednesday and went on to hit an all-time high of $1.5144, was trading just below $1.51. Markets are giving a strong chance of a 50 basis point cut to the 3.0 percent fed funds rate at the March policy meeting and a small risk of a bigger 75 point cut. U.S. crude eased 55 cents to $99.08, climbing off the record high above $102 set on Wednesday, while gold was at $955.20, down from the record high of $964.70 set in the previous session. Even European credit spreads were relatively steady, drawing breath after a sharp rally earlier in the week. The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index was at 107.5 basis points, according to data from Markit. "It kind of feels like the music's stopped for a while," said a trader in London. STOCKS SOFT But mixed corporate results kept equity investors cautious. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares eased 0.4 percent with Germany's DAX 0.3 percent lower. Insurer Axa and drug and chemical group Bayer both fell after disappointing investors with their results, but Royal Bank of Scotland, Britain's second-biggest bank, rose after posting in-line earnings and raising its dividend. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.8 percent as investors sold exporters like Toyota Motor Corp on worries that a stronger yen would hurt profits, while MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets shed 0.3 percent. MSCI's main world equity index was down 0.3 percent. Weakness in stocks gave government bonds a slightly bid tone as investors sought the relatively safety of sovereign debt. The March bund future climbed 18 ticks, while the benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.07 perce
