 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil will be sent to Singapore Monday for better treatment, DIG (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said. Updates with changes The term of his one-month parole took effect from 7:45pm Sunday, the prisons official said. Although Jalil was to spend the night at his Gulshan home, before his flight to the city-state, as Siddiqui said, he was kept at LabAid Cardiac Hospital in a change of mind Sunday night. In a circular, the government also announced its decision on "temporary parole". Jalil's wife Rehana Jalil sought to take her husband to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. "Rehana Jalil will accompany her husband," said one of the AL leaders who flocked to LabAid Cardiac Hospital where Jalil had been hospitalised with heart failure and kidney ailments. AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said: "The condition of Abdul Jalil is bad." The recommendation for overseas treatment of Jalil came after a new medical board was formed with five members. Earlier, a high-profile meeting was held at the Chief Adviser's Office where law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and home adviser MA Matin were also present. The medical board included doctors from the Combined Military Hospital, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and medical colleges. A doctor treating Jalil at LabAid Cardiac Hospital said Saturday the health condition of the detained AL leader was unstable. "His condition is critical. He suffered mild heart failure on Friday night as his kidneys were not functioning," Dr Motiur Rahman, chief cardiologist of the hospital, told bdnews24.com Saturday. bdnews24.com/l
