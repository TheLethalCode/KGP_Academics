 MADRID, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid restored their five-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the Primera Liga on Saturday by winning 3-2 at Recreativo Huelva while the Catalans were thumped 4-2 away to Atletico Madrid. Brazilian forward Robinho led Real to a comeback victory with two top-class strikes after coming on as a second-half substitute in a game that featured three red cards, two for Recreativo. Atletico also fought back from a goal down, teenage striker Sergio Aguero leading the way with two goals and a clever assist. Real lead the standings with 59 points from 26 games, Barca follow on 54 while Atletico remain in fourth spot with 44, two behind Villarreal who are at home to Osasuna on Sunday. Espanyol moved up to fifth spot with 42 points after a double from striker Luis Garcia earned a 2-0 win at home to Valencia and their first points in four matches. Sevilla slipped a place to sixth after losing 2-1 at relegation-threatened Deportivo Coruna. Barca started well at the Calderon, Ronaldinho putting them in front with a spectacular overhead kick but the goal sparked an extraordinary rally from Atletico. Aguero equalised with a deflected shot after 36 minutes before providing the pass to allow fellow Argentine Maxi Rodriguez to put the home side 2-1 up. Diego Forlan extended Atletico's lead with a penalty early in the second half after Carles Puyol pushed Aguero as he darted into the area. SOLO EFFORT The Argentine youngster capped a brilliant performance with a virtuoso solo effort, jinking past Gianluca Zambrotta and leaving Puyol on his back before firing low past goalkeeper Victor Valdes to make it 4-1. Samuel Eto'o netted for second-placed Barca 16 minutes from time but Frank Rijkaard's side still slipped to their first defeat in nine league matches. Real, who had lost three of their last four league games, fell behind at Recreativo when Uruguayan defender Martin Caceres steered the ball in at the far post following a free kick. The visitors equalised against the run of play after 28 minutes when Raul headed over Stefano Sorrentino as the Recreativo keeper tried to punch the ball clear. There was a flurry of red cards early in the second half, Recreativo having defenders Beto and Quique Alvarez dismissed either side of Real fullback Sergio Ramos's sending off. It was the appearance of Robinho 17 minutes from time that proved decisive. The Brazilian put Real in front with his first touch, firing home after snapping up a loose ball on the edge of the area. Robinho then made it 3-1 with a delightful chip before Recreativo pulled a goal back in added time when midfielder Carlos Martins curled in a free kick
