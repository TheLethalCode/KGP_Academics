 WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The US economy is in a slowdown but not headed into a recession, President George W Bush said on Thursday after new data showed slow fourth-quarter growth and a bigger-than-expected jump in unemployment claims. Bush, speaking at a White House news conference, also said he didn't think another economic stimulus package was necessary at the moment, adding "why don't we let stimulus package one have a chance to kick in." "There is no question the economy has slowed down," Bush said. "I don't think we're headed into a recession, but there is no question we are in a slowdown." "And that's why we acted, and acted strongly, with over $150 billion worth of pro-growth economic incentives, mainly money going into the hands of our consumers."

"If you're out there wondering what your life is going to be like and you're looking at $4 a gallon, that's uncertain." The US dollar fell to a record low against the euro on Thursday on fears that the US economy is heading for a recession. The government reported on Thursday that gross domestic product, which measures total goods and service output within U.S. borders, rose at an annual rate of 0.6 percent. It was slowed by a collapse in spending on new homes and a slump in inventories, and was slightly weaker than the 0.7 percent pace forecast by analysts polled by Reuters.
