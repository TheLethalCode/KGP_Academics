 MADRID, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in remarks published on Sunday that some Western countries were using Iran's nuclear activity as a pretext to pressure his country. Ahmadinejad also told the Spanish El Pais newspaper some in the West was not happy with the assurances that Tehran had given to the international nuclear watchdog showing that Iran's nuclear programme was intended for peaceful purposes only.

Obama has said he would engage in direct talks with Iran if he was elected. "I think it's impossible for Obama to achieve the presidency because of the hidden forces that exist in the United States," the Iranian president said. "It makes no difference to us who wi
