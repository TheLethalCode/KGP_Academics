 Chittagong, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)  Graeme Smith smashed double hundred and Neil McKenzie struck a ton as South Africa cruised to a mammoth 405 for no loss against Bangladesh at the close of the first day of the second Test at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium Friday. Smith remained unbeaten on 223 to reach the 5000-run club as the fourth South African batsman after Jacques Kallis, Gary Kristen and Herschelle Gibbs. McKenzie passed his previous best of 120 against New Zealand in 2000 to make 169 not out, his first century after his second hundred (103) against Sri Lanka in Centurion in May, 2001. Smith and McKenzie set South Africa's new opening partnership record, eclipsing their previous best of 368 first-wicket stand by Smith and Gibbs against Pakistan in Cape Town in January, 2003. The opening pair is also just nine runs shy of breaking a 52- year world record of 413 set by Indian openers Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy against New Zealand in Chennai in 1956. They also erased their previous opening partnership record of 87 against Bangladesh after Gibbs and Smith made the opening stand record against Bangladesh at East London in 2002. The 27-year old Smith, drove Shakib Al Hasan for a single to reach his 14th Test century playing 127 balls before the opener turned Mashrafee Bin Mortaza past to square leg for a single to arrive at his fourth double ton from 238 balls. Bangladesh's toothless attack hardly troubled the South African pair and they played round the wicket striking 52 boundaries and four sixes. Smith smashed 32 fours and one six in his 254-ball knock to remain 44 runs away from his career best 277 against England. Mohammad Rafique could have been the day's lone successful bowler had he taken a return catch off McKenzie on 131. McKenzie finally stuck 20 fours and three sixes facing 287 balls. Shahadat Hossain (97 in 18 overs), Rafique (87 in 23 overs), Mashrafee (66 in 16 overs) and Abdur Razzak (76 in 15 overs) were blunted by the Proteas. Fielding first, Bangladesh ended the first day without any wicket for the second time since India's posting 326 for no loss against them in Dhaka in May 2007. Bangladesh, however, saw Sri Lanka post the highest 449 for seven against them at the close of the first day in Colombo in 2005. Bangladesh earlier brought one change in the squad that played the first Test in Dhaka with left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak replacing top-order batsman Habibul Bashar. South Africa also made one change with Robin Peterson coming in for Johan Botha. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Junaid Siddique, Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Ashraful, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Rafique, Mashrafe Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain. South Africa squad: Neil McKenzie, Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Aswell Prince, Mark Boucher, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Makhya Ntini. bdn
