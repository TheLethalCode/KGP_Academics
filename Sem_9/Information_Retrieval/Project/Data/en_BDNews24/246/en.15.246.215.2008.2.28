<TEXT>
 PARIS, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Once the creme de la creme of French education, alumni of the country's most elite graduate school are struggling to land top jobs in business and industry, according to a newspaper report on Thursday. The daily Le Figaro said an education at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) was no longer a ticket to a plum management post in the private sector and its graduates must join the queue with other applicants. The upper echelons of the civil service are still populated by former ENA students, known as "enarques", but Le Figaro said today's company managers found them arrogant, ill-suited to business and too technocratic. "Not only do they have inflated egos, they consider the private sector as something to fall back on," it quoted Jean-Francois Roquet of the human resources consultancy Francois Sanchez Consultants as saying. ENA graduates account for just 10 percent of senior executives in the private sector, compared with 20 percent in 1995, according to Francois Kesler, former ENA deputy director and author of a critical book on the school. Executive recruitment expert Michel Souzay said in the past their qualifications were over-valued and that was no longer the case. "From now on, it's done on a case-by-case basis." The institution, which has produced top civil servants and captains of industry for more than half a century, has faced accusations in recent years that it is out of touch, creating an arrogant and self-serving class of senior officials. Alumni include two of France's last three presidents, as well as Bank of France governor Christian Noyer and European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet. President Nicolas Sarkozy did not attend the school and has made his dislike of that elite clear. But his Socialist opponent in last year's presidential election, Segolene Royal, is an ENA graduate. Founded by General Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to train senior civil servants, it turns out barely 100 graduates a year and critics say they all come from similar social backgrounds and virtually none are from ethnic minorities. A report in 2003 called for an overhaul of ENA to enable it to compete better with prestigious foreign universiti
