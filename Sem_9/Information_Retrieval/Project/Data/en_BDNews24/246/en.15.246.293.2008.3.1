 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has called on his administration to speed up the sluggish rate of this year's ADP implementation, a government official said Saturday. Planning secretary Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury spoke to reporters after a meeting of the executive committee of the national economic council at its conference room in Sher-e-Bangla. Fakhruddin told the meeting that the government had no alternative to boosting implementation of the annual development programme, Chowdhury said. "The chief adviser asked ministry officials to take up specific work plans to increase ADP implementation." The planning secretary said the latest estimate for ADP implementation in the first seven months of the current fiscal year (July-January) constituted 25 percent of the total budget of Tk 26,500 crore. In the same period last year the figure stood at 29 percent, Chowdhury said. A planning ministry report on this year's ADP implementation stated that the health and education ministries had increased their implementation relative to the same period last year. However, implementation by the ministries of communications and local government had fallen from the same period the previous fiscal year, the report said. Chowdhury said the two consecutive floods combined with Cyclone Sidr hampered ADP implementation this year. The ECNEC meeting gave the go-ahead to 12 projects worth Tk 2,524 crore, the planning secretary said. Of them, nine projects will be implemented with government funds, with the others to be funded by the World Bank and different donor agencies. "Loans worth Tk 1,088 crore will be provided to fund the projects," the secretary said. The projects are: The Bakrabad-Siddirganj pipeline project was given the go-ahead at Tk 685 crore. Enhancing agricultural technology countrywide at a cost of Tk 622 crore. Infrastructure development for rural roads and markets was approved at Tk 500 crore, while the Char Area Development project was approved at Tk 94 crore. The union infrastructure project has been approved at a cost of Tk 140 crore. A project to build a connecting road from Airport Road to Mirpur Cantonment was approved at Tk 136 crore. The purchase of modern equipment for the Fire Service at Tk 86 crore. Improving water supply and setting up clear drainage systems in 18 district cities at a cost of Tk 31 crore. Protecting the Betil and Enayetbazar areas from erosion by the Jamuna River was approved at Tk 31 crore. bdnews
