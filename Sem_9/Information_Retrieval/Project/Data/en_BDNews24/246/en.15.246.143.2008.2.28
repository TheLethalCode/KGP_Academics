 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Whitbread said on Thursday it would save 25 million pounds ($49.56 million) a year by combining its Premier Inn hotels, Beefeater restaurants and Brewers Fayre pubs into one business. Whitbread said merging its budget hotels and pub restaurants would take around a year to complete and incur a one-off cost of 35 million pounds. The aim is to have hotels and pub restaurants on all of its sites. The 35 million cost will be split over two years, mostly in the second year. It is the latest move by Whitbread to slim down its business, having sold Marriott, Deep Pan Pizza, TGI Friday and David Lloyd over the last few years. It also sold 235 restaurants to Mitchells & Butlers in 2006 but kept hold of 130 it hoped to attach Premier Inns to. Chief Executive Alan Parker revealed it had plans to build on around 100 of the sites and would sell off around 20 Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub restaurants, having struggled to get the necessary planning permission. PUB CHEER Whitbread added that it was on track to hit market forecasts for the year, which average at 208 million pounds for pretax profit, according to a Reuters Estimates poll of 16 analysts. Like-for-like sales in the 50 weeks to Feb. 14 were up 5.7 percent, slowing from a 5.8 percent rise last time it reported. Premier Inn like-for-like sales were up 10.5 percent over the 50 weeks, Costa coffee was up 6.3 percent, and its pubs and restaurants were up 0.8 percent, the company said. Having seen pub and restaurant takings stagnate for months, Parker said like-for-like sales had picked up over the last 11 weeks, growing 2 percent. Investors welcomed the restructuring and sales news, pushing shares in the firm up 7.2 percent to 1,314 pence by 1057 GMT. "The markets have been treating Whitbread in the same way as they have the other pub and restaurant companies, which, we would suggest, does not accurately reflect what's gone on," said BlueOar analyst Mark Brumby. "Good, solid performance, with more to come. No slowdown evident, but realism expressed ... And there is no debt, and that matters," he added. Finance chief Rogers said there was also currently no chance of reviving its plans for a bond issue that it had originally hoped would fund a 600 million pound shareholders handout. "All the indications are that the securitisation and the asset-backed market are as good as shut," he sa
