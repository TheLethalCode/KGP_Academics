 WELLINGTON, March 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell both scored centuries for England in their drawn practice match against a New Zealand Invitational XI on Saturday. Strauss retired on 104 and Bell finished 104 not out as England made amends for their dismal first innings total of 131 by making 325 for seven in their second knock. The match was abandoned at tea on the third and final day at Dunedin's University Oval because of rain with neither side in a position to push for a win. Strauss virtually assured himself of a recall to the test side for next week's opening match against New Zealand with a patient display over four and a half hours. Bell continued his impressive form in the series with a chanceless innings including 15 fours and a six but Paul Collingwood failed to get some valuable practice ahead of the test, departing for a fourth ball duc
