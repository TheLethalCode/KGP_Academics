 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone has started weighing the fundamentals of the capital market ahead of an initial public offer, expected by June. GP officials met finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday to say they wanted to offload 10 percent of its shares on to the capital market soon. But the officials sought assurance from the adviser on whether the market would be able to absorb the impact of the share listing. After the meeting, Mirza Aziz told reporters: "Grameenphone has taken preparation for an IPO. It wants to rest assured that the capital market rules and regulations do not change in future." "Also, Grameenphone wanted to know whether the market would be able to absorb 10 percent of its shares, meant for the market." A delegation led by the vice president of Telenor Asia, Per Erik Hylland, met the adviser at the Planning Ministry. However, after the meeting, the Telenor delegation did not agree to speak to reporters. Grameen Telecom owns 38 percent in GP, while Telenor, the largest phone company in the Nordic region, owns 62 percent. Mirza Aziz said: "I have assured them (the delegation) that a private sector-friendly environment exists in Bangladesh." He hoped that the same environment would prevail in future. "On whether the market will be able to absorb 10 percent of its shares, I said there would be no problem." Speaking to bdnews24.com by phone, Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive officer Salahuddin Ahmed Wednesday said the share market has the capacity to absorb the GP shares planned for listing. In a meeting with Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission on Jan 16, GP promised to come to the market by June. bdnews
