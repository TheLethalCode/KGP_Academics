<TEXT>
 SEOUL, March 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham scored from the penalty spot but his LA Galaxy side were beaten 2-1 in a shootout by FC Seoul after a 1-1 draw in a friendly on Saturday. The former England captain had a hand in the Galaxy's 21st-minute opener, his long through ball pounced on by Alan Gordon, who turned to fire the visitors into the lead. FC Seoul equalised 10 minutes later when Jung Jo-gook converted from the spot. "First-half was some of the best football I played (with the Galaxy)," Beckham said. "I think we played very well in the first half but we were a bit tired in the second." Beckham made no mistake with his kick in the shootout but his team mates were less reliable, allowing Lee Sang-hyup to win the game for the home side. Beckham played the entire game despite reports that the former Real Madrid midfielder would be limited to a half to avoid the risk of injury before the start of the MLS season
