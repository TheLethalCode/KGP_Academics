 LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Exhibitions and online media company United Business Media on Friday posted an 11.5 percent rise in underlying 2007 profit to 166.1 million pounds ($329 million) and said the new year had started well. Chief Executive David Levin said revenue bookings for UBM's top 20 shows were running more than 10 percent ahead of last year's levels. Finance Director Nigel Wilson said the company's appetite for new acquisitions was undiminished by the ongoing turmoil in global financial markets. Wilson told Reuters in an interview that UBM was not seeing as much competition for deals from private equity groups as it had over the past two years. "We have made some of our best acquisitions buying companies from private equity. We expect in the next two years to see opportunities from buying assets from private equity which they have in their portfolio and realise that the exit is in fact selling to companies like us," he said. UBM spent nearly 100 million pounds on 17 acquisitions last year and this year has spent 25 million pounds on five acquisitions. It is sticking to its target of spending 150-250 million pounds on acquisitions in both 2008 and 2009. Wilson said that in in 2007 UBM bid for eight companies it did not get and passed on more than 50 businesses. CEO Levin said UBM has made 52 acquisitions in the past three years, generating a cumulative 13.1 percent pretax return on capital. London-based UBM said 2007 revenue was up 8.5 percent at 801.6 million pounds, compared with an average forecast of 19 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates of 788.4 million. Pretax profit before amortisation and exceptional charges was seen at 164.12 million pounds, based on 13 forecasts. The dividend per share was raised by 20 percent to 21.6 pence, just ahead of the average 20.70 pence figure from 19 forecasts. Levin said UBM was not interested in pitching for the business information division put up for sale last week by Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier that analysts think could fetch around 1.1 billion pounds. "We have a strategy built around integrated media so to pick up a block of orphaned print assets is not consistent with what we want to do," Levin told Reuters. The company's exhibitions include the Hong Kong Jewellery and Watch Fair, Asia's largest jewellery fair, and Furniture China, the largest international furniture exhibition in Asia. Its portfolio of magazines include Music Week and Property We
