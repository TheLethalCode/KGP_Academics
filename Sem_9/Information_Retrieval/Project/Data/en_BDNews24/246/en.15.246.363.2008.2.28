 BERLIN, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich needed a Franck Ribery penalty in the last minute of extra time to see off second-division city rivals TSV 1860 Munich 1-0 in the quarter-finals of the German Cup on Wednesday. The French international had to take the kick twice after his team mates encroached the first time but coolly chipped the ball in at the second attempt. The referee awarded the spot kick after Chhunly Pagenburg brought down German international striker Miroslav Klose on the very edge of the box with a penalty shootout looming. Replays appeared to suggest contact was made just outside the area. "I think from the number of chances we had you can't really dispute that we deserved the win," Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said in a television interview. Bayern ended the match with 10 men after their Italian international striker Luca Toni was sent off in the 84th minute and 1860 had two players sent off in extra time. Bayern, missing injured Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, started with Ribery and Klose on the bench and chances were scant in the first half. Midfielder Toni Kroos intercepted the ball and went clear in the 36th minute but fired his shot over the bar with Toni in a good position to his right. Bayern thought they had a penalty in the last minute of regular time when Benjamin Schwarz appeared to drag Lucio down but the referee ignored their furious appeals. Earlier, Marcelinho scored in extra time to give VfL Wolfsburg a 2-1 win over Hamburg SV in Wednesday's other quarter-final. The Brazilian looked sluggish for most of the match but found an extra burst of pace in the 109th minute to power into the Hamburg area and lift the ball over advancing goalkeeper Frank Rost. Wolfsburg had taken the lead from the penalty spot in the 17th minute. Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart then levelled spectacularly in the 70th minute, lashing a long-range shot into the top corner after Mohamed Zidan's layoff. Wolfsburg, ninth in the Bundesliga, have never won the German Cup but reached the final in 1995, losing to Borussia Moenchengladbach. In Tuesday's quarter-finals, second-division strugglers Carl Zeiss Jena beat Bundesliga champions VfB Stuttgart on penalties and Borussia Dortmund eased past second-division 1899 Hoffenheim 3-1. The draw for the March 18/19 semi-finals will take place on Sunday and the final is on April 19 in Berlin
