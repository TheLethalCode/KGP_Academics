<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Abahani Limited and City Club moved into the Premier Division Twenty20 Cricket League final defeating their respective rivals in semifinals at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium Thursday. Blazing 65 runs from opener Mahbubul Karim powered Abahani to an easy 7-wicket win over newcomers Surjo Torun in the first semis while a team effort helped City Club record a tense five-run win over Victory Sporting Club in other semis. Abahani vs Surjo Torun Sent in to bat first, the Dhanmondi-based outfit, Abahani, restricted Surjo Torun to 106 for seven in 20 overs with Talha Jubaer (3/21) and Rezaul Karim (2/25) sharing five wickets. Top-order Shakil Haider (48), Shamsur Rahman (15) and Nayeem Islam (26) laid the foundation with slow pace that caused them to make a paltry total. Abahani, in reply, got off to a blistering start with opener Mahbubul hammering a 52-ball 65 with the help of three boundaries and as many sixes. After the departure of opener Jahurul Islam (15), man of the match Mahbubul and Nazimuddin (21) took their side to the verge of triumph before both batsmen left at 103. Nadif Chowdhury (4) and Rezaul Karim (0) remained unbeaten to take Abahani to 107 for three with 14 balls to spare. City Club vs Victoria SC After being invited to bat first, City Club fell in trouble losing three batsmen for 21 runs before opener Imran Ahmed (26) and Arafat Salahuddin (38) produced some resistance. But they were finally restricted to 96 for eight in 20 overs. Except Salahuddin and Imran, no City batsmen crossed the double digits in the face of superb bowling from left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior (3/16) and pacer Shahajada (2/9). Victoria, in reply, were reduced to 32 for four in ninth over and never recorded before being restricted to 91 for six in 20 overs. Mahmudullah Riad (23 off 30 balls) and Dhiman Ghosh (28 off 32 balls) tried to accelerate the run rate in the middle, but that was not enough to reach the target. Despite ball-a-run from Shahajada (5) and Waseluddin (7), Victoria saw five runs short of the target to end the innings with 91 for six in 20 overs as pacer Shafaq Al Jabir and Arafat Salahuddin took two wickets each.
