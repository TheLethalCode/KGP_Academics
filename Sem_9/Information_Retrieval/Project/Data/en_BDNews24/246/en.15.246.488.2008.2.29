 Fahmida Wadud Chaity bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)February 29 is an extra day in the calendar, an extra day in life, enjoyed every fourth year. There is a scientific explanation. The day is meant to keep order with the astronomical calendar as a corrective measure. The earth does not orbit round the sun precisely in 365 days, rather takes 365 days and six hours. Every fourth year, an extra 24 hour, which makes a full day, is added to the calendar. As a result, humans on earth do not lag behind the real time. There are people around who long for the extra day and circle the day in their calendar, with pleasant personal memories. Dramatist Mamunur Rashid is a "leapling". "It's interesting. My friends, relatives wait for this day. I receive birthday wishes once every four years." Does Feb 29 matter? Mamunur Rashid said: "Every day is a new day. I don't particularly wait for Feb 29." Another person, who was born on Feb 29, said: "I feel I'm an alien. I feel I'm different from many others. Probably it's because of my birthday on a special day." Leap years are associated with many different traditions. In England, women may only propose on a leap year. In Greece it is considered bad luck to get married in a leap year. Indian finance minister P Chidambaram Friday joined the leap-year club presenting the country's ninth budget on that extra day. bdn
