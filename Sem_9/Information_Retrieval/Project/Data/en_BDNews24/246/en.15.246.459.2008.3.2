 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)No bank official will be allowed to take payment for attending board or committee meetings, Bangladesh Bank said Sunday. An emergency circular of the central bank was sent out to chief executives of all banks, except foreign ones. In line with the circular, no salaried officer of any state-run or private bank, including the managing director or equivalent, will be permitted to receive honorariums for attending any board meeting of the bank or any committee formed by the board. A senior central bank official, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com Sunday: "A Bangladesh Bank investigation revealed that senior bank officials, though they get a monthly salary and other benefits, were taking honorariums to the tune of Tk 1,500 to Tk 2,000 for attending board meetings." "This is against the Banking Companies Act, 1991," the official said. bdnews2
