 NAIROBI, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya faces "a long road ahead" to make a success of a power-sharing deal between government and opposition, Kofi Annan said on Sunday as he took his leave from Nairobi at the end of a six-week mediation mission. President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga signed a coalition government pact on Thursday intended to bring to a close two months of bloodshed and political upheaval following a disputed election on Dec. 27. As calm has returned after violence that cost the lives of 1,000 Kenyans and forced 300,000 to flee their homes, politicians from both sides have now begun more detailed negotiations on how the coalition deal will be implemented. "I am glad we have come this far but we still have a long road ahead. I would like all of you to remain engaged," Annan told reporters. "We want to see Kenya return to the Kenya of old. Stable, peaceful, prosperous, welcoming," the former United Nations secretary-general said. The violence devastated Kenya's tourist industry, its biggest foreign exchange earner which was worth nearly $1 billion last year, and the national currency, the shilling, only recovered after Thursday's deal was struck. Annan was heading to a environmental meeting in Kampala before going home to Geneva. "I bid you farewell," he said. "I am not fading away. I will be back when I am needed." Annan was presented with a white rooster by staff at Nairobi's Serena hotel, where the crisis negotiations were held. Three triplets and their sister sang as Annan posed for pictures with journalists and well-wishers. He is handing over day-to-day mediation to former Nigerian foreign minister Oluyemi Adeni
