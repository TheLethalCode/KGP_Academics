 Dhaka, Feb 02 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet committee on public purchase Sunday approved a Tk 27.1 crore plan to buy power transformers. Also, a Tk 14 crore land development project to build a jail in Keraniganj received the green light, according to a decision taken at a meeting of the committee, chaired by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. In a post-meeting briefing, the adviser said a plan for setting up a 150MW combined cycle power plant in Sylhet, which was also on the day's agenda, was not discussed as the power ministry lacked preparation. The meeting also approved a Tk 9.47 crore proposal to appoint an agency to help bring reforms to the management and policy of the health and family welfare ministry. In line with a proposal by the Rural Electrification Board, 6,600 power transformers are being procured to ensure uninterrupted power supply for irrigation, Mirza Aziz said. bdnew
