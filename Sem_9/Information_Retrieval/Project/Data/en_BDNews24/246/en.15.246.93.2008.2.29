 LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - You see a vacant east London building lot paved over with asphalt and used as a car park. Tim Pryce sees the site of a rack-'em, stack-'em prefab temporary designer boutique hotel.

He has already picked a site and offered to pay the owner three times what he now earns running a car park.

Just don't call them trailers. "It's not a trailer. The only similarity is that you can move it. This has as much in common with a trailer as a moon rocket," Pryce says. But then, showing off a plan to place single-story temporary rooms along a disused railway viaduct nearby, he uses the "T" word himself. "It's like the world's coolest trailer par
