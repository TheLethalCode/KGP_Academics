<TITLE> Ahmadinejad says Iraq visit opens new chapter in ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad flew to Baghdad on Sunday for the first visit by an Iranian president since the two neighbours fought a bitter war in the 1980s and said his trip marked a "new chapter" in relations. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani told a joint news conference that Iraq would seek to oust Iranian rebels based in Iraq, a long-time Iranian demand that was expected to be raised during Ahmadinejad's two-day state visit. Ahmadinejad's trip is expected to be as much about symbolism as it will be about cementing ties between the neighbours, which are both run by Shia majorities. It will be closely watched by Washington, which has more than 150,000 troops in Iraq. "This visit will open a new chapter in the two countries' bilateral relations and it will help the atmosphere of cooperation in the region," Ahmadinejad told reporters at Talabani's home in Baghdad's central Karrada district. "A visit to Iraq without the dictator is a truly happy one," he said, referring to Iran's arch-foe Saddam Hussein, who was deposed in the US-led invasion in 2003. Ahmadinejad, whose government is at odds with Washington over Tehran's nuclear programme, has repeatedly called for US forces to leave Iraq, blaming them for violence that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis since the 2003 invasion. Washington says Tehran supplies weapons and training to Shi'ite militias to attack US troops, a charge Tehran denies. Analysts say Iran seeks a stable Iraq but at the same time wants to make life difficult for occupying American forces. "A developed, powerful and united Iraq is to the advantage of everyone," Ahmadinejad said. Standing next to Ahmadinejad, Talabani said Iraq was trying to expel the Mujahadeen e-Khalq group, the largest and most militant group opposed to Iran. "The presence of those terrorists is forbidden by the constitution and we are working to get rid of them," he said. Iraqi state television footage earlier showed Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari warmly embracing Ahmadinejad, the first Iranian president to visit since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, on his arrival at Baghdad international airport. His motorcade drove from the airport to Talabani's house. Foreign dignitaries visiting Iraq normally fly by helicopter to avoid the dangerous airport road. Ahmadinejad received a red carpet welcome at Talabani's house, with a military band greeting him on his arrival. He was also due to hold talks with Talabani, Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki and Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi. Relations between Iran and Iraq have markedly improved since the 2003 invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, and analysts say Ahmadinejad will use his visit to show Washington that Tehran is a power in Iraq that cannot be ignored or sidelined. The Iranian president has sought to counter US efforts to isolate Tehran over its nuclear programme by seeking to improve ties with Arab states in the region. CLOSE TIES Iran has close ties to Iraq's Shia leadership, many of whom were in exile in Iran under Saddam's rule and both countries have longstanding ethnic and religious links. But analysts say the extent of Tehran's influence in Iraqi politics is unclear. Both have Shia majorities, but Iran is mainly Persian, while Iraqis are largely Arab and have historically rejected attempts to interfere in their affairs. US officials in Baghdad say they will play no role in Ahmadinejad's visit and that the US military will not be involved in protecting him as he travels around. When Ahmadinejad flew into Baghdad, his plane was controlled by Iraqi air controllers. But from his plane, Ahmadinejad would probably have seen the rows of American armoured vehicles and helicopters at a giant US military base next to the airport. And unlike the strict secrecy that surrounds visits by US President George W Bush to reduce the risk of an insurgent attack, Ahmadinejad's trip has been well-flagged. Also, unlike Bush, he will be spending the nig
