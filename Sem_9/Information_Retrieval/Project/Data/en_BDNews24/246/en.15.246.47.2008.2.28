 Chittagong, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Habibul Bashar has been dropped from Bangladesh's Test squad for the second Test against South Africa because of poor performance. The team management Thursday announced a 12-member squad with middle order Rajin Saleh coming in for the former Bangladesh captain during the Chittagong Test. The second and final Test between the Tigers and the Proteas begins Friday at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Bashar is being dropped from the Test squad for the first time since Bangladesh gained Test status in 2000. The top order batsman missed two Test series against visiting New Zealand in 2004 due to a thumb injury. Bashar has played 50 Tests out of Bangladesh's 52 appearances. Bashar made 11 and two in the Dhaka Test against visiting South Africa that prompted the team management to drop him from the squad. The former Bangladesh captain has not been in rhythm since his 76-run knock against Australia at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium in April 2006. Since then, he has scored 246 runs in 18 innings of nine Tests with an average of 13.66. The 35-year-old batsman scored 3026 runs in 50 Tests with an average of 30.87 that also included 24 half-centuries and three hundreds. Bangladesh's 12-member Chittagong Test squad will be: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Shahriar Nafees, Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Rajin Saleh, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Rafique, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shahadat Hossain and Abdur Razzak. bdnew
