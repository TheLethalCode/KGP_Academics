<TITLE> No Bashar in Rafique's farewell Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh take on South Africa in Mohammad Rafique's farewell Test Friday at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Coach Jaime Siddons expects the boys to learn soon from the mistakes they made in the Dhaka Test as they had really good practice sessions Thursday. "We really had two good practice sessions today. I think the boys are raring to go. They seem to switch on which is obviously a good sign. We are working on what they need to do in this Test," said Siddons at a pre-match press briefing. He, however, said it would not guarantee great cricket. The Australian coach believes 300 to 350 runs would be a good effort on the pretty dry and flat wicket, which should be good for batting. The team management dropped Habibul Bashar for the Chittagong Test as they picked a 12-member squad with Rajin Saleh replacing the former Bangladesh captain. Bashar has been dropped from the Test squad for the first time since Bangladesh gained Test status in 2000. Bashar, however, missed two Tests out of Bangladesh's 52 appearances due to thumb injury. "It was a tough decision in my cricketing career to axe him (Bashar)," said captain Mohammad Ashraful adding that Habibul has been passing a bad patch for the last eight Tests. It is also going to be the last Test for Bangladesh's most successful spinner Mohammad Rafique, who is two wickets shy of 100 Test scalps as the first Bangladeshi bowler. "Before the series, I have decided to quit from the international cricket as a group of people in the Bangladesh Cricket Board do not like to see me in the squad," the left-arm spinner told reporters. "These officials did not allow me to play test cricket for nearly three years and they are now back on the board. So I have decided to quit," added the 37-year-old, who has played in 32 tests and 125 one-day internationals. Whether he returns to the fold if the management recalls him, Rafique said, "I have announced my retirement before the start of the series, and everyone knows it. If the board had such an intent, it would have informed me earlier." Rafique also said that the selection committee had earlier told him that he had no place in the ODI squad. Rafique was excluded from the one-day tour of Sri Lanka last July and the squad that went to New Zealand in January. He is the first Bangladesh player to complete the double of 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in one-day internationals. On the other hand, South Africa skipper Graeme Smith was concentrating on the Chittagong Test. "I think patience is going to be key to our second Test here. We were not patient enough in our first innings in the first test in Dhaka. So that's something we are talking about," said Smith. "What I understand is that the wicket is going to behave pretty good in the first two days," Smith said. bdn
