 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Thursday demanded immediate release of party general secretary Abdul Jalil to give him an opportunity to take better treatment. Zillur made the demand in a statement signed by the party's deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haque. Doctors say Jalil's kidneys are in critical condition, with his blood pressure rising uncontrollably. He also has heart and liver problems and his vision is impaired. "In such a situation to save his life he needs to be immediately sent to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore where he took treatment earlier," Zillur said. bdnews
