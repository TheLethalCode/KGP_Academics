 Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime ministers, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, filled in their voter registration forms Friday, the last date for voter registration in the Dhaka City Corporation area, a prisons official said. Deputy inspector general (prisons) major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said, "The two former prime ministers have filled out their voter registration forms. Their signatures and photographs will be taken either on Sunday or Monday." Hasina wanted to be a voter of Dhanmondi while Khaleda wanted her cantonment home as her address, Siddiqui said. "They will get what they wish," he said. The country's law allows prisoners to cast their votes through postal ballots. Meanwhile, an EC official said that they would complete preparation of the electoral roll in the Dhaka metropolitan area Friday. Biswas Lutfar Rahman, assistant election commissioner for Dhaka division, said that they had got some 34.23 lakh voters in the metropolis until Tuesday. On whether the commission would extend the timeline for citizens left out of the voter registration, the official said: "The commission will look into it." He said that many registration centres had been kept open for last 10 days for the people left out of the process, but it did not attract any big turn-up. He said that people not yet registered would be able to list their names during a 15-day timeframe before publication of the draft voter list. bdnews24.com/
