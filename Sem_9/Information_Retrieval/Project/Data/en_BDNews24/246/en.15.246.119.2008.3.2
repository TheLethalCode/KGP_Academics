 DALLAS, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Sen Hillary Clinton's poll numbers are slipping and each day seems to bring news of waning support but a display of stubborn optimism surrounds the candidate who faces do-or-die contests in her presidential bid this week. Despite Clinton's declining popularity and growing momentum for rival Democrat Sen. Barack Obama, aides and supporters reveal nary a glimpse of the doom and gloom that many pundits predict for the former front-runner now struggling in her bid to become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee for November's election. The former first lady, who would be the country's first female president, faces nominating contests on Tuesday in Texas and Ohio, where if she loses, many say, she could be forced to leave the race. "The mood is very upbeat and focused, and I think that comes right from the top," said campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway. "She's very clear-headed, focused on the task, doesn't let any ups and downs get us down." That's what Clinton says, too. "We have to win on Tuesday, that's not a surprise to any of you, and we are going to win on Tuesday," she told supporters and campaign volunteers over the weekend in Texas. "Don't sleep between now and the time those caucuses are over." On board her campaign plane, her voice hoarse after months of speeches and interviews, Clinton told reporters, "I'm just focusing on doing the best I can." "I feel good about our campaigns," she said. "We'll find out how people evaluate our candidacies on Tuesday." Clinton plans a television appearance on the satirical "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" on Monday, on the eve of the voting, when the comic host is sure to joke about the state of her political affairs. She also made a cameo appearance on the "Saturday Night Live" comedy show. REPORTS OF BICKERING What happens behind the campaign's closed doors, of course, could be an entirely different story. Her top aides do not often travel on campaign trips, where their demeanor would be most visible. Some U.S. media have carried reports of her staff bickering and blaming one another for campaign woes. Clinton has lost the past 11 primaries to Obama. Those who travel steadily with Clinton say the campaign mood was grimmest immediately after the so-called Super Tuesday voting in early February, when she failed to score a decisive edge over Obama. With Arizona Sen. John McCain closing in on the Republican nomination, polls show Obama gaining on Clinton in Texas and Ohio, campaign staff like to point out how inaccurate polls were before the New Hampshire primary. Heading into that contest on Jan. 5, polls showed Clinton well behind Obama but she emerged victorious and rejuvenated. Those who have covered Clinton over the years see her as tireless and not likely to flag in the face of adversity. In her first Senate campaign in New York, she liked to cite Harriet Tubman, a heroic former slave who helped other slaves escape to freedom. "If you hear the dogs, keep on going. If you hear gunfire, keep on going. If you hear shouts and footsteps, keep on going," Clinton would say, quoting Tubman. These days, Clinton supporters at campaign events sound positive, although a few admit to harboring doubts. "I'm a little worried. It's only natural," Susan Pena said at a rally in San Antonio before she was interrupted by a fellow Clinton supporter who insisted Clinton was assured of victory. Clinton volunteer Carolee Moore, a retired social worker in San Antonio, said she had stopped paying attention to the news. "You know what our attitude is? Don't look at it if it bothers you," she sa
