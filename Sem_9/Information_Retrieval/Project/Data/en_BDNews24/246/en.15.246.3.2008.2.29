 LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's SCi said it needed to raise 50 million pounds ($99 million) after the cost of scrapping a series of ill-conceived computer games caused a heavy first-half loss, hammering its shares to a five-year low. The company behind Lara Croft, heroine of the Tomb Raider games, said it wanted to go to the stock market for cash after a first-half loss of over 80 million pounds, compared with 18 million in the same period last year. It also plans to cut around 270 jobs or about 25 percent of the workforce.

The preference is for an equity issue, but with no evidence of support for this plan, in these markets it is a concern," he told Reuters. Phil Rogers, who has been at the company almost a year, launched a business review after he replaced Jane Cavanagh as CEO in mid-January. SCi was in takeover talks with various parties between September and January but the company said it was not currently looking for a buyer. "At this time the board is not encouraging offers for the company but, in a consolidating industry, a sensible offer ... will be considered," it said in a statement. Hope for a deal was raised earlier in the week as Electronic Arts made a $1.9 billion bid for Take-Two Interactive, although the approach was reject
