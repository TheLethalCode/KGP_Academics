<TITLE> Historic Shanghai waterfront gets $1 bln makeover </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Shanghai, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shanghai's historic waterfront, once the Wall Street of Asia, is getting a 7 billion yuan ($985 million) makeover to divert automobile traffic underground and make itself more appealing for the city's 2010 World Expo. The plan includes an underground expressway, two tunnels across the Huangpu River to Shanghai's glitzy financial district, a facelift for the city's oldest steel bridge and dismantling an eyesore freeway ramp that cuts the waterfront, or Bund, in two, city officials said on Friday. "We want to return the view to the people," said Qin Kangde, director of the administrative office for Shanghai's Bund transport redevelopment project. "It has been reserved for the motorists." On Saturday, the city will shut the waterfront's century-old Waibaidu Bridge and begin dismantling it for transport by barge to dry docks for refurbishing. The dual-span truss bridge, which links the Bund to the Hangkou District, site of Shanghai's Jewish ghetto during World War Two, is due to be back in place above the Suzhou Creek, a tributary of the Huangpu, in a year. Qin said the 11-lane highway that runs in front of the Bund's stately colonial structures would be replaced with a four to six lane road limited to local traffic, while a new underground expressway would handle through-going vehicles. The three-year-plus project, most parts of which are already under way, should be complete in March or April of 2010, he said. Shanghai will host the World Expo from May to October 2010 and expects 70 million visitors to the event. While the Bund, whose elegant bars and restaurants are a big draw for tourists as well as well-heeled Shanghainese, remains a prominent Shanghai landmark, it increasingly finds itself in the shadow of the flashy, futuristic skyline of the Lujiazui financial district across the river. The project, moreover, is not just about beautifying the Bund, which is also one of the metropolis' main north-south transport corridors. Qin stressed that improved transport was the other key goal. The project's two tunnels are expected to ease chronic congestion in the existing underground link that runs under the Bund to the financial district. ($1=7.106 Yuan)
