 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Banks are cutting the cost to their customers of slipping into the red, amid a test case on whether overdraft charges are legal and fair. Rates for going beyond an agreed overdraft have fallen by more than five percentage points in the past year -- to an average 20.1 percent from 25.25 percent, according to financial comparison Web site MoneyExpert.com. Despite that, chief executive Sean Gardner warned that consumers are still being severely stung. "A 20 percent rate is still very high and well above the average standard credit card rate," he said. "Penalties are still severe for what might be just a one-off mistake." Nine providers -- including nationalised Northern Rock -- still charge 29 percent or higher for customers going into the red without permission. Others include Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Halifax, Citibank, Yorkshire and Clydesdale, while Ulster Bank is the worst with a rate of 30.5 percent. A total 52 of the 136 current accounts from 27 providers on the market charge more than 25 percent. High street banks and the consumer watchdog began court proceedings last July to resolve a dispute on the charges applied to unauthorised account overdrafts, after thousands of customers reclaimed millions of pounds in refunds, but banks continued to impose the charges. A preliminary hearing at the High Court, which started in January, will decide whether the charges, typically between 24 and 39 pounds for each transaction over and above an authorised overdraft, should be regarded as unfair under consumer contract regulation. The average charge for a bounced cheque or unpaid direct debit is currently 28.29 pounds, according to MoneyExpert.com, while the typical monthly penalty for going overdrawn beyond an agreed overdraft stands at 22.80 pounds. A total 41 out of 136 current accounts do not charge a monthly fee for going further into the red than agreed, and 65 also offer some form of interest-free overdraft. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) launched an investigation into bank charges last March after a customer backlash. It wants the High Court to establish a legal principle showing the charges are unfair. Eight leading banks and building societies have joined the test case, saying they and their customers want legal clarity. A preliminary court ruling is expected in April or May. If charges are deemed unfair the OFT is expected to suggest a charge that it considers more appropriate, which the court could consider and potentially rule on before the end of the year. Until the case is decided, the Financial Services Authority has said all customer claims for refunds are on hold. The court case comes after claims for refunds accelerated sharply early in 2007 amid high profile media coverage, Internet sites explaining the process and anecdotal evidence that banks had been repaying the charges in full. Tens of thousands of Britons have so far claimed back up to six years worth of penalty fe
