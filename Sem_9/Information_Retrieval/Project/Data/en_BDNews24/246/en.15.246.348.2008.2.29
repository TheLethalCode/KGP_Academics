<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 29 (bdnews24.com) School kids and citizens took to the streets in the capital Friday with message for cleanliness and greening drive aimed at giving the sprawling but dusty city a facelift. They carried banners that asked the Dhaka residents to get involved with the effort to free the city of the thick-as-soup pollution. They paraded through the streets in the city's Naya Paltan area and its neighbourhoods in the weekend to draw the people's attention. The Dhaka City Corporation Community Unit Working Group and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) sponsored the campaign. Ward commissioner Abdur Rab said their campaign was to involve people in the neighbourhood for the cause of cleanliness. "We want to sensitise the people about the matter so that they keep their own surroundings clean and don't litter on streets," he told bdnews24.com. Dhaka, a city of more than 10 million people, is increasingly becoming chaotic and rusty for living, experts and green campaigners say. They say people's understanding about the cleanliness is important while authorities need to improve solid waste management. JICA has recently partnered with the DCC for a clean Dhaka. bdnews24
