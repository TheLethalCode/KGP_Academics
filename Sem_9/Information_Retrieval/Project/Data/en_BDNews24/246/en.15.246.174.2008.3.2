 Baghdad, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday brushed off accusations by US President George W. Bush that Iran is supporting and financing Shi'ite militias in Iraq who kill American soldiers. "We tell Mr. Bush that accusing others without evidence will increase the problems in the region and will not solve them," Ahmadinejad said in translated remarks at a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. "The Americans have to understand the facts of the region. The Iraqi people do not like America."
