More than 550 Brotherhood members are currently held, according to the group. Security sources said the men were accused of belonging to a banned group and possessing anti-government literature.

The non-violent Muslim Brotherhood, which holds a fifth of the seats in the lower house of parliament through members elected as independents to circumvent a ban, seeks an Islamic state through democratic means and operates openly despite a decades-old ban. Egypt postponed local council elections for two years in 2006 after the Brotherhood performed better than expected in a 2005 parliamentary election. The local vote is now due to be held on April 8.
