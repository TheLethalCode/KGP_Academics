<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 29 (Reuters/Nielsen/bdnews24.com) - Soul singer Amy Winehouse will face no further action in connection with an investigation into obstruction of justice charges against her husband, British police said on Friday. The Grammy Award-winning singer had been released on bail after being detained for questioning last December and was due to return to a London police station in March pending further inquiries. But police on Friday said the 24-year-old performer was no longer required. A spokesman for Winehouse said she was "pleased to be discounted from the investigation, and she thanks the police for their professionalism in their dealings with her." Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, 25, is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at Snaresbrook Crown Court and was remanded in custody on Friday until April. Winehouse did not attend the hearing. She was absent because she was traveling to Paris to perform at a party for luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton.
