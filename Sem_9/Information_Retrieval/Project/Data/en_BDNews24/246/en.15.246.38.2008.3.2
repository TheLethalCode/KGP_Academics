 RIYADH, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US ally Saudi Arabia compared Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip to Nazi war crimes on Sunday and called on the international community to stop what it called the "mass killings" of Palestinians. Israeli forces killed 61 people in Hamas-ruled Gaza on Saturday, the bloodiest day for Palestinians since an uprising against Israeli occupation began in 2000. Almost half the dead were civilians, including children.

"Saudi Arabia watches with utmost concern what is happening in Gaza; the killing of children, women and elderly, the destruction of houses over their owners' heads, the intimidation at the hands of Israel's military machine," SPA said. "The kingdom strongly condemns these actions that go against international law and humanitarian norms ... and contradict what Israel says about its desire for peace." The UN Security Council on Sunday urged Israel and the Palestinians to cease all violence in Gaza after the secretary-general condemned Israel's "excessive" use of force. Saudi Arabia, a major Arab power broker which attended a U.S.-sponsored peace conference in Annapolis in November, renewed calls for a comprehensive Middle East peace de
