<TITLE> Philippine capital gears up for anti-Arroyo rally </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters started to gather in Manila's financial district on Friday calling for the resignation of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo over a kickbacks scandal. Organisers expect up to 40,000 to demonstrate but a light drizzle was falling, which could dissuade people from coming out. Security was tight with around 5,000 police deployed in the sprawling capital and soldiers on standby. Arroyo has survived three impeachment bids over allegations of corruption and vote fraud and at least three attempted coups. Analysts expect her to see off this latest scandal over alleged kickbacks in a government telecoms deal with China's ZTE Corp. "The political opposition have been relentless in trying to hunt down President Arroyo for some time. They have not had any success in reality but that won't stop them from doing it," said Mark Condon of risk consultancy Pacific Strategies & Assessments. "I would certainly expect the political noise to continue." Religious groups, students and some business groups have joined leftwing organisations to organise Friday's rally but many middle class Filipinos, key to two previous "people power" revolts, are fed up with political upheaval and will likely stay at home. Around 1 million people took to the streets to overthrow dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and up to half a million helped oust Joseph Estrada in 2001 in a military-backed revolt. Arroyo, although deeply unpopular, appears secure because of the public's cynicism as well as her careful courting of the military and the lower house of Congress, where she has a large majority. Earlier this week, the powerful Catholic Church stopped short of calling for her resignation, taking the wind out of the opposition's sails. Investors have largely shrugged off the political noise in Manila, helping the main stock index to finish up 0.55 percent on Friday in contrast to regional losses. The peso , which hit eight-year highs earlier this week, was quoted at 40.53 against the dollar, slightly weaker than Thursday's close at 40.
