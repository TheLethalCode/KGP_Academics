 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  SA Sultan, Bangladesh Football Federation's self-exiled president, Sunday apologised to reporters for his remark about journalists a few days ago. "I know journalists got hurt by my remarks and I apologise to all of you," Sultan told reporters at a press conference at the National Sports Council (NSC) conference room Sunday. On Dec 9 last, Sultan wrote to NSC Chairman General Moeen U Ahmed following a row over the then sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury that "It is not possible to manage the media without exchange." Later, journalists demanded apology from Sultan and boycotted him from the sports arena Claiming that he also came from a journalist's family, Sultan said, "I grew up in a journalist's family and I should not comment on this. But, mind that those remarks were really not made from my heart." Sultan went into self-exile following the row over the then sports adviser and there was a stalemate over formation of football associations at district and divisional levels in line with the FIFA guidelines. But, Sultan is getting active again after a green signal from the concerned authority and he is scheduled to meet AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam on March 6 in Kuala Lumpur. bdn
