 Chittagong, March 1 (bdnews24.com)  South African Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie set a new world record for a Test opening partnership on the morning of the second day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium Saturday. The South African pair broke the 52-year old record of 413 laid by Indian openers Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy against New Zealand in 1956. Soon after breaking the record, Smith was bowled by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, leaving the Proteas at 415 for one. The visiting South Africans resumed the day on 405 for no loss, just nine runs away from setting the new world record. Smith himself added nine runs today to his overnight 223 to finish 232 and saw the 52-year old Indian world record going to the Proteas. Smith hammered 33 fours and one six from 277 balls before being bowled by Razzak while trying to sweep the bowler. Overnight batsman McKenzie was on way to his first double century with 187, with Amal on 10 and South Africa 443/1 in 101 overs. bd
