 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com) The government announced the charges Wednesday for people going to South Korea for jobs under the employment permit system. Each person will have to pay a fee of US $788, or about Tk 54,000, to Bangladesh Overseas Employment Services Limited (BOESL), according to a government notice. The amount is inclusive of airfare, medical check-up, welfare fund, airport tax, clearance certificate, a US $30 charge for a Korean language test and BOESL's fee. The amount has been fixed on approval from the labour ministry of South Korea, the handout said. It further suggested that people do not attempt to deal with any other agency for employment in South Korea. South Korea's Human Resource Division (HRD) and BOESL most recently held a Korean language test on Feb 22 for those interested in working in South Korea. HRD prepared a list of candidates who passed the test, and will appoint people on demand from different companies in South Korean. bdn
