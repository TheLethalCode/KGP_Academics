 Moscow, March 1 (bdnews24.com/AP) -More than 109 million Russians are eligible to vote in Sunday's presidential election. The first of more than 96,000 polling stations across the country's 11 time zones will open at 3 p.m. EST Saturday, and the last will close at 1 p.m. EST Sunday. Early results are expected shortly after polls close; a complete official count may not be available until Monday. Turnout in the last presidential election, in 2004, was 64 percent. ___ WHO'S RUNNING Voters face a slate of four candidates, but First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev  who has been endorsed by the outgoing President Vladimir Putin  is expected to win an overwhelming victory; some predictions say he could get up to 70 percent of the vote. Communist Gennady Zyuganov, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and little-known politician Andrei Bogdanov also are running, but most see them as Kremlin-designed window-dresssing to give the vote the appearance of competition and fairness. ___ WHAT'S AT STAKE Putin, who is overwhelmingly popular after two consecutive terms in office, has indicated he will accept Medvedev's proposal to become prime minister after the election. That has raised questions about where the true center of power will be  in Medvedev's presidency or Putin's premiership. Medvedev has openly espoused support for Putin's domestic and foreign policies, although many of his recent speeches have given the impression of someone less harsh and more liberal-minded than Putin. In addition to dealing with an emboldened armed forces and increasingly aggressive security agencies, the new president faces the task of continuing reforms to the creaky, Soviet-era systems of education, health care and agriculture, among other things. bd
