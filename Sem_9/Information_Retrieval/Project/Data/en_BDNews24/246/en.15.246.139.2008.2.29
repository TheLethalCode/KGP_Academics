<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com) Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Friday called upon all to shun the desire of clinging to power taking a lesson from the pre-1/11 era. The CEC who was addressing a reunion organised by the Dhaka University History Department Alumni Association said the sociopolitical culture in the pre-emergency eradevoid of all patriotic norms but dominated by plunderers and hoodwinkers must be left behind to change the fate of the nation. "We don't want a repeat of what the nation suffered in the pre-emergency days. I'm an optimist. I'm not worried about our future," the CEC told the programme at the Dhaka University Teacher-Student Centre. "None did learn anything from history since the country earned its independence till January 11, 2007. All at the helm of affairs were engaged in looting, as there was no culture of accountability practised by the people who shaped the fate of people. That culture must change now." An MA student from the 1964 batch of the department, Huda said: "This department's aim should be shaping the future citizens of the country as worthy sons of the soil." Unwilling to talk about the polls on this auspicious occasion, Huda told bdnews24.com: "I don't want to speak on such issues today. I've always tried to attend the departmental alumni meet through the years. I'm genuinely happy to be among my old friends here." On the sceptics' views of the forthcoming elections, he firmly said: "The elections will be held at the appropriate time notwithstanding the varied opinions and doubts expressed by as many quarters." The session on reminiscences was inaugurated by House Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, who said: "Those who tried ruling this country trashing public opinion were all cast away as the rejects of history. No nation has so far attained any glory without taking lessons from its past." Feeling rejuvenated at the alumni meet, the Speaker reiterated, "I'm always ready to work to cement the relationship between the BNP factions whenever they are willing to sit together and talk and settle differences." Old students starting from the 1952 batch were represented by KM Fazlul Qader, Language Movement veteran Abdul Matin, Dr Akbar Ali Khan, Justice Tafazzal Islam, Dr Abdul Momin Chowdhury, Prof Muntasir Mamun and others. Matin said, "Famine is knocking at our door and the disaster may not be any less severe than the 1942 event. Death counts will be fewer if the government tackles the food scarcity efficiently." Threatened by the possibility of a comeback of the same old corrupt lot after the elections, Matin said: "We must be careful around the polls so that we do not get the old monsters back as the shapers of our fate. We must shun all communal practices." KM Fazlul Qader, a senior lawyer based in Netrokona, told bdnews24.com: "I relive my early days when I come to these reunions." Prof AH Ahmed Kamal, general secretary of the association, told bdnews24.com: "The department has played an important role in shaping the nation's history." The first departmental reunion took place in 1988, followed by subsequent events in 1990, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2007. bdnews24.com
