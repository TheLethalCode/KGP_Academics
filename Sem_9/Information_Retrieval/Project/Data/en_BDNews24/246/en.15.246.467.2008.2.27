 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com) Japan has assured Bangladesh of providing support to future nuclear energy projects in Bangladesh, the foreign ministry said Wednesday. "Japan will be happy to support clean energy projects including nuclear energy in Bangladesh," Taro Aso, chairman of the Japan-Bangladesh Parliamentary League, told foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury when they met him in Tokyo. "While there were some reservations in Japan about anything nuclear, now Japanese people are persuaded that the time for nuclear energy has come," said former Japanese foreign minister Taro. Earlier, the visiting foreign adviser had a meeting with president of Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) Akihiro Nishimura, and discussed the possibility of assistance for the construction of the planned Padma bridge in Bangladesh. "Support for the Padma bridge project would be very much in line with the Japanese philosophy to assist infrastructure development, and will hopefully be forthcoming," Iftekhar informed Bangladeshi media by e-mail. bdn
