 Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga signed an agreement on Thursday after talks on power-sharing to end a post-election crisis. Following are key facts about Kibaki: Kibaki was born on Nov. 15, 1931, in Othaya, near Mount Kenya, in the heartland of his Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's largest.
