 Juba, Sudan, March 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uganda's government and the rebel Lord's Resistance Movement (LRA) have signed the last in a series of documents before a final peace agreement to end one of Africa's longest-running conflicts, officials said. But only hours later the rebel delegation stormed out of a meeting held after the signing ceremony late on Friday in protest at Machar's insistence that a day should be set for a final peace deal. "You have finally signed the necessary agreements and protocols for the final agreement," chief mediator Riek Machar told the delegations after they signed texts that provided for the disarmament and demobilisation of the LRA.
