<TITLE> Israel kills three Palestinians in Gaza: medics </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Gaza, March 1 (bdnews24.comReuters) - Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two militants and a 17-year-old girl, during clashes in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Saturday, medical workers and the Islamist group said. A total of 37 Palestinians have been killed in four days of Israeli raids and air strikes in the coastal territory that the Jewish state launched after an Israeli civilian was killed in a Palestinian cross-border rocket attack on Wednesday. Most of the dead have been militants but some civilians, including children, have been killed. Witnesses said one clash erupted on Saturday when Palestinian gunmen spotted an Israeli force backed by helicopters that had entered the Gaza Strip. Hamas and medical workers said the gunmen belonged to the Islamist movement, which seized control of Gaza last June by routing the secular forces of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. A Hamas militant and the girl were killed. In another clash a gunman from the Islamic Jihad militant group was killed, medical workers said. The Israeli army said it was looking into reports of the clashes. Israeli leaders have said they may have no choice but to launch a broader offensive in the Gaza Strip if Palestinian militants do not stop rocket attacks on the Jewish state. On Thursday, Israel's Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai warned Gazans they risked a "shoah" if rocket fire did not end, but aides said he used the Hebrew word not in its common meaning of holocaust but only as a term for disaster. The strength of his language, however, reflected mounting anger after the killing of the Israeli civilian on Wednesday. The United States, whose Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due to visit Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Abbas next week, urged Israel to "consider the consequences" of its action. Abbas holds sway now only in the occupied West Bank. More bloodshed could derail Washington's hopes of a peace deal this year before President George W. Bush steps down. Abbas, who has shared Israel's hostility to Hamas since they defeated his forces in Gaza, called Israeli threats "dangerous". Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 after 38 years of occupation. Though rocket fire has long disrupted life in southern Israeli towns, the killing of the Israeli on Wednesday -- the first death of its kind since May -- has put pressure on Olmert to increase military action. Hamas has said the rocket attacks were a response to Israeli raids into Gaza and the West Bank.
