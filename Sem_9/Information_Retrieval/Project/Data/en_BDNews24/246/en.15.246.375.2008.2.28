 Hong Kong, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Thursday as worries about the sickly US economy were exacerbated by a falling dollar, which could prop up US firms at the expense of Asia's exporters. Prices for commodities from gold to oil remained near record highs on supply concerns and as investment funds looked for assets expected to out-perform in an environment of slowing growth and rising prices. US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signalled on Wednesday that he was ready to cut interest rates again to prevent further damage to the U.S. economy, despite rising inflation risks. Bernanke's comments, coupled with a sharp drop in durable goods orders and home sales, pushed the dollar to a record low against the euro on Wednesday. The euro also gained after European Central Bank Governing Council Member Axel Weber said expectations of rate cuts underplayed the risk of inflation. "The broad dollar weakness will continue, with the likelihood of the euro hitting more record highs because there are reasons to buy the single currency after the hawkish remarks from Weber," said a trader at a big Japanese bank. The euro remained at around $1.51 on Thursday, while the Australian dollar hit a 24-year high above $0.9450 and other Asian currencies including the South Korean won and China's yuan also firmed. The yen held below 106.5 to the dollar, denting exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, which both fell almost 3 percent. Japan's Nikkei average was down 1.5 percent by 0308 GMT, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was 0.4 percent lower. GLUM STOCKS With investors seeing the darker side of the picture, even healthy business investment figures in Australia served as a harbinger of another rate hike from the Reserve Bank next week, meaning higher interest costs and tougher U.S. sales. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX2 200 slipped 2.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8 percent, having risen 3.2 percent to 3-week highs on Wednesday, while Shanghai stocks dipped 1 percent. The return to gloom in equities, which had begun to bounce back after a miserable January, boosted fixed income assets such as Japanese bonds, which got an added fillip from weak Japanese industrial output data. March 10-year futures rose 0.61 points to 137.82 pulling further away from a two-month low of 136.89 struck on Tuesday. But the confidence in bonds was matched by a glum reading of the data for stocks, including the tech sector. "Output of electronic devices fell sharply, which is a worrying sign as strength in that sector drove overall output in the second half of last year," said Yoshiki Shinke, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. If February and March turn out as forecast, Japan's output in the first quarter of 2008 will fall 2.5 percent from the previous quarter, which would be the biggest quarterly drop since a 2.6 percent decline marked in the last quarter of 2001, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. COMMODITIES FIRM Japanese investors are focusing on how Atsushi Mizuno, regarded as one of the Bank of Japan's most hawkish board members, describes the economic outlook when he addresses business leaders and a news conference later on Thursday. The slump in the U.S. dollar has also helped lift prices for commodities and oil, which are dollar-denominated. U.S. crude oil ticked back towards $100 on Thursday. Oil and metals have also gained from supply worries. Shanghai zinc jumped by its 4 percent daily limit, rallying after fresh flows of commodity investments drove London futures up almost 8 percent on Wednesday. Gold loitered just below a record high of $964.70 an ounce that it notched up on Wednesday.
