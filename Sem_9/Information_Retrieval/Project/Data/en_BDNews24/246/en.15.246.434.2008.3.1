 Rome, March 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Non-governmental groups from Libya and Italy have signed an agreement to cooperate on ways to help migrants seeking a better life in Europe, a perennial issue in problem-plagued ties between Africa and the European Union (EU). Thousands of people cross the Mediterranean from Libya every year, often in overcrowded boats, hoping to reach the shores of the EU in Italy or Malta, and European governments are pressing Tripoli to stem the flow of migrants north from its shores. The Libyan International Organisation for Peace, Care and Relief (LIOPCR) and the Italian Council for Refugees (CIR) signed a memorandum of understanding in Rome on Friday. The agreement aims to improve the management of the migrant flow, the organisations said in separate statements. "The deal was forged within the framework of humanitarian interest in Libya and Italy to stem the flow of illegal migration and resolve the problem of refugees," said LIOPCR. LIOPCR is chaired by Khaled al Hamaidi, a son of Kouildi al Hamaidi, an adviser to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and works in partnership in Libya with the U.N. Refugee Agency, CIR said. More than 1,100 people, mainly Africans, have arrived on Italy's shores in the past week alone after perilous crossings of the Mediterranean from Libya, the United Nations refugee agency said on Friday. Some 1,855 would-be migrants landed by sea in Italy during February, compared to 345 in the same month in 2007, it said. A CIR statement said the Italian group would work together with UNHCR and LIOPCR in Libya to help refugees. The Libyan government said last month it had begun to deport illegal immigrants, a community of up to 2 million, mostly men from poor African states trying to reach Europe. They were welcomed to the oil-exporting desert country in the 1990s as a source of cheap labour but officials and locals now blame the migrants for taking jobs from unemployed Libyans.
