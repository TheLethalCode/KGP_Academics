<TITLE> Australia's Hogg quits international arena </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian all-rounder Brad Hogg joined the mass exodus of players quitting international cricket when he announced his retirement on Wednesday. The spinner said he was leaving the international arena after next week's tri-series finals against India but would consider playing in Australia's domestic first-class competition for another year. "I feel the time is right to call an end to my international career, I am extremely comfortable with my decision," Hogg said in a statement. "I wanted to bow out while I was still on top of my game and while I was not letting my team mates down in any way." The 37-year-old is among a large number of international players who have recently retired and the third Australian in the past month after Adam Gilchrist and Shaun Tait. Hogg, a leftarm spinner and handy lower-order batsmen, played seven tests and 121 one-day internationals for Australia and was a member of the sides that won the 2003 and 2007 World Cups. His test appearances were limited because of Shane Warne's stranglehold on the spinner's job but he was a regular and valuable member of the one-day team. A former postman, Hogg made his test debut for Australia against India in 1996 but waited more than seven years for his next test. He played his last test against India last month. "My career started against India and I thought if I can play test cricket against India that would be fantastic," he told a news conference in Melbourne. "I wanted to fight to get back in there and I did it and I achieved what I wanted to achieve." Australia have been hit by a series of retirements in the past 15 months with Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Gilchrist, Tait and now Hogg all quitting. His retirement also raises questions about Australia's spin options with Stuart MacGill still recovering from surgery and no obvious replacemen
