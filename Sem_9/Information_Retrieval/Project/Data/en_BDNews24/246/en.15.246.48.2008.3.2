 Dhaka, March 02 (bdnews24.com)Progressive Democratic Party convenor Ferdaus Ahmad Quarishi Sunday said elections if held under the state of emergency would ensure a fair outcome. "The elections must be held under the emergency rule to ensure that they are freely and fairly executed," Quarishi told a press conference in the party office. The PDP convenor also called for an immediate relaxation of the embargo on indoor politics across the country. Over 100 former Liberal Democratic Party leaders and workers, led by the party's former vice president Abul Kashem Chowdhury formally joined the PDP. Among the heavyweight defectors to have quit the LDP Wednesday in favour of the PDP were former Coastguard director general Shafique-Ur-Rahman and former assistant chief of naval staff AM A Alam. Quarishi said the former LDP leaders would help propel the party ahead. "No politics will be possible in the country without the PDP. We vow to continue our drive to root out corruption, terrorism and dynastic rule," he said. Quarishi also demanded an amendment to the 1973 University Ordinance, enhancement of government employees' dearness allowance and an introduction of food rationing. bdnew
