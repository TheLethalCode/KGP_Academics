 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Cattles Plc, which lends to lower-income consumers under its Welcome brand, said it was confident of raising more money to fund its 2008 lending as its results met market forecasts on Thursday. Cattles' CEO David Postings told Reuters the company has had strong expressions of support to raise up to 350 million pounds ($694 million) on the bond market to fund its 2008 needs. Cattles said it expected to maintain "highly attractive" net interest margins after its pretax profit rose 25 percent to 165.2 million pounds ($327.5 million) in the year to Dec. 31, 2007, in line with the consensus forecast from a Reuters poll. "We've got funds until the middle of this year, and maybe slightly more, but we need a bit more for 2008, and we're confident we can raise that money (on the bond market) and have had strong expressions of support," said Postings by phone. Cattles will soon go to the bond market to raise around 350 million pounds, Postings said, though it may raise that amount in two chunks, with the second coming in the Autumn. Cattles' shares were up 0.7 percent at 286p by 0848 GMT, valuing it around 1.04 billion pounds, while the UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.3 percent. Cattles also announced on Thursday it had increased its banking facility with Royal Bank of Scotland, announced in December, by 100 million pounds to 250 million pounds. "Funding looks secure with an extension of December's facility," said broker Landsbanki analyst Ian Poulter, who said the results were a little shy of his forecasts but in line with consensus estimates. There had been concerns about Cattles' funding, as the global credit crisis sparked by widespread defaults on U.S. mortgages made to "subprime", or less creditworthy, customers has made raising cash much more difficult. "Market conditions are favourable for Cattles. We intend to expand in a prudent way," said Postings. Analysts expect it to increase its market share because rivals such as credit card issuers MBNA and Capital One have drawn back from lending to subprime borrowers to reduce their exposure to risk. Postings said he did not consider Cattles a subprime lender. "It's an unfortunate moniker. We prefer to call our customers non-standard. They have average wages but are not wealthy. At the moment, our credit quality remains robust," he added. Cattles posted earnings per share (EPS) of 32.3p for 2007, compared with an average forecast of 32.5p, according to 12 analysts polled by Reuters. The company proposes a total dividend of 19.3 pence for the year, up 10 percent from a year earlier, versus a 19.5p forecast in the Reuters p
