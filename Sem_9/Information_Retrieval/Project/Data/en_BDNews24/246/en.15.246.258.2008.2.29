 DUBLIN, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Growth in lending to Ireland's private sector was the weakest in over four years in January, with the cooling property market knocking growth in loans to homebuyers to its lowest annual level in almost 14 years. Overall private sector credit growth slowed to an annual rate of 16.8 percent last month from 17.0 percent in December and was the weakest rate of expansion since September 2003, data from the Central Bank of Ireland showed on Friday. That was well below a peak of 30.3 percent hit in June 2006 when the central bank warned Ireland's then booming property market was fuelling unsustainably high rates of lending growth. Private sector credit rose 2.2 billion euros or 0.6 percent in the month, bringing the total outstanding level to 379 billion euros. The central bank said tighter credit standards on business loans appeared to account for the tiny increase. The central bank said that in the past such small monthly rises had been the result of banks securitising mortgages, thereby removing them from their balance sheets, but that had not been the case in January. A recent trend of large increases in lending to non-bank companies based in Ireland's International Financial Services Centre had also not been repeated in January with a decline in such lending of over 500 million euros, the bank said. "Irish credit institutions participating in the Euro Area Bank Lending Survey reported increased tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises, especially during the final quarter of 2007," the bank said in a statement. "This is now becoming evident in the data." Growth in residential mortgage lending slowed to an annual rate of 12.9 percent from 13.4 percent in December and was the weakest since March 1994 after last year's end to Ireland's decade-long property boom when house prices quadrupled. "While the net increase in adjusted residential mortgage lending is usually weak in January, the seasonal effect was very marked at the start of 2008," the bank said. "With a monthly increase of just 824 million euros, this was the most subdued start to the year since 2003. The monthly increase in outstanding residential mortgages has not been below 1 billion euros since January 2005." The month-on-month rise brought outstanding residential mortgage lending in Ireland to 140.7 billion euros. CREDIT CARD GROWTH HALVES The annual growth rate of non-mortgage credit was unchanged from December's 20.6 percent, however. The central bank said a sectoral breakdown of private sector credit up to the end of December had shown a continued decline in the rate of increase in lending to Ireland's real estate and construction sectors. "This is reflected in a small monthly increase in lending to non-financial corporates in January," the bank said. The annual increase in outstanding indebtedness on credit cards slowed to 8.9 percent from 9.3 percent in December and was less than half the rate seen in January 2007. "Outstanding indebtedness on credit cards fell in January, due to the relative weakness in new spending during the month," the bank said. Funds provided by the bank as part of the European Central Bank's monetary policy operations fell by 8.7 billion euros in January with all of the fall being accounted for by main refinancing operations, the bank said. Credit institutions in Ireland accounted for 222.8 billion euros of the euro area's broad money supply (M3), a monthly increase of 1.3 billion euros or 0.6 percent. The annual rate of increase slipped to 8.7 percent from 9.6 percent in Decemb
