<TITLE> Insurer Amlin posts record pretax profit in 2007 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK insurer Amlin made a record pretax profit of 445 million pounds ($882.2 million) in 2007, helped by low catastrophe claims, reserve releases and strong investment income. Its earnings were well above analyst expectations of 359.8 million pounds, according to Reuters Estimates, and showed a 30 percent increase on the 342.7 million pounds it made in 2006. Amlin shares reversed early gains of 2.6 percent to be down 1.4 percent at 292 pence by 0945 GMT, while the DJ Stoxx index of European insurers fell 0.7 percent. The stock has risen 16 percent in the past two weeks. "The results are pretty fantastic, it's another record year for them," said UBS analyst Jon Firkins. The company set a total dividend of 15p a share, above 2006's basic payout of 12p. The company has also returned 120 million in excess capital to shareholders. Amlin CEO Charles Philipps told Reuters in a telephone interview that the insurer's board had authorised managers to launch a share buyback. "The board has given us authority to proceed with a buyback if we think that is a sensible thing to do. We will be looking at that over the coming weeks," said Philipps. He declined to say how much cash the company had to spend on the buyback. "The indication of a further capital return is very encouraging," said Firkins. "They may take the opportunity to buy back some stock if they think it is cheap enough, but to commit themselves to a large capital return ahead of this year's hurricane season may not be the right thing to do. But I've argued for some time that there is significant surplus capital sitting in the business." Amlin may be holding back some excess capital to make an acquisition, such as a small insurer in the United States, Firkins said. 2008 OUTLOOK GOOD Amlin's 2007 results were helped by the release of 109 million pounds from reserves no longer need to pay claims and a 36 percent rise in investment income to 157 million pounds, while it emerged from the US hurricane season virtually unscathed by costly claims. "We would describe 2007's results as exceptional. They should not be expected to be repeated in the short-term. However we still believe we're capable of delivering good returns on equity in 2008 and going forward," said Philipps. Amlin's confident outlook for 2008 is underpinned by 474 million pounds in premiums written last year that will feed through into this year's earnings, Philipps said. "A lot of that would have been reinsurance and other business which has been written during 2007 at peak or near-peak rates," said Philipps. Although premium rates are coming down in its marine and non-marine businesses, Amlin expects to still make satisfactory margins there, while the UK commercial and global aviation units, which have been afflicted by intense competition, should start to improve, Philipps sa
