<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia has reviewed its policy for migrant workers allowing them to change their workplacea provision expected to hugely benefit Bangladeshi workers employed there, an adviser said Friday. Some half a million Bangladeshi workers are employed in Malaysian companies, and many of them complain of harassment by their employers. Other exploitations, including physical torture and deprivation of promised facilities, also abound. But they had not previously been allowed to change their workplace. Exhausted and frustrated, the workers often resort to street protests to demand their rights. The change in policy means from now on expatriate workers including Bangladeshi ones would be able to switch from one company to another, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters Friday. "Malaysian authorities have agreed for the first time to allow the transfer of workers from one company to another," said Iftekhar. The adviser said he came to know about the matter during his brief stopover in Kuala Lumpur on his way back home from Tokyo. Iftekhar, who also oversees the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment, met the Bangladesh High Commission officials in Kula Lumpur and inquired about the Bangladeshi workers. The adviser said the officials were working to ensure rights of the workers in Muslim-majority Malaysia, a lucrative destination for Bangladeshi workers, skilled or unskilled. He said a workers' welfare committee had been set up to assist the high commission to tackle labour-related issues. The adviser said a hostel to accommodate 800 to 1,000 people had been set up in Kula Lumpur to facilitate the expatriate workers. Bangladeshi annually earns some US$1 billion in remittance from Bangladeshi workers employed in Malaysia. bdn
