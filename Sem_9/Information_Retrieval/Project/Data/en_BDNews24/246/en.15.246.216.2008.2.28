 STOCKHOLM, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swedish and Norwegian security services detained six people on Thursday on suspicion of offences related to terrorism. Security services in the neighbouring countries gave few details on the cases, but Swedish news agency TT said the raids were coordinated.

In 2007, a cartoon by Lars Vilks of a dog with the head of the Prophet led to death threats against the Swedish artist. Two men were jailed in Sweden in 2005 for collecting money to fund attacks in Iraq. Three Swedish Muslims were also jailed in 2006 for fire-bombing an Iraqi election office and planning an attack on a church. In Norway, two men stand charged of plotting a terror attack against the US and Israeli embassies in Oslo in 2006. One of them, a Norway-born Pakistani, has also been charged with firing about a dozen shots with an automatic weapon into the wall of a synagogue in September 2006, which put the police on to the trail of the embassy pl
