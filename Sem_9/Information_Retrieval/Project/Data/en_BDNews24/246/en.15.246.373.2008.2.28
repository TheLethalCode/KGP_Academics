 YAOUNDE, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon's authorities appealed for dialogue on Thursday to defuse the worst anti-government riots in over a decade, but opposition leaders called President Paul Biya "out of touch" after 25 years in power. Officials estimate up to 20 people have been killed in five days of protests in several cities, including the main port of Douala and the capital Yaounde. Protesters have vented their rage over high fuel and food prices and a bid by Biya to prolong his presidential mandate in the central African oil producer. Yaounde and Douala, which were paralysed by rioting and looting on Wednesday, were tense but relatively calm on Thursday. Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, but most businesses were closed and public transport was not operating. A sombre-faced Biya, who is 75, appeared on state television late on Wednesday to accuse political opponents of fomenting the riots to try to topple him by force. He offered no concessions to protesters demanding falls in the cost of fuel and basic foods, beyond slight fuel price cuts agreed by the government on Tuesday. The government would use "all legal means" to guarantee the rule of law, Biya said. Communication Minister Jean Pierre Biyiti bi Essam followed up on Thursday with an appeal for dialogue. "Our beautiful country is at a crossroads, people are dying in our main cities and peace is in danger ... Let's call for dialogue and negotiations between people whenever there are differences," he told Reuters after meeting newspaper editors to urge them to contribute to the dialogue process. Biyiti bi Essam said it was difficult to give a precise death toll from the riots, in which stone-throwing protesters clashed with armed riot police and public buildings, businesses, shops and vehicles were set ablaze in a string of western towns. "The death toll is very high, but less than 20," the minister said. But he said not all the deaths occurred in clashes between security forces and protesters. Some resulted from the settling of personal scores and fights over loot. Far from pacifying citizens, Biya's broadcast appeared to have infuriated many protesters, including taxi drivers whose strike over high fuel prices on Monday triggered the wider unrest. Witnesses reported protests overnight in the western towns of Limbe and Bamenda and at least one person was killed. CLAMOUR FOR PRICE CUTS "This man is not serious. Is he taking us for fools?" said Sebastien Ebanga, a taxi driver in Yaounde. "The strike will continue," he added. John Fru Ndi, president of the main opposition Social Democratic Front party, denied Biya's charge that the opposition was behind the demonstrations. He said Biya ruled like an "absentee landlord, not always in touch with the people". "He does not know their problems," he added. Biya announced eight weeks ago he might change the constitution to stay in power when his term ends in 2011. Critics say he could use his party's majority in parliament to make the constitutional amendments. The riots followed similar protests against the high cost of living in other West African countries after soaring oil prices pushed up prices for energy products and basic foodstuf
