 SOFIA, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fire swept through two sleeping carriages on a Bulgarian train overnight, killing at least four people and injuring nine, officials said on Friday. The Transport Ministry said 62 people had been in the two coaches. The train was travelling from the capital Sofia to the northern town of Kardam.

Petkov said workers used five fire extinguishers but failed to put out the fire as it spread very rapidly. He defended the safety standards of the railway and said initial investigations showed the train workers had acted professionally. The carriages were produced "before the 1980s", but had passed all safety and operational checks, Petkov said. More than half of BDZ's passenger train carriages are over 20 years old. "We have not had such a grave incident with so many victims since 1992. For us, it is unexplainable how such a big fire could break out in such a short time," Petkov said.
