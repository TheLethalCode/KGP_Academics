<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)-Those accused in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case will be arrested if they try to flee or destroy evidence related to the case, ACC director general (admin) Hanif Iqbal said Thursday. "The accused will be arrested, if necessary, for the sake of investigation," he said. "However, the issue of arresting will depend on the investigation officer. No investigation officer has so far been appointed for the case. One will be appointed by the middle of the next week." Iqbal told reporters at a regular briefing that the commission had not yet discussed bringing the Barapukuria case under emergency powers rules, but they may include it under EPR after consulting lawyers, he added. The ACC filed a case with Shahbagh police on Feb 26 against 16 people including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 10 of her former cabinet ministers, on charges of corruption in appointing a contractor for the production, management and maintenance of Barapukuria coalmine. The accused in the case include: former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former local government minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, former industries minister Motiur Rahman Nizami, former health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, former home minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, former social welfare minister Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain and former chairman of Petrobangla SR Osmany. The ACC alleges that the accused through misuse of power conspired to embezzle a total of Tk 158.71 crore from government coffers. Of the accused, Khaleda Zia, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and AKM Mosharraf Hossain are now in jail. Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid have already appealed to the High Court seeking anticipatory bail. bdne
