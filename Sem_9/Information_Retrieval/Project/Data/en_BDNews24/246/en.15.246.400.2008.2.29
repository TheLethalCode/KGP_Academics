 Muktar Hossain bdnews24.com Correspondent Natore, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)The owner of an NGO went into hiding Friday after allegedly swindling thousands of people in four districts of Tk 48 crore. Ishak Ali deserted the head office of the NGO, Freedom Unnayan Sangstha, located in Narsatpur of Natore district. He and his associates took away all values from the office excluding 26 cows. A mob set the head office on fire and ransacked other branches. Police have been deployed in Narshatpur to avert further deterioration of law and order over the incident. The befooled people, who had deposited lakhs of taka for a fat and quick return of their investments, encircled the cowshed on hopes of recouping their financial losses through the sale of the cows. The deputy commissioner of Natore, SM Ehsan Kabir, told reporters that he did not have any prior report of any wrongdoing of the organisation. "No government agency had given me any prior report on cheating by the organisation," Kabir said. The Sangstha, which had 2500 branch offices in the districts of Natore, Rajshahi, Bogra and Joypurhat, collected at least Tk 3,200 from each of its members promising to impart training on spangling work (decorating clothing with spangles). Each branch office had, on an average, 60 members. Witnesses said that Ishak Ali had left the village at 9.00 pm Thursday on a motorcycle. The villagers could not understand that he was fleeing. Friday morning locals discovered that the computers and other valuables of the head office were missing and no staff member came to the office despite the beginning of working hours. As news of the desertion spread, thousands of NGO members from the four districts thronged Narsatpur to get their money back. District administration officials said Ali, from Comilla district, took registration for a voluntary NGO from the local office of the Social Welfare Department in Natore sadar upzila in December 2006. The NGO used to offer its members at least Tk 360 per week against their deposits. Thousands of people became members of the NGO and deposited money. "I sold all of my land and deposited Tk 1.6 lakh as the NGO gave me Tk 15,000 a week. I have received Tk 45,000 so far," said Jewel Hossain, a resident of Abdanpur village under Raninagar upzilla in Naogaon district. Jahura Begum of Chakbhabanipur and her nephew deposited Tk 1 lakh with the NGO eight weeks ago. We got eight weeks' salary, but the NGO had not imparted training on spangling," said. "My husband will kick me out of the family if I do not get the money back," Jahura said. "I will not leave the cowshed if I'm not given cows," said Jamela Begum, who deposited Tk 47,000 with the NGO. Hundreds of people are desperate to snatch cows from the manger, but they cannot do so as the police are guarding the whole area. The district administration did not take action against the NGO though a leading newspaper published reports on possible cheating by it. "The local journalists requested the district administration to shut the NGO. But it allowed the NGO to continue activities and induct more members for reasons best known to it," Mahfuzul Alam Muni, president of Natore Press Club, told bdnews24.com Friday. bdnews24
