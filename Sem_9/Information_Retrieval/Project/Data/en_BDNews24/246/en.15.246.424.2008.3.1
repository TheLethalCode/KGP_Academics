 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com) With all realistic hope fading of finding any more survivors from Thursday's launch disaster in the Buriganga, family members have been left with the grim task of waiting for their loved ones' bodies to be recovered. Joj Miah, who has been searching for his grandson Nurunnnabi for three days, told bdnews24.com Saturday that he was having great difficulty bearing the tragedy. "I do not feel able to simply sit here any longer. When I search for the body I feel a little better, otherwise I become dizzy," said Joj. Joj's son-in-law Habibur Rahman was also a victim as the Sourav-1 launch sank on the eastern side of the first Buriganga bridge at about 3 pm Thursday after being stuck from behind by a trawler. The launch was bound for Dhahuri in Munshiganj, carrying about 150 passengers at the time of the accident. The rescue operation was called off after 39 bodies had been retrieved from the capsized vessel and river. Local resident Habildar Nantu Miah said: "Eight people have come here in search of their relatives since the morning. But no one managed to recover a body." Amir Hossain spoke to bdnews24.com from a trawler near the accident spot after several hours on the river searching for his two nephews. "I am no longer expecting to see my nephews alive. I have come here simply to search for their bodies, but I have not found those either," Amir said. Amir's aunt, Anwara Begum, also died in the tragedy, although her body has been recovered. Amir's nephew Sajib was in class seven at Jinjira PM Pilot High School in Keraniganj while his other nephew Rajib was studying in class three at Jhakpara government primary school in Jinjira. bdnews24.c
