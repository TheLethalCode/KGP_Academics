 BEIJING, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua will meet with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) officials in Beijing this week, Chinese state radio said on Thursday, as energy-hungry China courts the oil-rich African nation. Yar'Adua arrived in Beijing on Wednesday with a large delegation of Nigerian officials, including Minister of State for Petroleum, Odein Ajumogobia, as part of a four-day state visit to boost ties. CNOOC, China's third-largest oil company, paid $2.7 billion for a stake in Nigeria's deepwater Akpo field in 2006 and expects first oil this year. President Hu Jintao welcomed Yar'Adua during a ceremony at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Thursday, pledging to boost strategic ties with Abuja. "I'm confident that your current visit to China will further our practical cooperation in various fields and take our strategic cooperation to a new level," Hu said. China, the world's second-largest energy user, has loaned billions of dollars to Africa's largest oil producer and has been rewarded with big-ticket infrastructure tenders to build hydroelectric plants, railways and oil refineries. But its imports of relatively expensive Nigerian crude remain marginal, and China's top oil giants Sinopec Group and Petrochina have not made significant investments, with sources citing security concerns. Last year, a number of Chinese workers were kidnapped in Nigeria last year, as militants and criminals seeking ransom intensified attacks on foreign workers in the Niger Delta, a vast wetlands region which has almost all of Nigeria's oil. Yar'Adua's visit is his first to China, and comes after a Nigerian tribunal on Tuesday threw out opposition candidates' complaints of fraud during the 2007 presidential election, which threatened to further destabilise the chaotic country of 140 million people. Analysts have said the ruling will strengthen Nigeria's political stability and help push reform, including Yar'Adua's pledge to overhaul the cumbersome and opaque state oil company, NN
