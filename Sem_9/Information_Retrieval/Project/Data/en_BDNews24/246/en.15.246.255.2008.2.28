 Ahmedabad, India Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A speeding train mowed down 15 people, including two children, at an unguarded railway crossing in the western Indian state of Gujarat, police said on Thursday. The victims, mostly labourers and their families, were crossing the tracks on Wednesday night when they failed to spot the rushing train. "We found bodies of 15 people, including two children and two women," a police officer said. Dozens die every year at India's estimated 18,000 unguarded railway crossings. India has one of the world's biggest rail networks. To reduce accidents, thousands of railway porters are being hired to guard crossings.
