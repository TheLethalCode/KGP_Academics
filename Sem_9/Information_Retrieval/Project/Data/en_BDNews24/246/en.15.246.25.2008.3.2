<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)Medical treatment, as permitted for Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, will be arranged for other VIP detainees, including Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, if necessary, a government spokesman said Sunday. "These are humanitarian and health service issues. Each case will be considered separately," the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a cabinet meeting at the CA's office. Meanwhile, the government Sunday night released Jalil on one-month parole for treatment abroad. Quoting the AL leader's family, DIG (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters that Jalil would be sent to Singapore. Munaim said the case of Hasina, a detained former prime minister, would definitely come under consideration as it had already done in the past. "Sheikh Hasina has been given treatment when she wanted and by the doctor she chose to visit her. If necessary more will be done," he said. The press secretary said the government was sympathetic on such humanitarian issues. "The government has considered the case of Abdul Jalil from a humanitarian angle." "There was no delay in taking decision," Munaim said. "This was a matter of due process. Abdul Jalil may now go for treatment anywhereat home or abroad." Replying to a question, he said Jalil's family would bear the cost of his treatment abroad. On the visit of former US ambassador Patricia Butenis, the CA's press secretary said: "I came to know from newspaper reports that she has come on a private visit." On the government's proposed dialogues with political parties, Munaim said the government was due to sit with parties after the electoral reform talks with the Election Commission ended. The government was making preparations accordingly, he added. bdnews24.com/ahd-e
