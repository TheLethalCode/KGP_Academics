"There is a clear distinction between terrorist rocket attacks that target civilians and action in self-defense," he said. "The United States remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and southern Israel," Johndroe added.

Israeli forces killed 61 people in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, the bloodiest day for Palestinians since an uprising against Israeli occupation began in 2000. Israel, which lost two soldiers, seemed ready to press home its fiercest air and ground assault since it pulled troops back to the borders of the coastal enclave in 2005.
