<TITLE> Bangladesh heading for innings defeat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh apparently walked off to an innings defeat against South Africa after being forced to follow on by the visitors on the third day of the second and final Test at Brishreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium Sunday. The hosts still require another 270 runs to avert the innings defeat with five wickets in hand as they were 54 for five at stumps on the third day, after being bundled out for 259 in the first innings, chasing South Africa's 583 for seven declared. Mushfiqur Rahim (4) and Shakib Al Hasan (0) will resume batting Monday with the hopes of avoiding the innings defeat, but with little hope. Bangladesh's second innings followed the same fate as the first, as the top-order once again collapsed in the face of superb spells from pacer Dale Steyn and left-arm spinner Robin Peterson, who made inroads into the Bangladesh batting line-up. Steyn removed Junaed Siddique (0), Mohammad Ashraful (4) and Shakib Al Hasan (4), while Peterson dismissed Tamim Iqbal (4) and Shahriar Nafees (31), to reduce the Tigers to 45 for five in 25.3 overs. Steyn, who took four for 66 in the first innings, returned three for four while Peterson took two for eight. Earlier, pacer Makhaya Ntini picked four quick scalps to clean up Bangladesh's tail and forced them to follow through midway of the day's third session. Makhaya Ntini, who remained wicketless in the Dhaka Test, dismissed Mushfiqur Rahim (15), Shakib Al Hasan (40), Mohammad Rafique (10) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (1) as Bangladesh slipped to 259/9 from 232/6 after Aftab Ahmed returned hurt. In the morning, left-arm spinner Robin Peterson broke the overnight fourth wicket partnership having Abdur Razzak caught by Ashwell Prince at point for 33, leaving the opponents at 118 for four. Afterwards, Nafees and Aftab showed enough nerve to go for lunch without further damage, but Nafees lost his concentration and threw his wicket away in the very fifth delivery after the lunch. He got a thick outside edge behind wicket off Dale Steyn, who Saturday ripped through Bangladesh's top order taking three wickets. The left-handed Nafees put on 69 runs with Razzak for the fourth wicket and added another 58 with Aftab for the fifth wicket before he finished 69 off 98 balls that included a dozen boundaries. Two balls later, Bangladesh got another jolt when Aftab retired hurt facing a short bounce from Jacques Kallis, leaving the side at 176 for five. Aftab missed the line and the ball went in the gap of the helmet and the visor to hit his cheek and had to be rushed to the Combined Military Hospital in Chittagong. "Aftab has got a cut beneath his right eye and inside the eye which has caused the bleeding and swelling. He will be kept at the hospital overnight for further observation. The X-ray and CT scan has revealed no fracture,'' said media manager Rabid Imam. After the departure of Nafees and Aftab, Shakib and Mushfiqur raised hopes a little of avoiding the follow-on, putting on 56 runs for the sixth wicket before Ntini came in his devastating spell that saw four Bangladesh batsmen fell inside 29 runs. Ntini, however, conceded 35 runs to take four wickets in 13.4 overs. Bangladesh resumed the day on 60 for three to add 199 runs in the first innings after South Africa declared at 583 for seven Saturday. bdnew
