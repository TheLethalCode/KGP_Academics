 MAKHACHKALA, Russia, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion injured two men in the southern Russian region of Dagestan on Sunday as Russians voted for a new president, local police said. The blast took place in the town of Khasavyurt, west of the regional capital Makhachkala. A member of the Khasavyurt police force said it was not linked to the election and had not taken place near polling booths. Police could not confirm reports of a second explosion. Kremlin critics have said the presidential election was slanted in favour of 42-year-old Dmitry Medvedev, who is backed by President Vladimir Putin, whose crushing of Chechen separatist rule helped build his popularity. Two wars in Chechnya since 1994 have scarred the entire north Caucasus region and violence has spilt over into the neighbouring regions of Dagestan and Ingushet
