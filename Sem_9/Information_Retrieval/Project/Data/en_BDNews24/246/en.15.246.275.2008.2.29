<TITLE> Advertisers will not shy from Beijing: WPP head </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Advertisers are unlikely to withdraw support for the Beijing Olympic Games despite recent criticism from human rights groups, the head of the world's second largest advertising group said on Friday. WPP chief executive Martin Sorrell told Reuters that Beijing would draw a larger advertising budget than any previous Olympics, and that his group was already running about seven campaigns for the Games. "I think most if not all of the sponsors have confirmed their commitment," he said. "I think most of them regret what has been happening but, no, there hasn't been any impact." "If anything, I think probably it strengthened the resolve of people to invest in the event." The question of China's human rights record rose up the agenda in mid-February when Hollywood director Steven Spielberg quit as artistic adviser to the 2008 Games over China's policy on the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region. Spielberg said China was not putting enough pressure on the Sudanese government to halt the bloodshed, which has driven some 2 million people into refugee camps. Eight Nobel Peace laureates have also written to Chinese President Hu Jintao urging him to change policy towards Sudan, where China has big oil investments. China says it is working for peace in Darfur. A campaign group called Dream For Darfur has said it will put pressure on Olympic sponsors to raise the issue with China. Twelve global Games partners have marketing rights to use the Olympic logo globally, including McDonald's Corp, Coca Cola Co and Visa. But hundreds of other sponsors and suppliers are also linked to the Games, hoping to benefit from the association. The Beijing Olympics and the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, in 2006 have already brought in about $4.4 billion in broadcasting rights and sponsorship deals. Contracts for the top partners programme are for at least four years, to include both editions of the Games.
