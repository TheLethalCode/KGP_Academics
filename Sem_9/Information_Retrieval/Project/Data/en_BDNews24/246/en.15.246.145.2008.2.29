<TITLE> Interpol issues urgent alert for escaped S'pore militant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Interpol has issued an urgent global security alert for an accused leader of an al Qaeda-linked militant network who escaped from detention in Singapore on Wednesday. The world police group posted an Orange Notice, or urgent worldwide security alert, on its Web site. Interpol said the alert was issued after a request from Singapore. The Orange Notice means the militant leader's photograph and fingerprints will be issued to each of Interpol's 186 national central bureaus. Singapore said a "security lapse" led to the escape of Mas Selamat bin Kastari from the toilet of a detention centre. Kastari is accused of being the leader of Jemaah Islamiah's Singapore cell and of planning an attack on the city-state's airport. The escape led to an apology from the government and a manhunt involving thousands of policemen in the city-state. The JI has been blamed for several deadly bombing attacks in Southeast Asia, including the 2002 bombings that killed more than 200 people on Indonesia's resort island of Bali.
