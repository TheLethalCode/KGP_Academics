 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government is proposing to offload shares in three road and rail entities under the communications ministry, an adviser said Thursday. "We have discussed offloading shares of Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority, Bangladesh Railway and Bangladesh Road Transportation Corporation," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters after a meeting at his office. The government has yet to announce the percentage of shares to be offered in the three entities, but the adviser said that a committee had been formed to submit a report to the finance ministry in a month to finalise the decision. Representatives of the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, Securities and Exchange Commission, Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh Bridge Authority (Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority) would be on the committee, Azizul said. However, he did not clarify from what level officials the officials would be picked. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Faruk Ahmed, told the meeting that offloading shares of BTRC, long facing losses, was not such a good idea. "As the organisation has been facing losses, its shares won't make any impact in the market," he said. The SEC boss asked the government to strengthen the BTRC's financial base to make it a profitable organisation. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader, communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman, acting secretary of the finance ministry Mohammad Tareque, Bangladesh Bridge Authority executive director Md Ibrahim were among those present. bdne
