<TEXT>
 MILAN, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Javier Zanetti scored two minutes from time to salvage a 1-1 home draw for Serie A leaders Inter Milan against second-placed AS Roma on Wednesday. Zanetti's strike from the edge of the area kept Inter nine points clear, taking them a step closer to retaining their title while maintaining their unbeaten record in the league this season. Roma, the last side to beat Inter in the league last April, took the lead through Francesco Totti in the first half but conceded after French defender Philippe Mexes was sent off six minutes from time for a second yellow card. Inter, without main strike duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Julio Cruz through injury, played the last 25 minutes with 10 men having already used their substitutes when Maxwell took a knock. Fiorentina moved above AC Milan into fourth after Papa Waigo Ndiaye's brave diving header gave them a 1-0 home win over Livorno. European champions Milan, without several first team regulars including Kaka, drew 1-1 at Catania with Alexandre Pato's long range effort being cancelled out by Gionatha Spinesi's header for the hosts. Third-placed Juventus, who drew 0-0 with Torino in the Turin derby on Tuesday, are four behind Roma and four above the Florence club. DEFENSIVE FORMATION Despite losing 4-1 at home to the champions in September, Roma scented blood in the top-of-the-table clash. Luciano Spalletti's side beat Inter 3-1 at San Siro in April before defeating their rivals in the Italian Cup final and the Super Cup. Stuttering Inter, who lost 2-0 at Liverpool in the Champions League last week, snatched a 1-1 draw at Sampdoria at the weekend and entered the clash with Hernan Crespo playing up front on his own in a defensive formation. The Argentina striker, who scored at Samp, had the first good opportunity when his acrobatic effort hit the post. Roma got in the first real blow on 38 minutes when Totti netted his 201st goal for the club and his first since mid January. The captain, overtaking Giacomo Losi to set a club record of 387 top-flight appearances, smashed in at the near post with one touch after beating former team mate Cristian Chivu to the ball. Roma midfielder Rodrigo Taddei was just wide with a chip in the second half but Inter gradually exerted more pressure despite ending up being a man down after Maxwell's injury. The visitors were also reduced to 10 when Mexes picked up two bookings in a minute, leaving Inter to besiege the goal. Crespo had a header well saved by Doni but it was a short reprieve as irrepressible Argentine Zanetti shot home to put Inter in sight of their third title in a row
