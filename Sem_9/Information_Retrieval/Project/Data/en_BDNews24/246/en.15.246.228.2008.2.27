<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Feb 27 (Reuters Life!/bdnews24.com) - Former "Baywatch" star and Playboy model Pamela Anderson is seeking to have her third marriage, to Rick Salomon, annulled on the grounds of fraud, according to court documents released on the Internet on Tuesday. Celebrity Web site TMZ.com published documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court and dated February 22 showing that Anderson was seeking an annulment. No further details were made for citing fraud as the reason for the split. Anderson, 40, and Salomon -- best known as Paris Hilton's partner in a 2003 sex tape -- married in Las Vegas on October 6 last year where she was performing alongside magician Hans Klok. They separated on December 13, according to the court documents. Anderson filed a claim for dissolution of the marriage in December, citing "irreconcilable differences," but later ended the divorce speculation with a posting on her Web site diary saying they were "working things out." It was the third marriage for both. The Canadian-born actress was married to rocker Tommy Lee for three years from 1995 to 1998; they had two sons together. She was also married to rocker Kid Rock for just over three months in 2006. Salomon, 40, was previously married to actresses Shannen Doherty and Elizabeth Daily, the voice of Babe the Pig, and Salomon dated Hilton, a hotel heiress, socialite and actress, in a relationship memorialized in a sex tape distributed on the Internet and later released as a porn video titled "1 Night in Paris."
