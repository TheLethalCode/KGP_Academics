 Atlanta, Mar 01 (bdnews214.com/Reuters) - US authorities will deport to New Zealand a man accused of killing his wife and abandoning his young daughter, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said on Friday. Nai Yin Xue was arrested near Atlanta in the town of Chamblee, Georgia, on Thursday after members of the local Chinese community recognized him from a picture in a Chinese newspaper and tied him up until police arrived. US Marshals held Xue in custody and the US Justice Department determined that he should be deported rather than undergo an extradition procedure because he had broken immigration laws, a spokeswoman for ICE said. "He had entered this country on a visa waiver pilot program that allows certain countries we have this agreement with to stay for 90 days and he had violated the agreement by overstaying," spokeswoman Pat Reilly said. "He will be escorted home by officials to New Zealand," Reilly said, adding that it could take up to a month before deportation takes place. Xue made headlines in September after security camera footage showed him abandoning his 3-year-old daughter, Qian Xun Xue, at a railway station in Melbourne, Australia, before boarding a flight to Los Angeles. She was dubbed "Pumpkin," after the brand of Pumpkin Patch clothing she was wearing. The body of Xue's wife, Anan Liu, 27, was found in his car outside the couple's home in Auckland four days after Xue left. The baby has since gone to live in China with her grandparents. Police on Thursday received a call from a man who said he recognized Xue as someone wanted for murder in New Zealand. When officers arrived in Chamblee, five Chinese men and a Chinese woman had restrained Xue by pulling his pants down and tying them in a knot around his ankles. They also cinched his hands together with his belt, police said.
