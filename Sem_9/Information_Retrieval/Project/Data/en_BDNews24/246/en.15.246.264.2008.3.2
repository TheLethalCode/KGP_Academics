<TITLE> Saudi advises nationals to leave Lebanon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, March 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has advised its citizens in Lebanon, especially families living there, to leave the country immediately due to the security situation, a Lebanese government source said. The source said the Lebanese government had confirmed the news with the Saudi embassy in Lebanon after several Saudi nationals said they received a text message with the advice. The United States said on Thursday it deployed the USS Cole off the Lebanese coast because it was concerned about the political deadlock in Lebanon. This provoked criticism from Hezbollah and Syria. Several Kuwaiti nationals said they also received messages telling them to leave the Mediterranean country immediately. The source said he had no official information about that. There was conflicting news on whether the Kuwaiti embassy had issued any warnings. Last month Saudi Arabia issued an advisory urging its citizens not to travel to Lebanon because of deteriorating political and security conditions. Kuwait and Bahrain followed with similar calls. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia is a major supporter of the Sunni-led government in Lebanon which has been locked in a 15-month-old political standoff with an opposition led by Iranian-and-Syrian backed Hezbollah. Tension in the region has also increased after the assassination of a Hezbollah commander in the Syrian capital Damascus last month. Hezbollah said Israel was behind the killing of Imad Moughniya
