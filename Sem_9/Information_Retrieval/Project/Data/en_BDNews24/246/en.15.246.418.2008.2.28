<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - U.S. aluminum company Alcoa has been accused of a 15-year conspiracy involving overcharging, fraud and bribery by a company controlled by the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain, according to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Aluminum Bahrain has alleged in a lawsuit filed in a U.S. Federal court, that Alcoa steered payments for an aluminum precursor ingredient to a group of companies abroad, in order pay kickbacks to a Bahrani government official. The firm also alleged that Alcoa had overcharged it for the precursor material, alumina. "The suit was filed very, late last night, so we have not had an opportunity to review the allegations," said Kevin Lowery a spokesman for Alcoa. "That said, we are not aware of any wrongdoing by any of our employees or by the company," he added.
