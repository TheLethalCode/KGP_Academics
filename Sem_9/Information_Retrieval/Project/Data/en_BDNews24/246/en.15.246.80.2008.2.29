 HONG KONG, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar dropped to a 3-year low against the yen on Friday amid renewed worries about the US economy, rattling stock markets, bolstering bonds and helping drive up prices of safe-haven gold and oil to all-time highs. Weak US economic data and a warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that some small US banks could fail raised expectations for more interest rate cuts in the world's leading economy and heightened fears of a recession. Asian stocks fell more than 1 percent and major European indexes were expected to open lower. The dollar plunged to 104.58 yen, its lowest since May 2005, after a slide in the US currency below the key 105 yen level triggered a wave of stop-loss orders. Crude oil hit $103 a barrel, breaking the inflation-adjusted high of $102.53 reached in 1980, fuelled by the weak dollar, a fire at a European gas terminal and problems with a pipeline in Ecuador. Gold hit a new high of $973.10 an ounce, up more than 16 percent this year and needing only another 3 percent spurt to hit the $1,000 mark. "Most of the funds are buying inflation hedges such as gold, silver and oil. It's still a bull market, where hedge funds and banks buy precious metals," said William Kwan, a dealer at Phillip Futures in Singapore. By 0600 GMT, U.S. light crude was quoted at $102.79 a barrel and spot gold stood at $972.90/3.70 an ounce. "I think inflation is really getting out of hand. I am looking at $955 for support and resistance at $985," for gold, said Kwan. BETTER LEFT UNSAID Asian stocks fell, with domestic conditions in Australia and Japan -- where inflation hit a 10-year high of 0.8 percent -- conspiring to make life tough on the home front as well as in the U.S. export market. MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan fell 1.3 percent, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei average closed down 2.3 percent. That followed a 0.9 percent fall in the Dow on Thursday. Wall Street's nerves, gauged by the CBOE Volatility Index, found their calmest moment of this year on Tuesday, but Bernanke's doom-laden testimony brought the jitters back. "Bernanke's remarks were something a central banker should never say," said a bond strategist at a US brokerage. "It shocked us and certainly worsened credit jitters in the market." US stocks were also dragged down by a large quarterly loss at American International Group Inc, the world's largest insurer, on write-downs of derivatives related to bad mortgage investments. Friday may bring more ill omens for recession-watchers, with eurozone inflation, US personal consumption figures, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and the final February reading on the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. Investors seeking shelter from tumbling stock markets snapped up US Treasuries and Japanese government debt, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to a 5-week low of 1.365 percent. "The huge losses at AIG along with Bernanke's warnings about small banks and remarks suggesting a US recession all point to yields falling further," said a trader at a Japanese trust ba
