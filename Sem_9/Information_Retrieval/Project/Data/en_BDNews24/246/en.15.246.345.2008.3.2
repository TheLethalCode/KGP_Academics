 YEREVAN, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States urged Armenia's warring political forces to start talking after a night of rioting in which eight people were killed and dozens more injured. President Robert Kocharyan imposed a state of emergency in the capital and ordered troops onto the streets after opposition demonstrators protesting at what they say was a rigged election hurled petrol bombs, looted stores and set vehicles ablaze. Troops lined the streets and a few armoured personnel carriers could be seen on Sunday, though there was no sign of fresh clashes. Opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who says he was cheated during last month's vote, remained under house arrest. In Washington, the State Department called on all sides "to avoid further violence, act fully within the law, exercise maximum restraint and resume political dialogue", according to a statement posted on its Web site www.state.gov. The United States is home to a sizeable Armenian community and is also concerned about disturbances in a region which is emerging as a key transit area for oil and gas supplies from the Caspian Sea to Western markets. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent an envoy to Yerevan on Sunday to meet the government over the unrest in the former Soviet republic and close Moscow ally. The state of emergency, effective until March 20, bans all protests and subjects news media to censorship. A police statement said the deaths were under investigation, adding: "We don't know if they were policemen or protesters." FIRE AND LOOTING Police fought pitched battles on Saturday night with opposition supporters who have held daily protests since Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan -- a close ally of the current president -- was elected the new president. Kocharyan accused demonstrators of firing weapons and grenades and planning a coup d'etat. The opposition rejected this, saying police had attacked a peaceful protest. U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch said police used excessive force at the demonstrations, detaining groups of protesters and beating them. "Armenian special police forces violently dispersed a rally ... Dozens are reported to have sustained severe injuries and more than 100 protesters were arrested," it said on Sunday. The crowd melted away in the early hours after a message was read out from Ter-Petrosyan urging his supporters to go home. The politician said he would negotiate with the government, reversing a previous stance that talks were out of the question unless the election result was overturned. About 60 protesters initially refused to go and set fire to police four-wheel drive vehicles abandoned after the clashes. By early morning, the army had taken over all the main state buildings in Yerevan. Protesters had burned cars, looted grocery stores and smashed windows in the main streets. "It's a nightmare. Look at what they've done to our city," 25-year-old student Emma Karapetyan said. "I hate both opposition leaders and our authorities." The violence was the worst in the impoverished mountainous country of 3.2 million since 1998, when a mass uprising forced Ter-Petrosyan to resign. Sarksyan's opponents accuse him of winning the presidential vote by ballot-rigging and intimidation. He denies this. Ter-Petrosyan's supporters say Kocharyan has run a corrupt state where only those with ties to the ruling elite have access to business opportunities and decent jobs. The government denies th
