 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com) Friends, relatives and admirers from across the political spectrum paid tribute to renowned journalist Bazlur Rahman Saturday at a memorial gathering at the National Press Club. Speakers at the memorial lauded the late Sangbad editor as a man who refused to compromise journalistic ethics or deviate from his principles. Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain said: "Bazlur Rahman was a bright star in the democratic, non-communal and progressive arena of Bangladesh." "In his professional life he built himself up to become an established editor. We would all reach our goals in life if we followed his example," he said. Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed said Bazlur had been not only a great journalist but a formidable force in politics. "He was committed to his ideals, which made him a great man," said the AL leader. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain described Bazlur as an easy-going, honest and patriotic man. "He proved that it is not only politicians that have a role to play in establishing democracy in a society," said Delwar. Communist Party of Bangladesh president Manzurul Ahsan Khan termed the late Sangbad editor an "ideal politician". "Many sold themselves, but he never took that path. We have to follow his ideal to save democracy and the country from the prevailing crisis," he said.
