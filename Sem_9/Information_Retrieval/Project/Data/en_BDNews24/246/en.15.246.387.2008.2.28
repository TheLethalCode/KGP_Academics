 ANKARA, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States called on Thursday for NATO ally Turkey to end its major ground offensive against Kurdish PKK rebels in northern Iraq as soon as possible, but Ankara said it would stay until the job was done. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Ankara that he had been given no timetable for a Turkish withdrawal. "The key is for us to make clear what our interests are, our concerns about the situation in Iraq," he said after meeting with Turkey's defence minister. Washington fears that a prolonged Turkish operation will undermine stability in the region, particularly Iraq. "It should be clear that military action alone will not end this terrorist threat," Gates added, saying Ankara must also take political and economic steps to isolate the PKK guerrillas and help support Turkey's large ethnic Kurdish minority. Turkey's Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said troops would remain in Iraq as long as necessary to accomplish their goal of ending the PKK threat from bordering northern Iraq. The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has used remote mountainous northern Iraq as their main base in their decades-long armed campaign for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey since the late 1990s. Gates was due to hold talks with military chief General Yasar Buyukanit and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan -- both under domestic pressure to crack down on the PKK after a series of deadly attacks on civilians and soldiers late last year. Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by warplanes and attack helicopters, crossed the border on Feb. 21 to root out PKK fighters and their numerous bases. It is Turkey's first major ground offensive against the PKK in northern Iraq in a decade. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began its armed struggle in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey in 1984. Turkey says an estimated 3,000 PKK members have used northern Iraq as a base to stage cross-border attacks against Turkish military and civilians. MORE TROOPS Senior military sources in southeast Turkey told Reuters several hundred Turkish soldiers were ferried across the border by helicopter into northern Iraq on Wednesday evening. A senior military source said around 10,000 troops were involved in the northern Iraqi operation, much centred around the Zap valley, a PKK stronghold. Several hundred special forces were leading the charge against rebel camps across an isolated part of northern Iraq, which is not under the control of the semi-autonomous northern Iraqi administration. The United States is providing significant intelligence to Turkey. If Ankara does not heed Washington's call to complete the operation quickly, Washington could curtail or cut off that intelligence flow. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek tried to placate mounting international concern about the cross-border offensive. "No one should be concerned. We will leave Iraq as soon as we are done. We are not intending to remain any longer than necessary in minus 26 degree temperatures," he told the English language daily Today's Zaman. "Turkish soldiers are fighting under harsh winter conditions there and we do not want them to stay there any longer than needed," Cicek said. Turkey's military General Staff has put the death toll among the PKK rebels at 230 since the ground campaign began. Twenty four soldiers have been killed so far, and more funerals were planned in Turkey for Thursday. PKK says that more than 100 Turkish troops had been killed. It has not given a figure for rebel casualties. Ankara says it is engaged in a legitimate fight against what it and Washington describe as a terrorist organisation. Acting Iraqi Prime Minister Barham Saleh said on Wednesday a prolonged Turkish operation would lead to dire consequences for the region and repeated Baghdad's demand that the incursion end. Erdogan's chief foreign policy adviser, Ahmet Davutoglu said after talks in Baghdad on Wednesday that his government had approached Baghdad several times for help to combat the PKK. He said Iraq was not capable of dealing with the rebels, given its preoccupation with security threats elsewhere in Ir
