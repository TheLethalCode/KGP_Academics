 LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - GCap Media, Britain's biggest commercial radio group, has turned down an improved 333 million pound ($660 million) bid proposal from privately owned Global Radio, saying it is still too low. GCap, which runs London's Capital and Xfm radio stations, said on Friday the proposal of 202 pence a share, up just over 6 percent on the previous one of 190 pence a share, did not take into account the expected benefits from the strategy outlined earlier this month by new Chief Executive Fru Hazlitt. Hazlitt unveiled a plan to pull back from digital radio and focus on GCap's five key brands, which also include Choice, Classic and the One Network of local stations, in a bid to boost profits. "This revised proposal significantly undervalues the company because it does not reflect the value that would be created by implementing the strategy of the new chief executive," GCap said. Global Radio is headed by Charles Allen, the former chairman of broadcaster ITV. GCap also said it was trading in line with its expectations, with like-for-like revenues forecast to be up 4 percent in February, including a 7 percent rise in like-for-like radio advertising. GCap shares, which have leapt over 50 percent in value since the bid approach from Global Radio, closed at 191.25 pence on Thursd
