 MELBOURNE, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adam Gilchrist produced a scintillating 83 off 50 balls before a batting collapse by Australia gave Sri Lanka a consolation 13-run victory in their triangular series one-day international on Friday. Gilchrist smashed 11 boundaries and two sixes in his final innings at the Melbourne Cricket Ground until the collapse derailed his team's pursuit of Sri Lanka's 221 all out. Australia lost five wickets for eight runs to slump to 115 for five and were eventually bowled out for 208, despite 37 from Brett Lee that pushed them to within sight of victory. Ishara Amerasinghe led the Sri Lankan bowlers with three for 44. Australia had already qualified for the best of three finals starting on Sunday against India and apart from Gilchrist, Brad Hogg and Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya and Muttiah Muralitharan, all of whom were playing their last matches at the ground, there was little riding on the match for either side. Gilchrist, Hogg and Jayasuriya have announced their retirements from international cricket, while Muralitharan has said he is on his last tour of Australia. Gilchrist appeared determined to go out in style, and was within sight of Matthew Hayden's Australian record of the fastest one-day century (66 balls) when a superb diving catch by Lasith Malinga deep in the outfield ended his innings. Gilchrist received a standing ovation from the 22,524 strong crowd as he departed and it appeared he had set his side well on the path to victory with the score 113 for two in the 16th over. He had contributed 74 of Australia's first 102 runs and combined with James Hopes (28) for an opening partnership of 107. Hopes was dismissed in strange circumstances, with third official Bruce Oxenford needing several television replays to determine whether he had been bowled by Muralitharan after it took several seconds for the bail to dislodge. Gilchrist's dismissal, however, sparked the collapse with Michael Clarke (0), Ricky Ponting (1) and Andrew Symonds (0), all falling within the space of two runs before Brad Haddin (7) was trapped lbw eight runs later. When Mike Hussey was bowled by Chamara Kapugedera for five to leave Australia at 142 for seven, their run chase was all but over despite Lee and Nathan Bracken (14 not out) combining for a last-wicket partnership of 35 before Lee was bowled off Sanath Jayasuriya's first, and only, ball of the innings. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene (50) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (62) had provided the backbone of their innings, after they had crawled to 61-4 in the 20th over, while Chamara Silva chipped in with 35. Bracken, who conceded just nine runs from his first eight overs, finished with 4-29 off 10 over
