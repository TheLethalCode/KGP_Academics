 KATHMANDU, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of jubilant Nepalis living in the southern plains danced and marched in victory parades on Friday, a day after reaching a deal with the government for more autonomy and ending weeks of violent protests. Traffic was back on roads and markets buzzed in the region after the end of a regional strike that choked supplies to Kathmandu for a fortnight and threatened to derail a national election.

Armed groups are fighting a low-intensity insurgency in the region, and may prove harder to satisfy. But for now, many Madheshis are celebrating. "Long live Madhesh. This is our victory," chanted revellers, their faced smeared with red vermillion powder. "People have removed roadblocks of logs, burnt tyres and boulders," said Dev Kumar Yadav, a resident in Siraha, a focus of ethnic Madheshi protests. "They are now celebrating."

Implementation of the deal will be an "important contribution to the election of an inclusive constituent assembly in a conducive climate", said Ian Martin, chief of the United Nations Mission in Nep
