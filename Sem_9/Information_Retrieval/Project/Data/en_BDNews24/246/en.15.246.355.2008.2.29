 LONDON, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Birds nested early, spring flowers bloomed before time and ice cream vans reported an unexpected rise in sales as England and Wales enjoyed the sunniest February since records began. The Met Office confirmed on Friday that there were 106.1 hours of sun over the last four weeks, beating the previous record of 94.4 hours set in 1970.
