<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 02 (bdnews24.com)  The Asian Development Bank's Dhaka mission chief said Sunday the economy had recovered from the losses left by twin floods and a devastating cyclone. Hua Du, the country director of the Manila-based agency, also forecast bright economic performance in the days to come. "(About) 50 percent of Bangladesh economy has recovered. I think the economy will go up further," Hua Du said in a meeting with the members of the Overseas Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (OCAB) at the National Press Club. She appreciated the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts after the Nov15 cyclone. The ADB chief said Bangladesh had a capability to become a middle-income country with per capita income of $1,000 in 2015-20 if stable investment policies were adopted. Currently, the country's per capita income is $470. "If Bangladesh remains stable, ensures availability of energy and electricity, develops infrastructure and sets up connectivity, the economy has a very good future," she said. On poor implementation of the annual development programme, Hua Du said there was a sluggish trend in the implementation of the ADP over the years. "We have the second half in hand. I hope it will increase in the second half (January to June)," she said. Hua Du said instability did not necessarily mean that a "civil war" was going on here but it meant inconsistency of policies too. Policies should not be changed from time to time, she said, adding: "Investors will not invest if there is no stability in policy." Stressing greater connectivity of all regional countries, ADB's Dhaka chief said the proposed Dhaka-Kolkata passenger rail link was an "extreme encouragement" for regional cooperation. She said the government should partially reduce subsidies to various sectors, including energy and fuel. She said fixing a priority for subsidies was important. "The revenue collections in Bangladesh were 10.6 percent, lowest among the countries of the region. The government needs to see which sectors need subsidy," she said. "Subsidy should not go to the wrong groups." bdnews
