 Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com) Detained former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina are expected to sign up for the electoral roll Friday in makeshift prisons on the parliament building premises, a prisons official said. Deputy inspector general (prisons) major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said that the Election Commission officials would register their names. Sheikh Hasina likes to be a voter as a resident of Dhanmondi while Khaleda Zia wants to use her cantonment home as her address, Siddiqui said. "They will get the chance as they wish," he said. The country's law allows prisoners to cast their votes through postal ballots. Meanwhile, an EC official said they would complete the preparation of the electoral roll in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area Friday. Biswas Lutfar Rahman, assistant election commissioner for Dhaka division, said they got some 34.23 lakh voters in the metropolis until Tuesday. If the commission would extend the timeline for citizens left out of the voter registration, the official said: "The commission will look into it." He said many registration centres have been kept open for last 10 days for the people left out of the process, but it did not attract any big turnover. He said the people not yet registered would be able to list their name during a 15-day timeframe before publishing the draft voter list. bdnews
