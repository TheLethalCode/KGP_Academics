Ehsanul Haq (3/12) and Jarar Kuraisi (3/28) shared six wickets as three-time champions Victoria handed a convincing 89-run defeat to Kalabagan Sporting Club at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishan (BSKP) ground-2.

In reply, two-time champions DOHS were all out 209 with a ball to spare as Muktar Ali ran through the top order dismissing four for 35.
