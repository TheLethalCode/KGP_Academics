<TITLE> Roll up! Roll up! for London`s used newspaper house </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Karen Janody was so annoyed by the mounds of free newspapers blowing around the streets of London she decided to build a house with them to illustrate the degree of waste. Janody and her Creative City colleagues Gillian McIver and artist Sumer Erek will build the skeleton of the Newspaper House in East London and call for people to bring along their used rolled up used newspapers to build the house itself. Construction will take place from March 3 until March 8 when the skeleton will be removed leaving the edifice to stand on its own. The following day it will be dismantled and sent for recycling. With a contribution of 15,000 pounds ($29,730) from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the Newspaper House in Gillett Square Hackney will be the first of several in cities around Britain artistically highlighting the mounting problem of waste. "I am confident the project will be a big hit with the public and hope it will be able to tour the UK, involving the public and making a contribution to environmental awareness in a truly adventurous way," said Gulbenkian director Andrew Barnett. "We all need to do our bit for the environment and this gives us an opportunity to do so in a way that's close to home."
