 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India all-rounder Tanmay Srivastava has been reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after being found guilty of breaching its Code of Conduct during the Under-19 World Cup. The incident occurred in the semi-final against New Zealand in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday when Srivastava was reported by the umpires for pointing batsman Corey Anderson towards the pavilion in an "aggressive manner" after clean bowling him. Srivastava pleaded guilty to the charge and was given an official reprimand by match referee Chris Broad. "I understand that in the heat of the moment young players can get excited, especially when they have just dismissed the opposition's highest scorer," Broad said in an ICC statement. "But it is important for them to realise that gesturing a batsman towards the pavilion in this fashion is disrespectful and is contrary to the spirit of the game." On Tuesday, India's cricket chiefs told senior players to keep their cool during the tri-series finals against Australia after a series of disputes between the two teams. In the latest incident, Ishant Sharma was fined 15 per cent of his match fee for celebrating the wicket of Andrew Symonds by pointing him towards the pavilion
