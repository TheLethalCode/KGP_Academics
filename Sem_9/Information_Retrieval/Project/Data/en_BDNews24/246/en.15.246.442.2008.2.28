<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Egyptian bourse rebounded on Thursday as Arab investors bought shares in housing and real estate firms led by Medinet Nasr Housing, brokers said. "Arabs were the only net buyers early in the session then we saw strong buying from foreigners also," said Mohamed Kotb, Investment Manager at Jazira Asset Management. Arab and foreign investors accounted for more than 30 percent of market buying on Thursday while local investors were net sellers. Medinet Nasr, among the most heavily traded stocks, surged 10.2 percent to last trade at 69 Egyptian pounds ($12.57), while Talaat Moustafa rose 0.5 percent to 12.10 pounds. Shares in Heliopolis Housing were 0.8 percent higher at 578.01 pounds. "The sector has witnessed a correction lately so prices became attractive again," said Mohamed Kotb, Investment Manager at Jazira Asset Management. Investment bank EFG-Hermes rose 1.4 percent to 64.25 pounds to recoup some of Wednesday's losses. The firm said on Wednesday it posted a net profit rise of 82.5 percent to 1.28 billion pounds in 2007, slightly above analysts' forecasts, but its declining global depositary receipts in London pulled it down more than four percent. Regional telecom giant Orascom Telecom was also in the green, rising 0.9 percent to last trade at 83.61 pounds. Overall, the benchmark CASE 30 index climbed 0.9 percent to 11,335.21 points, while the well-watched Hermes index was also up 0.9 percent to 99,080.76 points. The broader CIBC index was up at the same rate to 479.81 points. But Orascom Construction Industries, was in the red, as its GDRs in London fell 0.4 percent by 1334 GMT. The firm's shares last traded in Cairo 0.3 percent lower at 664 pounds per share. ($1 = 5.49 Egyptian pounds) (Reporting by Wael Gam
