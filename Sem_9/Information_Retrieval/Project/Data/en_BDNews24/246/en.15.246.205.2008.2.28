<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday, led by insurer Axa and drug and chemical group Bayer, as mixed company results unnerved investors already fretting about the US economy. At 0941 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,347.94 points. Axa and Bayer fell more than 2.5 percent after updates that disappointed investors, while mining group Xstrata slid 4.5 percent as a source close to the situation said Vale's bid for the group had run into trouble. Royal Bank of Scotland, Britain's second-biggest bank which last year led a takeover of ABN AMRO, fell initially but then rose 1.2 percent after posting in-line earnings and raising its dividend. But other banks were largely lower, with UBS, ING and BNP Paribas down 1.6 to 2.4 percent. Brewer InBev rose 8 percent to top European winners after its results, and British American Tobacco tacked on 2.4 percent. "The corporate earnings season has been very mixed, with consumer stocks under pressure and financials doing better than expected other than those close to the housing market," said Andrew Bell, strategist at Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management. "European equities are vulnerable to a slowdown in the (United) States spreading to Europe, exacerbated by the euro's strength, and on a currency-adjusted basis, they don't look massively attractive," he said. The euro held near a record high near the dollar at $1.5097, while oil shed 0.4 percent, hitting stock in BP, Total and Shell by 0.6-0.9 percent. SMALL GAIN With one full trading session left, the FTSEurofirst 300 is on track to eke out a 2 percent gain this month, similar to gains in February 2007 but a big improvement on a 12-percent fall last month. Equities have been boosted by a series of measures including two Fed rate cuts amounting to 125 basis points, a bailout for monoline bond insurers and, most recently, the lifting for investment caps for the two largest US home financing groups. Bell said that markets could well head lower. "This year we had a sharp fall in the first three-quarters of January, then a bounce, which seems to have stopped. All this reflects the fact that people are uncertain whether they should react to the prospect of a better tomorrow or a stinky today." Across Europe, Britain's FTSE lost 0.7 percent, Germany's DAX and France's CAC both fell 0.8 percent. Pubs group Whitbread was the top British gainer with a 6 percent rise, prompted by a rise in sales and a savings plan involving merging its hotels and pub restauran
