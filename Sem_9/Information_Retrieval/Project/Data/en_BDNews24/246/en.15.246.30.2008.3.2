 Chittagong, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  Pacer Makhaya Ntini struck four quick scalps to force Bangladesh to follow on against South Africa on the third day of the second and final Test at Birshrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium Sunday. Makhaya Ntini, who remained wicket less in the Dhaka Test, dismissed Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Mohammad Rafique and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza in a row and Bangladesh collapsed to 259/9 from 232/6 after Aftab Ahmed returned hurt. Bangladesh will bat in the second innings trailing by 324 runs after South Africa declared their first innings at 583 for seven. Mushfiqur, Shakib, Rafique and Mashrafee threw their wickets away despite having a fine foundation laid by Shahriar Nafees, Abdur Razzak and Aftab Ahmed. Nafees's departure in the fifth ball after the lunch triggered the collapse as Aftab (21 off 45) was hurt in the very next over while trying to pull a short bounce of Jacques Kallis. Aftab missed the line and the ball went in the gap of the helmet and the visor to hit his cheek and had to be rushed to the Combined Military Hospital in Chittagong. Then, Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim stuck to the middle contributing 56 runs for the sixth wicket before Mushfique (15 off 56 balls) edged Ntini to keeper Boucher, who also took Shakib off an Ntini delivery for 40 off 75 balls. Mohammad Rafique (10) was a bit unlucky as his top edge went to the Smith's hands at the first slip after slipping the Boucher's glove off an Ntini delivery after Mahsrafee (1) was the fourth victim of Ntini. After the departure of overnight Abdur Razzak, Shahriar Nafees and Aftab Ahmed showed enough nerve to go for lunch without further damage. After resuming on 168 for four at lunch, Nafees lost his concentration and threw his wicket away in the very fifth delivery while he got a thick outside edge behind the wicket off Dale Steyn, who Saturday ripped through Bangladesh's top order taking three wickets. Two balls later, Bangladesh took another blow with Aftab Ahmed retiring hurt by a Jacques Kallis delivery, leaving the side at 176 for five. Earlier, left-arm spinner Robin Peterson broke the overnight fourth wicket partnership having Abdur Razzak caught by Ashwell Prince at point for 33, leaving the opponents at 118 for four. Nafees finally finished 69 after striking his fourth Test 50 pushing Morne Morkel to fine leg for a single before smashing Morkel for two fours in the same. The left-handed opener clubbed 12 fours from 98 balls, first fifty after six innings in three Tests. Nafees and Razzak put on 69 runs for the fourth wicket after Bangladesh were reduced to 49 for three inside 13 overs on the first day Saturday. Bangladesh having resumed the day on 60 for three added 199 runs after South Africa declared the first innings at 583 for seven Saturday. bdnews
