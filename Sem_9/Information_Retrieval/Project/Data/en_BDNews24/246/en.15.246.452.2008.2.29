<TITLE> Thaksin's return likely to rile polarised Thailand </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thaksin Shinawatra's carefully choreographed return from post-coup exile and his pledge to retire from politics have imposed a veneer of calm on the three-year struggle for control of Thailand's future. But beneath the calls for "unity" and "national reconciliation", tensions between the forces vying to steer a country being wrenched from semi-agrarian feudalism to 21st century market economy are as fierce as ever. Thaksin's opponents in the military and royalist establishment may be on the ropes after the ousted prime minister's supporters won a December election and his triumphant return from exile on Thursday -- but they are far from down and out. His every move will be subject to intense scrutiny. Signs of exacting revenge could trigger a rebirth of open political conflict in the form of the 2005 street protests that led ultimately to the September 2006 coup that ousted him. Already, the People's Alliance for Democracy, which led the Bangkok protest marches, has warned the billionaire former telecoms tycoon not to use political clout to sway corruption cases against him and his wife. "If we find they are trying to intervene in the judicial process directly or indirectly, we will not sit idly by," spokesman Suriyasai Katasila said. However, the ecstasy and adulation from the thousands who greeted Thaksin at Bangkok's glitzy new airport are unlikely to inspire moderation and restraint in a politician not noted for hubris or modesty. "It is critical for them not to overplay this upper hand in order for Thailand to have reconciliation and some unified road down the line," said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "Otherwise we are going to see more tension, confrontation, brinkmanship, conflict that could lead to outright unrest." PURGE STARTED? Signs of a purge by Thaksin supporters are emerging already. Three senior bureaucrats who worked with the interim post-coup government lost their jobs last week, and on Friday National Police Chief Sereepisut Taemeeyavej -- appointed shortly after the putsch -- was given his marching orders. Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the army chief who led the coup, has gone into virtual hiding on a military base, newspapers reported, and his successor has struck a very conciliatory, neutral tone towards Thaksin. Progress of the graft and abuse of power cases against Thaksin, who has had nearly $2 billion of assets frozen, will be a key measure, given that the generals who ousted him cited "rampant corruption" as a prime reason for their action. The case against his wife has already started. Thaksin's will open at the Supreme Court on March 12. Too swift a push for reversal of the five-year political ban imposed on Thaksin and 110 top members of his disbanded Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party could also spark anger from his opponents, whose support is rooted in Bangkok's middle and upper classes. Muddying the picture yet further are threats from the Thaksin camp to flood the capital with thousands of farmers -- the core of Thaksin's political support -- if electoral officials are not keen to give him or his political proxies fair treatment. That said, some analysts believe most Thais are bored with a political saga that has deprived the economy of any sort of helmsman, resulting in some of the most sluggish growth in the region. "The country is tired of politics. Everybody, including the military, the business community and politicians from both sides would like to see Thailand go forward," CLSA analyst Harry Bunyaraksh wrote in a research no
