 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com) - The health condition of detained Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil is unstable, a doctor treating him at LabAid Cardiac Hospital said Saturday. "His condition is critical. He suffered mild heart failure on Friday night as his kidneys were not functioning," Dr Motiur Rahman, chief cardiologist of the hospital, told bdnews24.com. "His condition improved a little after receiving an injection. But it may deteriorate anytime. Any speculation is difficult since his overall condition is so critical," he said. When asked to comment further on Jail's "mild heart failure", the doctor said: "His heart cannot take any pressure." "If his kidneys do not start functioning properly his condition will deteriorate." "He is also suffering from pulmonary oedema that causes blood to gather in the lungs." Dr Motiur heads a six-member medical board that includes cardiology specialist Prof Boren Chakraborty, kidney specialists Prof Rafiqul Islam, Prof Anisul Haque and Prof Abdus Samad, and orthopaedic specialist Dr Gouranga Boiragi. On whether the medical board would recommend sending Jalil abroad Dr Motiur said: "The condition of his kidneys is very serious. Under the circumstances he needs kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation." "Jalil's family wants kidney transplantation. In that case, we would recommend sending him abroad as transplantation is not a regular practice in this country," he said. He said Jalil had been suffering from various other complications. "But I think there would be no big risk if he undergoes kidney transplantation in a specialised hospital abroad," he said. Senior prisons officials visited the AL leader at the hospital Saturday and said Jalil's condition was not good. Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Zakir Hassan said they would do everything for Jalil's proper healthcare. "We will do everything for him in line with the board's suggestions," he said after seeing Jalil in the morning. But it was not made clear if the government would send him abroad. Deputy inspector general of prisons Maj Shamsul Haider Siddiqui accompanied the IG to the hospital. Jalil was arrested on May 28 last year. He was admitted to LabAid Cardiac Hospital on July 15 after falling ill in jail. He underwent bypass surgery and a pacemaker has been installed in his heart. The Awami League has long been demanding treatment abroad for the detained general secretary, but authorities have not entertained the demand to date. bdnews24.
