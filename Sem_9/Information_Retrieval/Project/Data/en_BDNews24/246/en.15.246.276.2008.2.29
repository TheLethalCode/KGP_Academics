 ASHGABAT, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior US official on Friday urged Turkmenistan to find alternative routes to Russia for its natural gas exports and called the rival Nabucco project a viable option for Central Asia's largest gas producer. Turkmenistan exports most of its gas through Russian gas monopoly Gazprom, which then resells it to Europe at higher prices. But the West wants it to diversify exports away from Russia, Turkmenistan's former Soviet overlord. "We believe it is highly desirable for Turkmenistan to have alternative export possibilities, and Nabucco might be one of those," said Steven Mann, the Eurasian Energy Diplomacy Coordinator at the US Department of State. "Nabucco is progressing very well," he told Reuters on a visit to the Turkmen capital, Ashgabat. The West has been courting Turkmenistan since President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, seen as a reformist, came to power following the 2006 death of absolutist leader Saparmurat Niyazov. Russian President Vladimir Putin this week called Nabucco a waste of money and said it was losing to a competing South Stream project backed by Russia. South Stream, supported by Italy's ENI, aims to link Gazprom's Siberian gas fields to Western Europe. "There is a big difference between private sector pipelines and pipelines that are the subject of declarations," Mann said, commenting on Putin's statement. "Serious international companies don't work on the basis of declarations." Mann said Europe would prefer a pipeline not controlled by Gazprom. "Right now Gazprom dominates imports from the East and many Europeans have told us that they would to like to see more competition, not less competition," he said. BOOSTING OUTPUT Before joining Nabucco, Turkmenistan needs to increase its gas output, Mann said. "Turkmenistan has not had an effective development of reserves during the period of independence," he said. Turkmenistan has not revealed the results of an independent reserves audit made under Niyazov. Some analysts have questioned Turkmenistan's ability to supply gas into several pipelines. Berdymukhamedov last year ordered a fresh audit which is yet to be carried out. "President Berdymukhamedov is doing something extremely wise in terms of auditing the current gas reserves and the next important step for Turkmenistan is to bring in major international firms as investors," he said. "I think the president has repeatedly underscored to me his desire to bring new, major investment into the Turkmen energy sector and it is going to be a continuing proces
