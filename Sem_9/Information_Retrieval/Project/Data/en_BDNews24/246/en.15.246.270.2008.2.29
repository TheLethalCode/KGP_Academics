<TITLE> Manila's Estrada in new role in politics of scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Manila, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Joseph Estrada, the Philippines' movie star former president and a convicted plunderer, has taken on the role of moral champion as a corruption scandal rattles the president who replaced him. Estrada, ousted from office in 2001 by members of the middle class, Catholic Church and military aghast at allegations of widespread graft, has seized upon a brewing government kickbacks scandal to lecture Filipinos in interviews and rallies about the "arrogance of corruption". "We have suffered through scandal after scandal, scam after scam," said the 70-year-old, wearing his trademark shades as the sun went down over a recent university rally in Manila. "The Philippines has been branded as the number 2 most corrupt nation in the world and number 1 most corrupt country in Southeast Asia. When we go out of the country, it is a bit of a disgrace to admit that we are a Filipino." Despite being found guilty last year of diverting funds amounting to about 4 billion pesos ($99 million), Estrada remains wildly popular among voters, particularly the poor of Manila, who enjoy his wisecracks and down-to-earth manner and identify him with the Robin Hood style movie heroes he used to play. His calls against corruption have barely raised eyebrows in the Philippines, where many view graft as one of the perks of politics. Estrada has however maintained he is innocent of the charges for which he was convicted. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who faces renewed calls for her resignation over allegations of kickbacks in a government telecoms deal with a Chinese firm, pardoned Estrada around a month after his conviction in a move viewed as an olive branch to the opposition. But Estrada, better known by his nickname "Erap", has become a thorn in the side of Arroyo, his former vice-president. He has seized on the kickbacks scandal to call for her to go and is a major draw at anti-government rallies where he charms the crowd with gags. His wristbands still bear the presidential seal. "The convicted and pardoned former president is merely jumping on what he thinks is the right bandwagon, at the time he thinks it should be jumped on," the Manila Standard newspaper said in a comment this week. Although renowned as a playboy president who was alleged to have made policy decisions after late night drinking bouts with his "midnight cabinet", Estrada is relishing his role as a proponent of virtue. Arroyo pardoned him after he signalled he was not interested in running for office again but hopefuls in the 2010 presidential election will look for his endorsement and two of his sons are politicians.
