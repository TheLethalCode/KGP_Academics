<TITLE> Interpol will help Bangladesh bring in suspects from India: Noble </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)Interpol will help Bangladesh bring in crime suspects from India and other countries if the nation has extradition treaties with those countries, the agency's secretary general Ronald K Noble said Saturday. Noble added that his agency could provide Bangladesh with a list of criminals and their personal details, including addresses, passport numbers and fingerprints. Bangladesh is a member of the 52-strong agency. Speaking to reporters in a news briefing at Sonargaon Hotel after arriving in Dhaka on his maiden visit to Bangladesh, the Interpol chief said they had a list of 12,000 suspected criminals across the world. Asked if there is any Bangladeshi in the list, Noble said he had no idea about that. Noble avoided a direct answer to a query if local Islamic militants had links to global militant groups such as al Qaeda. Asked to comment on the Aug 21-grenade attack on an Awami League rally, the Interpol chief said he was not meant to comment on any national issue. Noble said it was the duty of a particular country to investigate and punish perpetrators for a crime that takes place in its boundary. If an Interpol member country needs any information for criminal suspects, the agency extends its cooperation, he said. On the Aug 21 attack, additional inspector general of police administration Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura said Bangladesh did not seek any help from Interpol in the case. "This organisation does not investigate any particular case. It just helps by providing information," he said. Noble later visited the headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Department to inaugurate a criminal investigation information unit. He later visited the Bangladesh Police Headquarters and held a meeting with senior officials. bdnews24.com/
