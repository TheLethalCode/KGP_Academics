<TITLE> No local polls while democracy held hostage: Suranjit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 1(bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengputa said Saturday that the national polls must be held prior to any local elections. "There can be no local elections while democracy and parliament are kept hostage. The people will not be benefitted if that happens," he said. The AL leader made his comments at a discussion on local government issues organised by the Governance Coalition at the CIRDAP auditorium in the city. The AL presidium member said the results of any local elections would have to be approved by parliament. "What will happen if parliament does not approve the local election results?" Suranjit asked. Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon also criticised the move to hold local body elections prior to the national polls. "There is a political motive behind holding the local elections before the national polls. All such governments want to hold local elections during their tenure," said Menon. The Workers Party chief said that if the logic behind holding the city corporation elections was that their tenure had expired, then parliamentary polls should be held first as its tenure had expired first. BNP vice-chairman MK Anwar said the EC was taking too long to register voters and prepare national ID cards. He added that, in reality, institutions such as the Election Commission had not undergone any reforms. "The EC secretariat is still in effect under the chief adviser's office. They do not have any financial independence," the BNP vice-chairman said. AL presidium member Suranjit also called for immediate dialogue between political parties and the caretaker administration. Such dialogue, he said, did not have to wait for talks with the EC to be completed. bdnews
