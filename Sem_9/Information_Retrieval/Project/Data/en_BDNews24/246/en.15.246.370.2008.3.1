 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com) South Africa will go head to head with India in the ICC U/19 World Cup final after outplaying title holders Pakistan by 98 runs (D/L) in the rain-interrupted second semi-final at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur Saturday. The final will be played on Sunday at the same venue. Two-times champions Pakistan was bundled out of the tournament for 153 in 39.3 overs on the reserve day Saturday. They were chasing a revised target of 252 in 47 overs, after Pakistan ended Friday with 86 for two in 18.5 overs following a rain interrupted play. On the resumption of play, Pakistan lost overnight Umar Amin (22). Medium fast bowler Roy Adams then removed Ali Asad (5), and overnight opener Ahmed Shehzad (60) to reduce Pakistan to 124 for five in 28.5 overs. The defending champions then dramatically lost their last five wickets for just 29 runs to collapse at 154 all out. Off-spinner Yasen Vallie dismissed the four tail-end Pakistani batsmen in style for just 25 runs in 8.3 overs. Put in to bat first on Friday, South Africa posted a challenging total of 260 for eight in 50 overs, riding on three fifties from Trevor Smuts (55), Riley Rossouw (53) and Jonathan Vandiar (50). Reeza Hedrick chipped in with a blazing 27 off 17 that included four fours. Imad Wasim grabbed three for 44 while Ahmed Shehzad and Adil Raza took two wickets each for 35 and 58 respectively. bd
