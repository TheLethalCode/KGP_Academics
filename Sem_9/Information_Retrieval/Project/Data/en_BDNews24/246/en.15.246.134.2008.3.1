<TEXT>
 London, March 1 (bdnews24.com/bbc) - A Vincent van Gogh work, painted weeks before he killed himself, is going on the market for the first time in more than 90 years, valued at $30m (15m). L'Enfant a l'Orange - or The Child With An Orange - will go on sale next month at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The painting was created in 1890, a month before Van Gogh shot himself at the age of 37. The joyful portrait contrasts with his other angst-ridden paintings. The Child With An Orange was one of several works Van Gogh painted after spending time with his baby nephew and godson, named Vincent after the artist. Van Gogh's happiness at seeing his young nephew sparked an explosion of artistic energy in the last few weeks of his life. The subject of the portrait is of two-year-old Raoul Levert, the son of a carpenter in the French village of Auvers, 25 miles north of Paris, where the artist spent some time before he died. New York and London-based dealers Dickinson are organising next month's sale. In November, Van Gogh's last ever work failed to sell at a New York auction. The Wheat Fields did not reach its undisclosed reserve or attract a bid over $25m (11.9m) at the time of sale. bd
