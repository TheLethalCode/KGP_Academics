 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British housebuilder Redrow Plc reported a 35-percent fall in six-month pretax profit on Thursday and warned of weaker margins and fewer sales than expected, and said it sees market conditions becoming tougher. Redrow said profit before tax fell to 35.8 million pounds ($71 million) in the six months to end-December, as turnover fell to 353.1 million pounds from 387.7 million and legal completion decreased by 4.7 percent to 2,111. "Visitor levels have increased in the new year but the markets in which we are operating are clearly challenging," it said in a statement. "Our overall expectation remains that 2008 will present a more difficult trading environment than the industry has experienced for many years with lower levels of confidence in the housing market."

"I'm cautious in that regard and I'm also cautious in the sense that second-hand home market data is pretty cautious." Redrow said presold homes fell 10 percent to 1,694 units, as tightening in mortgage availability kept prospective buyers at bay. It warned that legal completion in the current financial year would be 3 percent lower than its previous forecast and would show a 10 percent annual fall as a result of more challenging housing market conditions. Fitzsimmons said activity levels since its Jan. 10 trading update had weakened further, with sales down 35 percent from a year ago versus 25 percent fall seen in early January. Gross margins from home sales are also set to weaken as net sellling prices after incentives come under pressure due to the competitive sales market condition, although operating margins would stay flat in the second half on it continued to cut costs. Shares in Redrow eased 0.1 percent to 302 pence by 0900 GMT. "The poor results are unlikely to improve in the second half although improving visitor levels may offer some comfort to the management... The company needs to address key strategic issues of land structure and product positioning," a Landsbanki analyst sa
