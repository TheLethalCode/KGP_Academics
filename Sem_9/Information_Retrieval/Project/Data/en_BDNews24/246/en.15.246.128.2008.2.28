 BRUSSELS, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union governments raised a string of objections on Thursday to the bloc's flagship plan on fighting climate change, promising tough negotiations on carbon dioxide emission curbs and the use of renewable energy. At an initial debate among energy ministers, most of the EU's 27 member states said the blueprint for moving to a low-carbon economy, as presented last month by the European Commission, was a good starting point for talks. But many raised questions over specific measures, such as overhauling the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme or national targets for the share of energy produced from renewable sources. The Commission's proposals aim to implement targets set by EU leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels, increase the share of renewables in power production to 20 percent and boost the share of biofuels used in transport to 10 percent by the same date. "The Commission's proposal provides a good starting point for our debate ... But it is essential that cost-efficiency is at the heart of our discussions," said Shriti Vedera, Britain's secretary of state for business and competitiveness. Marco Stradiotto, an Italian secretary of state for energy, said: "Energy efficiency was not given enough room in the Commission's proposal. He added there was a risk some industries would move out of the EU as a result of the scheme unless an agreement with major world powers was reached on curbing emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. APRIL 2009 TARGET EU governments hope to clinch a final deal on the package by April 2009 in negotiations with the European Parliament, but the debate on Thursday showed talks would be tough. Officials made few concrete demands at this stage, but the Czech Republic and Poland criticised plans that would force power plants to buy 100 percent of their emissions permits from 2013, when the overhauled Emissions Trading Scheme takes effect. "Because of our energy mix ... we would like the scheme to be phased in gradually," said Czech Industry Minister Martin Riman, adding that otherwise "our electricity prices could rise by several dozen of percent". He said his country's target for renewable energy use, 13 percent, would be very difficult to achieve. Similar doubts were voiced by Sweden and Greece. Finland said it would not achieve its renewable energy target if imports of lumber from Russia ended as a result, for example, of high duties. Some countries said provisions to ensure that biofuels are produced without harming the environment should be sharpened. Polish Economy Minister Waldemar Pawlak proposed creating pan-EU rules for subsidising plants from which biofuels are produced. "Nobody is entirely happy with our proposals, but this is a good sign, a sign that our proposal is a good basis for a compromise," said a senior Commission offici
