 Dhaka, March 02 (bdnews24.com) - Former Awami League members of parliament are demanding immediate release of party president Sheikh Hasina and general secretary Abdul Jalil for treatment overseas. "If our leader Sheikh Hasina and Abdul Jalil are not provided with proper treatment we will assume that they are deliberately being pushed towards death," Abdul Hamid, former deputy leader of the opposition in parliament, said at a press conference Sunday. "Denying them treatment amounts to murder," Hamid said, speaking to reporters at his NAM residence "on behalf of former AL members of the seventh and eighth Jatiya Sangsad". Hamid mentioned that charges have not yet been pressed against Jalil. "If an accident occurs in custody, it will be considered murder. The government will be responsible for this. The nation will not accept this as an ordinary occurrence." "Using the jail code as an excuse, authorities are ignoring doctors' recommendations to send Sheikh Hasina abroad for treatment," Hamid continued. "She is not even being provided with proper treatment at a local hospital," he added. "Denying someone in custody treatment and pushing them slowly towards death is inhuman and unjust. The country's laws allow a detained person to receive treatment abroad on parole." Asked about AL's possible course of action if their demands are not met, he said: "It is under consideration. We will come to a decision after extensive discussion within the party." bdnews2
