 MINSK, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belarus's most prominent detainee said on Thursday he would return to prison after attending his wife's funeral and had abandoned a hunger strike. Alexander Kozulin, described by the West as a political prisoner, was given three days' compassionate leave for the funeral after interventions by the United States and European Union. Both have called for his definitive release. Kozulin was jailed for 5-1/2 years for helping stage rallies denouncing the 2006 re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, who is accused in the West of rights abuses. "I will be returning to prison on my own, without any convoys or people accompanying me, so that I can arrive there at 8 p.m.," Kozulin told a news conference.

Kozulin began a hunger strike pending a decision to let him attend the funeral of his wife Irina, who died of cancer. He had vowed to resume the strike once back in prison. In 2006, he refused food for 53 days to draw attention to human rights violations in Belarus. Hundreds of mourners, many linked to Belarus's opposition, packed into a Minsk church on Wednesday to pay their last respects to Irina Kozulina. Authorities had offered to allow Kozulin to travel to Germany to have his wife treated, but the couple refused on the grounds that this amounted to going into exile. "It was proposed that I be taken straight from prison to the airport and put on a plane to Germany. This was tantamount to deportation," he said. "I was told I could not come back for at least six months." Western countries accuse Lukashenko of crushing fundamental freedoms, and the EU and United States have barred him entry over allegations he rigged his 2006 re-election to a third term. Lukashenko, who remains broadly popular, says his stand on dissent and generous benefits have shielded Belarus's 10 million people from the upheavals of other ex-Soviet states. But since quarrelling with traditional ally Russia over energy prices last year, he has sought better ties with the West, particularly the European Union. Several opposition activists have been freed in recent months. Kozulin was arrested on the last of four days of mass rallies denouncing the president's re-election after urging protesters to march to a prison where activists were being held. He is one of two detainees considered "political prisoners" in the West along with businessman Andrei Kim, detained in connection with protests in January by small entrepreneu
