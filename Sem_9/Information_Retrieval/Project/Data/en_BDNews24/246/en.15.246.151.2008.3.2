<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar scored a masterly century to lead India to a comfortable six-wicket win over Australia in the first tri-series final on Sunday. Tendulkar batted through the Indian innings to post an unbeaten 117 off 120 deliveries as the tourists cruised past Australia's 239 for eight with 25 balls to spare at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Rohit Sharma provided valuable support to Tendulkar with an impressive 66 in their fourth wicket partnership of 123 as the Indians drew first blood in the best-of-three finals series. "The first blow is always extremely important," Tendulkar told a news conference. "But we can't get too far ahead of ourselves. It's really important we carry this momentum forward." The Australians were always in trouble after they had to settle for a modest total following a top-order batting collapse. Opener Matthew Hayden top-scored with 82 and Mike Hussey kept the tail wagging with a watchful 45 but the world champions failed to impose themselves on the Indian bowlers. "We pride ourselves on the way we prepare and play in finals so I expected a better performance than this," skipper Ricky Ponting said. Spinner Harbhajan Singh was a unanimous winner in the latest round of his feud with the Australians when he captured two wickets, dismissing Andrew Symonds for 31 then denying Hayden the chance of a century. Hayden and Symonds, both embroiled in recent disputes with Harbhajan, had steadied the innings with a fourth-wicket partnership of 100 when the combative Indian dismissed them. Symonds, who accused of Harbhajan of racially abusing him during the Sydney test, holed out to Praveen Kumar in the deep when he tried to smash him out of the ground. Then Hayden, reprimanded on Friday after describing Harbhajan as an "obnoxious weed" and challenging Ishant Sharma to a fight, swept straight to all-rounder Piyush Chawla. Harbhajan, who described Hayden as one of the most disliked cricketers in the international game, then cheekily taunted the Australians by shadow boxing with his team mate Yuvraj. "They were probably the defining moments in the game," Ponting said. "They had put together a nice partnership and if they had continued on a bit longer I'm sure we would have got around 270." BRIGHT START India made a bright start to their run-chase when Tendulkar and Robin Uthappa put on 50 for the opening wicket before the Australians broke through. Hussey held a spectacular low running catch at deep square to dismiss Uthappa for 17 then James Hopes ran out Gautam Gambhir with a direct throw at the non-striker's end for three. Australia briefly threatened to stage a comeback when Hogg bowled Yuvraj for 10 to reduce the visitors to 87 for three before Tendulkar and Sharma steered their team to safety. Tendulkar survived a difficult dropped catch off Hogg on 88 then a full toss from Lee that struck him on the shoulder to reach his 42nd one-day international but his first in Australia. "To score a hundred in Australia was something I always wanted and this was a terrific occassion to do it," Tendulkar said. The second match will be played at Brisbane on Tuesday with the third scheduled for Adelaide on Friday if the teams are level
