<TITLE> Hafizuddin sees solution to BNP stalemate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  BNP reformist faction leader Hafizuddin Ahmed said Thursday he foresaw a solution to the stalemate the party was now facing, if M Saifur Rahman and Khandaker Delwar Hossain sat together. "Our unity will be realised easily if Saifur Rahman and Khandaker Delwar sit together to discuss issues," Hafizuddin told reporters at his Banani home. "The misunderstanding will be resolved through discussions," he said. Hafizuddin, who departed from the Khaleda-nominated faction, said the party would go to polls only under the leadership of Khaleda. Khandaker Delwar leads the 'Khaleda loyalists' as the party's secretary general. Hafizuddin said they would not sit with the Election Commission without Khandaker Delwar even if the commission previously invited their faction to the electoral reforms dialogue. "As soon as we receive a fresh invitation from the EC, we'll go for dialogue taking Khandaker Delwar with us," he said. The commission concluded its second spell of dialogues with political parties Thursday, but BNP missed out on both rounds because of a High Court order. A planned dialogue with the EC remained stalled since the matter of invitation has been pending with the High Court. Since both factions claim they are mainstream, the EC is in a dilemma over which faction to invite to discuss electoral reform. Hafizuddin welcomed recent moves by opposing faction leader ASM Hannan Shah to unite the party. "Our chief (Khaleda) has asked all to stay united. We'll do everything for that," Hafizuddin said. bd
