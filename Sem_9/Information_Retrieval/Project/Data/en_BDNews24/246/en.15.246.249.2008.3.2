 SYDNEY, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India spinner Harbhajan Singh won the latest round of his feud with Australia's cricketers when he captured the vital wickets of Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds in Sunday's first tri-series final. The combative Harbhajan dismissed Symonds for 31 and denied Hayden the chance of a century when he removed him for 82 as India's bowlers restricted Australia to 239 for eight at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia's lower-order kept the runs ticking along to give the bowlers a respectable total to defend after an early collapse but India were still in a strong position to take the early honours in the best-of-three series. Australia made a slow start after Adam Gilchrist's final appearance in Sydney ended prematurely when he departed for seven, mistiming a short delivery from Praveen Kumar to Yuvraj Singh at mid-on. Kumar bagged a second wicket in his opening spell when Australia captain Ricky Ponting played on for one and Ishant Sharma dismissed Michael Clarke for four, caught by wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Replays suggested the batsmen had missed the ball. RECENT DISPUTES Hayden and Symonds, both embroiled in recent disputes with Harbhajan, steadied the innings with a fourth-wicket partnership of 100 from 105 balls but the Indian had the last laugh. Symonds, who accused of Harbhajan of racially abusing him during the Sydney test, holed out to Kumar in the deep when he tried to smash him out of the ground. Hayden, reprimanded on Friday after describing Harbhajan as an "obnoxious weed" and challenging Sharma to a fight, had looked to be in ominous form as he raced towards a hundred. The left-hander struck 10 boundaries off 88 balls before he came unstuck when also fell to Harbhajan, caught by all-rounder Piyush Chawla. Harbhajan, who described Hayden as one of the most disliked cricketers in the international game, cheekily celebrated his success by shadow boxing with his team mate Yuvraj. The Australians were in deep trouble at 135 for five in the 28th over but recovered thanks to some lusty hitting by the middle order. Mike Hussey led the fightback with a watchful 45 before he was run out and Brad Hogg (23 not out), Brett Lee (17) and James Hopes (15) all chipped in with valuable contribution
