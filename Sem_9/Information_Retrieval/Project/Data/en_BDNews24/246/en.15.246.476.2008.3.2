 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided in principle to turn BTTB, a one-time monopoly and the largest fixed line entity, into a public limited company, named Bangladesh Telecom Company Limited. The decision was taken at an interim cabinet meeting Sunday, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. The meeting asked the post and telecommunication ministry to present the proposal again at a meeting of the council of advisers by April 30. An earlier proposal submitted to the advisory council by the ministry was rejected on Oct 6 last year. The ministry was set the November deadline to remove inconsistencies in its proposal. The telecoms ministry formed a five-member committee on Oct 7, with BTTB general manager (security and surveillance) Ziaur Rashid Safdar as its convenor, to amend the proposal. The committee also included officials of the ministry, BTTB and the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, and was tasked with submitting a report with recommendations within 15 working days of its being convenedthat is, by Nov 4 last year. After independence, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone (T&T) Department was created under the telecoms ministry to run telecommunication services on a commercial basis. T&T Department was restructured into Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB) in 1979 with a mandate to provide telecommunication services throughout the country. bdnews24.com/ah
