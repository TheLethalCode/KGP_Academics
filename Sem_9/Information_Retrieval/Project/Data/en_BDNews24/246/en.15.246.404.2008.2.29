 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest back-office outsourcing firm Capita Group Plc said trading was good amid continuing strong demand for services, as it met forecasts with a 19 percent rise in underlying 2007 profit on Friday. "Progress in the first few weeks of this year underpin our continued growth in 2008," Chief Executive Paul Pindar said, adding Capita has won contracts with an aggregate value of 314 million pounds ($623 million) so far in 2008. As a result, Capita has 100 percent of planned revenue for 2008 in the bag and has a "substantial degree of visibility" for 2009 and 2010, he said. Capita shares, which rose over 10 percent in the run-up to its results, were down 2.6 percent at 665 pence by 0940 GMT to value the business at 4.05 billion pounds. Capita announced two new deals on Friday. It is preferred bidder for an eight-year contract worth 87 million pounds to help British Islamic Insurance Holdings (BIIH) launch insurance products based on Islamic law, and has won a 17 million pounds five-year deal to help eircom, Ireland's leading telecoms provider, provide its directory enquiry service. Capita, which runs London's vehicle congestion charge and collects payments from Britain's television licence holders, made a pretax profit before amortisation of 238.4 million pounds last year, on turnover up 19 percent at 2.07 billion. Operating margin before amortisation rose 14 basis points to 13.1 percent. Seymour Pierce analyst Kevin Lapwood said: "The statement contains little that is new but is a typical reiteration from Capita of the buoyancy of its markets and its optimism for the future. There is nothing much wrong in that but we maintain that the shares are well up with these events". He rates Capita stock a "hold"" with a 700 pence target. Citi analysts repeated their "buy" rating on Capita stock with an 830 pence target, given "general insurance is increasingly looking a new leg to Capita's organic growth". The BIIH transaction follows a 722 million pound deal Capita won from British insurer Prudential Plc in November. Capita's final dividend was set at 8.0 pence, making the total dividend a third higher at 12p. Capita announced a special dividend of 25 pence in October. Its stock has outperformed other London-listed support services sector companies by 26 percent over the past 12 months. In October, Transport for London said U.S. technology services group IBM would run London's congestion charge scheme from 2009, after beating two bidders, including Capi
