 MILAN, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini said Wednesday's 1-1 home draw with second-placed AS Roma felt like a victory after the champions maintained their nine-point lead in Serie A. Captain Javier Zanetti struck two minutes from time to keep Inter's unbeaten league record this season after Francesco Totti had given Roma the lead in the first half. "It's a draw that's worth a victory," Mancini told Sky after his side played much of the second half with 10 men because he had used all his substitutes when left back Maxwell was injured. "Totti scored with their first shot on goal and this changed the game. Then with 10 we suffered." Zanetti was unwilling to say the title was wrapped up but still sounded confident. "It was a difficult match," he said. "Fortunately we got the goal and we're still nine points clear. The lead is big, we have to carry on like this because we're not in top form at the moment. It's a pity Maxwell got hurt." Inter were already without injured strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Julio Cruz through injury. They drew 1-1 at Sampdoria on Sunday and lost 2-0 to Liverpool in a Champions League last-16 first-leg match last week. Roma boss Luciano Spalletti came into the game saying his side needed to win to open up the title race. After the match he was more bothered by Philippe Mexes being sent off for two yellow cards minutes before Zanetti's equaliser. "It was unjust because the second yellow wasn't a yellow," he said. "It was absolutely not a foul.
