<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com)  The curtain came down on the month-long Ekushey Book Fair at Bangla Academy Friday with hundreds of people dashing for the last-minute purchase. A tinge of sadness suffused the end of the fair. Journalist Rahman Mustafiz was a regular visitor to the fair. "The last day moves me to tears," he said. Mustafiz referred to the early days of the fair when his father had piggybacked him to the fair venue. "I have been a regular visitor since 1972." "The other day I went out of town on an assignment and rushed to the fair after coming back to Dhaka," he said. According to an estimate by Bangla Academy, as many as 15 lakh people visited the fair, turning the venue into a bustling point of cheering and hangouts. Publisher Osman Gani said: "Book sales are not the only thing I care about. Thousands of people come here every year. Many Bangladeshis living abroad come home and visit the fair." Gani said the venue was the meeting place for writers, publishers and readers. Afzal Hossain, coming from Dhanmondi, despaired of the closing day. "We don't have many places here in Dhaka to go for hangout." "The fair was not all about the booklovers. Many visited the place only to spend some time with their friends. That's also important." For Razzak, Badal, Hasan, and Masudall from Kamalapur, the evening cultural function was the attraction. "It was all for free." bd
