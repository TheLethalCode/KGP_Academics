<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh have been drawn into an easy group of the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship when the eight-team draw ceremony took place in the Maldives Thursday. Last year's runners-up Bangladesh were placed in Group B along with co-hosts Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan while Group A included co-host the Maldives, holders India, Pakistan and Nepal, according to a Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) press release. The regional football championship is scheduled to begin at the end of May this year with Sri Lanka and the Maldives hosting the group stage matches. In the last edition in Pakistan in 2005, Bangladesh failed to retain their title after losing 2-0 to India in the final. Meanwhile, the BFF is yet to take any imitative to resume the national camp after country's football governing body came to an end with Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin leaving in last October, citing the six-month deferment of the SAFF Championship.
