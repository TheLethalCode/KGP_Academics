 NAIROBI, Feb 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's rival political factions turned to trying to solve the long term problems laid bare by two months of turmoil on Friday after a power-sharing deal to end the immediate post-election crisis. President Mwai Kibaki and his rival Raila Odinga signed the deal setting up a coalition government on Thursday after a month of often bitter negotiations punctuated by riots and ethnic violence around the east African nation. The two men had come under huge pressure from world powers and Kenya's 36 million people to find a solution to forestall more bloodshed and help repair the country's reputation as the region's business, tourism and transport centre. As word of the deal spread, overjoyed Kenyans danced, sang and ululated in the streets. Messages of praise and offers of help flooded in from overseas. Kenya's shilling currency strengthened against the dollar and stock brokers said they were too busy to talk on Friday morning, a sign of renewed life in east Africa's strongest economy -- badly hit by the crisis. Many Kenyans greeted each other with "Happy New Year," a reference to the fact that those celebrations were delayed by spasms of violence after Kibaki was sworn in on Dec. 30. The optimism was tempered with recognition across Kenya that the signing was only a first step. Real proof of commitment could wait for next Thursday, when Kenya's often unruly parliament opens with a mission to ratify the deal. "Conceiving the deal may have been difficult, but as with the conception of a baby, the hardest task will be nurturing it," columnist Kipkoech Tanui wrote in the opposition-leaning Standard newspaper. "The job is just half done!" 'HISTORIC OPPOTUNITY' Much remains to be negotiated, and Kenya's parliament is split right down the middle between Kibaki and Odinga's allies. "It would be a real tragedy and a betrayal if an agreement that holds so much hope ... was to be sabotaged by a parliament that might still have its share of hardliners and obstructionists," the Daily Nation wrote in an editorial. Under the deal, Odinga becomes executive prime minister and the cabinet will be split based on parliamentary representation. The agreement will enshrine in law those long-sought constitutional changes, the first part of a complete overhaul of the document that has ruled Kenya for 45 years. Mediator Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general has said the talks will produce lasting solutions to those issues within 12 months. A spokesman for Annan said the two sides had resumed discussions on Friday. Many Kenyans want a new charter to help resolve deep rifts over land, ethnicity and wealth that have plagued the nation since before its independence from Britain in 1963. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who visited Kenya two weeks ago to press for a deal, applauded the signing of Thursday's agreement as "an important step to sustain Kenya on its democratic path." South African President Thabo Mbeki called the deal a "shining example of how Africans themselves can find peaceful resolution to their political challenge
