 WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Treasury froze assets of four Syrians on Thursday, saying they facilitated the flow of money, weapons and terrorists through Syria to al Qaeda in Iraq. "Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, Syria has become a transit station for al Qaeda foreign terrorists on their way to Iraq," Stuart Levey, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The four Syrians are said to be members of Abu Ghadiyah's network, the Treasury Department said. "Abu Ghadiyah and his network go to great lengths to facilitate the flow through Syria of money, weapons and terrorists intent on killing US and coalition forces and innocent Iraqis," Levey said.

"Despite some improved efforts and progress, Syria remains the primary point for foreign fighters to transfer into Iraq. And we think the Syrian government has a lot more that it can do to deal with this issue," spokesman Tom Casey said. "The fact that we are sanctioning individuals who currently reside in Syria because of their participation in and support for al Qaeda in Iraq, is a clear indication that there is a long way to go on the part of the Syrian government to take the necessary actions to really be a valid partner in fighting terrorism rather than being a facilitator and enabler," Casey told reporters. The four men include: Iraqi-born Badran Turki Hishan al Mazidih, also known as Abu Ghadiyah, runs the al Qaeda in Iraq, or AQI, facilitation network. He now resides in Zabadani, Syria. Syrian-born Ghazy Fezza Hishan al Mizidih is Badran's cousin and a member of the network. Syrian-born Akram Turki Hishan al Mizidih is Badran's brother and a member of the network. Syrian born Saddah Jaylut al-Marsumi was AQI's financier and Badran's cous
