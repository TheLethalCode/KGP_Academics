<TEXT>
 BARQUISIMETO, Venezuela, July 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Midfielder Javier Mascherano scored his first goal for Argentina to give them a 1-0 win over Paraguay and top spot in their Copa America group on Thursday. Mascherano picked up a loose ball on the edge of the area and scored with a cleverly-placed shot into the bottom left-hand corner of Aldo Bobadilla's goal shortly after coming on as substitute for his 27th appearance. The win meant Argentina avoided a difficult quarter-final against Mexico and will instead face Peru, a theoretically easier game, on Sunday. Argentina topped Group C with nine points from three games, the only 100 percent record in the tournament. Paraguay, who will now be Mexico's opponents on Sunday, were second with six, followed by Colombia (three) and the United States (0). Argentina made eight changes to their starting line-up while Paraguay also made several alterations. Although Carlos Tevez and Rodrigo Palacio both looked lively, Argentina struggled to create chances against a tough Paraguay defence early on. Their best chance fell to Pablo Aimar, who failed to make proper contact with his header after Luis Gonzalez found him with a pinpoint cross from the right. Fernando Gago and Tevez were both close before halftime with long-range efforts while Paraguay forward Salvador Cabanas nearly scored from a tight angle but was denied by Roberto Abbondanzieri. Argentina kept up the pressure and twice hit the woodwork early in the second half. Tevez struck the foot of the post with a shot on the turn, then Palacio rifled a 25-metre effort against the crossbar. Argentina brought Lionel Messi on to a rousing reception from the crowd and Tevez curled another effort over the bar in the 73rd minute. But Mascherano ended their frustration six minutes later
