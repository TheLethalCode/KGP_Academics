 Cox's Bazar, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - A court dealing with cooperatives-related dispute in the district Wednesday cleared BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan of the charges of illegally allotting land for building a party office when his party was in power. Judge Bahalul Ahmed Chowdhury in his verdict said Bhuiyan was not found guilty of being involved with the allotment of the land, and he must be freed from the charges. On May 4, two members of a local cooperative of farmers filed the case against Bhuiyan and four other people, accusing them of allotting a piece of land of the cooperative to the local BNP for building its office. Abdur Rahman and Kafil Uddin of Badarkhali area filed the case with the court. They alleged that the allotted land was registered with the land office in 2002, using the name of the then local government and cooperatives minister, Bhuiyan. The other accused were also freed because the allegations against them could not be proved, the judge said. bdnews2
