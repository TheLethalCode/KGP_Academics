<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian Navy ship equipped with a radiation-monitoring laboratory will keep watch on the American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz when it comes calling at the southern port of Chennai on Monday. The first ever Iindian port call by a US aircraft carrier has sparked controversy. Some politicians said Washington was trying to absorb New Delhi into its sphere of military influence while some port workers voiced environmental fears. "A stringent radiation-monitoring protocol is in place which will periodically monitor and analyse air and water samples," naval officer Commodore P E Vanhalteren said. The Nimitz is due to lie at anchor off Chennai, formerly known as Madras, until July 5 in what has been termed yet another landmark in the growing warmth between Washington and New Delhi. Leftists have planned to organise protests in Chennai during the port call.
