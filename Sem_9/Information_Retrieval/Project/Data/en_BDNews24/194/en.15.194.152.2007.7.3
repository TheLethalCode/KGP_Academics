 Dhaka, July 03 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka-Kolkata direct train test drive on July 8 will bring an Indian delegation to Dhaka. "The communications ministry has informed me that a delegation from India will come to Dhaka by train on July 8. It will be like a trial run," director general of Bangladesh Railway Md Belayet Hossain told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The Bangladesh government agreed Tuesday to the Indian authorities sending their officials by an Indian train from Kolkata, he said. The Indian delegation will be in Dhaka until July 11 to hold talks with the Bangladeshi officials to finalise the launch of the Dhaka-Kolkata direct passenger train service scheduled for a launch in the third week of this month, according to the government officials. Dhaka and New Delhi had previously operated a trial run of trains between the two countries in 2001, but the service did not roll on. "The Indian train will come up to Dhaka Cantonment Station as the ongoing dual-gauge line project (up to the Cantonment) is scheduled to be finished by July 8," said additional director general (operations) of BR Kazi Asad Ullah. bdnews2
