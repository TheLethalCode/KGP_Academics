 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has suspended operations of 146 non-functional customs points along the porous border from July 1. Badiur Rahman, chairman of the NBR, told bdnews24.com Tuesday the points set up to facilitate border trade have been of no use for long. He added the new decision would help cut government expenditure . Most of the customs points had been set up under political consideration and without any feasibility study, Rahman said, adding the points would resume operations in the future, if needed. The political regimes had set up 181 such customs points since 1972, and with the latest decision only 35 points including some fully-fledged land ports would remain open for imports and exports of goods, the NBR chief said. He said they had been forced to bow to pressure from political leaders in approving such points in their constituencies although little trading took place through most of the points, he said. The cross-border trading will now be carried out through Benapole, Tamabil, Sona Masjid, Hili, Darshana, Sheola, Burimari, Chhatak, Biral, Rohonpur, Zakiganj, Gobrakura, Karoitali, Cox's Bazar, Betuli, Nakugaon, Teknaf, Noarai, Bholaganj, Ichhamati, Vijaypur, Ghoshgaon, Haldigram, Lingura, Kashba, Madarganj and Sonarhat. bdnews24.com/
