<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's defence minister apologised on Sunday for comments about the 1945 US atomic bomb attacks on the country which outraged survivors and drew criticism from the ruling bloc ahead of a key election in late July. Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma said he had not meant to offend the victims when he said on Saturday the bombings "couldn't be helped" because they had brought World War Two to an end and had prevented the Soviet Union from entering the war against Japan.

Some opposition parties demanded Kyuma's resignation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe defended his minister on Saturday, but ruling party executives urged Kyuma to apologise, in a bid to minimise the damage ahead of the July 29 upper house election. "If the comments were misunderstood, then he should explain and apologise," Shoichi Nakagawa, policy chief of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said earlier on Sunday.

Defenders of the bombings say they convinced Japan to surrender and saved lives that would otherwise have been lost had fighting continued.
