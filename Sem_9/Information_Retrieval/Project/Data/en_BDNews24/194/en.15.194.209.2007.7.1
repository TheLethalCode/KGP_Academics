 NEW YORK, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities briefly closed the American Airlines terminal at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport on Sunday after a suspicious package was found. Port authority officials said the package was being investigated by bomb squad and other experts but the terminal was reopened and the "all clear" given shortly after it was evacuated, media reports said. No information was available on what was inside the package. The airline said flights were not delayed. US airports have been on heightened security at the weekend after the explosion of a fuel-filled jeep on Saturday at Scotland's busiest airport that police said was a terrorist attack linked to failed car bombings in London. Federal officials last month announced they had foiled a plot to blow up JFK, although the suspects never obtained any explosive materials.
