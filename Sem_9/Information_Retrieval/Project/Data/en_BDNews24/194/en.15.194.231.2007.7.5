 ISLAMABAD, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears mounted that women and children were being used as human shields at a besieged mosque in Pakistan's capital on Thursday, as hundreds of militant students ignored a plea from their captured leader to surrender. Pakistan's Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan said the few students who had quit the mosque on Thursday had spoken of a nightmare scenario for security forces trying to keep casualties to a minimum. "A large number of women and children are being held hostage by armed men in a room," Khan told a news conference, adding that the brother of the captured cleric was hiding in the basement of an attached madrasa with 25 "women hostages". "Yes, they're using them as human shields, because the people who have come out, they told us that they're telling women and children not to worry because as long you're here forces will not attack us," he said. In an interview broadcast earlier on state television, the leader of the Red Mosque's Taliban-style student movement, caught the previous evening trying to escape wearing a woman's burqa, said 850 students remained inside, including 600 women and girls. Abdul Aziz, clad in a woman's all-enveloping garment like the one he was caught in, began the interview by dramatically lifting the black veil to reveal a face dominated by a bushy grey beard. He said only 14 men were armed with Kalashnikovs in the Islamabad mosque, though an Interior Ministry spokesman put "hard core elements" between 30 and 40, and a senior paramilitary officer reckoned there were 100 armed men. Smiling through much of a bizarre interview Aziz said he had wanted to leave the mosque, and had urged others to do the same, but some women teachers had persuaded girls to stay behind. "They are not being used as human shields, we only gave them passion for jihad," said Aziz, who was later remanded in court. Hundreds of police and soldiers, backed by armoured personnel carriers and with orders to shoot armed resisters on sight, have sealed off the Red Mosque, or Lal Masjid, and imposed an indefinite curfew in the neighbourhood around it. Aziz said it was time for all the students to leave. "For students to stay put at the mosque will only be damaging ... they should either leave, if they can, or surrender." One 12-year-old girl, Maria Habib, who was escorted from the mosque by her uncle on Thursday, said there were between 35 and 40 students of her age still inside. Liberal politicians have for months pressed President Pervez Musharraf, who faces elections later this year, to crack down on the cleric brothers in charge of the mosque and their movement. The Lal Masjid movement is part of a phenomenon known as "Talibanisation" -- the spread of militant influence from remote tribal regions on the Afghan border into central areas. The government has set several deadlines for surrender and used scare tactics, including warning explosions, bursts of gunfire and overflying helicopter gunships to weaken the resolve of the mosque's occupants. The death toll from the violence that began on Tuesday with clashes outside the mosque rose to at least 17 after a security officer said a student was killed in pre-dawn firing. A burqa-clad woman who left the mosque told Reuters Television she had seen four bodies including those of two girls. Before dawn, security forces fired a series of "warning blasts", ratcheting up pressure on the hold-outs to surrender, but by early afternoon only 66 students had left the compound, compared with close to 1,200 on Wednesday. There were occasional exchanges of fire through the day and seven students were later caught trying to escape. Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, told Reuters by telephone he would seek talks, but the government said the only option was surrender. The mosque has a history of supporting militancy but the latest trouble began in January when students, who range from pre-teenagers to people in their 30s, occupied a library to protest the destruction of mosques illegally built on state land. They later kidnapped women who they said were involved in prostitution, abducted police and intimidated shops selling Western films, while demanding enforcement of strict Islamic law. Threats of suicide attacks had stopped the government using force earlier, and two attacks on security forces elsewhere in the country on Wednesday raised fears the mosque's militant allies were hitting ba
