 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  Two sets of rules on judicial service designed to implement the 12-point directives of the Supreme Court to free the judiciary from the influence of the executive came into effect from Sunday. The rules are Bangladesh Judicial Service (Determining place of service, promotion, granting of leave, control and discipline and other condition of service) Rules 2007 and Bangladesh Judicial Service (Constitution of service appointment in the service and dismissal from the service) Rules, 2007. Law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser Mainul Hosein at his office told reporters of the rules taking force. He, however, could not say when the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code crucial to separating the magistracy from the executive would take effect. A nine-member Judicial Service Pay Commission led by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim was formed on June 16 to fix salaries and other facilities of the officials of the judicial service, Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed said. The Supreme Court on December 2, 1999 delivered a historic verdict in the Mazdar Hossain case with 12-point directives to the government to separate the judiciary form the executive wing of the state. On January 16, the government issued a gazette notification on the four judicial service rules, two of which came into effect earlier. Recently, the Supreme Court judges in a full court meeting advised the government to implement the remaining two rules from July 1. bdnew
