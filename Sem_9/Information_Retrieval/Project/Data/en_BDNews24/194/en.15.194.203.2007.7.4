<TITLE> Geeteara blames runaway industrial growth on policy mismatch </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 04 (bdnews24.com)  Industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury said Wednesday a lack of effective land allocation laws is leading to haphazard growth of industry. "There is no legal requirement in Bangladesh for a developer to obtain permission from any authority to convert privately owned land for any other use than the current use. This indiscriminate location of industry is causing environmental and social problems," Choudhury said. "The industrial land market is still very informal, this combined with a lack of professional service providers leads to chaotic development. A dearth of policies and laws are pushing up land prices in some areas drastically," Choudhury said. The price of land in the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor increased by nearly 100 percent from 2000 to 2005 while demand rose by 200 percent in the same period. A well-planned use of land for industrial growth can provide much needed jobs to millions of people, the adviser said. Choudhury also pointed to the concentration of enterprises in and around Dhaka. She asked the industrialists to diversify into some potentially dynamic regions, such as Bogra, Jessore and Comilla. Zhu Xian, country director of World Bank, said, "The development of industrial zones might be a good way to ensure that land is used productively and efficiently for non-agricultural purposes. Such a policy requires careful and strategic planning, as many other countries have shown." The Industry adviser and World Bank country director made their comments at a programme entitled, "Piloting reform through the development and management of economic zones" at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. The International Finance Corporation, Board of Investment and the World Bank jointly prepared the report. bd
