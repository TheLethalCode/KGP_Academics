Shah Nurul Kabir Shaheen, BCB vice president and chairman of the tournament committee, Saturday said the board plans to hold another four-dayer tournament with the participation of six clubs -- four from the capital and two outside the capital  in March next year.

The clubs outside Dhaka will take part in the Challenge Cup, organised by the BCB. Earlier, the BCB regularly organises a cricket match between Shaheed Mustaq Eleven and Shaheed Jewel Eleven on the occasion of the Independence Day every year but they are going to bring the clubs under the first-class tournament for the first time.
