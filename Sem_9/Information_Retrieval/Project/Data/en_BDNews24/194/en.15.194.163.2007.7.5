 Colombo, July 5 (bdnews24.com) - A valiant fightback from Mohammad Ashraful and Mushfiqur Rahim proved too little too late for Bangladesh as they conceded an innings and 90 runs defeat to Sri Lanka on the third day of the second Test at P Saravanamattu Stadium. Sri Lanka clinched the three-match Test series 2-0 with the final Test yet to be played. It was 28th innings defeat in 48 Tests for Bangladesh and sixth against Sri Lanka in nine Tests. Bangladesh have now lost five matches inside three days and the remaining four with a day to spare against the Lankans. It was also the 15th time that Bangladesh lost a Test inside three days on the back of 19 defeats inside four days. Bangladesh have been able to take only eight Tests to the fifth day. Bangladesh's end was similar to the starts they had in the first and second innings as they slipped from 269 for six to 299 all out, losing the last five wickets for 30 runs. The slide belied the hope of raised by Ashraful and Mushfiq of averting an innings defeat. The timid visitors also lost their way during the first Test after losing last five wickets for 21 runs in the second innings to concede an innings and 234 runs defeat, again on the fourth day. Muttiah Muralitharan broke the brave resistance between Mushfiq and Ashraful when Mushfique mistimed an off-drive to spoon a return catch soon after tea. Paceman Chaminda Vaas caused the damage with the new ball as he trapped both Mohammad Sharif (2) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (0) leg before in successive deliveries with both batsmen offering no shot. Ashraful and Mushfiq put on 191 runs for the sixth wicket, the Tigers' highest-ever partnership for any wicket, before Mushfiqur fell on 80. The pair eclipsed the previous best of 187 between Habibul Bashar and Shahriar Nafees for the second wicket against Australia at home in 2006. Skipper Ashraful remained unbeaten on 129 off 236 balls studded with 18 boundaries after Shahadat Hossain was run out for two. The newly-installed captain, dropped on 13 by Michael Vandort at gully off Lasith Malinga, drove Tillakaratne Dilshan to mid-off for a single to hit his fourth ton in 37 matches, third against Sri Lanka. The 22-year old middle order batsman, who first showed a high patience to knock 50 balls for 11 runs, took 184 balls to reach the ton with the help of 15 boundaries. Mushfiq defended 14 deliveries before pushing Muttiah Muralitharan to square leg for a single to become second youngest Bangladeshi batsman after Ashraful to score a half-century. The wicketkeeper hit nine fours and one six in his 183-ball knock. The hosts declared their first innings at 451/6 after bundling the timid visitors for their lowest-ever score of 62 in the first innings. Overnight batsmen Habibul Bashar and Ashraful showed some signs of recovery with patient strokeplay, but paceman Dilhara Fernando dented the Tigers' brief resilience in the day's fourth over. The experienced batsman hardly moved his feet and was beaten by Fernando's pace to be bowled for 12. Bangladesh resumed the day on 69 for four to add 230 losing remaining wickets. Vaas grabbed four wickets for 55 and Dilhara Fernando chipped in with three for 60. The final Test starts on July 11 in Kandy. bd
