 DILI, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timor's ruling Fretilin party has maintained a lead in the vote count for parliamentary elections with about half the ballots tallied, the electoral commission said on Tuesday. Counting had been completed in six of the nation's 13 districts, Maria Angelina Sarmento, a spokeswoman for the National Election Commission, told a news conference. With more than 278,000 votes counted, Fretilin had 30 percent of the votes and CNRT, the party launched by resistance hero and former president Xanana Gusmao, had 22 percent, Sarmento said. "Although it is not possible to share with you the turnout of this election, due to communication problems... we can already state that half of the votes in Timor Leste are already counted," she said, referring to East Timor's official name. Just over half a million were eligible to vote in the poll, the third in three months, after a presidential election and run-off. Fourteen parties contested the election, but it has proved to be the expected showdown between Fretilin and CNRT. Analysts do not expect any single party to win a majority in the 65-chamber parliament, meaning coalitions will have to be formed. However, Fretilin legislative candidate Jose Manuel Fernandes said he was confident his party would win more than half the vote. "In this parliamentary election we have won because (we) have consolidated our party since the presidential elections," he said. Fretilin, which led the 24-year struggle against Indonesia, remains popular, especially in the east of the country, but its candidate fared badly in the recent presidential election. President Jose Ramos-Horta, who resoundingly won a run-off vote in May, has called for a unity government that will promote reconciliation in the divided nation. Factional bloodshed broke out in East Timor last year, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. The month-long campaign was mostly peaceful, helped by the presence of U.N. police and a force of Australian-led troops. A European Union observer mission has endorsed the poll. After serving as the country's first president, Gusmao -- a charismatic hero of the resistance to the decades of Indonesian occupation that followed Portugal's withdrawal in 1975 -- now wants the more hands-on post of prime minister. The Fretilin government's sacking of 600 rebellious soldiers triggered the turmoil last May that killed 37 people and drove 150,000 from their homes. Foreign troops were brought in to restore order, but sporadic violence and unrest have continued. East Timor also faces food shortages after drought and plagues of locusts have slashed the harvest this year, meaning about a fifth of East Timor's population will need food aid, a UN report said recently. Saturday's election could help put the former Portuguese colony, which despite have rich energy resources is one of the world's poorest countries, on a new pa
