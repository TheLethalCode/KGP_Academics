 Colombo, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh were trailing by 320 runs at the close of the second day of the second Test after Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara cracked his fifth unbeaten double hundred at P Saravanamattu Stadium Wednesday. The timid tourists were tottering at 69 for four at stumps with Mohammad Ashraful (7) and Habibul Bashar (3) at the crease after the hosts declared their first innings at 451 for six. Bangladesh batsmen showed no signs of mending in the second innings the mistakes they had made in the first, they indulged in reckless strokeplay to collapse to 48 for one to 59 for four. Pacemen Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando caused the damage with two wickets apiece. Opener Shahriar Nafees nicked a simple catch to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off Vaas for 20 while Rajin Saleh forced Mahela Jayawardene at second slip to pull off a blinder off Dilhara Fernando for a two-ball duck in the next over. Beaten twice by Vaas, opener Javed Omar was finally trapped leg before for a stroke-filled 28 off 23 balls studded with six boundaries. Mehrab Hossain Jr was bowled by Fernando for a seven-ball eight. Earlier, the hosts added 297 runs on the second day with their overnight score of 154 for one, having skittled Bangladesh out for their lowest-ever total of 62 in the first innings on the first day. Sri Lanka skipper Jayawardene declared their first innings at 451 for six just after Sangakkara smashed his double ton to power Sri Lanka to a 389-run lead. Sangakkara, who romped from 96 to 102 whacking Mohammad Rafique over long-on for a massive six to complete his 13th Test hundred in 66 Tests, reached his double hundred pushing left-arm spinner Mehrab Hossain Jr in between midwicket and mid-on for a single. The 29-year old stylish left-hander, who resumed the day on overnight score of 51, remained unbeaten on 200 clubbing 20 fours and two sixes facing 325 balls. He took 137 balls to make his second century after consuming 188 balls for the first century. Sangakkara put on 128 runs with opener Malinda Warnapura (82) for the second wicket, 98 runs with Mahela Jayawardene (49) for the third wicket, 92 runs with Chamara Silva (33) for the fourth wicket and 56 with Chaminda Vaas ( 30 not out) for the unbroken seventh wicket. Bangladeshi bowlers could hardly penetrate the opponents batsman though out the day except a few moment in the second session after the hosts took the new ball. Shahadat Hossain, who removed overnight batsman Malinda Warnapure shortly after start the day 2, struck in the second over with new ball after lunch as Mahela Jayawardene pulled straight to Shahriar Nafees at square leg for 49. Bangladesh were also left ruing the position of their slip cordon as Jayawardene edged his seventh ball directly between the wicket-keeper and a very wide first slip in the morning. Just before tea, left-arm spinner Mehrab Hossain dismissed Chamara Silva and Tillakaratne Dilshan in between three deliveries to reduce the hosts to 359 for five before Prasanna Jayawardene pulled Mashrafee Bin Mortaza to Javed Omar at mid-on after tea break. Mehrab, Mashrafee and Shahadat took two wickets apiece, giving away 29, 77 and 81 runs. bd
