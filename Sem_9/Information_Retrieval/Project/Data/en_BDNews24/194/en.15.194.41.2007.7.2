 Barisal, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Two officers of the army-led joint forces allegedly tortured a pro-BNP student leader during questioning in absence of the investigation officer Saturday evening, the police said. Investigation officer Alimuzzaman, sub-inspector of Banaripara Police Station, admitted that the two officers had quizzed Mir Tajul Islam Shiplu, 25, a Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leader taken into remand, when he was out to attend a meeting. Shiplu was admitted to Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital, Barisal Saturday night after he had fallen sick, Alimuzzaman said. The police arrested Shiplu on June 22 at his municipality home and took him into a four-day remand on June 28. First class magistrate Munim Hasan approved his four-day remand after the IO had appealed for seven days to grill him. Shiplu, younger brother of Banaripara Upazila BNP general secretary Mir Shahidul Islam, was the joint secretary of Banaripara Jatiytabadi Chhatra Dal, the student chapter of the BNP. Barisal police chief Towfique Mahbub Chowdhury conceded that an accused in police remand had fallen sick. Sub-inspector Fariduzzaman of Banaripara Police Station told bdnews24.com that the two officers had arrived in the police station Saturday evening when he was on duty. One of them introduced himself as commander of RAB-8 lieutenant KM Mamunur Rashid. They took the key of the locker, took Shiplu to another room and interrogated him for about one hour. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Rashid admitted that they grilled Shiplu. "We returned after interrogating him. He was slightly sick." Shiplu led a group that had fired on an Awami League procession on Hospital Road in Banaripara on November 26, 2006, the RAB commander said. IO Alimuzzaman said he came to know about the joint forces quizzing on his return from the meeting and took Shiplu to hospital as his condition worsened. Shiplu is now under the watch of Prof Golam Mahmud Selim of medicine department. Banaripara police chief Abdul Hye Sarkar told bdnews24.com he and Alimuzzaman had gone to a meeting on law and order of Chakhar Union. He said he had come to know about the incident from second officer Fariduzzaman. Asked if the joint forces officers were right to interrogate Shiplu in absence of the IO, deputy inspector general of police of Barisal Aminul Islam said the law does not allow that. The DIG said the officers could be allowed to interrogate the accused only in front of the investigation officer since he is entirely responsible once the magistrate approves remand for anybody. He said he did not know of the Banaripara incident. Sub-inspector Abdu Hye said there was no case or complaint against Shiplu with Banaripara police station. bdnews2
