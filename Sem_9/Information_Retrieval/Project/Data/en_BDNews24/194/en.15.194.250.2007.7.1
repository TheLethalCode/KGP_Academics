<TITLE> Thai elections could be delayed to 2008 </TITLE>

 BANGKOK, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's post-coup national election could be pushed back until early 2008 as legal experts fear a new constitution and other laws will not be finished as planned, army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin said on Sunday. Sonthi, who ousted Thaksin Shinawatra's government in a bloodless coup last year, told reporters he would meet Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont to discuss possibly postponing the elections, originally set for the end of 2007. "Several academics have voiced their concern that the general election could not be held as planned, so I will bring this to discuss with the prime minister," Sonthi said. It remains a possibility that the charter being drawn up to replace the 1997 "People's Constitution" torn up in last September's military coup would be rejected in a plebiscite set for Aug. 19, analysts say. Thaksin, currently living in exile, and his disbanded Thai Rak Thai party are expected to campaign vigorously against it. They are likely to be joined by a variety of groups, ranging from those who want Buddhism, the faith of 90 percent of Thais, to become the state religion to rights activists who say some clauses in the new charter are affronts to democracy and freedom. Surayud said in a television interview on Saturday elections should be held between Nov. 25 and December 23, the dates he has set, in order to regain investors' confidence. But Sonthi told reporters the president of the army-appointed parliament had told him passage of the new charter and other laws would take longer than expected, and so the election would have to be delayed. Other lawmakers said a fierce election campaign ahead of 80th birthday celebrations for King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Dec. 5 would not be appropriate. Surayud told reporters on Sunday he would wait to see the result of the referendum before deciding on the final date for the parliamentary election. "If it's doable, I wish to keep my words by holding the elections at the end of the year," said Surayud, whose popularity declined to 45.4 percent in a June survey released on Sunday by a Bangkok university, compared to 48.2 percent in February. But 65 percent of 3,000 respondents wanted his interim government to continue working until the end of its term, set at year end, an Assumption University poll said. Sonthi's comments prompted criticism from anti-coup activists that the coup leaders were trying to cling on to power, a charge Sonthi denied on Sunday. The anti-coup campaign, which has lost strength after the government froze Thaksin's $1.5 billion in Thai bank accounts last month, continued its rally on Sunday demanding Sonthi and other generals to quit and call and immediate election. About 6,000 protesters took a 5-km (eight-mile) march along Bangkok streets and were stopped a few blocks before the house of Prem Tinsulanonda, the chief adviser to the monarch, accusing him of being the mastermind of the coup and demanding his ouster.
