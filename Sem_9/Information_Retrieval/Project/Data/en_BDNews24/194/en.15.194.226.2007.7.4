 Dhaka, July 04 (bdnews24.com) - The caretaker government considers a plan to stop the production and use of incandescent light bulbs to save power, a government official said Wednesday. The cabinet has recently sent letters to the industry ministry and the National Board of Revenue to take necessary steps. Additional secretary of the cabinet division Md Zahid Hossain told bdnews24.com: "The industry ministry and the NBR have also been advised to take steps to encourage production of energy-saving fluorescent bulbs and to stop production of incandescent bulbs within three years." Zahid, who also heads the committee to monitor power consumption in government offices, said: "Up to 400 megawatts of power will be saved every day throughout the country once the use of incandescent bulbs stops entirely." He said many other countries were implementing moves to stop the use of incandescent bulbs. "The EU (European Union) countries have decided to stop production of such high power-consuming bulbs within two years. A senior NBR official said the government was considering whether duty on fluorescent bulbs could be cut to encourage its production, and duty on incandescent bulbs increased at the same time. bdnews24.co
