<TITLE> Batting firmed up for second Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh have strengthened batting in desperation to get over batting blues after the disastrous performance by the batsmen in the first Test when they go head-to-head against Sri Lanka in the second Test beginning Tuesday at the P. Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo. But like the first Test the rains threatens to dictate the second Test too with more showers forecast for the rest of the week with both teams already denied meaningful practice Monday. "We need to bat for long periods and we are focusing on the batting," said Bangladesh's interim Australian coach Shaun Williams on eve of the second Test. To increase the batting depth, the team management is considering a couple of changes in the squad that lost the first Test by an innings and 234 runs, their worst ever defeat against Sri Lanka. Bangladesh were skittled out for just 89 runs in the first innings although bravely kept the hosts at bay on the third day in the second innings before collapsing spectacularly on in the fourth day morning to lose five wickets for 21 and the last seven for just 27 runs. Bangladesh have brought three changes to the squad that played the first Test with teenage wicketkeeper-cum-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim replacing long-serving Khaled Mashud, seamer Mohammad Sharif and Mehrab Hossain Jr playing in the places of spinner Abdur Razzak and Saqib Al Hasan, according to Tigercricket.com, the Bangladesh Cricket Board's official website. Captain Mohammad Ashraful said he was confident to do better with the squad he has and wanted to bat at least four sessions. "I am very confident that we can do better than we did in the first Test with the side we have selected. "We have not set any target rather we want to improve every day. We have strengthened our batting and I would like to see us bat for at least four sessions. That would help the team," the newly installed Bangladesh skipper was quoted by tigercricket.com. Coach Williams told Reuters that it was a tough challenge for them because Sri Lanka have a bowling attack now that compares with the best in the World, but his boys were enjoying it. "I rather talk about the positives we got out of the first test... In particular, I thought our boys batted very well in the first and second sessions of the third day. "They maintained a good tempo and that was a positive aspect which we hope to take into the second test," added the Australian coach. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene ruled out any complacency against the struggling Bangladesh, saying his team needed to perform better in the five-day game. "I feel we can still improve in batting, bowling and fielding. One area that we can improve on is to make those hundreds into 150s and 200s that will give our bowlers the ideal platform," Jayawardene told AFP. Referring to Bangladesh's second round berth in the ICC World Cup, the successful Lankan skipper said, "I guess the Bangladeshis are heading in the right direction. A bit more commitment from the players could help them at the Test level." Sri Lanka are expected to name the same squad with Jayawardene keen to give youngster Malinda Warnapura a proper opportunity after he was dismissed for a golden duck on his debut. Squad: Bangladesh - Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafe Mortaza, Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, Mehrab Hossain jnr, Shahriar Nafees, Rajin Saleh, Shahadat Hossain, Mohammed Rafique, Mohammad Sharif and Mushfiqur Rahim.
