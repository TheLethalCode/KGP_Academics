 Rajshahi, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Rajshahi court Wednesday cleared former BNP lawmaker Nadim Mostafa of the charges of misappropriating CI sheets meant for relief. Rajshahi additional sessions judge Rezaul Islam ordered the acquittal of Nadim, who Tuesday was jailed for five years for cheating, and seven others jailed on the same charges. The others are Selina Khatun, her husband Salek Sarker, Rokonuzzaman, Mansur Master, Rakib, Abdur Rahman Sarker and Zahedul Islam. Sub-inspector BM Liakat Ali of Puthia Police Station filed a case against them after the police recovered CI sheets on Feb 25 from Selina Khatun's Belpukur home. The investigator of the case, sub-inspector Kazi Farid Uddin, pressed charges against the eight on April 22. The court said the accused were cleared of the charges, as the allegations against them were not proved beyond doubt. All, excluding Nadim Mostafa and Salek Sarker, who are hiding, were present in the dock when the verdict was delivered. Five more cases relating to assisting militants and extortion against Mostafa are awaiting verdict. bdnews24.com/
