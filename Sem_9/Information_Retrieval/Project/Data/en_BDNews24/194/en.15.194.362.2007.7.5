 LONDON, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British police investigating the al Qaeda-style car bomb attacks in London and Scotland have found a suicide note left by one of the men who rammed a vehicle into Glasgow airport, CNN reported. The U.S. broadcaster did not say where the note was found but, citing sources close to the investigation, said it had been left by one of two men who rammed a Jeep into the terminal last Saturday and set the vehicle ablaze.
