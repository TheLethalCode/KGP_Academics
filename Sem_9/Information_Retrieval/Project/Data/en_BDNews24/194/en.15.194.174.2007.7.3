 MILAN, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edward P. Jones plans to meet 'West Wing' actress Anna Deavere Smith this week to discuss her possible HBO script for his novel 'The Known World,' the writer said on Monday. The script for 'The Known World,' Jones's 2003 novel about slave-owning blacks in the pre-Civil War US South, will be a topic when he and Smith, also a playwright, attend a cultural event in Aspen, Colorado, Jones said. "She wrote a screenplay for a movie but that fell through and she's now written a screenplay for HBO," he told Reuters, referring the US cable television network, Home Box Office, known for such hits as 'The Sopranos' series. "Of course, writing it is one thing, getting the money to produce it is something else. She and I will have sort of a public conversation at some stage and probably talk about that as well." A movie deal would be another step into the limelight for the 56-year-old writer, whose slender three-book output has been garlanded with US and foreign awards. A late-blooming literary celebrity, Jones won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for 'The Known World'. He started writing the New York Times best-seller just after losing his job as press digest editor for tax and insurance magazines. WIDESPREAD PRAISE Last year he won widespread critical praise for All Aunt Hagar's Children', a short story collection set in the black working class of Washington, Jones's hometown. He also has taken home a MacArthur Fellowship, the so-called 'genius grant'. Asked if he had another book in mind, he said, "No, not really." "What I need to do is just go back home and spend a few weeks not traveling. Since 2003, I've done a lot of traveling. I didn't even have a passport before 2004. I'd never been west of, like, (the US state of) Indiana," Jones said. Washington could again provide inspiration for a book, possibly a novel. But Jones said he has relied only on his own creativity, never on people or events he knew. "There might come a time down the line when my imagination fails me and I'll just have to start stealing from my life but so far I haven't gotten to that point," said Jones, who was attending the Milanesiana cultural festival in the northern Italian city. Jones added that he felt he had to write even if his books never sold. "I think it's compulsion. I have no choice," he sai
