 Washington, July 3, (bdnews24.com/BBC)Former US President Bill Clinton has made his first major appearance alongside his wife, Hillary, as she campaigns in the 2008 White House race. The couple took to the stage in Iowa, a crucial state because it is among the first to pick which candidate from each party will run for president. Mr Clinton said his wife was the "best qualified non-incumbent I have ever had a chance to vote for president". Mrs Clinton is trailing Democratic rival Barack Obama in fundraising.

Senator Obama's campaign team announced on Sunday he had raised $32.5m (16.2m) in the second quarter of campaign fundraising, compared to some $27m (13.5m) for Mrs Clinton.
