 BAGHDAD, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of civilians killed in Iraq fell sharply in June to the lowest monthly total since a US-backed security clampdown was launched in February, Iraqi government figures showed on Sunday. The data, obtained from the ministries of interior, defence and health, showed 1,227 civilians died violently in June, a 36 percent fall from May and the lowest level in five months. While U.S. military officials have said the number of attacks across Iraq have remained steady in recent months, there has been a reduction in the past few weeks in the amount of big car bombings that often cause a heavy loss of life. One of the key aims of the crackdown is to dismantle car bomb networks operated by al Qaeda in and around Baghdad. U.S. officials accuse al Qaeda of trying to tip Iraq into full-scale sectarian civil war. The data showed that 222 Iraqi police and soldiers were also killed in June, slightly higher than the previous month. The Iraqi data also showed that 416 insurgents and militants were killed in June while 2,262 were detained. A car bomb attack at a Shi'ite mosque in central Baghdad on June 19 killed 87 people, the deadliest attack in the capital since 140 people perished in a Baghdad market bomb in April.
