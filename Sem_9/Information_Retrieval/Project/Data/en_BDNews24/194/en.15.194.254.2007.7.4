 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Authorities have appointed former ambassador Mirza Shamsuzzaman and former joint secretary AYM Mosharraf Hossain to Bangladesh Public Service Commission as members, a government statement said Wednesday. Their appointments came to fill the vacancies after the last month's resignations of five members of the PSC over reported corruption and mismanagement. PSC members Anwarul Haque, Prof AKM Shahadat Hossain Mondal, Latifur Rahman and Prof Fazlul Haque resigned on June 17, under apparent pressure from the emergency government. On June 14, PSC member Ashraful Islam Chowdhury, chairman of the 27th BCS exam committee, followed the suit. Prof Ashraf's resignation came after the 27th BCS oral exam was cancelled on May 30 amid allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism involving the tests. He was appointed to the PSC on May 30, 2004. The interim cabinet on May 30 cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams in a move to restore people's trust in the agency, as media reports said corruption and intimidation by the BNP-led government had marred the process. The government on June 20 appointed Md Nurunnabi and Suraiya Begum as PSC members. bdnew
