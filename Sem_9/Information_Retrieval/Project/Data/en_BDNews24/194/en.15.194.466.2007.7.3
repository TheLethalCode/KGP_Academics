<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 03 (bdnews24.com) - The National Board of Revenue chairman has personally guaranteed that the board will not take any action against those who legalise their undisclosed income by July 31. "I promise people that the NBR won't take any action against them under the Income Tax Ordinance of 1984," Badiur Rahman told reporters Tuesday. Rather, the NBR chairman said, legalising undisclosed money will stand them in good stead if they face any future problems in the current context," Rahman said. However he said: "There will be no mercy after the July 31 deadline." The NBR chairman was talking to the reporters after instructing tax officials on the board's move to intensify the search for potential new taxpayers in Dhaka and to implement the move in other metropolitan cities from Thursday. NBR members and senior tax officials were present. The government has provided people the opportunity to legalise undisclosed income since June 5 up to July 31, by paying only 5 percent tax in penalty in addition to normal tax. But the NBR have not had the expected response due to taxpayers' fears that they would be punished if they declared previously undisclosed income. Since June 5 the NBR has received only Tk 8.8 crore in taxes against the provision. "I am assuring those people who are considering legalising their untaxed money that the NBR will take no punitive action," Badiur Rahman told reporters. "Tax officials have been ordered not to take any further information other than name and address of the taxpayers," he added. But serious actions will be taken as soon as the deadline is over against persons who are detected to own untaxed money. "There will be a strong and drastic drive after July 31," the NBR chief reiterated. He said a fine of up to 250 percent may be imposed against those holding undisclosed income. On March 29 the NBR launched a three-month-long survey in the Dhaka metropolitan area to identify potential new taxpayers. Eight teams comprising three members each have been working in the capital to which another 12 teams are being added. NBR official Ahmed Ali said that the survey has traced 11,381 new taxpayers out of 20,104 persons surveyed in Dhaka since March 29. Another 28 teams will be sent to other metropolitan cities while a separate survey team will operate in Rangpur, said the NBR chairman. bdn
