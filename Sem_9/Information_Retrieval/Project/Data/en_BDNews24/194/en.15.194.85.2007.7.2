<TITLE> Rushdie and Lakshmi to divorce </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, July 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Author Salman Rushdie and his wife Padma Lakshmi, host of TV show "Top Chef," are getting divorced, his spokeswoman said on Monday, just two weeks after he was awarded a controversial knighthood. Rushdie is the 60-year-old writer whose novel "The Satanic Verses" outraged many Muslims and sparked death threats that forced him to live in hiding for nine years. He married Lakshmi, a former model born in 1970, in 2004. "Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi, because of her desire to end their marriage," spokeswoman Jin Auh said in a statement on his behalf. "He asks that the media respect his privacy at this difficult time," the statement said. Rushdie hit the headlines two weeks ago when he was selected for knighthood by Britain's Queen Elizabeth, provoking renewed anger among some Muslims in Iran and Pakistan. Rushdie published his first novel, "Grimus," in 1975, but shot to fame in 1981 when his second novel, "Midnight's Children," a magic realist exploration of Indian history, won the Booker Prize. The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme religious leader, pronounced a fatwa, or religious edict, on the writer on February 14, 1989, calling on Muslims to kill Rushdie because of perceived blasphemy against Islam in his fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses."
