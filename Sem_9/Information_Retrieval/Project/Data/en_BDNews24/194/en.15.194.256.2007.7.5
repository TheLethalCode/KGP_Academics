 TOKYO, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Shinzo Abe, his public support sinking in the polls, admitted on Thursday that his coalition faced a tough fight in elections just weeks away but refused to consider defeat before the battle had even begun. Public anger over mismanaged pension records and doubts about his leadership abilities have pushed the once-popular leader's support below the critical 30 percent level ahead of the July 29 vote to elect a new upper house of parliament. At a televised news conference, Abe said he faced headwinds but was determined to win his first big electoral test since taking office last September. "I believe conditions now, before the elections, are very tough," he said. "But I am confident of winning if we are able to explain strongly and clearly during the campaign about our performance, what kind of country we are aiming for and what we are doing to achieve that," he said. Abe's woes were compounded by weekend remarks by his defence minister remarks that appeared to condone the 1945 atomic bombings of two Japanese cities. Abe refused to fire him but the minister quit on Tuesday -- the second resignation from his nine-month-old cabinet, less than two months after the scandal-tainted farm minister committed suicide. The LDP and its junior coalition partner, the New Komeito party, need to win a total of 64 of the 121 seats up for grabs to keep their majority in the 242-seat upper chamber. New Komeito is aiming to get 13 seats. A loss in the upper house would not eject the ruling camp from government, since it retains a huge majority in the more powerful lower chamber. Abe is seeking to present the election as a contest between himself and Ichiro Ozawa, the old-style politician who leads the main opposition Democratic Party and who often seems ill at ease before the cameras. The two held a debate on Sunday. "When looking at policies, it's a matter of asking whether the policies being pitched by the party leader is right, whether that person can be trusted," Abe said. Ozawa told reporters on Thursday he would step down if opposition parties failed to win a majority in the election, but Abe refused to say the same. "I have no intention of speaking before the battle under the premise of losing," he said. Seeking to quell public anger over the government's bungling of millions of pension records, Abe apologised for the mishap and vowed to speed up checks and set the records straight. The government later announced a more detailed plan for resolving the pensions mess. "I think the public is feeling very angry that this has happened," Abe said. "This problem must be completely resolved under my administratio
