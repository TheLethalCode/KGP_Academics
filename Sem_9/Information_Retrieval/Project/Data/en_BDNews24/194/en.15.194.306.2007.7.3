 NAROK, Kenya, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small plane flying to Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve crashed on Tuesday and three people were feared dead, police said. The aircraft took off from Nairobi's Wilson Airport, which serves many tourists flying out for safaris, before disappearing from the radar shortly afterwards, police said. "Three people are feared dead. The plane crashed into the Loita Hills, near the Masai Mara game reserve," Narok district police boss Patrick Wambani told Reuters. "The plane was headed to the reserve." Accident investigators were on their way to the scene to recover the wreckage, he said. Wambani said he had no details on the nationalities of those aboard, nor who owned the plane. The road from Nairobi to the Masai Mara, home of lions, cheetahs, elephants, zebra and wildebeests, is in poor condition and many tourists opt to fly there rather than drive.
