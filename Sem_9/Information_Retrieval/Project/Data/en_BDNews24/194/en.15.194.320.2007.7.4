<TITLE> CEC to lay out roadmap to voter listing, not election: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4(bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda is likely to lay out a roadmap to the electoral roll with photographs, but not an election timeline, before the media by July 15 or July 16. The roadmap will include guidelines of the voter list project and probable dates for voter listing in the districts, election commissioner Md Sohul Hossain, told bdnews24.com in his office Wednesday. The commissioner said the roadmap might not specify a national election date. "The roadmap will illustrate more efficient and quicker ways to craft the voter list with pictures and address the issue of the national ID card as well," he said. "The media misinterpreted the CEC's statement of June 30, the closing day of the pilot project in Gazipur, as a roadmap to the elections," Hossain said. He said they would finish listing voters within 18 months. "The toughest part is to enlist inhabitants of the enclaves and non-resident Bangladeshis as voters." The consultants to the commission are now weighing several procedures adopted during the pilot project for an efficient and transparent roll, he said. The commissioner said some of the voters had been given forms earlier in their homes while others came directly to the camps to enlist themselves. The voter list project will start from the Rajshahi City Corporation in mid-July. But an amendment to the voter list related ordinance and a new law for the national ID card needed to be in place, Hossain maintained. He said national ID cards were not issued simultaneously with listing in the pilot project to save time and were given in one or two days. The cards would be also useful to avail public services, he added. bdnews24.
