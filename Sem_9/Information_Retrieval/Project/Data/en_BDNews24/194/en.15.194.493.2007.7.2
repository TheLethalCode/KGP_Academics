<TITLE> Party reforms a must before electoral talks: EC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com) The Election Commission will sit with political parties to discuss electoral laws only after necessary reforms to the parties have been carried out. "But no discussion can take place until the ban on indoor politics is lifted and reform takes place within the parties," election commissioner Sahul Hossain told reporters in his office Monday. He said the EC had submitted a proposal for talks with political parties but it had yet to decide by what process such talks would take place. He also stressed the holding of party councils. The commissioner said Sunday that the EC's proposal to have informal talks on electoral reform could not garner the expected response from parties and that the EC was awaiting the withdrawal of the ban on parlour politics. However, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Sunday that a decision may come through the home ministry "very soon" to relax the ban. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had last month invited political parties to discuss electoral reforms with the EC. He had said the ban on indoor politics would not bar such talks. The CEC met the law adviser three months ago, on April 4, asking for withdrawal of the ban. The government has so far not responded to the plea. bdnews
