<TEXT>
 BERLIN, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barbra Streisand told a sell-out Berlin concert crowd on Saturday that she was delighted to perform in Germany for the first time after turning down several invitations in the past. German media have linked the Jewish star's refusal to sing there previously to Germany's responsibility for the Holocaust and had hailed her decision to appear. Streisand quickly warmed to the enthusiastic audience of 18,000 that gave her more than a dozen standing ovations. "I'm so very happy to be in your country," Streisand said, speaking in flawless German, after the crowd warmed themselves up and brought her orchestra to their feet with a series of pre-concert stadium waves. "It's exciting for me to be here, too," Streisand added before listing some of the things she likes about Germany -- from currywurst to apple strudel and Beethoven to Bach.

"Barbra Streisand was the only one," Spiegel said, when asked if artists had reservations about Germany. Spiegel, a top German talent agent, said he could understand her stance. The 65-year-old singer did not want to comment on her reasons for not coming to Germany in her career before. But in a statement to Reuters on Friday she had said: "Germany is a very different place than it was before World War Two." Born in New York to Jewish American parents in 1942, according to online biographies, Streisand has never played outside North America except for London and Australia. "Thank you for coming to Berlin!" shouted one fan at one point late in her 2-1/2 hour long show. "It's my pleasure -- I'm thrilled to be here," she repli
