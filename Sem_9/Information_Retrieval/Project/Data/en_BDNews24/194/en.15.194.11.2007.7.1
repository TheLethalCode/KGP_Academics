<TITLE> German rail unions to begin strikes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unions representing 134,000 workers at Germany's Deutsche Bahn will begin strikes on Monday to protest the rail operator's stance in wage negotiations. The Transnet and GDBA unions are demanding a 7 percent pay rise or a minimum increase of 150 euros per week, while Deutsche Bahn is offering two 2 percent raises in 2008 and 2009 and a one-off payment of 300 euros. The two sides were unable to narrow their differences in negotiations on Saturday when a moratorium on staging strikes expired. "In light of the employer's refusal to budge, we are calling for massive warning strikes," Regina Rusch-Ziemba, deputy head of the Transnet union, said at a news conference in Berlin. The unions said 2-3 hour targeted strikes would begin in the early hours of Monday in the southwestern cities of Freiburg and Karlsruhe and then be extended to cities in the east and north of the country. Government-owned Deutsche Bahn has said 9,000 jobs would be put at risk if the company met the wage demands of the unions. "Transnet and GDBA must realise that their push for a 7 percent raise, the highest wage demand in all of Germany, simply cannot work," said the company's human resources chief Margret Suckale in a statement. Another union representing 30,000 locomotive drivers is demanding a separate contract with raises of up to 31 percent and has also vowed strikes this week that it says will lead to a "massive standstill". Deutsche Bahn, keen to agree a single contract for all its workers, has refused to talk to the GDL union.
