<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel will resume as early as Sunday the transfer of millions of dollars in tax funds to the Palestinians for the first time in 17 months to bolster President Mahmoud Abbas in a drive to further isolate Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his cabinet steps taken by Abbas to try to rein in militants could also lead to progress on the diplomatic front, but he offered no specifics. Senior Israeli and Palestinian officials said the tax money would be transferred to the emergency government Abbas established in the occupied West Bank after he ordered the dissolution of the cabinet led by Hamas Islamists. It was not immediately clear how much money would be transferred to the emergency government in the first instalment. In addition to resuming automatic transfers of tax revenues worth some $50 million each month starting July 1, Israel said it would begin unfreezing the hundreds of millions of dollars in tax funds it has been accumulating since transfers were first halted on Feb. 1, 2006, following Hamas's election victory. "Everything that needed to be agreed upon has been agreed," a senior Israeli official said. "From July 1, there will be automatic transfers of the tax money. It is supposed to happen now, Sunday or Monday." A senior Palestinian official said Abbas's emergency government was promised by Israel that it would begin receiving the tax funds on Sunday. Palestinian officials estimate Israel is holding more than $700 million. Israeli officials say that figure is closer to $500 million, and that $300 million to $400 million is all that is available for transfer to Abbas because the rest of the money has been frozen by court order to cover Palestinian debts. "FINANCIAL BRIBERY" Hamas has called Israel's release of the tax money "financial bribery" and "political blackmail" meant to stoke divisions after Hamas forces routed Abbas's secular Fatah to seize control of the Gaza Strip last month. Israel and the United States want to isolate Hamas in Gaza while bolstering Abbas financially, militarily and politically in the West Bank. "The conduct of the new Palestinian government creates avenues for cooperation that were impossible previously because Hamas was an indivisible part of this government," Olmert told his cabinet on Sunday. Olmert said recent orders issued by Abbas, aimed at banning West Bank militants from carrying arms and curbing Hamas's influence in the territory, "certainly help in creating, slowly and carefully, avenues for cooperation between us and them". This cooperation, Olmert said, "will also, without a doubt, enable us to make progress on the diplomatic track". At a meeting with Abbas at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh last week, Olmert promised to free about 250 Palestinian prisoners from Abbas's Fatah faction as a goodwill gesture to the Palestinian leader. Olmert did not seek cabinet approval on Sunday for the release of the prisoners as had been expected. Instead, Israeli officials said, Olmert asked his cabinet to set up a committee to set the parameters for the release of prisoners "without blood on their hands". It is unclear how Abbas intends to enforce orders that no longer permit Palestinians to bear illegal weapons. Hamas has decried what it sees as a major crackdown by Abbas's forces on Hamas members in the West Bank. Hamas says more than 250 Hamas supporters have been taken into custody by forces loyal to Abbas. Fatah officials dispute those numbers. One of the bodyguards for Aziz Dweik, the Hamas speaker of parliament, was seized on Sunday by Palestinian security forces, security sources said. Dweik is already in Israeli custody. "Whoever harms our people will be struck harshly," Hamas's armed wing, Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said on Sund
