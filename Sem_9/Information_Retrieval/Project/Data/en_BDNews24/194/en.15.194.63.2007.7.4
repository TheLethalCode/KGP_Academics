 Dhaka, July 4(bdnews24.com) - A sunny morning ushered in Wednesday in the capital, but soon the skies were overcast with rain clouds and it was drizzly all over. Intermittent rainfalls accompanied by gusty winds caused traffic congestions in parts of the city. Commuters faced the usual monsoon handicaps in getting to work. The met office said the active monsoon and thunder-lined cloud formations should be continuing through the day. Rain and thunderstorm may affect the seaports that have been asked to continue to hoist local cautionary signal three. All fishing boats and trawlers have been asked to stay anchored safely until further notice. Most places of Khulna, Barisal and Chittagong divisions may see rainfall. Many places of Dhaka and Sylhet divisions and some places of Rajshahi Division also may have moderate to heavy rainfalls with gusty to squally winds. The day temperature will remain almost unchanged. The sun sets at 6:50pm Wednesday and rises at 5:16am Thursday. bdnews24
