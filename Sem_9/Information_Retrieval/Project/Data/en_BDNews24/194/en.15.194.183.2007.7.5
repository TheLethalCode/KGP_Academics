 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday sentenced former BNP lawmaker Ali Asghar Loby to eight years in jail for dodging tax and suppressing information about his tax. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin of the Special Judge Court-3 in his verdict also fined the former Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Tk 25 lakh. Loby has to serve another one and a half years in jail unless he pays the fine, according to the verdict. Loby was brought to court from Kashimpur jail in the morning for sentencing. The judge also ordered confiscation of money suppressed in his tax return document. The sentencing will be effective from Loby's detention date. A team of joint forces arrested Loby at his Gulshan home on Feb 6. On May 23, Md Nurul Amin, deputy commissioner of the National Board of Revenue, filed the case against the former lawmaker with Dhaka Metropolitan Special Judge's Court accusing him of dodging Tk 4.5 crore in income tax. The court recorded testimonies of 17 witnesses on June 7-18 after charges were framed on June 5. One witness declined to testify. "The tax evasion charge brought against me is baseless," Loby said in his court statement on June 20. "The untaxed money in question was in my bank account as I was the managing director of Rupsha Overseas." Loby faces another case. On March 21, deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission Shirin Parveen lodged the case against him and his wife Khushnud Asghar with Gulshan Police Station accusing them of suppressing information regarding assets worth Tk 2.69 crore and acquiring wealth valued at 24.97 crore beyond their known income sources. The Special Judge's Court-3 set up in the Jatiya Sangsad premises will hear the charge framing in the case Sunday. bdnews24.com/p
