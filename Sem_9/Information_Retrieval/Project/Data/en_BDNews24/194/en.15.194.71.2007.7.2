 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  So-called reformist BNP leaders Monday said they would convene a council conforming to the party constitution and with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's consent. "We will follow the democratic way of calling the council. And that is after permission from the chairperson," joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain said after a meeting at the Gulshan home of BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. At the meeting, several former lawmakers and grassroots workers aired their views on the reform issue. Khaleda's adviser retired major general ZA Khan said: "We don't have a problem with the chairperson. She wants reforms as much as we do. The draft proposals will be approved at the council." "The secretary general will meet the chairperson and finalise the draft reform proposals," Khan said. Ashraf said, "Councillors will be notified 15 days before the council is convened." bdnew
