 LONDON, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shivnarine Chanderpaul inspired West Indies to a 61-run win over England on Wednesday in the second one-dayer to level the series at 1-1. Set a challenging target of 279 to win at Edgbaston, England were bowled out for 217. The tourists' victory was built on another fine performance by Chanderpaul, who hit an unbeaten 116 from 122 balls as they reached 278 for five. It was his seventh one-day century. Marlon Samuels also thumped 77 while Ravi Rampaul bowled impressively, taking four for 41. The best-of-three series will now be decided on Saturday at Trent Bridge. England's highest scorer was Matt Prior, who carried the fight to West Indies by scoring his first 50 in one-day internationals, totalling 52 off 73 balls. West Indies, unchanged after their defeat at Lord's on Sunday, made a brisk start after being put into bat by England captain Paul Collingwood. Openers Chris Gayle (36) and Devon Smith (17) struck 50 inside the opening eight overs but it was the partnership of Chanderpaul and Samuels that was key to West Indies' success - the pair adding 175 for the third wicket. Chanderpaul, in imperious form during the test series, reached his century in the 47th over. England's prospects looked as bleak as the Birmingham skies, which brought three rain delays, when they lost three early wickets, with Kevin Pietersen's dismissal by Rampaul for nine leaving them on 64 for three. After Prior's dismissal, captain Collingwood lasted only five balls before he was bowled lbw by Fidel Edwards for one. Owais Shah and Michael Yardy gave England a glimmer of hope with a sixth-wicket partnership of 54 runs but once Yardy was caught by Dwayne Smith, England slumped from 171 for 6 to 217 all out
