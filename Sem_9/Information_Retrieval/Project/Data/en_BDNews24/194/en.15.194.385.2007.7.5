 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to reorganise the board of directors of companies under the power, energy and mineral resources ministry, according to an adviser. The chairmen of the companies, if need be, would be manned by experts other than the ministry secretaries, power and energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Wednesday. He said the line ministry secretaries in top positions of the companies were relatively more susceptible to corruption. Chowdhury said experts from outside would be made top managers of the companies to enable the secretaries to spend more time on running their ministries. The adviser said secretaries of other ministries might also be appointed to run the companies to enhance the efficiency of the companies as well as to check corruption. Officials with access to the ministry said the Power Development Board, Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, Dhaka Electric Supply Company, Rural Electrification Board, Rural Power Company and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh under the Power Division are among the companies in for an overhaul. Petrobangla, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd, Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Limited, Bangladesh Petroleum Export Company and Bangladesh Power Company under the Energy Division are also in line for a change. Currently, there is a separate board run by the secretaries of the two divisions to steer the companies. The secretaries act as chairmen of the board, assisted by one or more officials of the companies acting as members. The presence of three members including the chairman fulfils the quorum for a board meeting to resolve a crisis. The power adviser pointed at the fact that the problem surfaces when the question of decision-making comes. As the companies are directly under the ministry, chances are always there that the relevant division or ministry will try to impose its bias. Likewise, the bureaucrats may also impose skewed decisions in collaboration with the senior company officials, he said. bdnews24.com/
