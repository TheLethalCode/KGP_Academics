<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Former communications minister Nazmul Huda Thursday questioned the transparency of trial in a special court dealing with high-profile political corruption. "Maybe for this (the question) five years of jail sentence will be increased to 14 years," Huda, also a barrister, said in the Special Judge's Court-2 housed on the premises of the parliament building. Huda, who faces broader allegations of corruption as BNP minister, made the remarks during the hearing of a case for charge framing against him and his wife, Sigma. "Is it a camera court (secret court)? Is any secret trial going on here? "The situation in the country is not normal at the moment. I am accused of corruption, but everybody is saying I am corrupt, corrupt and corrupt. It means I have been convicted even before the trial is complete," Huda told judge Amar Kumar Roy. "If anybody is here to influence the proceedings of the trial, he should go away. I can't get normal justice in this situation," continued Huda. "I know my punishment will perhaps jump to 14 years from five years in jail for uttering such words here. "I don't see any common people here in this court. Common people are not allowed to witness what is going on here. Please ensure that the witnesses are not intimidated. I demand fair justice," the former minister told the court. bdnews24.com/pc
