<TITLE> Rain threatens India v Pakistan match in Scotland </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GLASGOW, Scotland, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tuesday's one-off international between India and Pakistan is in danger of being washed out, says Cricket Scotland chief executive Roddy Smith. The arch-rivals were unable to train at the Glasgow ground on Monday because of a saturated outfield and intermittent rain. "We are just hoping that there is not enough rain over the next 12-14 hours to get the ground any wetter because it has rained so much over the last six weeks in Scotland," Smith told Reuters on Monday. "For the last four or five days it has rained every day so, although we are remaining hopeful of getting play, the ground can't take a lot more rain." Smith said he was happy about security arrangements for the match, after members of a suspected al Qaeda cell rammed a fuel-packed jeep into a terminal building at Glasgow Airport on Saturday. "We are very comfortable with the security," Smith said. "Security was always going to be tight and will be tomorrow, but it's about having to react to situations that are faced by us. "The police have been involved for five months in terms of planning the event. Everyone wants the event to go ahead smoothly and I'm sure we can control every situation, apart from the weather.
