<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Tuesday issued a verbal order asking the trial court to halt the proceedings of a narcotics case against former law minister Moudud Ahmed until July 9. Following a quashment petition filed by Moudud, a High Court vacation bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and AFM Abdur Rahman passed the order. The judges fixed July 9 for further hearing of the petition. Joint forces arrested Moudud at his home on April 14 and the police filed a case with Gulshan Police Station the same day on the allegation of possessing nine bottles of foreign wine. Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court framed charges against Moudud on June 18. Barrister Rafiq-ul Haque and Ajmalul Hossain QC moved the petition, while additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed opposed it. The counsels for Moudud argued that the trial court framed the charges under section 25B of the Special Powers Rules on an allegation of selling wine, but there was no such allegation in the first information report, charge-sheet or any other document on the case. "The chare is baseless," a lawyer argued. The additional attorney general differed. He argued there was an allegation of selling wine against Moudud. There was also accusation of possessing wine illegally against Moudud, which is a crime under anti-drugs law. Moudud's lawyers said nobody could be punished under a law, which was not used to frame charges against him. At this point, the additional attorney general sought adjournment of the petition hearing and Moudud's lawyers sought an order to halt trial-court proceedings of the case. The HC asked the additional attorney general to take steps to halt the proceedings until Monday. bdnew
