<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government is taking steps to keep markets and shopping malls open until eight in the evening, an adviser said Sunday. Power and energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury said shop-owners were suffering losses having been forced to pull their shutters down at seven in the evening in line with a government order on early closure to save electricity. Tapan spoke to the media after a meeting with the leaders of Bangladesh Shop-owners' Association at the secretariat. He said the shop-owners had been asking for permission to keep the shops open until 8:00pm. The advisory council meeting will decide the issue Saturday, he said and hoped the new timings may take place in a week from now. Tapan said the shutdown of shops and markets at 7pm saves 300-400 MW power in peak hours a day. Amir Hossain Khan, chairman of the shop-owners' association, said their sales will surge at least by 30 percent if the time is extended by an hour. Amir said they would look for ways to minimise power consumption by at least 50 percent during peak hours by, for example, lighting five bulbs in place of 10 and using one air-cooler instead of two. The government order to close all megashops, shopping malls, street shops and markets at 7pm in a bid to save power came into effect on Feb. 25 after a meeting with the shop-owners' association on February 18. The eateries, green groceries, small suburban emporia and medicine shops, however, were allowed to keep open after seven in the evening. bdnews24.
