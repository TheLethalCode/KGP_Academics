 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone has decided to add "BlackBerry" in its suite of mobile e-mail solution. BlackBerry is all-in-one wireless solution that offers e-mail with attachments, mobile phone, web browsing, organiser (calendar, addresses, tasks) along with Yahoo instant messaging and corporate data access. Some of the GP top executives use BlackBerry handsets as part of the company's internal trial. If everything goes right, GP will launch this mobile e-mail service sometimes in the fourth quarter of this year, insiders said. But the company's top management remains mum. "We are not able to comment on potential future marketing plans," Grameenphone's CEO Erik Aas told bdnews24.com. GP's current mobile e-mail platform has been provided by California-based Seven Networks. The operator is reportedly discussing with Research In Motion (RIM) about migrating to this Canadian outfit's proprietary "BlackBerry" mobile e-mail solution, sources said. "But that doesn't mean GP will scrap Seven's existing mobile e-mail platform," said a GP executive, requesting anonymity. Launched in 1999, BlackBerry was the first wireless device that synchronized with the corporate mail system so that the travelling executives did not require a different email. For individuals, a BlackBerry e-mail address is also available. BlackBerry had nearly a million users until early 2004. It jumped to two million only 10 months later and exceeded four million by 2006. GP will plug BlackBerry in its core network by linking RIM's central server either in the USA or in Canada. Subscribers of this mobile e-mail service will have to buy BlackBerry handsets or compatible devices mostly made by Nokia and Qtek. bdn
