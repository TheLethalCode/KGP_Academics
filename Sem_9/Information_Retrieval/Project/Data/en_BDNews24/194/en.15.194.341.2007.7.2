 TOKYO, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi arrived in North Korea on Monday for a three-day visit, Kyodo news agency said, amid progress toward implementing a nuclear disarmament deal with Pyongyang. Yang's visit follows one by officials from the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog last week after North Korea agreed to move ahead on the six-country disarmament agreement. North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China reached a deal on Feb. 13 under which which Pyongyang would receive energy aid, security guarantees and better diplomatic standing in return for disabling its nuclear arms programmes. The agreement then stalled in a dispute over some $25 million in North Korean funds frozen in a Macau bank under pressure from Washington. Following release of the funds last month, North Korea agreed to implement the deal, and invited an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) delegation to visit last week. IAEA official Olli Heinonen said on Saturday the U.N. nuclear watchdog had clarified how to monitor the shutdown of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility. But he stressed the timing of the long-negotiated shutdown needed consultation between North Korea and other countries in the six-party talks to iron out the details. The talks have been hosted by China in the past.
