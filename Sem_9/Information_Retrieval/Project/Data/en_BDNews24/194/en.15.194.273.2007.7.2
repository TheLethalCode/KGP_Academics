 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun Sunday filed an appeal with the High Court against the verdict of Dhaka Special Court in an anticorruption case. Court sources said Justice Md Anwarul Haque and Justice AFM Abdur Rahman on a vacation bench are likely to hear the appeal in a couple of days. Barrister Fakrul Islam and advocate Mosabbir Hasan will move the appeal against the judgment, handed down by judge Ashraf Hossain. Mamun was sentenced to three years in jail by the Special Court on June 7 for failure to submit a genuine wealth statement by the deadline to the Anticorruption Commission. In his appeal, Mamun said the secretary to the graft watchdog sent him a notice on Feb 19, asking for his wealth statement although he had no authority to do so. "The notice was sent to a wrong address. Furthermore, the Special Court disposed of the case in 63 days although the stipulated period is 60 days." Police claimed that Mamun was arrested on March 26, although he testified to court that he was arrested on Jan 31 at a friend's home in Paltan. bd
