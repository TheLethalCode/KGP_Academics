 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) The home ministry has okayed a proposal to empower deputy commissioners of 17 districts with the authority to issue and renew passports, the ministry's secretary said Wednesday. Secretary Abdul Karim said the move was meant to end pervasive harassment of citizens in the hands of the officials and the so-called middlemen in getting passports while forgery is also rampant. After a meeting at the ministry, Karim told reporters that a pilot project might begin late this month in Savar before a final decision comes into effect. Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Munshiganj, Manikganj, Chandpur, Feni, Narshingdi, Dinajpur, Bogra, Pabna, Tangail, Kushtia, Patuakhali, Cox's Bazar, Brahmanbaria and Moulvibazar districts will come under the new arrangement, Karim said. The decision came as the meeting chaired by Karim finalised the 'Passport Licencing Rules, 2007'. A ministerial committee has also been formed, assigning it to scrutinise the technical aspects of the rules, he said. The committee gets a week to submit its report. The secretary said currently 57 Bangladesh embassies and 15 regional passport offices across the country renew and issue about one lakh passports a day. He admitted that the passport seekers face tremendous harassment from the officials and the "middlemen" in the regional offices. Karim hoped the hassle would ease with the new decision. According to the rules, the designated deputy commissioners will eventually authorise one magistrate in each district to renew and issue the passports. The government has also decided to assign financial institutions such as banks in the designated districts to receive fees for passports. The secretary said Bangladeshis have to use one form for renewal and two forms for a new passport from now in line with the new rules. The services charges for both purposes have been fixed at Tk 200 per person per service, he said. The 'most urgent' passports will be issued within 72 hours, even if the police verification is delayed. The issued passport, in such cases, will be cancelled if the police report makes negative comment about the passport holder in question. The 'urgent' passports will be issued within 21 days and 'ordinary' ones in 30 days. Adults will be issued a 64-page passport for 10 years while minors will get 48-page ones with a five-year validity, Karim said. bdnew
