 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) had their second win in the super league of the 27th National Hockey Championship with a 4-1 victory over winless Mymensingh DSA at the Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Tuesday. Syed Al Masum, Jahid Bin Talib, Samshul Alam and Ajit Kumar Ghosh scored one goal apiece for BKSP while Himel netted the lone goal for Mymensigh, who lost their all four matches in the super league. In the other match of the day, Dhaka DSA played a 1-1 draw against Rajshahi at the same venue. After the barren first half, Sabbir put Rajshahi ahead in the 41st minute while Rasel Mahmud Jimi equalised the margin for Dhaka. BKSP, Dhaka and Faridpur were jointly at the top of the point table with seven points each, but the finalists will be decided on Wednesday after the group's last match between Dhaka and Faridpur.
