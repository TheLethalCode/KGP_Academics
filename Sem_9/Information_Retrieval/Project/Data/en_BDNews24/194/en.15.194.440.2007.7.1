 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  A Supreme Court lawyer Sunday said he turned down a request to conduct the appeal of Bangabandhu murder convict retired major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. Advocate Sarwar Ahmed told reporters that Supreme Court deputy registrar Mafizul Islam had proposed him to be a state defence lawyer to conduct Mohiuddin's appeal. He said he was feeble to independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and could not stand in court to appeal against the conviction of Mohiuddin who deported from Los Angeles on June 18. Mohiuddin filed an appeal from Dhaka Central Jail with the Supreme Court on June 24 for approval to move against the High Court death sentence. On June 25, the execution of the death sentence was stayed. The High Court on April 30, 2001 sentenced 12 people including Mohiuddin to death in the case. bdnew
