 DAMASCUS, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria on Tuesday described as absurd a travel ban imposed by the United States on Syrian officials who Washington accuses of undermining the Lebanese government. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem said the move to stop the Syrian officials from entering the United States "did not need comment because of its absurdity". "American statements against Syria only show the failure of American policy in the region ... especially in Iraq," he told reporters in Damascus. US President George W. Bush on Friday banned 10 Syrian officials and Lebanese politicians, whom Washington accuses of undermining the Lebanese government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, from entering the United States. The list of Syrian officials includes Assef Shawkat, Syria's director of military intelligence and brother-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad. It also included Hisham Ikhtiyar, adviser to Assad, and Brigadier General Jama'a Jama'a. The United States, a strong backer of the Siniora government, has called on Syria to stop fomenting instability which it says Damascus is creating in Lebanon. Lebanese opposition parties, including factions allied to Damascus, have declared Siniora's government illegitimate. The opposition, including Hezbollah, are demanding veto power in government, a demand Siniora has refused to grant.
