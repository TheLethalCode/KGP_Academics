 Noakhali, July 2 (bdnews24.com)Do it right or just leave. It was an instruction by local government adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal to government officials, when he addressed a meeting in Noakhali Monday. "You must work properly when you are in charge, or you may just leave," Iqbal said. The adviser came down hard on massive corruption, mismanagement and the politicisation of institutions, in his speech to the meeting at Noakhali Shilpakala Academy. He said past governments had made national institutions ineffective and controversial. "Through reform, the present government has succeeded in restoring people's confidence in national institutions. The caretaker government took over at a time when the country was witnessing serious crises in law and order, unbridled corruption, chaos in the garments sector and plummeting foreign trade," the adviser said. "The patriotic efforts of the army are providing necessary support for the government, who are fully supporting the Election Commission in their efforts to prepare an acceptable voter list. This is a precondition of holding free and fair elections," Iqbal said. "All conceivable steps are being taken to control the prices of market essentials and there is greater stability in the garments sector. An initiative is also underway to create an effective national birth registration programme." The LGRD adviser also spoke on the importance of maintaining Bangladesh's cultural heritage. "The current administration has taken measures to preserve the memory of Bir Shresthhas, the highest gallantry award winners, as well as language movement martyrs," Iqbal added. After the meeting, the adviser Iqbal laid the foundation stones of Begumganj Cultural Academy, Choumohoni Public Hall and Sonaimuri Upazila Complex. bdnews24.com/
