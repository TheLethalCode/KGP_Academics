<TITLE> Govt may loosen ban on politics soon: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) - The emergency government may take a quick decision to relax the ban on indoor politics, an adviser said Sunday. Law adviser Mainul Hosein said a decision might come through the home ministry "very soon" after a discussion with the chief adviser and other advisers. The probable move would be designed to help complete reforms to the political parties, he said. Also, it will create scope to move ahead with the plan of holding new elections, the adviser said. "The political parties are talking about their reforms at home, but they are not allowed to do that in offices. We are now considering to draw a line so that they can discuss politics in their offices as well," Mainul told reporters in his office. "But it won't mean full freedom for political activity." The adviser thinks there is enough pace in the reform efforts of the political parties. "It's not an easy thing for the reformists to do their job so easily. They are working to pull their parties out of a long practiced tradition. They need to call council meetings to finalise that process," he said. Mainul said it was not possible to bring any big change in a hurry. "The parties are talking about the elections. It's not possible to complete all reforms before the elections. But it's good that a process has begun," he said. Mainul, however, said a corrupt person would not be spared even if he belongs to the reformists. bdnews24.c
