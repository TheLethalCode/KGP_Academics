 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)Stocks ended almost flat Tuesday amid last-hour profit taking in mutual funds, cement and some financial stocks while power, insurance and the banking sector gained due to buying pressure. "Such ups and downs are normal. A correction is very likely for the market as most of the blue-chip stocks are still a little overpriced," said Saiful Islam, chief of Equity Partners Securities. The DGEN or general index slipped 4.13 points or 0.18 percent to 2186.32. The DSI or all-share price index ended almost flat at 1796.58, down 0.15 points or 0.008 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip index fell 6.17 points or 0.32 percent to 1891.38. Gainers however ruled losers 115 to 80. A total of 17 issues held steady. Turnover however dropped to Tk 1.99 billion from Monday's Tk 2.05 billion on the Dhaka Stock Exchange. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange finished lower amid profit-taking in mutual funds, ICT, cement, pharma and chemical stocks. Turnover on the CSE also declined to Tk 316.71 million from Tk 396.92 million. Of the issues traded, 46 gained, 50 lost and nine held steady. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Southeast Bank, Summit Power, Shahjalal Bank and EXIM Bank ruled the turnover table on the DSE. Power Grid (registering Tk 210.53 million in turnover) rose 1.28 percent to Tk 610 on the hopes of growth in the power transmission network.
