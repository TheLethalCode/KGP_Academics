<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Members of a high-powered taskforce dealing with serious crimes Sunday questioned the wife and the mother-in-law of Tarique Rahman, officials said. The members of the taskforce of the national committee on serious crimes went to the Dhanmondi residence of Syeda Iqbalmand Banu, and quizzed her and her daughter Jobaida Rahman. Tarique's counsel Ahmed Azam Khan told reporters that the officials stayed at the house for one and a half hours and inquired about Tarique's wealth. The taskforce is investigating the matters to find out if Tarique's wealth statement submitted to the Anticorruption Commission is true. Khan said that his client's wealth statement mentioned that Jobaida inherited a good amount of property from her father. "The officials mainly wanted to know about her part. We've cooperated with them fully," Khan said. Asked if the officials seized anything from the house, Khan did not give a direct reply but said they would cooperate with them if they need something. Four officials of the taskforce including ACC deputy director Md Zahirul Huda and Major Redwan Ahmed Khan were present during the question time. "We are here to verify Tarique's wealth statement. It's the part of our investigation," Huda later told reporters. On whether they will question Tarique who is now in Dhaka Central Jail, Huda said: "We've already obtained permission from court to do that. We'll go to the jail anytime to get answers from him." bdnews
