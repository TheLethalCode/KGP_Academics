 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks finished upbeat Thursday after the cement sector heavyweight Lafarge Surma Cement and its counterparts rallied across the board. Insurance, mutual funds, non-bank financial institutions and engineering stocks added extra pace to the rise. "It's not clear to us why the cement shares start rallying suddenly. There is no news regarding the sector as a whole or of any individual company, including ours," a senior official of Lafarge Surma, wishing anonymity, told bdnews24.com. Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, who also saw no disclosure from the cement sector, linked the rise to high demand. "It reflects high demand in the market. Share prices of various sectors are going up amid high demand among investors," he said. Insurance stocks continued rallying on speculation of increase in capital bases although profit taking took place in some issues. Nine insurance companies rose between 9 percent and 15 percent. Most non-bank financial institutions, mutual funds, multinationals and engineering sector shares moved up significantly. But profit taking pushed banking stocks down. The DGEN or general index climbed 10.73 points or 0.49 percent to 2198.73, a record high. The DSI or all-share price index gained 7.27 points or 0.40 percent to 1806.14. The DSE-20 blue chip index finished almost flat, adding 0.77 points or 0.04 percent. Turnover rose slightly to Tk 1.61 billion from Wednesday's Tk 1.60 billion on the DSE. Of the issues traded, 130 gained, 71 declined and 14 held steady. Except the CSE-30 index, all major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange closed higher. Turnover however dropped to Tk 230.53 million from Tk 272.12 million. Gainers beat losers 66 to 43. Seven issues finished unchanged. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Summit Power, BRAC Bank, EXIM Bank and Lafarge Surma Cement topped the turnover table on the DSE. Power Grid registered Tk 80.58 million in turnover but dropped 1.24 percent to Tk 596.5 as investors locked in gains. Summit Power rose 2.05 percent to Tk 933 on anticipation of better earnings after it recently won a contract to build four small power plants. Profit taking drove BRAC Bank and EXIM Bank shares to end lower. BRAC Bank slumped 1.59 percent to Tk 742. EXIM Bank fell 1.83 percent to Tk 414.75. Lafarge Surma Cement, a fifth top issue in turnover, surged 7.28 percent to Tk 412.5. Ambee Pharma, Padma Cement and Meghna Cement led the gainers.
