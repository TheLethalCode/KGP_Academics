 Dhaka, July 03 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court has adjourned the hearing of a writ petition, filed by advocate Sigma Huda, until Wednesday. Advocate Huda and her husband are accused of taking Tk 2.4 crore in bribe from Mir Zahir Hossain, a roads contractor. Sigma, the wife of former communication minister Nazmul Huda, is claiming immunity from arrest and detention due to her status as a special United Nations reporter on human trafficking. The petition claims that Article 6 of the United Nations Convention states that a UN rapporteur cannot be detained or arrested. bdnew
