 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Correspondent Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Global telecoms heavyweights say microcredit may provide loan without collaterals but it does not meet the rural people's total financial needs in the developing countries. Vodafone along with Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks have urged telecoms and banking regulatory reforms to encourage fund transfer by mobile phones instead. They believe it will transform access to financial services in countries lacking banking networks. "Lack of access to banking services is currently forcing people to rely on a cash-based economy with little security, a more casual informal labour market and a lower tax base for governments," said the reportThe Transformational Potential of M-Transactions. It expects regulatory reforms will have widespread impact on both the economic development of countries and the financial security of millions of people currently without access to banking services. "Microfinance institutions do not offer an array of banking services, and in particular do not provide basic transactions services (such as cash deposits and withdrawals or the ability to pay utility bills)," noted the report's author Dianne Coyle. She said Grameen Bank's success of microfinance in terms of reach amongst low-income households testifies to their appetite for financial services. "And certainly, technological innovation offers the hope of reducing the cost of serving poor customers." Afro-Asian mobile transaction or "mtransaction" pilot projects during last two years reveal the potential for mobile phones to deliver basic financial services in developing countries. The findings show how these services provide the first real opportunity for many poorer people to get on to a formal "banking ladder" with benefits including reduced threat of crime, time saving and secure savings opportunities. "However, existing banking regulation is currently inappropriate for the growth of m-transaction schemes," observes the report and calls the "regulators to ensure they do not restrict commercial experimentation or limit the schemes to sub-economical scale." The study suggests m-transaction operators should have access to the clearing system of national banking operations. Because, m-transactions "is also expected to introduce significant improvements in financial services, such as easier and cheaper international payments especially for remittances home, or reduced risk in domestic payments by near real-time transfers." Remittances dwarf official aid flows for certain recipient countries and are now of the same order of magnitude as foreign direct investment for developing countries as a whole, it said. The average size of a remittance payment from the US to Mexico in 2003 was just over $220. The average cost of sending $300 was then $15, down from about $30 in 1999. Competition has helped further reduction but other costs related to such cross-border transaction remain high. "It's possible that m-transactions would introduce the scope for significant cost reductions on typically quite small transactions." The report concludes that financial services are critical for economic development and inclusive financial services for the "unbanked" are essential for poverty reduction. Mobile transactions inherit two regulatory environments  telecoms and banking. The study suggests continuing dialogue between these regulators "if the potential of mobile transactions is to be realised." It has detected three key regulatory hurdles  restrictions on deposit-taking, restrictions on distribution and consumer protection regulation. The report said at present regulators can turn a blind eye to m-transactions on the grounds that they are not material in scale, or alternatively to introduce limits on transaction size to mitigate any risks. However, these options are unlikely to be sustainable, or worse still could constrain the business models for m-transactions to operate at an inefficiently small scale. The paper suggests the need to consider the basic principles of regulation in each area for assessing if the forms of intervention which have grown around the banking industry are appropriate for m-transactions. It suggests a detailed policy agenda for both banking and telecoms regulators in order to facilitate growth in the market and encourage new entrants and innovation. bdn
