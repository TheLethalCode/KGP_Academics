 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP lawmaker Ali Asgar Loby's wife Khusnud Asgar was sent into custody in jail in a corruption case Monday. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin of the Special Judge's Court-3 ordered Loby's wife to be jailed and set the date of charge framing against the Loby couple for July 8. Gulshan police arrested Loby's wife Khusnud on June 26 at LabAid Hospital where she was under treatment. Since then she had been under treatment at the same hospital under police supervision. On grounds of her illness, Khusnud's lawyers appealed to court to defer the hearing for framing charges against her. Doctors have said she needs further treatment. They also appealed to exempt her from appearing in court in the case. The court rejected the appeal of the lawyers and ordered Khusnud to jail. Deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission Shirin Parveen filed the case with Gulshan Police Station on March 21 against Loby and his wife for allegedly earning by unfair means or withholding information about Tk 27.66 crore. bdnews24.
