 LONDON (bdnews24.com/AFP)- British police were questioning Monday suspects in three failed terror attacks and hunting for others involved in the Al Qaeda-linked attempted car bombings that have put the country on maximum alert. Police have so far detained five people in connection with the discovery of two Mercedes cars laden with gas canisters and nails in London's entertainment district on Friday and a blazing jeep that rammed into Glasgow airport's main terminal on Saturday. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, on the job less than week, was due to give an update on the investigation to MPs in the lower House of Commons later on Monday. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who himself only succeeded Tony Blair on Wednesday, told the BBC on Sunday: "It is clear that we are dealing in general terms with people who are associated with Al Qaeda in a number of incidents that have happened across the world." Brown added that Britain "will not yield, we will not be intimidated." Police anti-terror chief Peter Clarke told reporters in Glasgow that the investigation was "extremely fast-moving" and added that the links between the three attacks in London and one in Glasgow were becoming "ever clearer." Officers were searching properties in Glasgow, Liverpool, and Newcastle-under-Lyme, and also carried out a controlled explosion on a suspect car at a hospital where one of the Glasgow suspects was being treated for burns. British media outlets said that between one and three suspects were still at large, with Sky News and the BBC also reporting that most of the people arrested were not British. Media reports added that two of the five in custody were doctors. A spokesman for Scotland Yard declined to comment on the reports. Scotland Yard did, however, confirm that a 26-year-old man and 27-year-old woman detained on the M6 motorway near Liverpool were being interviewed at a London police station. Officials have refused to comment on a report that two people arrested on the motorway were the drivers of the two Mercedes cars. Several British newspapers published gruesome photos of one of the Glasgow jeep's passengers, the suspect later taken to hospital, writhing in pain on the ground outside the airport with severe burns. They also urged the government to not rush anti-terror legislation through parliament, with the Daily Telegraph warning in its editorial: "The immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate." The Independent, a left-wing paper, took a similar line, declaring that it "is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought." Before taking office last week Brown had come out in support of extending the detention period without charge for terror suspects to 90 days, a controversial measure the previous Labour government failed to get enacted. The attacks spurred the government to raise the security alert level to "critical" for the first time since August, and about a week before the second anniversary of the July 7, 2005, suicide bombings on London's transport network that left 52 commuters dead. "Critical" is the highest on a five-level scale, and means another attack could be imminent. The British terror alert also triggered alarm abroad. The United States beefed up security at airports following the attempted attacks in Britain, while Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Sunday that more US air marshals were being deployed on flights to Britain. A terminal at New York's John F. Kennedy airport was also briefly evacuated Sunday, as authorities investigated a suspicious package, US media reported. US President George W. Bush on Sunday hailed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's "very strong response" to the attempted car bombs during remarks at his family residence in the northeastern state of Maine where he was hosting talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In Paris, French Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie called a meeting with security chiefs to discuss events in Britain, while UN chief Ban Ki-moon said "no cause or belief can justify such acts of terrorism." Back in London, Terminal 3 of London's Heathrow Airport, the world's biggest international air hub, was briefly closed late Sunday after a "suspect package" was found, an airport spokesman told AFP. Glasgow airport's main terminal, meanwhile, re-opened on Sunday with limited service. Liverpool's John Lennon airport was temporarily closed Saturday night. Concern focused Sunday on a concert in memory of Princess Diana at Wembley Stadium, where more than 60,000 people flocked to a star-studded performance on what would have been her 46th birthday, 10 years after her death. The concert went off without incident. At Wimbledon, systematic checks were being conducted on all vehicles entering the car parks and on everyone coming into the tennis tourname
