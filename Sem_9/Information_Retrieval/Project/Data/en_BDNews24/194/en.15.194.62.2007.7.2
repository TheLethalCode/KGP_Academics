 (bdnews24.com/BBC)Air passengers and rail commuters are to bear the brunt of heightened security following the three attempted bombings in London and Glasgow Airport. Cars, including taxis, are being banned from approaching terminals at many airports, and vehicle searches at train stations are being increased. The move is likely to cause disruption to national and international travel as the summer holiday season begins. Police said the increased presence would act as a "visible deterrent". The UK moved to its highest level of terror alert - critical - after a Jeep Cherokee crashed into the doors of Glasgow Airport's main terminal and burst into flames on Saturday afternoon. The incident came a day after two cars loaded with petrol, gas cylinders and nails were found in London's West End. 'Armed response patrols' Security has been increased across the country, with travellers expected to experience the worst disruption. Scotland Yard said there would be a heightened police presence in the capital at mainline stations and on the streets to "act as a highly visible reassurance".

BAA said access to forecourts and drop-off zones at terminals across the country would be "severely restricted". A spokesman said people who usually drive up to entrances were being advised to use public transport or to use short-stay car parks. British Transport Police said police patrols were being stepped up across the rail network and random searches on vehicles approaching stations and passengers were being increased. A spokesman added: "We continue to work closely with our colleagues from Home Office forces to ensure high visibility patrols in and around stations. "Passengers and station staff have been briefed to be extra vigilant and report any suspicious activity immediately." Security is also being increased at the Wimbledon Championships, in south-west London, which are resuming after a day's break.
