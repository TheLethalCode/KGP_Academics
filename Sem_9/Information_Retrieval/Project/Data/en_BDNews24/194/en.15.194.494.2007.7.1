<TEXT>
 Chittagong, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue will target five additional tax zones, including Chittagong and Rangpur, from July 5, apart from the drive to identify new taxpayers in Dhaka. NBR chairman Badiur Rahman announced the new drive from Chittagong Customs House. He spoke at a function marking the separation of Chittagong Customs House into two branches. The restructuring separates the Customs House import from the Customs House export. "I feel this new change will bring dynamism into their respective roles," Rahman said. "The decision has been taken to keep pace with modern business practices." Rahman added that 28 teams would work in six tax zones to bring new businessmen into the income tax system. In addition, Dhaka's survey team will increase to 20. The latest drive will cover the city corporations of Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Barisal, and a separate tax zone of Rangpur. Rahman urged income tax-liable businessmen to come forward voluntarily and said: "In Dhaka, 18,000 new taxpayers have been identified. Those who fail to take the opportunity to register by July 31 will face stern legal action." "Defaulters will be fined up to 250 percent of their tax bill and face possible legal action. Some cases have already been filed," he said. Of the country's total revenue, 30 percent comes through Chittagong Customs House, he said. He hoped that the Customs Houses' new form would increase revenue earnings by up to 10 percent. The NBR chairman called on customs officials not to treat businessmen as their adversaries. "Old habits involving bribes and 'commissions' to facilitate the process of tax collections should be replaced by a system involving mutual respect." "If our officials are found involved in corrupt practices punitive action will be taken against them," he said. During a question-and-answer session, the NBR chairman said: "The tarnished image of Chittagong Customs House has been overcome." He hopes that the realisation of duty would be more transparent after the separation of the import and export branches. Under the new system, there will be two commissioners for the import and export branches. bdnews24.
