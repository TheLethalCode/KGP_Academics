 4RAMALLAH, 5 July West Bank (bdnews24.com/AFP) - - Palestinian civil servants began receiving their first full salaries in 17 months on Wednesday, keen to start paying debts that piled up during a crushing Israeli economic boycott. Relieved Palestinians queued en masse outside banks, checking to see whether their names were on a list of those to be paid, or drawing money from cash machines. The Western-backed Palestinian government based in the West Bank has vowed not to pay allies of the Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip, which overran their Fatah rivals loyal to the Palestinian Authority nearly three weeks ago. The more than 160,000 employees of the Palestinian Authority have received only partial salaries since March 2006, as a result of Israeli and Western economic boycotts slapped on successive administrations led by Hamas, which is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Israel and the West. The boycott was eased after president Mahmud Abbas sacked the Hamas-led government following the Islamists' deadly Gaza takeover and installed an emergency cabinet headed by internationally respected economist Salam Fayyad. "This is the first time I received my complete salary in more than a year," said a grinning 51-year-old Jasser Sbai, who works in the agriculture ministry in the West Bank political capital of Ramallah. "Unfortunately most of this salary will go to the electricity company and shops because I owe them too much," he added, surrounded by more than 50 Palestinians queueing to draw out money, with dozens more further down the road. The salaries were paid three days after Israel transferred 118 million dollars to the new emergency government based in Ramallah, as part of hundreds of millions in tax duties owed to the Palestinian Authority. Israel froze monthly transfers of 50 to 60 million dollars worth of customs duties, levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israel, in February 2006 after the general election win by Hamas. Fayyad told a press conference in Ramallah that 31,000 employees, 23,000 of them in the military and 8,000 civilians, were not paid on Wednesday as they began work in late 2005 -- only months before the Western and Israeli boycott took effect. He said that a further 1,000 civil servants, about three percent of the total and all of them in Gaza, were not paid because they did not pledge support to the Palestinian Authority. Hamas charged that 23,000 civil servants are being boycotted because of links to the Islamist movement. "The Fayyad government's decision not to give thousands of employees their salaries enforces the political and geographical separation of Palestinian people," spokesman Sami Abu Zurhi told AFP in Gaza City. Palestinians finally receiving their full salaries were all smiles after getting their hands on the money, although the problems they have accumulated over the past year are far from over. "The problem is how to solve what happened in previous months. We need another month's salary to cover all of our debts," said Ruba Hamad, who has an outstanding rent payment of 3,500 dollars for one year. At a branch of the Arab Bank in Gaza City, hundreds of people waited in two queues outside. Ashraf Shada, a 40-year-old doctor, had been waiting at the Palestine Bank since early morning. "I am very happy because this is the first time I get a complete salary for more than a year. I hope things will carry on like this," he said. But not everyone was pleased. Mohammed, a 27-year-old policeman, waited for hours outside a bank in Gaza City, but did not find his name on the list of those due to be paid. "We followed (president Mahmud) Abbas's decision not to work (after the Hamas takeover) and I was shocked not to see my name on the list," he said, sad and angry.
