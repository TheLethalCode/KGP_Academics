<TITLE> HC order slims Sigma Huda's immunity from arrest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Wednesday rejected Sigma Huda's appeal seeking immunity from arrest and detention as special UN rapporteur on human trafficking. But the HC vacation bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Ashfaqul Islam said the trial court may consider her appeal for immunity if she applies for it. Meanwhile, a special five-member vacation bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, stayed for three weeks an HC order that had stalled any move to arrest Sigma. A corruption case was filed with Dhanmondi Police Station in March against her and her husband on an allegation of taking Tk 2.4 crore in bribe by cheque from Mir Zahir Hossain, a roads contractor. In its order, the HC had asked Sigma to surrender to the trial court in eight weeks from June 6, but Wednesday's order by the Appellate Division slimmed scope for the wife of former communications minister Nazmul Huda to duck arrest. "Two simultaneous court orders cleared the way for police and other officers to arrest Sigma Huda if they have to," a lawyer told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. Moving Sigma's writ petition in the High Court, Ajmalul Hossain, QC argued that a UN rapporteur is entitled to immunity from arrest and detention in line with article 6 of the United Nations Convention. He also cited some international decisions of the apex courts in different countries to back up his defence. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed opposed the argument. He said she was not entitled to such immunity under law in Bangladesh. On June 6, the High Court asked Sigma to surrender to the magistrate's court and directed law-enforcement agencies not to arrest her for eight weeks. bd
