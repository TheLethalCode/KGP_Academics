 Yemen, July-5 [bdnews24.com/AFP] The suicide bombing was the deadliest against foreign nationals since the USS Cole attack in 2000 Yemeni authorities have arrested dozens of people with suspected links to a suicide bombing that killed seven Spanish tourists and two Yemenis two days ago, security sources have said.
