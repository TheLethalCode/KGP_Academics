<TITLE> Sri Lanka airport to resume night flights </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's only international airport is to resume night flights for the first time since air raids by Tamil Tiger rebels forced their suspension seven weeks ago, an airport official said on Sunday. "We have permitted all the airlines to operate 24 hours a day from today," the duty manager at Bandaranaike International Airport said by telephone, saying he was not authorised to give his name. "We are satisfied that the security situation is normal and we have permitted each and every airline to operate at night. The air force will provide all the facilities to operate." But it was not immediately clear when the first night flight would take place as airlines needed time to reschedule, the airport official said. Defence officials say the air force has revamped anti-aircraft defences to deal with the threat of attacks by the rebels, who have mounted a series of raids under cover of darkness using light aircraft smuggled into the island. In one attack, the rebels bombed an air force base adjacent to Bandaranaike International Airport, which is 20 miles (32 km) north of the capital Colombo. A new chapter in a two-decade civil war between the state and Tamil Tiger rebels is causing wider worries. The war has killed nearly 70,000 people since 1983 -- around 4,500 of those since last year. There are near daily land and sea battles, ambushes or air raids, mostly confined to the north and east where the Tigers want to establish an independent state. But there have also been a spate of attacks and bombings in Colombo. Tourist arrivals fell 40 percent in May from a year earlier, which the industry blamed on the conflict, while uncertainty stemming from the war is prompting some to put investment in the $23-billion economy on hold.
