<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League party members reacted for the first time Sunday to presidium member Abdur Razzak's reform proposal. Several AL activists and mid-level leaders made hostile remarks about 'reformists' as Sheikh Hasina and AL leaders and workers gathered to pray for AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim's mother Achhiya Khatun. Senior leaders of the party who were present made no comment when some AL workers went so far as to demand the expulsion of reformist leaders. Ward commissioner and AL activist Sahida Tareq Deepti criticised reform tendencies and said those who create chaos in the name of reform should be excluded from the party. Citing Abdur Razzak, Amir Hossain Amu and Suranjit Sengupta, AL activist Tareq Ahmed said, "These three leaders have no election committee in their respective districts. Still they are making big statements about joint leadership." As more activists joined in the demand to exclude the reformists, AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said: "This is not the place to address such an issue." Presidium member Sajeda Chowdhury said, "Razzak can have his personal reform opinion. Only the council will decide for the party." "The government is suggesting reforms but is trying to force it on us. This is miserable," said presidium member Motia Chowdhury. bdnews24.c
