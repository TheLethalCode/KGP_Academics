<TEXT>
 Bandarban, July 2 (bdnews24.com) A spate of public criticism has apparently compelled a local Awami League leader to step down from the chairmanship of a local anticorruption committee of citizens, officials said. Kazi Mujibur Rahman, the district's AL secretary, was made chairman of the committee Saturday but he quit a day later for "personal reasons". "I have resigned purely because of personal reasons," Rahman told bdnews24.com. There are numerous allegations against Rahman for his so-called involvement in grabbing land of tribal people and abetting public rioting in the district. The official anti-graft watchdog Anticorruption Commission is encouraging local administration to form such citizens' committee across the country to fight pervasive corruption. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury personally advocated such committees during his months of countrywide anticorruption campaign to build awareness among people. Shawkat Rashid Chowdhury, Sadar upazila nirbahi officer, said Sunday the committee was formed on the basis of a list of people made by the Bandarban district headquarters. Vice chairman of the committee Laxmipada Paul, also a BNP leader, took over the chairmanship after Rahman's resignation. The other members of the committee are retired primary school headmaster Hossain Ahmad Master, Bazar Jaam-e-Masjid Khatib Ehsanul Haque Al Muin, local NGO activist Hlasing Nue and municipal BNP secretary Islam Company's wife Quamrunnahar. bdnews24.c
