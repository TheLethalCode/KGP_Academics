 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The caretaker government has taken 'firm' steps to privatise non-profitable state-run companies and other businesses, according to a letter from the Privatisation Commission. To implement the government efforts, the Privatisation Commission last week sent letters to ministries and divisions seeking lists of non-profitable companies and other businesses. An official with the Privatisation Commission, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "Efforts are underway to make a new list to hand the non-profitable companies and service providers to the private sector." "The initiative was taken last week by writing letters to all ministries and divisions," the official said. "With the aim of strengthening the roles of private sector in the national economy, to establish the private sector as the driving force of development and to improve the deteriorating condition of the state-run companies, the government has taken firm steps for privatisaion," the letter says. "The government is implementing necessary economic reform programmes in line with the present free-market economy and changed demand," the letter adds. The letter reminded secretaries of all ministries to send proposals to the commission for privatising the government-owned companies. Since 1993, 69 non-profitable state-run companies in textiles, jute and chemicals sectors have been priviatised, according to Bangladesh Economic Review 2007. bdnews24.c
