<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)- Though most newspapers reported the outbreak of bird flu with due importance, some failed to rise to the occasion, a Unicef official said in Dhaka Monday. Unicef communications officer Shamsuddin Ahmed's remarks came at a press briefing and were based following a review of reports published within two weeks of the government's declaring the spread of bird flu March 22. The summary said that though almost all newspapers had published more than one news item in the first week, the flow decreased in the second. However, awareness campaigns and educational matters increased from the second week. Some newspapers, it said, had failed to present proper information. Confusion was created in the public mind as to the number of chickens culled because of different figures in different newspapers. Some newspapers had wrongly described the disease as "Ranikhet" in addition to providing contradictory information, the summary added. At the briefing in Unicef's Dhaka Sheraton Hotel office, the official presented a comparative picture of Bangladesh and other countries following bird flu epidemics. Analysing the situation, Unicef said that bird flu was not a distant possibility, but already existed in Bangladesh, creating a threat to the country's rapidly expanding poultry industry as well as to human health and environment. Bird flu, avian influenza and avian flu are names of the same disease, Unicef said. In 2003, the disease started spreading from hens and ducks to humans. 309 persons were afflicted by the diseases in 12 countries till May 31,2007. Of them 186 people, or 60 per cent of those afflicted, died. In 1918, about six crore people died of the disease. Though it could not be confirmed whether the virus spreads from human to human, such a possibility has not been ruled out. No vaccine or medication against the disease has still been invented. bdnews
