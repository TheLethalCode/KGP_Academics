 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  One month on from the caretaker government's budget announcement, prices of essential commodities on the market are on an upward curve. A bdnews24.com survey of Mirpur section-11 market, Karwan Bazar and Hatirpool Bazaar Friday revealed that though the supply of vegetables in these markets is abundant, their prices remain high. The price of green chili, however, has come down by almost half to sell at Tk 45 to 50 a kg from Tk 100 to 110 last week. Keeping with the rising cost of rice, the price of lentils, fish and meat have also gone up. Dano milk powder has also become pricier this week. The survey also revealed that the price of some goods varies considerably from market to market. Hilsha is still selling at exorbitant prices beyond the reach of common people. Though the government has banned the export and hoarding of hilsha for six months the prices are yet to ease. On Friday morning, hilsha was selling at Tk 300 to 400 a kg at Hatirpool Bazar. A big size Hilsha still costs Tk 600 to 1000. Police constable Nasim who came to Hatirpool Bazaar to buy Hilsha told bdnews24.com, "Hearing the government decision we thought the price of hilsha would come down. But now I find no reflection of it on the market." In Hatirpool bazar one kg of shrimp was selling for Tk 180 to 260, rui for Tk 160 to 220, telapia Tk 130 to 150 and pangas Tk 70 to 90. One kg of beef was selling at Tk 170 to 180, mutton at Tk 220 to 250 and broiler chicken at Tk 85 to 95. One kg of Dano sold at Tk 384 to 390 last week but this week it has leapt to Tk 420. "The company has increased the price of a five-pound container of Dano in the last one week by Tk 100. The price of other brands of powder milk did not register such a rise," Shamsul Islam Tarun, owner of Bhai Bhai General Store at Hatirpool Bazaar, told bdnews24.com. Though Mirpur-11 market and Karwan Bazar had Dhaka City Corporation price boards on display, they showed no prices. In Hatirpool market, prices were written on the price board but the sellers did not comply with them, charging shoppers higher prices. bdnews2
