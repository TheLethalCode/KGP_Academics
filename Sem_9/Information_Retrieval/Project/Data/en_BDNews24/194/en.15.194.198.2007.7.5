 TURIN, Italy, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Cinquecento lovers came from around Europe on Wednesday to celebrate the rebirth of a tiny Italian automotive icon. Members of Cinquecento clubs from across Europe parked their lovingly preserved cars in a huge square in Fiat's hometown to take part in the festivities surrounding the launch of a new version of the model on its 50th anniversary. Fiat unveils the new Cinquecento -- which means '500' in Italian -- at a huge ceremony on the banks of the River Po later on Wednesday. "It will be like the arrival of a nephew," said Parisi Santo, whose blue car was parked next to a dozen others. Although the only images they have seen of the new car have been those on the Internet, the enthusiasm showed by Santo and others was nearly as strong as the one felt for the old one.

"It's a symbol of Italy's rebirth," said Giacomo Monastra, owner of a white 1968 model. After 18 years on the road, the Cinquecento went out of production in 1975. That has helped drive a passion for the car that is fuelled by nostalgia for a golden era of Italian film, fashion, food and la dolce vita. Monastra said his desire to own one came from memories of his grandfather driving one to work every day in Sicily. "Its fantastic," said the 23-year-old engineering student. "Its the most beautiful thing." However excited Santo might be about the arrival of the new model, the old one will always be first in his heart. "It will be difficult to push it aside," he said. "It is the only one that motorized Ital
