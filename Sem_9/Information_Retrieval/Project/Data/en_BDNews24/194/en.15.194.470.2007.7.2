 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has decided to hire two Boeing-747s from Phuket Airlines of Thailand for carrying hajj pilgrims, an adviser said Sunday. As the lowest bidder, the airline will now get the job, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said after a purchase committee meeting. The committee approved the plan to hire the planes, he said. Biman Bangladesh Airlines recently floated tenders, inviting proposals for carrying 20,000 pilgrims. Azizul said the government would have to pay $7 million for taking the planes from the Thai airline. The meeting also gave the green light to import 25,000 bags of granular urea fertiliser, appointment of two international consultancy firms for development of the railway sector, fixing of new premium for import of oil from Kuwait Petroleum Corporation in July-December and installation of 500-line telephone exchange in Chittagong. bdnews24.com/
