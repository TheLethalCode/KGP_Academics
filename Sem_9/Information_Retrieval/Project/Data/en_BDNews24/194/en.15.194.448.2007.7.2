<TITLE> Israel releases Palestinian funds </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 (bdnews24.com/BBC)Israel has begun releasing tens of millions of dollars in tax funds that it has withheld from the Palestinian Authority during a 17-month boycott. The first transfer was of 500m shekels ($117m), Israeli officials said. The move follows the dissolution of a Palestinian national unity government that was led by the Hamas group, which refuses to recognise Israel. PA President Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the government after Hamas routed his Fatah movement in Gaza. Israel has pledged to support the emergency cabinet of Mr Abbas, operating from the West Bank, in opposition to Hamas, which controls Gaza. The freezing of the funds, coupled with a Western economic boycott, crippled the Palestinian Authority, depriving key workers of pay. Mr Abbas's government says it will be able to make salary payments this week. Six months Israeli officials announced the first transfer had been made on Sunday and Palestinian officials confirmed they had received it. Israel says there will be a further transfer within the next few days. Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said: "Israel is committed to help strengthening the new [Palestinian] government and to co-operate fully both in the financial and security realms." A Palestinian official said: "Israel affirmed to us that they would transfer tax duties, amounting to $50m to $60m every month, and that they will also transfer all the money owed from before." However, the exact amount of tax funding held by Israel since it froze transfers on 1 February last year is in dispute. Palestinian officials say it is more than $700m while Israel puts the figure closer to $500m. It says only $300-$400m can be transferred as a court order has frozen some money to cover Palestinian debts. The timeframe is about six months, an Israeli official said. Hamas has labelled the money transfer "political blackmail", intended to divide Palestinians further. Israel collects customs duties on behalf of the Palestinians and the tax funds make up about 50% of the authority's budget. Israel has also stepped up air strikes on Gaza. Three strikes on Saturday killed seven Palestinians, including a senior member of the Islamic Jihad militant gro
