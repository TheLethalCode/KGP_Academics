 PARIS, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Women dressed like maharajahs, Snow White's Prince Charming, chamberlains or the tsarevitch graced the runway of Jean-Paul Gaultier who treated fashion royalty with a fairytale haute couture show on Wednesday. Revisiting the cross-gender theme which has made his name, the French designer dressed female models with embroidered tail coats, stretch trousers and seven-league boots, and hung crowns made of hair nonchalantly on the sides of their heads. The white-tiled ballroom of Gaultier's headquarters was engulfed in blackness to the sound of 'Someday My Prince Will Come' as projectors revealed a female prince languishing with love in a gold and red velvet throne at the end of the runway. Saudi princesses and Spanish film maker Pedro Almodovar, who used Gaultier's extravagant costumes in his 1993 media satire 'Kika', smiled appreciatively from the front row as model Lily Cole presented a dark blue velvet coat with multi-coloured flowers embroidered on the hems and protruding epaulettes. Gaultier's 'Prince of the Night' sported a sleeveless black satin gown slit to the thigh with a satin army coat and cap, while 'Prince Hereditary' wore a black strapless bustier over a white poplin shirt and tuxedo trousers. Gaultier accessorized a green and burgundy outfit with a white fur wrap with fox heads, covered an ivory-coloured bustier with a floor-length see-through black lace gown and made his bride an Indian groom dressed in a white maharajah suit. "It was sublime," French cinema legend Catherine Deneuve told Reuters after the show. "He finds a theme and follows it. He's really at another level of couture. Everything is magnificent, from the clothes to the hairstyle and models. This is such a beautiful show." Gaultier's presentation concluded a three-day marathon of fall/winter haute couture shows marked by heavy rain and anniversaries -- those of Christian Dior and the French fashion house's charismatic designer Galliano in a lavish Versailles party on Monday and of Christian Lacroix on Tuesday. NEW PRINCE ON THE BLOCK There were also princesses, but of another kind, at the show of up and coming Lebanese designer Elie Saab, held at the Cirque d'Hiver, a polygon-shaped permanent circus and concert venue built in 1852 for French Emperor Napoleon III. Saab showed why he has in recent years become one of the favourite designers of Queen Rania of Jordan and red-carpet celebrities Beyonce Knowles and Halle Berry. Saab went straight to what he does best, glittering evening dresses made out of veils, satin or lace embroidered like jewels, with plunging decollete. French actresses in the front row applauded as models wore a ballroom grown made of a sleeveless silver lame top broadening below the chest into several layers of grey muslin, or a long satin cloak with sleeves hemmed with silver fox. Saab used his favourite fabrics -- satin and lace -- and colours -- white, grey, silver and black -- to create daringly revealing but consistently chic gowns. The 43-year-old designer has become a household name in the world of haute couture, selling hundreds of his embroidered evening dresses at up to $375,000 apiece -- and sometimes a staggering $2 million for an emerald encrusted wedding gown ordered by a Qatari prince
