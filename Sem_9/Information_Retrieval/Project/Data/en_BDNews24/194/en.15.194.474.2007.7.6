<TEXT>
 Bandarban, July 6 (bdnews24.com) Troops arrested a suspected abductor of Danida official early Friday after a firefight with an armed gang believed to be the kidnappers. A local named Maung Maung, alleged to be one of Hossain Shahid Suman's abductors, was held, an officer of the search forces said, preferring anonymity. The officer said they launched an operation in the Yang Rai hill at Thanchi in the early hours after Suman's abductors opened fire at them, prompting the rescuers to retaliate. He said at least 200 rounds were traded in the hour-long firefight. The abductors at one stage retreated behind the hill but Maung was caught. The search operations had been intensified following the arrest, the officer claimed. On June 25, a band of armed miscreants abducted the Danida official and driver Mohammed Hanif from Khiburipara area and carried them away to a hideout in a trawler. The Danida driver was rescued from Yang Rai at Thanchi on June 28. bdnews24.com/
