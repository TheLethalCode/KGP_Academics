 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  A medical board has suggested that BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury should immediately be sent abroad for a bypass surgery, a doctor said Monday. The parliamentary affairs adviser to former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who has long been suffering from heart diseases, is now being treated at BIRDEM Cardiac Centre. The board headed by Prof Sirajul Haque, chairman of the cardiology department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, checked Chowdhury's health Monday. Hummam Quader Chowdhury, the son of SQ Chowdhury, said his father's condition was not good. "We are trying to take permission from the government for his treatment abroad," he said. Chowdhury is under watch of Dr Maksumul Haque. Dr Haque told bdnews24.com that Chowdhury's condition was better than on Sunday. But he feared the condition might worsen anytime. "He (Chowdhury) should be sent abroad immediately for better treatment. The medical board suggested so," he said. Dr Haque said Chowdhury had already five stents in his heart. Singaporean doctors had earlier prescribed him an Intravascular ultrasound. Chowdhury had a heart attack two months ago. Joint forces arrested him on February 4 in one of the major raids on "political bigwigs" allegedly tied to corruption. bdnews
