<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Thursday ordered Sigma Huda into jail in a case that brands her as abettor for her husband Nazmul Huda in bribe-taking. Sigma had earlier surrendered to the Special Judge's Court-2 in the Jatiya Sangsad premises after she lost her claim to immunity from arrest and detention in a legal battle in the High Court. Roads contractor Mir Zahir Hossain filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station against Sigma, secretary general of Bangladesh Society for Implementation of Human Rights, and Nazmul Huda for taking Tk 2.4 crore in bribe from him. The Special Court asked jail authorities for treatment of Sigma, who is apparently ill, in line with the jail code. Judge Amar Kumar Roy issued the ruling after charges were framed against the couple Thursday afternoon. An initial development of the news created confusion over whether she was arrested or she turned herself in to court. Witnesses said two army vehicles escorted an ambulance carrying Sigma to court from LabAid Cardiac Hospital. Sigma's sister Khushi Kabir told bdnews24.com: "She (Sigma) was not arrested. She went to appear in court." The High Court Wednesday rejected Sigma's appeal seeking immunity from arrest and detention as special UN rapporteur on human trafficking. But the HC vacation bench said the trial court may consider her appeal for immunity if she applies for it. Thursday's trial court order sending her to jail dashed the last chance for a further immunity appeal. A special five-member vacation bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, Wednesday stayed for three weeks a previous HC order that had stalled any move to arrest Sigma. In its order, the HC had asked Sigma to surrender to the trial court in eight weeks from June 6. According to the case details, Mir Zahir paid Nazmul Huda Tk 2.4 crore by cheque for a contract of the Roads and Highways Department. Sigma abetted her husband in bribe-taking as the money was deposited into the account of Khoborer Antorale, operated by Sigma, the Bangla-language weekly's publisher, a lawyer close to her told bdnews24.com, referring to the case details. On June 4, the Anticorruption Commission investigated the case and submitted the chargesheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Metropolitan magistrate Jalal Ahmed forwarded the chargesheet to Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court, which was later sent to Roy's court. bdnews24.
