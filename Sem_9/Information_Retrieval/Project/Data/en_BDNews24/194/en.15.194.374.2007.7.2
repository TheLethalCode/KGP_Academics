Childhood cancers usually result in cure rates of between 70 and 90 percent but the aggressive chemotherapy which is often needed can render children sterile. Many experts had thought eggs in the follicles of young girls before puberty were too immature to be extracted. But an Israeli team found they could obtain eggs from girls with cancer aged between five and 10 years and then culture them in a dish to make them viable.
