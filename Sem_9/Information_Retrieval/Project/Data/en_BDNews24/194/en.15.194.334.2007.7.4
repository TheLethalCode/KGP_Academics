 Dhaka, July 04 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengupta Wednesday proposed a presidential form of government dissolving the office of the prime minister. "Leadership should not go beyond accountability," Suranjit told reporters at his Dhanmondi home in a reform plan. He replicated the proposal of party colleagues Abdur Razzak and Tofail Ahmed for joint leadership within the Awami League. In his three-point roadmap, Suranjit said the executive power of the government could be handed over to the president from the prime minister. "The cabinet will make important policies," he said. Suranjit's proposal eliminates the so-called absolute authority of the prime minister and treats the prime minister as the "first among equals". According to Suranjit's plan, the president can return constitutional appointments to the prime minister for further review if the president differs with the prime minister. Suranjit said the government must take into account the opinion of the president in shaping all national and foreign policies. He said: "Absolute supremacy and unilateralism are not acceptable in democracy. Joint leadership would brighten and glorify the images of the leaders." "Reform doesn't mean division. We want a stronger and united Awami League." "Our leader's (Sheikh Hasina) image should reflect greatness, patriotism, liberalism and simplicity, not any post or power," Suranjit said. He stressed a change in the structure of the Awami League on all levels. Suranjit said the practice of democracy in the political parties must be ensured by amending laws. Registration of political parties is among the key points on his plan. He proposed the appointment of a parliamentary ombudsman without delay. "Institutionalisation of the political parties in a democratic way has been delayed due to the lack of an ombudsman," he said. To make parliament effective, Suranjit stressed the need for fair election of the speaker, forming parliamentary committees at the first session, distributing the key posts of the committees among ruling and opposition parties and keeping parliament session uninterrupted. bdnews24.c
