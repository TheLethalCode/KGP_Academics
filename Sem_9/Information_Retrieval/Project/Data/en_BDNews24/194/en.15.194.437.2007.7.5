 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) The interim cabinet has approved the Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance 2007 to check money outflows and terror financing, an official spokesman said Wednesday. "The council of advisers has given final approval to the law," Syed Fahim Munaim, press secretary to the chief adviser, told a press briefing after a meeting of the council of advisers. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting in his office. The council had earlier approved the draft law in principle on March 19 and sent it to the law ministry for vetting. Munaim said the ordinance empowered the Anticorruption Commission with the authority of investigating money-laundering cases. "From now on, the ACC will look into those cases that were previously investigated by the Bangladesh Bank. In case of legal complexity, the ACC Act 2004 and the amended Criminal Procedure Code 2007 will be given priority," Munaim said. The cabinet has also vested the powers of judgment in money laundering cases to special judge's courts, the press secretary said. The ordinance will allow the authorities to seek cooperation from other countries in carrying out investigations, seizing and confiscating assets, and sharing information. The new money-laundering law comes amid US-led international pressure to combat terrorism and terror financing. The government's move for tougher measures on money laundering and other corrupt activities as well as disciplining the banking sector is motivated by financial crimes such as the Tk 5 billion Oriental Bank scam. "It will replace the previous Anti-Money Laundering Act 2002, which was not adequate to detect and take action against such activities. The definition of money laundering was also ambiguous," a senior official of the central bank had earlier said. Corruption and bribery, currency and document forgery, extortion, cheating, forgery, illegal arms and drug peddling, smuggling, smuggling, currency smuggling, illegal manpower export and terror financing, may all be prosecuted under the new ordinance. Providing fake information to banks and financial institutions will also be a punishable offence. Some 15 types of organisationsbanks, couriers, financial institutions, insurers, micro-finance organisations, moneychangers, money transferring agencies, post offices, real estate developers, shares and securities brokers, sub registrars' offices, NGOs, cooperatives banks, charities and professionals such as lawyers, accountants, auditors and notaries publicwill be required to report to Bangladesh Bank. The central bank will act as the manager of the assets confiscated in accordance with the orders by the Money Laundering Prevention Court. bdne
