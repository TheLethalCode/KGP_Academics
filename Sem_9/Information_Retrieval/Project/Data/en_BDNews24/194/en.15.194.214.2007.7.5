<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 04 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury's sons and daughter Thursday sought help from President Iajuddin Ahmed to send their father abroad for better treatment. Chowdhury, parliamentary affairs adviser to former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has long been suffering from heart ailments and is now being treated at the Coronary Care Unit of Ibrahim Memorial Cardiac Hospital at BIRDEM. Communications adviser MA Matin Thursday told reporters that the home secretary had been asked to check laws about the matter. In their appeal, Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, Farzeen Quader Chowdhury and Humam Quader Chowdhury said that they were willing to sign any document and agree to any condition for the travel of their father abroad. "Please understand that his career and our future have become irrelevant to us. Our father's life is our one and only concern. It is in your hands," they said in a joint appeal. "Please spare his life." They said that their father had had a second heart attack in two months and needed to be sent abroad for treatment as recommended by a medical board. A medical board headed by Prof Sirajul Haque, chairman of the cardiology department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, suggested that Chowdhury immediately be sent abroad for a bypass surgery. On July 2, Humam told bdnews24.com: "We are trying to get permission from the government for his treatment abroad." They said the angiogram and Intra Vascular Ultra Sound (IVUS) as recommended by the medical board were not possible in Bangladesh. The medical board in its report recommended an urgent coronary angiogram and IVUS. It also advised that the IVUS be carried out by Chowdhury's primary consultant in Singapore, Dr Wiston Oh. Joint forces arrested Chowdhury on Feb 4 in one of the major raids on "political bigwigs" allegedly tied to corruption. bdnew
