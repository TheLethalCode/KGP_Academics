<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka City Corporation Sunday announced a Tk 1,401.88 crore budget for fiscal 2007-08, an increase of 65.7 percent over the last year's revised budget of Tk 846.23 crore. The budget was announced on the first day of the new fiscal year by DCC mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka. The budget breakdown showed Tk 478.45 crore in revenue earnings, Tk 9 crore in other incomes, Tk 100 crore from government grants, Tk 150 crore special government grants, Tk 619.43 crore from government and foreign assisted projects and Tk 45 crore ending the balance. Speaking at the Mohanagar Natyamancha Kazi Bashir auditorium in Gulistan, the mayor began his speech by explaining why he had not stepped down as mayor despite expiry of his tenure on May 14. He and the elected commissioners must continue with their responsibilities as there is a legal requirement that they hand over responsibility to the next elected mayor, according to Khoka. The mayor also said that despite working relentlessly for the last five years to fulfil the expectations of city dwellers infrastructure, financial resources and manpower were inadequate for a city burdened with such a huge population. Emphasising the lack of infrastructure Khoka said: "Whereas a modern city should have 25 percent of roadways, Dhaka city has only 6 percent." Quoting experts who say that the population of Dhaka city will pass 20 million by 2015 the mayor said it is high time to realise a long-term plan. He recommended experts create a master plan for Dhaka that would extend from the Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers to Keraniganj, Savar and the Joydevpur junction, keeping in view urban growth over the next 50 years. He also proposed improvement of waterways, maintaining navigability and clearing them of pollution. Khoka suggested a civic government resembling the city wise administration of developed countries to adequately meet the demand for utilities, services, law and order, clean environment and flowing traffic of a growing population. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, the mayor said he has personally taken steps to reduce corruption in the city. Khoka added that the present government's anticorruption drive was effective and the Anticorruption Commission has grown in stature. bdnews2
