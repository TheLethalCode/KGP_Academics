Chanderpaul finished unbeaten on 116 from 122 balls, his seventh one-day century, as the tourists set England a challenging target. West Indies, unchanged after their defeat at Lord's on Sunday, made a brisk start after being put into bat by England captain Paul Collingwood. Openers Chris Gayle (36) and Devon Smith (17) added 50 inside the opening eight overs before Smith edged behind a James Anderson delivery. Gayle followed with the score on 67, chipping straight to Anderson at mid-on off Ryan Sidebottom, before Chanderpaul and Samuels set about England's attack -- adding 175 for the third wicket. After a short break for rain, Chanderpaul enjoyed a let-off when Ian Bell just failed to get his fingers to a sliced stroke to backward point but he soon moved past 50. Samuels then reached his 50 with a clip to leg before being caught in the 46th over at third man. Chanderpaul, in imperious form during the test series, reached his century an over later
