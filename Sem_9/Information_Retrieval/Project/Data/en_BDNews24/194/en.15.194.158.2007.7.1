 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Bank recorded $5.056 billion in foreign exchange reserves, an all-time high, on the last day of the outgoing fiscal year. Foreign exchange reserves were $3.48 billion for the previous fiscal year, 2005-06, according to the Bangladesh Bank. Increases in export earnings, remittances and funds released by donors were behind the increase. Relatively moderate import growth was also a factor. On January 9, reserves stood at $4.02 billion and crossed $5.0 billion benchmark on June 27. "We received funds worth $300 million from the World Bank recently. Deposits made by UN peacekeeping missions also boosted the reserve position," a senior central bank official, who wished to remain anonymous, told bdnews24.com Sunday. The World Bank recently released $200 million from Development Support Credit and another $100 million under the Education Sector Development Support Credit, the official said. In the 11 months to May, total remittance inflows rose by 25 percent to $5,466.99 million from $4,372.75 million in the same period a year ago. Exports registered an 18.5 percent growth, reaching $9,990 million in the July to April period (FY 06-07) up from $8,365.53 million the previous year, according to the Export Promotion Bureau. Imports, calculated in terms of letters of credit value, grew at a rate of 14.38 percent to $1,5965.26 million from $1,3958.17 million the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves are an indicator of a country's ability to meet overseas payments. bdnew
