 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  Friday dawned dry and sunny interspersed with drizzles, allowing weekenders to leisurely set about attending to their scheduled day's business. The monsoon damp also seemed to relax its sticky claws, as the morning was breezy too. A met office duty officer told bdnews24.com the monsoon winds and thunder-edged clouds should be floating over the northern Bay areas through the day. The ports of Mongla, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar will continue to hoist local cautionary signal three. All fishing boats and trawlers have been asked to stay anchored safely until further notice. Most places of Khulna, Barisal and Chittagong divisions and places of Dhaka, Sylhet and Rajshahi divisions may have moderate to heavy rainfalls with gusty to squally winds. The maximum and minimum day temperatures recorded in Dhaka Thursday was 30.8 and 25.6 degree Celsius. The country's highest temperature was recorded in Sylhet at 34.9 degree Celsius and the lowest was 25 degree Celsius at Rangamati, Bhola and Barisal.
