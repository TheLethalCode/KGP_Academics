 Sheikh Hasina Translated by Enamul Haque July 1971. A small one-storey house at Dhanmondi Road 18. Pakistani occupation forces detained my mother in this house. Jamal, Rehana, Russell and my husband were also present, as were my uncle Khoka, aunt and their son. I was pregnant. On March 23rd when my father hoisted the Bangladesh flag with his hands he told me: "Your son will be a citizen of an independent country. Name him Joy." I was then four months into my pregnancy. I was expecting my first baby, about to experience maternity for the first time. It was an incomparable feeling, impossible to express through language. Then on the night of March 25th, the Pakistani army attacked Dhaka University, Peelkhana, Rajarbagh police line and many other places. They also attacked our Dhanmondi Road 32 house. They arrested my father at about 4 in the morning, for declaring independence. When Pakistani occupation forces began their attack on unarmed Bengalis at about 11 that night, the declaration of independence was conveyed by telephone, through the EPR (now BDR) wireless services to different areas. The news was also sent by telegram to all districts and thanas. These tasks were assigned people to beforehand as a plan had been conceived earlier. Rehana, cousin Jelly and I were removed from our house to another place at about 11 pm. Our house was surrounded by intelligence people and there was a chance of an army attack on the house at any moment. Helicopters were hovering overhead and their searchlights were focused on the house. A helicopter searchlight also followed our car as we were leaving. The army attacked our house at about 1 in the morning and killed Khokon. They arrested my father and took him away. We did not know where he had been takenwhether he was alive or deaduntil January 8, 1972. The next day, on March 26th, our house was attacked again. Mother along with Russell took shelter in a neighbouring house. A curfew had been imposed from the previous night and continued through the 26th. On March 27th the curfew was relaxed for three to four hours. During that time we moved from one place to another for safety. The house at Road No 32 was occupied by the Pakistani army. We had to change our shelter 19 times in two months. There was no guarantee of food. Sometimes we could not sleep at night for lack of space. Because of my pregnancy I had no appetite for food. Mother was not able to leave me on my own. Kamal had already left to fight for our country's liberation. In this situation we were arrested from a house in Moghbazar. We were taken to a house at Dhanmondi Road 18 and held there. They gave us one blanket and one chair for the whole family. We were given no food or cooking utensils. We were arrested around noon and had no lunch. They whole day and night passed without food. I began to feel some pain four weeks before the expected date of delivery of my baby. I was sent to hospital and suffered there for about a week. I was crying out in labour pain but my mother was not able to stay by my side. My mother wanted to go to the hospital with me. But the government categorically forbade her saying that as she was neither a doctor nor a nurse she could not be with me. Hearing this my mother burst into tears and said, "I am a mother). I want to go to my daughter. I want be by her side to pray for her, to give her courage." My mother's appeal had no meaning for the occupation forces. It seemed that they enjoyed causing both my mother and me immense suffering. After seven days of almost intolerable pain Joy was born. I thanked Allah a thousand times for giving me a healthy baby. But I can never forget the pain I suffered as my mother was not allowed to be by my side. I was elected president of the Awami League in 1981 in absentia. My son was then nine and a half years old and my daughter was eight years. They stayed with Rehana while I stood by the people. At the time there were two or three factions of Awami League. Bangladesh was under military rule. I struggled to organise the party on the one hand and fought for democracy on the other. Joy and Putul grew up deprived of their mother's company. I was not there when they needed me most by their side. In 1983 I admitted them to school in Dhaka. Soon after I was repeatedly arrested. Sometimes I was taken to jail and sometimes it was house arrest. My children's study was hampered. In 1985 when I was detained, my father's friend Aziz Sattar Uncle got Joy and Putul admitted to school in Nainital, India. They lived in the hostel and during vacations they visited us at our small two-room flat of the Atomic Energy Commission in Mohakhali. I was so busy that I could not give them any time. They studied at an inexpensive missionary school and did not have good food either. They remained deprived of their mother's affection as their mother dedicated her time to the nation. I love my people deeply. I cannot be abroad for long leaving them behind. On the other hand I must go abroad to visit my children. Like all women I enjoy spending time with children and grandchildren. Every year out of 365 days I spend about 360 days with my people and the rest with my children and grandchildren. However I am grateful that both my children have received good education, they are worthy young people. This is my greatest achievement. I lost my father, mother and brothers on August 15, 1975 while my younger sister Rehana and I were abroad. I have had to suffer immense pain in life. My only consolation was my two children. I bore all sufferings while my children were the source of my inspiration and courage. But now when my children need me most I am not allowed to visit them. Why do they want my daughter to suffer so much? In this country a game is being played with the democratic rights of the people. How much will the people of Bangladesh have to suffer? I am not even being allowed to stand by them in need. This is 2007. I am a citizen of an independent country. My daughter Putul is pregnant. She is expecting a baby in just a few days. Doctors said her baby is due on the 9th. I wanted to go to her earlier. She must drive one hour to her workplace. She attended office until June 24th or 25th. She is in dire need of money, which is why she took such short maternity leave. I thought I could have cooked food for my daughter in the last stage of her pregnancy. I made all preparations to visit Putul in the USA in mid-June. I even booked a ticket. But a three-tier barrier was made around my house with hundreds of policemen. I could not leave my house in a car. Two false cases have also been filed against me. They have given orders to the airport not to let me out of the country. Earlier when I went abroad to attend my daughter-in-law, who was ill, I was barred from returning home. This time they did not let me leave. I am a mother. My daughter is very upset. She is in pain. She asks me over the phone again and again when I can be with her. I keep quiet. I cannot tell her directly that I am living the life of a detainee and the present government will not allow me to go. She will have to go to hospital for three or four days. I will not be able to be by her side when she will suffer the pain of giving birth. She will call out "Ma" but will receive no reply. I wonder why my daughter has to suffer the same pain as I suffered in 1971. Are we not living in an independent country? Putul, your mother cannot go to you. Forgive me. I want to know what my crime is. I want to know why I cannot be at my daughter's bedside. Are we still living in 1971? bdnews
