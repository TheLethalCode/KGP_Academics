 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka Abahani continued their winning run in the B. League with a hard-fought 3-2 win over Farashganj Sporting Club in the second-leg encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Tuesday. The ninth triumph in 15 outings helped the popular sky-blues outfit topple the table-topper Muktijoddha Sangsad to grab the top slot of the 11-team point table with 32 points, two points ahead of Muktijoddha, who played 16 matches. With the sixth losses in 16 matches, Farashganj, who were beaten 3-1 in the first leg by Abahani, were in the seventh position with 18 points. Both sides played an entertaining game, but Farashganj comparatively dominated the first half. Abahani bounced back in the second half to leave the field with a smiling face. Abahani took an early lead in the fourth minute through a strike from Zahid Hasan Amili, who put the ball home capitalising a left-side through pass from Wali Faisal, but the lead was short-lived for only three minutes. Mohammad Robin restored the Farashganj parity in the seventh minute with a solo effort as the promising striker dodged Abahani goalie Biplob Bhattacharya past to fire home. Then, Farashganj stunned Abahani with Arup Kumar Buddhya striking from 30 yards to give the old Dhaka outfit a 2-1 lead in the 13th minute. Abahani levelled the margin in the 37th minute with defender Nazrul Islam converting a penalty shot as referee Ram Krishna Ghosh did not hesitate to award penalty after Farashganj's Guinean defender Konate Amadou brought opponent's Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim down in the danger zone. Amili scored the decider four minutes into the second half utilising a misunderstanding between Farashganj goalie Mamun Khan and defender Abu Faisal. bdn
