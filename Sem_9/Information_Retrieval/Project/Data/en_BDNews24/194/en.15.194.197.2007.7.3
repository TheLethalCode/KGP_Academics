 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh manpower exports hit an all-time high at about 3.41 lakh workers in the six months to June, creating record remittances and boosting the rural economy, a senior official said Tuesday. The figure is 40,000 below full-year manpower export for January-December of last year when more than 3.81 lakh Bangladeshi workers went abroad. "We hope the figure will double from the last year. We have already sent 3,40,800 workers abroad up to July 2," director general of the Bureau of Manpower, Employment & Training (BMET) Md Abdul Malek told bdnews24.com Tuesday. A construction boom in the middle-eastern region and a thriving economy in Southeast Asia contributed to the high numbers, analysts said. Non-resident Bangladeshis, mostly workers abroad, are the second highest foreign exchange earners after exports. Remittances, which accounted for about 7 percent of GDP in FY 2005-06, are expected to hit a record $6.0 billion in fiscal 2006-07. In the eleven months to May of fiscal 2006-07, total remittance inflows rose 25 percent to $5466.99 million from $4372.75 million in the same period of the previous fiscal year. According to official estimates, about five million Bangladeshis have periodically worked abroad since 1977. Yearly manpower exports had remained below 3.0 lakh between 1998 and 2005 but reached 3.81 lakh last yeara figure it had not registered since 1997. The director general of BMET said Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia were the major recruiting countries. Recently, South Korea also sought 3,000 workers. About one month ago the government signed an agreement to restart manpower exports to Seoul, which had stopped recruiting Bangladeshi workers since 2003. Malaysia also resumed hiring workers in October 2006 after a ten-year embargo. Over 50,000 workers have left for Malaysia since January this year. "Now I have a list of 25 countries that seek Bangladeshi workers. The demand for unskilled labour is highest," said Malek. "It's good news," said Zaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. "It will help boost rural economy and its productivity as a major portion of the workers are going rural level." bdn
