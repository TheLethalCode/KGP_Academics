 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines has selected applications of 1,863 employees for a so-called golden handshake opportunity to go into voluntary retirement, a senior official said Sunday. Biman's managing director MA Momen told bdnews24.com: "A total of 2,162 employees signed up for the golden handshake opportunity. Only 1,863 applications reached the final stage." "I hope those who have been marked for the opportunity will be paid in one month's time," Momen said. Earlier on June 21, acting civil aviation and tourism secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali said the opportunity would not apply to the applicants who are essential to run Biman and those with corruption links. The golden handshake opportunity is part of a government effort to overhaul the loss-making national flag carrier, now staffed with 4,800. The government took up the voluntary retirement scheme to make Biman profitable and turn it into a public limited company. The government set Biman employees a June 20 deadline to turn in applications for retirement. The finance ministry has agreed to allocate Tk 297 crore for the scheme, which will need Tk 325 crore to be complete. bdn
