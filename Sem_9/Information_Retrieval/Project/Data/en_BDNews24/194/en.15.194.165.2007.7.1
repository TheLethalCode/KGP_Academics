 LONDON, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The mode, timing and targets of two failed car bombs and a third attack in Britain on an airport suggest a campaign by determined but tactically naive militants, linked to Prime Minister Gordon Brown's arrival in power. Brown played down that link on Sunday, saying in an interview that attacks in Britain had been expected over "many, many months". But four days after he replaced Tony Blair, the country has been put on "critical" alert status -- the highest level of terrorist threat warning, meaning attacks are expected imminently -- after two car bombs were discovered in London and two men crashed a jeep into a Scottish airport. Previous plots have almost invariably targeted London, and never Scotland, so Saturday's incident at Glasgow airport reinforced the impression of a chain of violent messages aimed deliberately at the new prime minister, who is Scottish. "Inevitably speculation is going to lead in that direction," said a British security source who confirmed that radical Islamists are suspected of being behind the three linked incidents. Brown said: "It is clear that we are dealing in general terms with people who are associated with al Qaeda." TIME TO PREPARE Security professionals often play down the timing of attacks, saying groups generally prepare their operations over weeks or months and strike as soon as they are ready, rather than wait for significant dates. But there are exceptions. The Madrid train bombings of March 2004, for example, took place three days before a general election. That tilted the outcome, leading to the surprise defeat of the ruling conservatives and their replacement by a Socialist government which quickly pulled Spanish troops out of Iraq. Britain has been a prime target for Islamist attacks because of its close support for the United States and its troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, although Brown declined to acknowledge that linkage in his interview. A key question he faces is how, and when, to scale back the British role in Iraq. Al Qaeda-inspired cells would have had ample time to prepare attacks to coincide with Brown's arrival in office: Blair announced as far back as May 10 that he would be stepping down on June 27. COMMITTED BUT NAIVE While the three attacks failed to inflict casualties, the commitment of the attackers was clear. The two London devices were packed with nails as well as petrol and gas canisters, which could have shattered into deadly shrapnel. In the Glasgow incident, one of the two attackers suffered critical burns in the fireball he fuelled by pouring petrol over himself and the vehicle, according to witnesses. "There's no question in terms of their willingness to sacrifice themselves but there may be some doubts as to the level of preparation and execution," said terrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp. He pointed to the use of simple, almost crude devices and the failure of all three attacks. Ranstorp said the desperate tactics in the Glasgow incident suggested it may have been launched in haste by men who felt time was running out before anti-terrorism detectives, following a trail of evidence from the two unexploded London car bombs, came knocking at their doors. The same logic could prompt any other connected cell to strike sooner rather than later. "There could be one cell out there still but they will be feeling the heat tremendously," Ranstorp said. A security official said there was no specific intelligence of further bombings. But the raised threat level reflected the fact there were "people out there who've got the capability and the intent to launch further attacks". Jason Burke, an al Qaeda expert writing for The Observer newspaper, said the amateur nature of the attacks showed public vigilance and security surveillance was making it hard for militants to launch ambitious and sophisticated plots. "But it is bad news in that it means that the threat is coming from the people who are hardest to stop: ordinary citizens angry or disturbed enough to become radicalised."
