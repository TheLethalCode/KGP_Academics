 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Remittance inflows grew 24.52 percent to reach a record $5,979.31 million in the July-June period of fiscal 2006-07 from $4,801.88 million in the previous year thanks to a move against money laundering. This is the highest amount in remittance inflows Bangladesh has ever recorded. "Bangladesh Bank's stringent drive to enforce anti-money laundering laws has contributed to the increase in remittances inflows. Expatriates now prefer official routes instead of informal channels such as hundi due to anti-money laundering laws," a Citibank NA senior official, who wished to remain unnamed, said. "Improvement of service delivery and increase in distribution channels also encouraged remitters," he said. Expatriates, mostly Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, USA and the UK sent the bulk of the amount, according to central bank data. Remittances, the second highest contributor to Bangladesh's economy after exports, are also set to increase in the coming months because of manpower export growth. In the six months up to June, manpower exports hit an al-time high at about 3.41 lakh. The figure is 40 thousand below the total manpower exports in the January-December period of the 2006. Last year, Bangladesh sent 3,81,516 workers abroad. Official estimates show that about 5.0 million Bangladeshi workers have gone abroad since 1976. Syed Abu Naser Bukhtear Ahmed, chief executive of Agrani Bank, attributed the rise in remittance inflows to bank efforts to make money transfer arrangements in countries wherever there are expatriates. "Wherever Bangladeshis are, we have arrangements for money transfers now," he said. Previously banks concentrated only on certain middle- eastern countries and Europe. Now the network has well expanded, he said. Ahmed said that higher remittance inflows contributed to the economy and boosted the country's foreign exchange reserves. "So far this is the highest amount in remittance inflows and it has pulled up the country's reserves to the over $5.0 billion mark," he said. bd
