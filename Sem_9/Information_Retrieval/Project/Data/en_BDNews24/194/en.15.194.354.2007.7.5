 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Middle-order batsman Tushar Imran leaves Friday for Sri Lanka to join Tigers ahead of the third and final Test against the hosts. "Tushar Imran will join the touring Bangladesh Team in Colombo. He is scheduled to leave Dhaka on July 6," the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said in a press statement Thursday. Chief selector Faruque Ahmed Wednesday said they asked selector Akram Khan who is now in Colombo whether the team needed any additional batsman ahead of the final Test. They also told him that they were ready to send Tushar over if needed. Tushar was to join the Tigers in the three-match ODIs series along with Aftab Ahmed, Tamim Iqbal, Farhad Reza and Mahmudullah Riad. Bangladesh scored their lowest-ever total of 62 in the first innings of the second Test and were skittled out for just 89 runs in the first innings of the first Test against Sri Lanka in the ongoing three-match Test series.
