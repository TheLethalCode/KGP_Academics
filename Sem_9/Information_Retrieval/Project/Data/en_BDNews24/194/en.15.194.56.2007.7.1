 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Nigerian striker Emeka Christina slammed his second hat-trick in the B. League as Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club joined league leaders Dhaka Abahani with a 3-1 win over Rahmatganj MFS in the second-leg match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Sunday. Both the giants are at the top of the 11-team point table with 29 points. Mohammedan, however, played a match more than Abahani's 14. Rahmatganj, who were beaten 7-1 in the first leg by the same rivals, remained on the bottom of the point table with only nine points from 16 outings. The eighth triumph was not easy for Mohammedan, who went one goal down in the 15th minute with a strike of Nigerian Charles Ikogho and survived a suicidal-goal scare in the 35th minute. The popular black and white outfit, however, bounced back in the stoppage time of the first half with an Emeka header after missing the targets twice. After the lemon break, Emeka doubled the margin in the 57th minute capitalising a Kamal cross and completed his second and league's seventh hat-trick with a back volley in the dying minute.
