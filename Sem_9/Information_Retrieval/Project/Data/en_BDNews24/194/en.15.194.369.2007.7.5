 Ahmed Dipu and Ehsanul Haque bdnews24.com Senior Correspondents Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com) - Government policymakers and a spokesman are making contradictory statements about a national security council, puzzling the public. The law adviser, the chief adviser's press secretary and a senior official at the Chief Adviser's Office Wednesday made differing statements on the making of the council. Some six months after the present government's takeover, law adviser Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com: "National security councils are there in different countries, including India and Pakistan. "There was such a council in Bangladesh before, but it was not active." "The national security council will pave the way for direct talks between the military and civil administration on any issue of national interest. "A proposal on formation of the council was been sent to the Chief Adviser's Office about two months ago," he said. Replying to a question, Mainul said the council could be formed through an executive order. He advised that the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim be contacted for more. Contacted by phone, Munaim said: "I am not aware of the matter at the moment." The same day, after the meeting of the council of advisers, when the press secretary briefed reporters at 7pm he was asked whether the national security council would be reconstituted. This time, he said since there was a national security council, the question of its reconstitution did not arise. Earlier Wednesday, an official with the CAO in return for anonymity said, "The proposed draft speaks of forming the national security council with the chief adviser as its head. Besides, chiefs of the three services and government officials will be involved in it." Since the present caretaker government took over, the issue of formation of a national security council has come up for discussion. After the government took oath on Jan. 11, a meeting of the council of advisers discussed the issue. However, the government did not say anything specific about the council. bdnews24.ocm/
