 LONDON, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The grave of a Victorian detective who led the hunt for one of Britain's most notorious killers, Jack the Ripper, is finally to be marked with a headstone, 78 years after his death. Despite being a key figure in the investigation into a string of gruesome murders in London's East End in the late 19th century, Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline was buried in an unmarked grave. Now, through the work of a group of former Metropolitan Police officers and keen Ripper historians, a headstone has been placed at his grave in Wimborne Road cemetery, Bournemouth. Father Robin Harger, vicar of the nearby church, St Stephen's and St Augustin's, will give a blessing on Friday attended by current and former Scotland Yard detectives. "It's extraordinary that no headstone has been there to commemorate Abberline, considering his role in the Jack the Ripper case," said former Met officer Arthur Stanners, who has helped in the campaign. Abberline was sent from Scotland Yard to lead a team of detectives investigating the murder and horrific mutilation of the bodies of prostitutes found in Whitechapel between 1888 and 1891. The ripper could have killed up to 11 women, though it is believed the number was more likely five, between August and November 1888. London was fascinated and appalled by the murders at the time and because the killer was never caught, the true identity of the Ripper has been a subject of avid speculation ever since. Theories include suggestions the Ripper was an artist, an author, a midwife or even a member of the royal family. The Metropolitan Police Web site suggested he could have been a poor Polish Jew who lived in the area, a barrister who later committed suicide, a Russian-born thief and confidence trickster or an American doctor who fled the country after being arrested for a different offence. Abberline left the inquiry in early 1889 and later retired to Bournemouth on the south coast in his native Dorset where he lived until his death in 1929. Local historians believe a headstone was never placed on his grave because his wife died shortly after he did, and the couple did not have any children. Stonemason Matt Williams of Williams Monumental Company, who donated the black granite memorial, told Reuters: "I read about the campaign to raise money for a headstone, and have always been interested in the story of Jack the Ripper, so thought I could help." Members of Abberline's family were tracked down, and permission given for the headstone. Michael Stead, technical assistant of conservation at Bournemouth Council, said: "Abberline's role has been played on film by Johnny Depp and Michael Caine so we thought 'yes' something should be don
