<TITLE> Iraqi doctors in Britain fear bomb plot backlash </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi doctors working in Britain expressed anger on Tuesday that one of their number could be involved in the London and Glasgow bomb plots, saying they feared it could harm their reputation. More than 1,900 Iraqi-trained doctors are registered with Britain's General Medical Council, working in government hospitals or in private practices across the country. Some fled Iraq under Saddam Hussein's rule to seek work abroad. Others have arrived since his overthrow in 2003, fleeing the deepening dangers at home despite an awareness that Iraq has a desperate need for doctors in its current crisis. "I'm really shocked and upset," said Mohammed Hasan al-Memar, a medical student at King's College London who came to Britain from the Iraqi city of Kerbala. "I know a lot of Iraqi doctors -- there are so many in Britain -- and the sense in the community in general is disappointment and disgust. "That this extremism can affect people like doctors who have an obligation to treat and help people... it's amazing. And the fact that he is an Iraqi doctor just adds salt to the wound." British police sources have named one of those arrested as Bilal Abdulla, who qualified in Iraq in 2004. As well as Abdulla, at least two other doctors are among the suspects arrested so far, including a young Jordanian who qualified in Amman in 2004. SOCIAL STATUS In Iraq, and throughout the Middle East, doctors are held in high regard. The profession attracts some of the most well-educated people in the region and gives its practitioners an elevated social status. Ironically, many doctors in Baghdad spend much of their time dealing with the victims of car bombs in the capital. "I'm finding it difficult to comprehend that a doctor can carry the mentality of a murderer," said Dr Jubouri, a specialist at one of Baghdad's main hospitals, who asked that his first name not be used. "I hope people realise this man doesn't represent Iraqi doctors. Iraqi doctors have already suffered a lot and have a great reputation." With nearly 40 percent of doctors registered in Britain having received their training overseas, including more than 6,000 in the Middle East, there was concern that the events of the past five days would taint the reputations of all. "A lot of people will just quickly point the finger at Middle Eastern doctors now, I know it and I guess to an extent I can't blame them," said Mudher al-Khairallah an Iraqi-British internist at Ninewells hospital in Dundee, Scotland. "I just chaired a meeting of doctors and physiotherapists in the hospital and all I could think about was were the police about to come through the door and ask to question me. "It's such a shame to feel so paranoid all of a sudden. There are so many Iraqi doctors in the UK -- there are probably 10 in my hospital trust alone -- and they are held in very high esteem. I'd hate to see that respect eroded."
