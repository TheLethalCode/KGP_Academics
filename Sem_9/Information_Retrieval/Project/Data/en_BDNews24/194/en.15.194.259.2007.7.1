<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will host the board meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in March 2008, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official. "It is a prestigious opportunity for us to host the ICC board meeting for the first time ever," said BCB chief executive officer (CEO) Mahmudur Rahman after returning home Saturday from the ICC annual meeting at Lord's, England. "The board presidents of 10 Test nations will attend the meeting in March 2008," said Rahman, who replaced BCB general secretary Mahbub Anam in the meeting as Anam did not turn up because of a personal engagement. Bangladesh had, however, another experience to host an ICC meeting in 2004 where the CEOs of the ICC member countries attended the meeting. The last two board meetings of the ICC, apex body of world cricket, were held in South Africa and England. Rahman also said that Bangladesh might take part in the Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies if the ICC approves a proposal of business tycoon Stanford, who has offered the ICC to organise a Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean. According to the proposal, three Test nations first will play a Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies, and then the champions will play a match against "Stanford Eleven" studded with the West Indies players. Rahman said, if the ICC approves the proposal, the West Indies will host the newest version of cricket every year onward. bdn
