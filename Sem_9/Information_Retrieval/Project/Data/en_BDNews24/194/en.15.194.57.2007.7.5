 BAGHDAD, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's acting parliamentary speaker urged political blocs on Thursday to end their boycott of the legislature to help push through vital laws designed to ease sectarian tension between Shi'ite and Sunni Arabs. "They should end their pointless boycott and voice their opinion here loudly to relay us the voice of their constituents," Khaled al-Attiya told lawmakers in an appeal to the main Sunni Arab bloc and a Shi'ite political party. Washington, facing domestic unease over the war in Iraq, is pressing Iraqi leaders to pass a key oil law and other political benchmarks that it hopes will help reconcile majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni Arabs and Kurds.

Politicians loyal to radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, representing a bloc of 30 seats, pulled out in protest against the bombing of a Shi'ite shrine's minarets in the Sunni city of Samarra on June 13. Attiya urged lawmakers to attend in sufficient numbers to achieve a quorum and suggested running six sessions every week instead of the current three. Parliament has already cut its two-month summer break and will sit until the end of July to tackle urgent business. Besides the oil law, Washington wants Iraqi politicians to agree to fresh provincial elections this year, as well as new rules allowing some members of Saddam Hussein's Baath party to join the military or the governme
