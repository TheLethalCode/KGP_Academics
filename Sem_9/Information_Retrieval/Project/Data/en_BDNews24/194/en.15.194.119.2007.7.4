 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - Army chief Moeen U Ahmed said Wednesday that Bangladesh would not need to hire foreign experts if its people were well trained. At a certificate-awarding ceremony at the BGMEA Institute of Fashion and Technology, General Moeen said he would provide the BGMEA and the BIFT with all possible help to set up permanent training centres. He said that he would request related departments to allocate land for the purpose. Moeen distributed certificates among 50 people trained in sweater manufacturing. BGMEA chief Anwarul Alam Chowdhury Parvez said that manpower was the main resource of the country. Skilled people of Bangladesh had earned a reputation at home and abroad, Chowdhury said. Referring to Bangladesh troops in UN peacekeeping missions, the BGMEA leader said that they were playing a prominent role in keeping world peace. Parvez said: "Educational institutions need to be overhauled for skilled manpower. The government has to do it. Leadership in the past had failed. As one of the key players in government, you can play a wise role." Former BGMEA chief Annisul Huq, now running for FBBCI president, said the army proved that they are with people of the country. The army chief was accompanied by his wife, Naznin Moeen. bdnews
