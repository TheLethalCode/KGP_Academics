<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Wednesday said he would publicise a complete party reform proposal in two days. "The existing proposal will be amended with some new points on national politics and governance," Bhuiya told reporters at his Gulshan home. "In a couple of days, when all the details are taken care of, I will present a comprehensive reform proposal to the public," Bhuiyan said. The BNP leader added that the proposal was aimed at building public opinion and confidence in the party. Bhuiyan is currently embroiled in allegations of illegally establishing a party office in Chakaria of Cox's Bazar. It is alleged that he had registered 10 decimals of land in his own name, belonging to Badarkali Agricultural Cooperative Samity, for the local BNP office. "I'm in the dark about it. It's a baseless accusation, as I had never authorised anyone to purchase land for me. I hope appropriate measures will be taken after an official investigation," he said. Since Wednesday morning, regional BNP leaders and lawmakers arrived at Bhuiyan's home to discuss the upcoming BNP council meeting. bdnews42
