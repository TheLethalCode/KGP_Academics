 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  The finance ministry has approved two new systems to ease hassles of taxpayers, National Board of Revenue chairman Badiur Rahman said Thursday. The ministry unveiled a so-called universal self-assessment system for taxpayers to evaluate their tax on their own and submit returns to NBR. The second system combines the tax identification number (TIN) and business identification number (BIN) in a unified taxpayer's identification number, which is called UTIN for short. "These systems will be introduced to ease the submission of tax returns," Rahman told bdnews24.com at the finance ministry. He said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday approved the two proposals made by the tax regulator and collector. Rahman said: "The previous system caused individual businessman and companies unnecessary difficulties." Under the old system, companies and individual businessmen have to submit separate returns under BIN and TIN. The NBR chairman said officials would accept taxpayer returns without asking any questions under the universal self-assessment tax system. "A tax official will have to take prior approval from the NBR in order to make an inquiry into a taxpayer's return," he said. The NBR intends to introduce the universal self-assessment system and UTIN in the current fiscal year. bdnew
