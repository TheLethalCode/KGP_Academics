 NEW YORK, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An American competitive eater devoured a record 66 hotdogs in 12 minutes on Wednesday to win the July 4 annual Coney Island hotdog eating competition, defeating a six-time champion from Japan in a photo finish. Defending champion Takeru Kobayashi, a 28-year-old from Japan who weighed in at 170 pounds, went into the competition with a jaw injury but still managed to down 63 hotdogs. But the winner of the 'Mustard Belt' prize for the most hotdogs eaten was 23-year-old Joey Chestnut from San Jose, California, who weighed in at 225 pounds. Chestnut fulfilled his vow to beat the world record he set in qualifying earlier this year of 59 1/2 dogs, and to bring back the prize to America on Independence Day.

Eaters tend to dunk the bread in water to make swallowing easier and eschew condiments such as ketchup or mustard. Kobayashi, who was competing despite a jaw injury, said all the eaters were getting better every year. "I lost but this was the most fun I had," he said. "I didn't feel pain but my jaw wasn't moving part way through," he said of his injury. Police said as many as 50,000 spectators watched the event, which drew 17 competitors, including two women.
