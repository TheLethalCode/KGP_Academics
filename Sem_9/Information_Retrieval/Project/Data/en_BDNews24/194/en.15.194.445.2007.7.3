 WASHINGTON, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it would not oppose the release of a small portion of 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil due to North Korea under a nuclear disarmament deal before Pyongyang shuts down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. "Our understanding is that the North Koreans have asked for some small portion of that overall 50,000 tonnes earlier on in the process," said US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. "From our view, this is ... something that we don't oppose."
