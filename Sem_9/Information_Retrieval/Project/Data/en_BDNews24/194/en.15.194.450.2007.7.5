 NEW DELHI, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian government approved participation in an ambitious global plan to build an advanced nuclear fusion reactor on Thursday, saying it would be a clean source for the country's soaring energy needs. The Indian cabinet said New Delhi would contribute $620 million to build the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a deal for which was signed by more than 30 countries last year. The objective of ITER is to to demonstrate the feasibility of producing electricity from a fusion reaction, which involves fusing atomic nuclei at extremely high temperatures inside a giant electromagnetic ring. "India's joining ITER is recognition of India's scientific and technical capability in fusion energy," a government statement said after the federal cabinet cleared the project. "Considering India's large energy needs in future, our gaining technological capability in fusion energy will be of considerable long-term benefit," it said. Participation in the project would allow India to "leapfrog in terms of our national technological capability in fusion energy", it added. Construction of the 500 megawatt reactor, to be based near the southern French city of Marseille, is forecast to cost about 5.0 billion euros ($6.8 billion) and take 10 years to complete. Another 5 billion euros will be needed to operate it over a 20-year period. Its backers say ITER would be cleaner than existing nuclear reactors and also a cheaper and abundant source of energy as the end of fossil fuels looms. But critics argue it could be at least 50 years before a commercially viable reactor is built, if one is built at all. New Delhi has hailed its inclusion in the project as a global acceptance of its nuclear capabilities, something it struggled to gain in the past after refusing to sign non-proliferation pacts and testing nuclear weapons.
