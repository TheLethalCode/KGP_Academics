<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  A Rajshahi court Tuesday handed down five years' rigorous imprisonment to former BNP lawmaker Nadim Mostafa in his absence and three others for cheating. Rajshahi additional sessions judge AF Rezaul Karim delivered the judgement fining Mostafa, who is a fugitive from law, Prof Omar Ali, Nazmul Gani Pintu and Abdul Majid Mollah, also on the run, Tk 7,000 each. They would have to serve another year in prison unless they paid the fine. Ali and Pintu were in the dock when the judge announced the verdict at about 1:00pm. The court examined 11 witnesses. Mokaddes Ali of Bhallukgachhi of Putia Upazila filed a case on April 2 accusing the four of embezzling Tk 1 lakh after promising him the job of a lecturer for his son Golam Mustafa in Bharampur College in Puthia. Nadim did not keep the p[romise and refused to have taken the money altogether, he alleged. He alleged that he could not sue them right after the incident since they were influential. Sub-inspector of Puthia Police Station Liakat Ali pressed charges against Nadim and others after investigation on April 22 and the court framed charges against them on May 29. Nadim faces more serious cases for aiding militancy, plundering relief materials and extortion and has been hiding since the emergency was declared. bdnews2
