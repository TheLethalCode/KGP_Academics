 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia Thursday said she would seek government permission to contact party workers and sit in the party office to prepare for the council. "I'll ask the government. I've got to go to the party office and I need to contact party leaders and workers in preparation for the council. We are ready to convene the council as soon as the ban on indoor politics is lifted," Khaleda told reporters after offering prayers at the grave of her husband and former president Ziaur Rahman. Asked about secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's proposal, Khaleda said: "I didn't call it unprincipled. But one can't propose a rushed plan on one's own. The chairperson must be consulted before placing any proposal at the council." Khaleda arrived on the grave in Shere Bangla Nagar at about 5pm. Shirin Sultana, Rehana Haque of Mahila Dal, some Chhatra Dal leaders and her personal physician Salauddin Molla accompanied her. No senior leader was present. Khaleda said: "The BNP is a big, democratic party. Everybody in the party is united against any conspiracy. I want the council. Party men want reforms, and I too." There are about 4,000 councillors in the party and the council might continue for up to seven days, she said. bdnews24.
