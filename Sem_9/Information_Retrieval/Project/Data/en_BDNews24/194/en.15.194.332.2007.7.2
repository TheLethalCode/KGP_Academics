 DILI, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timor's ruling party took an early lead on Monday over a party launched by resistance hero Xanana Gusmao, after a weekend parliamentary ballot in Asia's youngest nation. Results came in slower than expected, a national election commission spokeswoman said, blaming squabbles over the presence of party agents at counting centres. After more than 100,000 votes had been tallied, the ruling Fretilin party had about 33 percent and CNRT, the party launched by former president Gusmao, had 23 percent, Angelina Maria Sarmento told a news conference. Just over half a million were eligible to vote in the poll, the third in three months, after a presidential vote and run-off. "There is no data available from Dili yet and the process of receiving ballots is not yet concluded in Covalima and Bobonaro districts," said Sarmento, adding that it was still impossible to estimate voter turnout. Fourteen parties contested the vote but, as expected, it proved to be a showdown between Fretilin and CNRT. Analysts do not expect any single party to win a majority in the 65-chamber parliament, meaning coalitions will have to be formed. Saturday's election could help put the former Portuguese colony, which is one of the world's poorest countries, on a new path. Factional bloodshed broke out in East Timor last year, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. MOSTLY TROUBLE-FREE The month-long campaign was mostly peaceful, helped by the presence of U.N. police and a force of Australian-led troops. A European Union observer mission endorsed the poll. "The campaign ran in a generally peaceful atmosphere, despite some isolated, serious incidents," said Javier Pomes Ruiz, the head of the mission, referring to the killing of two people during a campaign rally in early June in Viqueque district. The chief of the U.N. mission in East Timor, Atul Khare, urged East Timorese to accept any results. "The East Timorese people have justified my confidence that the elections should be fair and free," he told a news conference. After serving as the country's first president, Gusmao -- a charismatic hero of the resistance to the decades of Indonesian occupation that followed Portugal's withdrawal in 1975 -- now wants the more hands-on post of prime minister. The Fretilin government's sacking of 600 rebellious soldiers triggered the violence last May that killed 37 people and drove 150,000 from their homes. Foreign troops were brought in to restore order, but sporadic violence and unrest have continued. Fretilin, which led the 24-year struggle against Indonesia, remains popular, especially in the east of the country. East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence in a 1999 ballot. The vote was tainted by bloodshed blamed mostly on pro-Indonesian militia and Indonesian military elements. The tiny, predominantly Catholic nation became a full-fledged nation in 2002 after a period of UN administration. Despite its poverty, East Timor is starting to tap rich energy resources that over time could significantly raise living standar
