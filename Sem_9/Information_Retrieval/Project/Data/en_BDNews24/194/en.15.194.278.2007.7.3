 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun to 10 years in prison in an arms case. Judge Md Abul Bashar of Dhaka Metropolitan Special Tribunal-2 delivered the verdict at 4:30pm. The verdict said that Mamun had not used the illegal firearm or bullets for any criminal purpose and that he was therefore awarded the minimum punishment under the Arms Act. The maximum punishment is life imprisonment. Mamun's lawyer Md Shahjahan told bdnews24.com: "We will file an appeal with the High Court against this verdict." During the trial, 26 out of 27 witnesses for the state gave evidence. The judge fixed the date of the verdict after the state and the defence had completed their arguments Monday. The case filed against Mamun under the Emergency Powers Rules had to be concluded within 45 days from filing the case. Tuesday was the last day of the deadline. Police seized a handgun and eight rounds of ammunition on March 26 from Mamun's DOHS home in Banani. Sub-inspector Kazi Abdul Awal filed the case the same day with Dhaka Cantonment police station. Charges were framed against Mamun on May 20. Mamun had earlier received a three-year jail term on June 7 for not submitting his wealth statement before the deadline fixed by the Anticorruption Commission. However on July 1, Mamun appealed to the High Court against the verdict of the special judge's court in the ACC case. bdnews24.com/pb
