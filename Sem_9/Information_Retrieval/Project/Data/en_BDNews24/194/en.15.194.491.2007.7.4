 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  The interim government has moved to form a national security council (NSC) and is set to make a final decision shortly, officials familiar with policymaking deliberations said wednesday. A draft proposal on the council was sent to the Chief Adviser's Office (CAO) a couple of months ago, the officials added. The draft proposal bills the chief adviser as the head of the council with the three defence chiefs as members, said an official at the CAO, speaking in return for customary anonymity because he was not authorised to brief reporters. "Bangladesh too had a national security council in the past like India, Pakistan and other countries, but it was not an active body," said law adviser Mainul Hosein to bdnews24.com by telephone Wednesday morning. "Once the council is in place, it will serve as the neutral platform for any deliberations between the military and civil administrations on issues of national interests," the adviser elaborated. "A proposal for forming such a council was forwarded to the Chief Adviser's Office about two months back." He said the council will come into being through an executive order. Asked who would be heading it and what would be the composition, the adviser said, "I can't tell you about that right away. I'll have to consult files." He then suggested bdnews24.com speak to Syed Fahim Munaim, the press secretary to the chief adviser, for more details. Reached by phone, Munaim said he was not aware of the matter. bdnews24
