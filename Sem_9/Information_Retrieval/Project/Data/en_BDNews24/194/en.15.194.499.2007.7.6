 NEW YORK, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Treasury bond prices and stocks fell on Thursday as investors worried about rising inflation pressures, highlighted by a surge in crude oil prices to above $72 per barrel. The dollar firmed modestly after data showing the U.S. service sector enjoyed its strongest growth in a year, which further diminished the already slim chance of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this year. But the euro was still in sight of record highs against the dollar, after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet reiterated warnings about inflation risks in the euro zone. "It is really nervousness on inflation affecting all three markets. You are seeing the potential for oil shocks from Nigeria, reinforcing the whole idea of this gasoline crunch," said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist with Channel Capital Research in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. "Everybody is afraid of it rolling over into core inflation," Roberts added. Crude oil traded in New York briefly topped $72 on the potential for continuing turmoil in OPEC exporter Nigeria. However, it edged back after weekly data showing higher-than-expected U.S. crude oil stockpiles, settling up 40 cents at $71.81 a barrel. Earlier, the Bank of England lifted official interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent and signaled further tightening was in the cards, pushing yields on British government bonds within sight of nine-year highs. The ECB held rates at 4.0 percent. While the decisions by both central banks were as widely expected, investors started looking for hints about when more hikes could come. "The market mover is oil breaking out above $72," said Donald Coxe, global portfolio strategist in Chicago with the BMO Financial Group. "More and more people are commenting on the idea of food and fuel inflation, and that is bond negative," Coxe said. These concerns also worried stock market investors, he said. In late trade, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 40.81 points, or 0.30 percent, at 13,536.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 3.75 points, or 0.25 percent, at 1,521.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.31 point, or 0.01 percent, at 2,645.26. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, following the lead of weaker euro zone debt on global inflation and interest rate concerns and after stronger-than-expected U.S. data on jobs and the services sector. A higher-than-expected ADP report on private sector jobs made bond investors nervous that the June non-farm payrolls data due on Friday might prove robust. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's price fell 26/32 for a yield of 5.16 percent . Bond yields and prices move inversely. The 30-year Treasury bond , which is particularly sensitive to long-term inflation prospects, fell 1-16/32 (48/32) for a yield of 5.25 percent. The September German Bund future fell to 110.10, down 46 ticks, after the ECB's Trichet warned about inflation. Rising bond yields stoked concern among stock market investors about higher borrowing costs, pushing down equities prices and offsetting earlier optimism about a $20 billion buyout of Hilton Hotels Corp. General Motors Corp. dragged on the Dow. The largest U.S. automaker's shares fell in reaction to a steeper-than-expected drop in U.S. sales in June. "There are three things in play. Of course you have gas, prices still high ...Then interest rates are under some pressure to go higher. Finally, we are balancing the last few days' run-up with a correction," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. With inflation worries growing, several major central banks are tightening monetary policy with expectations for rate hikes a key driving force in currency markets. The euro hit a record high versus the low-yielding yen and a two-month high against the dollar. The strength of European currencies helped push the dollar down to its lowest level since January 2005 versus a basket of major currencies. Late in New York, the euro traded little changed on the day at $1.3600, having earlier hit a two-month high of $1.3660, within sight of the all time high above $1.3680 struck at the end of April. The euro was trading flat at 167.06 yen, down from an all-time high of 167.30 yen set earlier in the day, according to Reuters data. On European stock markets, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended unofficially down 0.61 percent at 1,610.24 points. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average edged up 0.3 percent on Thursday, rising for the sixth session in a row, led by Sony Corp. and other exporters as the yen slipped in the currency marke
