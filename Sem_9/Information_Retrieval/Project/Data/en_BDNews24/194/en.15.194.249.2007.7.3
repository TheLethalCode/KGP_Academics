 Chittagong, July 3 (bdnews24.com)-- Joint forces will oversee all export-import activities at Chittagong Customs House, an official said Tuesday. A decision was taken to set up an observation cell for the joint forces to man. Joint commissioner of customs Matiur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the decision came Tuesday at a meeting in the customs house. Customs commissioner Mohammad Fariduddin and military officers were present at the meeting. "The joint forces will work closely with the customs officials from Wednesday onwards. This will check the harassment faced by the exporters and importers." The customs department and joint forces would work on issues like faster discharge of merchandise from the port, strengthening the auction process, speeding up chemical test reports of imported items and supervising the activities of Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI) companies, Rahman added. Rahman said that from now on an army major and a captain would supervise the whole auction process. They had also agreed to establish a joint forces' booth at gate-4 of the port to stop harassment of auction participants. Two other individual cells of the joint forces would deal with issues of chemical tests of imports and the PSI companies. A meeting of the joint forces and the local representatives of the PSI companies would be held July 9, the joint commissioner said. bdnews
