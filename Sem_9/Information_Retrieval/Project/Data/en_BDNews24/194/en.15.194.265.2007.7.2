 NICOSIA, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States military attache in Cyprus was found dead on Monday, four days after he disappeared, the American embassy said. The body of Lt. Colonel Thomas Mooney, 45, was found near his parked car in a remote mountainous region north-west of the island's capital, Nicosia. Local media reported that foul play appeared to have been ruled out, but a police spokeswoman said the cause of death would be determined by a post moretem scheduled for later on Monday. "With deep sadness, I announce that Thomas Mooney, who served his nation with distinction as our Defense Attache, was found dead by Cypriot authorities on Monday," US ambassador Ronald Schlicher said in an announcement on the embassy website. Monney, whom fellow diplomats described as a "straight up military type", was last seen leaving the embassy compound on Thursday afternoon. His body was found some metres (yards) away from his car which was parked on a dirt track. He was believed to have been dead for several days. Mooney arrived in Cuprus on June 2006 for what was his second tour of duty on the island in the past five years. He lived in Cyprus on his own. The American embassy cancelled an Independence Day reception scheduled for Monday evening. "He just came across as a highly disciplined American official doing his job," one diplomat said.
