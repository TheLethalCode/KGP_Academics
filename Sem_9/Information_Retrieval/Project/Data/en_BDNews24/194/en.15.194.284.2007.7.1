<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Senior Awami League leader Abu Sayeed, claimed Sunday that presidium member Abdur Razzak did not make any demand for the exclusion of Sheikh Hasina from the party. Sayeed accused the media of twisting Razzak's personal reform proposals, made during a meeting with the media at his Dhanmondi home on Saturday. Razzak's unendorsed proposals include the election of party leaders from every level by a secret ballot and restricting the posts of president and general secretary to two consecutive terms. Additionally, government and party positions could not be held simultaneously according to Razzak's plan. "Razzak's proposal is not a complete one. It's just a summary. The party's senior leaders will make their proposals in one weeks time," Sayeed said. "All proposals, made by party leaders, will be discussed with grassroots activists before being put to the Awami League Central Working Committee. Endorsement will be required from the council meeting," Sayeed added. AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury said Sunday that the reform proposals were entirely conceived by Razzak alone and went against the Awami League's constitution. Razzak stated that his proposals were a personal conception. bdnews42.
