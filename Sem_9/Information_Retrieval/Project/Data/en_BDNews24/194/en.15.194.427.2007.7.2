 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks finished buoyant Monday amid a rally of shares in almost all sectors as investors bet higher on hopes of better corporate results in the January-June period of 2007. Adjustments of duty structure for imports of industrial raw materials and machinery by the government also raised expectations on manufacturing performances, stakeholders said. "It's a good beginning on the first trading day of the new fiscal year. All the indicators look good," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh that manages over Tk 600 million in funds. The DGEN or general index ended at a new high of 2190.46 points, up 41.14 points or 1.91 percent over that the previous day. The DSI or all-share price index added 32.55 points or 1.84 percent to 1796.73. The DSE-20 blue chip index rose 15.46 points or 0.82 percent to 1897.55 points. "Expectation of better earnings from banks and import duty adjustments in the current year's budget have encouraged the market to rally," he said. Gainers beat leasers 141 to 47. A total of 21 issues finished unchanged. Increased participation in trading pushed the turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange to Tk 2.05 billion from Thursday's Tk 1.34 billion. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied amid surge in the prices of all the sectors, excluding engineering & electrical, and services and property. Turnover rose to Tk 396.92 million from Tk 232.17 million. Of the issues traded, 73 gained, 19 fell and nine closed unchanged. EXIM Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Shahjalal Bank, BRAC Bank and DESCO topped the turnover table on the DSE. There is a notion that banks have successfully recovered losses caused due to the political crisis in the July-December period of outgoing fiscal 2006-07, Sayeed said. EXIM Bank that scored Tk 210.53 million in turnover rallied 11.90 percent to Tk 437. Power Grid advanced to 3.03 percent to Tk 602.25. Shahjalal Bank gained 7.15 percent to Tk 250.75.
