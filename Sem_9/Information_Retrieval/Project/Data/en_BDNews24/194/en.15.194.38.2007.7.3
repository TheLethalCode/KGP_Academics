 LONDON, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police were holding eight people on Tuesday, at least four of them foreign doctors, over a suspected al Qaeda plot against Britain that has triggered a manhunt stretching as far as Australia. One British security source said two of the suspects were Indian, the rest were Middle Eastern and "quite a few" were doctors -- a contrast with recent British conspiracies led by "homegrown" militants, often with modest academic backgrounds. Two of those arrested worked at hospitals in England, one was a doctor in Scotland and Australian police also detained an Indian doctor, Mohamed Haneef, under counter-terrorism laws. Police sources said the other suspects also had medical links. The discovery of two car bombs primed to explode in London's bustling theatre and nightclub district last Friday put a city already attacked by four suicide bombers in 2005 on edge. When a fuel-laden jeep rammed into a Scottish airport the next day, Britain's threat level was raised to its highest level, "Critical" -- meaning more attacks may be imminent. The attacks pose a stern test for Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a Scot who replaced Tony Blair last week and has come under pressure from some quarters to change policy on Iraq and withdraw British troops. A security source said it was "entirely speculative" for media to suggest the doctors formed an al Qaeda sleeper cell smuggled into Britain using their medical profession as cover. "We don't know enough to say whether they were radicalised here or overseas, or how they met," he said. Britain has seen a marked increase in terrorism-related attacks since the Sept. 11 strikes on the United States and its decision to join US forces in invading Iraq in 2003. Muslim leaders praised the government on Tuesday for its "calm and reassuring tone" in handling the crisis and said they recognised there was a problem of extremism in their community. "Those who engage in such murderous actions and those that provide support for them are the enemies of all, Muslim and non-Muslims, and they stand against our shared values in the UK," Muhammad Abdul Bari, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, told a news conference in London. In its statements, the government has not singled out Britain's large Muslim community, nor called for tough new security measures -- a contrast with Blair's administration. ON ALERT Fearing further attacks, police have banned cars and other vehicles from directly approaching airports. With Britons on alert and security measures beefed up at transport hubs, there have been a number of security scares. A terminal at London's Heathrow Airport was evacuated as police investigated a suspicious package, and an object left in a busy west London street was blown up by police. In Scotland, police have carried out four controlled explosions at a hospital linked to at least one of those arrested and at a mosque in the biggest city, Glasgow. Police said they were still looking for other suspects. "It's still an active inquiry. The threat level remains at critical and, until we know for sure, that will probably remain the same," a police source told Reuters. Previous attacks, including one on London's transport system in July 2005 which killed 52 people, have mainly involved disaffected British-born Muslims, not educated professionals from overseas. Of the other doctors held over the plot, British police sources named one as Bilal Abdulla, who qualified in Iraq in 2004, and another as Mohammed Asha, who qualified in Jordan the same year. Asha's wife was also arrested. In Amman, Jordan, Asha's father described his son as a good Muslim and dismissed suggestions that he could be involved in an al Qaeda-style bomb plot. "I am sure Mohammed does not have any links of this nature," he said.
