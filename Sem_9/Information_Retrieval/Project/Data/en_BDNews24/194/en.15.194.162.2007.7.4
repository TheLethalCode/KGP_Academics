 LONDON 4 July 2007 - (bdnews24.com/AFP)A senior British detective headed for Australia Wednesday to question one of eight suspects held over failed attacks in London and Glasgow, as police battled to reconstruct the pieces of the bomb plot. Britain remains on maximum alert following last week's failed bombings, which came only a week before the anniversary Saturday of the July 7, 2005 suicide attacks in London which killed 52. The heightened security threat has been underlined by a series of false alarms this week, including several controlled exposions and the closure of a terminal at London's Heathrow airport on Tuesday, cancelling over 100 flights. But there have so far been no more attacks, and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith declined to confirm reports Wednesday that the national threat level could be lowered back down from 'critical,' to which it was raised on Saturday. 'That is something that will be determined on the basis of the intelligence when it is the right time to do, that is obviously the way it should be,' she said. Some reports Wednesday suggested that police have arrested all the key suspects over the failed double car bombing in London last Friday, which was followed by a fiery attack on Glasgow airport on Saturday. At least six of the suspects are believed to be doctors, including a Jordanian neurosurgeon and an Iraqi doctor, with one being held in Australia after attempting to leave the country. A British counter-terrorism officer was set to arrive in Australia on Thursday to interrogate Mohammed Haneef, a 27-year-old Indian doctor who was arrested at Brisbane international airport Monday. It was not immediately clear if Britain would seek his extradition. Australia's Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said the next action would become clearer within 48 hours. Asked if a decision on whether Haneef would face charges, be freed or be extradited to Britain would be made soon, Keelty replied: 'By the end of the week, I think, is the timeframe that we would give.' Security has been tightened across Britain since two Mercedes cars packed with gas canisters and nails were found in London's entertainment district on Friday. The following day a blazing Jeep Cherokee rammed into the front doors of Glasgow airport's main terminal, and hours later the national security level was raised to 'critical,' meaning another attack is expected 'imminently.' Police say the two attacks were linked and on Wednesday reports emerged that the two men who carried out the Glasgow attack may have been the drivers who abandoned the cars in London. The first arrests in the investigation were made Saturday after police apprehended the two men driving the fiery jeep in Glasgow, one of whom remains in critical condition in hospital. The injured man was identified by British television as Khalid Ahmed, while the other Glasgow suspect has been named as Bilal Abdulla, an Iraqi doctor. On Sunday, a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, believed to be a Jordanian surgeon named by officials in Amman as Mohammed Jamil Abdelkader Asha, and his wife, were arrested. They are now being questioned in London. A fifth suspect, a 26-year-old man, was arrested in Liverpool on Saturday night. On Sunday, two other men, aged 25 and 28, were detained outside Glasgow. Haneef and one of the suspects arrested in Liverpool had both worked at the Halton Hospital near Liverpool, a hospital spokesman said. Police can detain five of the suspects arrested so far until Saturday under Britain's anti-terrorism laws. Britain's main umbrella group of Muslim organisations strongly condemned the London and Glasgow attacks. Meanwhile Muslim leaders voiced concern over 'rising hostility' to their community triggered by the national alert. Police are investigating possible racist motives for a couple of incidents this week in Scotland, including an attack on an Asian newsagents' in Glasg
