 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  Former state minister Mir Mohammad Nasiruddin, if convicted in a corruption case, may face three to 13 years in jail and also see his wealth attached when a special court delivers verdict Wednesday. The court of judge Amar Kumar Roy on June 28 set the date after hearing defence counsels for four days If Mir Nasir's son Mir Md Helaluddin is found guilty of abetting his father in amassing illegal wealth, he may be imprisoned for three years. The Anticorruption Commission (ACC) on Feb. 18 published a list of 50 politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and other graft suspects including Mir Nasir and asked them to submit their wealth statements by a 72-hour deadline. On February 22, Mir Nasir, already detained, submitted an account of his wealth through his representative, putting his properties at more than Tk22.50 crore. ACC deputy director Sharmeen Ferdousi filed a case with Gulshan Police Station against Mir Nasir and his son on March 6. She charged them with suppressing what she said was their having another Tk 24 crore worth of undeclared wealth. Ferdousi accused the father and the son of making the fortune illegally. On April 29, ACC investigation officer Abdullah Al Jahid submitted pressed charges against the two with the court of metropolitan judge Jagannath Das Khokon. He said the accused did not give complete details of their ill-gotten wealth in the statement to the ACC. The case was transferred to the Special Judge's Court-2 housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban on May 6 for hearing and the court designed to try corruption cases framed charges on May 15. As many as 32 witnesses testified before the court until June 18. bdnews24
