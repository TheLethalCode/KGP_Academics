 CAIRO (Mon Jul 2,Reuters) - An Egyptian engineer who was convicted in 2002 of spying for Israel has died in jail of a possible heart attack while serving a 15-year sentence, Egyptian security sources said on Monday. Sherif al-Filali, believed to be in his early 40s, had initially been found innocent of espionage in 2001, and his trial judge called him a true patriot because he turned himself in as soon as he realized he may have been involved in a crime. But President Hosni Mubarak threw out that acquittal and ordered a retrial in an emergency state security court, where Filali was ultimately convicted in 2002 of trying to collect information and data on Egyptian tourism and a large-scale agricultural project for Israel. Security sources said Filali had most likely died of a heart attack, but that an investigation into the cause of death was still ongoing. Filali was among a handful of Egyptians serving jail time for spying for the Jewish state, and his death comes a week after a nuclear engineer at the state-run Atomic Energy Agency was convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in a separate case. In April, an Egyptian-Canadian dual national was also convicted of spying on Israel's behalf by using a job in a bank to get information on specific accounts. He is now serving a 15-year jail term. At the time of Filali's trial, court sources said that a Russian man who was convicted of espionage in absentia recruited Filali in Spain to obtain secret information about Egypt for the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency. Israel has denied any involvement in the case. Court documents said Filali shuttled between Egypt and Spain in 1999 before realizing the information he was collecting was for Mossad. His 15-year sentence was less than the maximum 25-year penalty he could have received for spying in peacetime. Rights groups had criticized the verdict as unfair, but the conviction could not be challenged as rulings in state security courts are not subject for appeal. Filali's arrest was announced shortly after Egypt, which in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv in November 2000, accusing Israel of using excessive force against Palestinians. Egypt returned an ambassador to Israel in 20
