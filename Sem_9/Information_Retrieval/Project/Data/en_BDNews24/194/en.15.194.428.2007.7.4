 GAZA, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alan Johnston, the BBC journalist held hostage in Gaza, was freed and handed over to Palestinian officials early on Wednesday after a late-night deal with the al Qaeda-inspired, clan-based group that kidnapped him in March. Johnston was freed after a fatwa, or edict, from one of the enclave's most senior Muslim clerics and no ransom was paid, an official who helped negotiate the release said. Abu Mujahed, a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees militant group, told Reuters Johnston's captors agreed to listen to the senior cleric, who then issued the edict calling for the journalist's release "without conditions". "It is just the most fantastic thing to be free," he told the BBC live by telephone from the home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. "(But it had been) at times quite terrifying." "I dreamt many times of being free and always woke up back in that room. Now it really is over," said the 45-year-old Scot, adding he had followed events by radio and thanked the public and colleagues for their support throughout his 114-day ordeal. Johnston, smiling and looking well, was embraced by BBC colleagues after arriving by car at the home of Hamas's local leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh. He was ushered inside amid a scrum of well-wishers and guards with Kalashnikov rifles. The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, said it was "extremely relieved". One of those who helped negotiate his release from the Army of Islam group said a leading Muslim cleric had been brought in by mediators to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, calling for Johnston's release. No ransom was attached to the deal, said Abu Mujahed of the Popular Resistance Committees militant group. Khaled Meshaal, the exiled leader of Hamas, said Johnston's release showed his Islamist movement was bringing order to the coastal enclave since seizing control last month after fighting with the Western-backed Fatah faction. Hamas fighters had surrounded the area of Gaza City that is the base of the powerful Doghmush clan, one of whose leaders, officials say, is also a leading figure in the previously obscure Army of Islam. It is unclear how far radical groups, which have emerged this past year in Gaza, are linked to foreign al Qaeda groups. Palestinian officials said Johnston would hold a news conference at Haniyeh's office before being taken to British diplomats for a journey home through Israel. Like most Western powers, Britain shuns Hamas for its refusal to abandon violence against the Jewish state and does not recognise Haniyeh's government in Gaza. However, British diplomats have met Haniyeh in Gaza and discussed Johnston's plight in recent weeks. Reuters journalists saw British diplomatic and BBC vehicles enter Gaza from Israel. Meshaal told Reuters by phone: "The efforts by Hamas have produced the freedom of Alan Johnston." Referring to his rivals from the Fatah faction of Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas, he said: "It showed the difference between the era in which a group used to encourage and commit security anarchy and chaos and the current situation in which Hamas is seeking to stabilise security." The Palestinian ambassador to London, who represents the government Abbas set up last month after dismissing a Hamas-led administration, said Hamas wanted to "capitalise" on the deal. But he said: "The credit goes to the Palestinian people." Johnston, the only Western correspondent working full-time in the troubled coastal enclave, went missing on March 12 when his car was found abandoned. Many weeks later, his captors issued Web videos showing Johnston and seeking the release of Islamists held prisoner by Britain and other states. Most recently, after Hamas officials threatened to free him by force from the clan's stronghold, Johnston was shown wearing a suicide belt with the warning he would die if that happened. Hamas was elected to run the Palestinian government 18 months ago but was shunned by Israel and Western powers. Its local leader, Haniyeh, still considers himself prime minister but Abbas has appointed an emergency government without Hamas involvement in the larger territory of the West Ba
