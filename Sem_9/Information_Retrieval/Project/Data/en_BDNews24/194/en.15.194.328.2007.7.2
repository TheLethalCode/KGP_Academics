 Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed Monday said a person should not be allowed to hold the post of president or general secretary for more than two straight terms. Echoing his party colleague Abdur Razzak, the former industry minister proposed that the party chief has to resign the post to become prime minister. The rules should also apply to district and upazila units, Tofail told reporters at his Dhanmondi home. He said reform is now demand of the time. The party council will decide which one to be final, Tofail said referring to his written plan and Razzak's. Tofail suggested sharing power between the prime minister and the president to strike a balance. "What happened in the last five years, such as looting and repression, would not take place if the president would have powers." Tofail stressed amending the article 70 of the constitution to make it up to date. "A person elected as a member of parliament at an election at which he was nominated as a candidate by a political party shall vacate his seat if he resigns from that party or votes in parliament against the party," the article says. According to Tofail's proposal, any party worker, convicted of crime by the Supreme Court, will lose his party post and would not be given a party ticket to the polls. "There must be reforms to the Awami League and it will be without a split." He asked party colleagues to be cautious about the conspirators within. Stressing joint leadership, the AL leader said it was necessary to restore democratic process to the party and ensure accountability. The controversial fatwa deal with Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish was the result of unilateralism, he said. Tofail proposed that the party treasurer must place the financial statement of the party at its quarterly meeting for transparency of funds. He hailed the caretaker government. "This government did a lot of good work. We should cooperate with the government instead of leaving us in dispute. "We are not against the government. I don't know why we have to stand against it anyway," the former minister said. Tofail said advisers should not make the government controversial by their remarks. bdnews
