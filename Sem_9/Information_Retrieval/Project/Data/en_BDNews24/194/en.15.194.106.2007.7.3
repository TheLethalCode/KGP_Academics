 ISLAMABAD Tue Jul 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani paramilitary trooper was shot dead during gunfire from a mosque run by a Taliban-style movement during clashes between security forces and Islamic students in Islamabad on Tuesday. The clashes began when around 150 students attacked a security picket at a government office near the mosque, snatched weapons and took four government officials hostage, according to police. "I can confirm that one of our troopers has been killed in the firing from inside the mosque," Masha Allah, a senior paramilitary official, told reporters outside Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque. Paramilitary forces fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of students outside the mosque, and came under fire from automatic weapons. "We retaliated with tear gas after which gunshots were fired from inside the mosque," Zafar Iqbal, a senior police official said. "They have also taken away with them four officials of the government office," he added. Authorities have been locked in a tense stand-off for months with the student movement, which is seeking to impose Taliban-style social values in the Pakistani capital. The government has hitherto refrained from using force, out of fear that it could provoke threatened suicide attacks. Concern that casualties among female students could result in a backlash from religious conservatives around the country has also stayed the government's hand. Last Friday, President Pervez Musharraf said suicide bombers from an al Qaeda-linked militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, were holed up in the mosque, and warned that the authorities were ready to take action. Jaish was primarily focused on fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, but some of its members later forged links with Osama bin Laden's network. Musharraf, who survived two al Qaeda-inspired assassination attempts, said the government had tried to resolve the standoff through negotiations to avoid bloodshed in the sprawling mosque complex, which also houses a religious seminary, or madrasa. Deployment in recent days of large numbers of paramilitary troops in the neighborhood had fuelled speculation that the authorities patience was running out. During the clashes on Tuesday appeals were made on the mosque's loudspeakers for residents of Islamabad to come to the mosque and help the students and 'mujahideen', or holy warriors. Burqa-clad women stood on the rooftops of an adjacent madrasa, shouting anti-government slogans, while male students armed with staves guarded the entrances to the compound, and some were seen brandishing Kalashnikov rifles. The Red Mosque has long been known as a hotbed of Islamic radicalism in Islamabad but trouble began in January when female students attached to the mosque occupied a library next to their madrasa to protest over a campaign to knock down mosques built illegally on state la
