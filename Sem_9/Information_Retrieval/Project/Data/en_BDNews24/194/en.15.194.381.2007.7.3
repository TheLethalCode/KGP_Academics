 SYDNEY, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand will host five tests and eight limited-overs internationals in a hectic summer schedule involving Bangladesh and England. The Blackcaps will play three tests against England in March, in Hamilton, Wellington and Napier, and two against Bangladesh in January. The first test against Bangladesh will be played in Dunedin, marking the first time in a decade a test has been played in the southern island city. Bangladesh will also play two warm-ups and three one-day internationals in December while England will play two practice games against Canterbury before seven one-dayers, plus two Twenty20 games, in February. "Bangladesh showed at the ICC Cricket World Cup that they are a steadily improving side who can be dangerous if underestimated" New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said in a statement. "And New Zealand crowds always enjoy turning out to watch a visiting English side." "This is a comprehensive tour by England and we are expecting a large number of English fans to travel to New Zealand for the series." New Zealand are also planning a reciprocal tour of England next year
