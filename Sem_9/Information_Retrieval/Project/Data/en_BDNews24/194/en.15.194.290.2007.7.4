 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks finished mixed Wednesday with profit-taking driving bank and power sector shares down. Buying pressure pushed insurance stocks up after the sector regulator moved to revise existing insurance laws. Non-bank financial institutions and state-run companies went high.
