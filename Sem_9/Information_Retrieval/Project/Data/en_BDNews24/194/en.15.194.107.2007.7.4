<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Narcotics Control Act is being redesigned to hand down life imprisonment for the worst drug offenders, an official said Wednesday. Director (administration) of the Narcotics Control Directorate Fazlur Rahman Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com that an amended narcotics control law was under active consideration. Under the amended law, drug dealers, drug couriers and those in possession of drugs will be punished by a minimum two years' jail to a maximum life sentence depending on the nature and gravity of the offence. The directorate has submitted a draft legal instrument to the home ministry, which held a meeting Sunday in this connection. The finalisation of the law will take time, ministry and narcotics control officials said. After the ministerial deliberations are over, the final draft will be forwarded to the advisory council for approval. A home ministry official said as per the draft law: a person found to be carrying up to 5 grams of 'yabba' or an equivalent narcotic will be liable to be punished by a minimum of two years to a maximum of five years in jail. For carrying 5 to 25 grams, offenders will be given a minimum five years to a maximum 10 years imprisonment. And for people handling more than 25 grams the punishment will be from 10 years to life-term in prison. The existing legal provision for similar narcotics-related offences ranges from a minimum six months to a maximum seven years imprisonment. In a bid to dispose of about 35,000 pending narcotics related cases, and also for quick trial of new cases, the establishment of a separate court has also been recommended in the draft amendment. bdnews2
