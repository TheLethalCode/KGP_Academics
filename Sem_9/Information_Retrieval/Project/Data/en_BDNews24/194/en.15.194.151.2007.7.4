<TITLE> Govt set for expansion to smooth work: spokesman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) - The interim cabinet has decided to expand the "size of the government" with the appointment of more people to support its day-to-day activities, an official spokesman said Wednesday. But they would not be called advisers, Syed Fahim Munaim, press secretary to the chief adviser, told reporters after a meeting of the council of advisers. According to the country's constitution, a total of 11 advisers including the chief adviser could be appointed to the caretaker government. "Appointments of new people are a must to manage huge workload of the advisers. The government is trying to determine how it could expand the size of the government without calling the new appointees advisers," Munaim said. The whole thing about who would be appointed, what portfolios they would get or what they would be called was not clear yet. But because of huge work pressure and an unusually lengthy tenure of the makeshift government, the cabinet has moved to smooth its daily activities. The previous two caretaker governments in 1996 and 2001 did not need to face the same problems as they were in power for only 90 days in line with the constitution. But the military-backed government, which is on a mission of purging the country of political corruption, seems to hold on to power until the end of next year in the least. Munaim broke the news that an earlier cabinet meeting had asked the law ministry to scrutinise constitutional provisions on how the expansion plan can get through. The ministry had started work on it, he said. If necessary, the government will seek guidance from the Supreme Court for a clear explanation of the constitutional provisions about the pros and cons of the caretaker government. He, however, said the Law Commission had already informed the ministry that increasing the number of advisers beyond 11 is not possible in line with the constitution. Munaim said the newcomers could be installed as associates or advisers to the incumbent advisers of the interim government. bdnews24.c
