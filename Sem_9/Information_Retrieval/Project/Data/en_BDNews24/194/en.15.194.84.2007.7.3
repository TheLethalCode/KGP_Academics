 CHICAGO Tue Jul 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nearly one in three Americans abuse or become dependent on alcohol over the course of their lives, and most never seek treatment, according to a study published on Monday. It found that 17.8 percent said they had abused alcohol at some point over the course of their lives and another 12.5 percent said they were dependent on it at some point, for a total of 30.3 percent. At the time of the survey 4.7 percent said they had abused alcohol in the past year and 3.8 percent said they were alcohol-dependent in the previous 12 months. And just about a quarter, 24 percent, are ever treated for it, the researchers reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry. "Alcohol use disorders continue to present a widespread and serious personal and public health problem in the United States," Deborah Hasin of Columbia University Medical Center in New York and colleagues wrote.
