 PUERTO LA CRUZ, Venezuela, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending champions Brazil beat Ecuador 1-0 to complete the quarter-final line-up at the Copa America on Wednesday after Chile had also advanced to the last eight by holding Mexico to a goalless draw. The results mean that United States and Colombia, who each lost their opening two matches, were eliminated before meeting in their last game in Group C on Thursday. Robinho, the only player to have scored for Brazil in the first round, notched his fourth goal of the tournament as his penalty gave his side a fortuitous win. Earlier, Chile and Mexico were booed off the field after opening the Group B double-header with a dismal match. Mexico topped Group B with seven points, followed by Brazil on six and Chile with four. Ecuador propped up the table after losing all three of their games. Chile qualified as the best of the two third-placed teams in the three groups and will meet Brazil again in their quarter-final in Puerto La Cruz on Saturday. Hosts Venezuela will meet Uruguay, who finished as the second third-placed team, in San Cristobal the same day. The only issue to be sorted out is the order in which Paraguay and Argentina finish in Group C. The teams each have six points from their first two games and meet on Thursday with Paraguay needing a draw to finish top. The winners will play Peru in Barquisimeto on Sunday and the losers take on Mexico in Maturin. "Whoever it is, I'm sure they'll be worried about facing Mexico," Mexican coach Hugo Sanchez told reporters after his team's result. Mexico, already qualified, and Chile, needing a point, produced the tournament's second goalless stalemate in match devoid of goalmouth action. However, there were no apologies from either coach afterwards. "We didn't want to get caught in their trap and play the type of game they wanted," Sanchez added. "We qualified and that's what is important. Football depends a lot upon the moment," Chile coach Nelson Acosta said. They were followed by Brazil and Ecuador, who both played to win but failed to create many chances. The breakthrough came as Brazil were awarded a 56th minute penalty when Robinho fell theatrically under a challenge from Giovanny Espinoza. The Real Madrid player took the kick himself and scored with a low shot into the right hand corner. "It's very difficult for Brazil because the other teams close up against us," coach Dunga said
