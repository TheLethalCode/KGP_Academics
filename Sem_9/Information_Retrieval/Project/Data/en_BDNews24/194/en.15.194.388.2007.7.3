 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Monday said the embezzlement of UK-based Bangladeshis' nine million pounds by a money transferring company would come to a 'satisfactory resolution'. "We hope we will be able to reach a satisfactory resolution. We have already contacted the British High Commission here and Bangladesh mission in the UK," Ahmed said. His assurance came when he talked to reporters after distributing certificates among the central bank's new assistant directors at Bangladesh Bank Training Academy. In the wake of embezzlement charges, First Solution Money Transfer Ltd declared itself bankrupt on June 29 and shut its UK office. The company had earlier received about nine million pounds from the expatriate Bangladeshis in the UK. The company offered expatriates higher exchange rates against pounds for transfer. Ahmed said his office had summoned those banks that had remittance facilities or drawing arrangements with First Solution. "We are examining how much money the banks received from First Solution," he said. "We are investigating the matter." Ahmed said the risk-weighted capital requirement for money transferring companies would be raised to check frauds. According to Bangladesh Bank, Uttara Bank, Eastern Bank, NCC Bank, Southeast Bank and Mutual Trust Bank and BRAC Bank had drawing arrangements with First Solution. b
