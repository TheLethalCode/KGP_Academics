 SYDNEY Sat Jun 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister John Howard is secretly planning to begin withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq by February 2008, Australian media reported on Sunday.

"Whenever one agrees with an ally about any subject, it's better than if one disagrees and there's always a tension or a stress on a relationship," he said.
