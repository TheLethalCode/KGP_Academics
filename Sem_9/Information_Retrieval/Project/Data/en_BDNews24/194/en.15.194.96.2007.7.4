 ISLAMABAD, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani authorities imposed a curfew around a mosque in the capital on Wednesday after 11 people were killed in clashes with security forces, and militant Islamic students were ordered to lay down their weapons. Violence erupted on Tuesday after a months-long stand-off between a Taliban-style movement headquartered at Islamabad's Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque. Firing between paramilitary forces and students holed up inside rang out throughout Tuesday afternoon, becoming more sporadic overnight. Soldiers moved 12 armoured personnel carriers, mounted with machineguns, into the area shortly before dawn broke. Power was cut to the neighbourhood where the mosque is located soon after dark on Tuesday and soldiers joined paramilitary troops in sealing off streets with barbed wire. Authorities said journalists should also leave the area. Liberal politicians have been pressing President Pervez Musharraf to crack down on Lal Masjid's militant clerics and their followers, who have threatened suicide attacks if action was taken against them. The religious hardliners have confronted authorities for months, running a vigilante anti-vice campaign and campaigning for observance of strict Islamic law. Authorities had not used force for fear it could provoke attacks or lead to casualties among female students at a religious school, or madrasa, in the mosque compound. The Interior Ministry said nine people had been killed but hospital officials later said the toll had risen to 11. SURRENDER CALL Deputy Interior Minister Zafar Warraich told an early Wednesday news conference broadcast live on television that a curfew had been imposed in the neighbourhood around the mosque. Speaking after Musharraf met top security officials, Warraich said warnings would be broadcast over loudspeakers for students to lay down their weapons and surrender. No action would be taken against those who did but anyone who tried to fight would be shot, he said. "A bullet will be responded with by a bullet," he said. Asked if security forces would launch an assault on the fortified mosque compound, he said: "We are not going to go inside and attack. We want them to come out and surrender." But one young woman at the madrasa was defiant. "We're nervous but not scared," the student, Mahira, said by telephone. "Nobody wants to leave. Your faith gets stronger in a situation like this." She said thousands of people were in the compound. Many women students were seen leaving on Tuesday and anxious parents turned up to take children home. The violence comes at a bad time for Musharraf who has been facing a campaign against him by lawyers and the opposition since he suspended the country's top judge in March. He is also preparing for presidential and general elections. Tuesday's clashes began when students attacked a security post at a nearby government office and snatched weapons, police said. Paramilitary forces fired tear gas outside the mosque to disperse hundreds of students, including women in black, all-enveloping burqas, and then came under fire. Someone in the mosque later used a loudspeaker to call for suicide attacks, although a cleric there denied to Reuters that any such order had been given. About 150 people were taken to hospital on Tuesday, 30 with bullet wounds, others suffering from the effects of tear gas. The 5,000 or so students affiliated with the mosque range in age from teenagers to people in their 30s, many from conservative areas near the Afghan border. They study under firebrand clerics and have been campaigning against vice and for Islamic law. Trouble began in January when students occupied a library next to their madrasa to protest against the destruction of mosques built illegally on state land. They later kidnapped women, some from China, at two places they said were brothels. They also abducted poli
