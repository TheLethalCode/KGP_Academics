<TITLE> Edwards on song as West Indies keep England to 225 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were restricted to 225 all out after West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards ripped into their batsmen in Sunday's one-day match at Lord's. Edwards took full advantage of about an hour's interruption due to rain to wreak havoc with England's middle and late order, finishing with five wickets for 45 runs from his 10 overs. Paul Collingwood was among the victims, lasting only seven balls and managing only five runs in his first 50-overs game since being appointed England's one-day captain. England were out with a ball to spare when Owais Shah, whose display on Friday squared the two-match Twenty/20 series, was run out after boosting the total with a creditable 42. Put into bat for the first three one-day games, England had been little more than solid against the straight, accurate bowling of the tourists. Openers Alastair Cook (29), caught by Dwayne Bravo after he skied his pull shot from a tricky Edwards delivery, and Matt Prior (34), trapped lbw by Dwayne Smith, set the tone. Ian Bell, back from a groin injury, injected more bite into the batting before being run out after some sharp fielding by West Indies captain Chris Gayle on 56. Kevin Pietersen bowed out on 33 to a smart catch by Marlon Samuels at backward point, just as England were stepping up the run rate to around six an over. Rain then intervened in the 42nd over with England on 181 for four and effectively killed their momentum. Collingwood went soon after the re-start and Dimitri Mascarenhas, Liam Plunkett and Stuart Broad all followed in quick succession as Edwards tidied up, leaving the West Indies with a realistic target for their innings
