 Prodip Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced former state minister Mir Mohammad Nasiruddin to 13 years in jail for amassing wealth by illegal means. The BNP leader's son Mir Mohammad Helaluddin was sentenced to three years in prison, as he was found guilty of abetting his father in raking in illegal wealth. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Judge's Court-2, set up at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, also fined Mir Nasir Tk 50 lakh. He will have to serve another two years in jail in failure to pay the fine. His son has to pay Tk 1 lakh in fine or serve one more month in jail in failure to pay the fine. The Anticorruption Commission on Feb 18 published a list of 50 politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and other graft suspects including Mir Nasir and asked them to submit their wealth statements by a 72-hour deadline. On Feb 22, Mir Nasir, already detained, submitted an account of his wealth through his representative, putting his property at more than Tk 22.50 crore. ACC deputy director Sharmeen Ferdousi filed a case with Gulshan Police Station against Mir Nasir and his son on March 6. She charged them with suppressing what she said was their having another Tk 24 crore worth of undeclared wealth. Ferdousi accused the father and the son of making the fortune illegally. On April 29, ACC investigation officer Abdullah Al Jahid submitted pressed charges against the two with the court of metropolitan judge Jagannath Das Khokon. He said the accused did not give complete details of their ill-gotten wealth in the statement to the ACC. The case was transferred to the Special Judge's Court-2 housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban on May 6 for hearing and the court designed to try corruption cases framed charges on May 15. As many as 32 witnesses testified before the court until June 18. bd
