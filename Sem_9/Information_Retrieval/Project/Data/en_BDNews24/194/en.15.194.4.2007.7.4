 Dhaka, July 04 (bdnews24.com) - The government plans 56 BDR-controlled markets in the city to keep prices of essentials stable prior to Ramadan, an adviser said Wednesday. "Prices of essential commodities will come under control once the markets open," rural development and cooperatives adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters. Out of the 56, six will be wholesale markets and 50 retail ones. Two wholesale markets will be set up in Uttara and two in Jatrabari, and one each in Gabtali and Shahidbazar. Shoppers would not be charged extra as the BDR would be in control of the markets, the adviser said. bdnews24.c
