 Colombo, July 3 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh plunged to their lowest-ever innings total of 62 all out in the second ball after lunch as Sri Lankan bowlers shredded them on the first day of the second Test at the P Saravanamuttu Stadium Tuesday. Off-spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan cleaned up Shahadat Hossain for one to take his tally to 4 for 14 after Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene had won the toss and put the Tigers in. Rajin Saleh, the lone fighter, top-scored with 21 off 62 balls before he was caught by Jayawardene off Muralitharan. Lankan tearaway Lasith Malinga tore through the Tigers' top order with four for just 25 runs. Paceman Dilhara Fernando with two for 16, and Muralitharan then joined the fun. Bangladesh folded for just 86 runs against the same rivals at R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, back in 2005 for the lowest total but the visitors will have to pull off a miracle to go past the total given the mindless strokeplay their batsmen have produced so far. Mohammad Rafique (2) was caught by Chaminda Vaas off Muralitharan, who also had Mushfiqur Rahim caught behind wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene for nine. First-change Fernando bowled debutant Mehrab Hossain Jr, who had looked promising on his debut, for six and had Mashrafee Bin Mortaza caught by Jayawardene for a two-ball duck. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful was a was unlucky to be caught at short leg by Malinda Warnapura off Malinga for a three-ball duck. Warnapura took a stunning reflex catch as Ashraful flicked off his pad. Malinga rattled the visitors upfront as he sent back Shahriar Nafees, Javed Omar, Habibul Bashar and Mohammad Ashraful in a row to reduce Bangladesh to to 22 for four. Former skipper Bashar edged a simple catch to Mahela Jayawardne at second slip in the 10th over. Malinga with his slingy action first trapped Nafees leg before for a five-ball duck in his first over before having Javed Omar caught behind by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene for eight. Bangladesh brought three changes to the playing eleven that had featured in the first Test. Wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim, uncapped Mehrab Hossain Jr and seamer Mohammad Sharif replaced Khaled Mashud, Saqib Al Hasan and spinner Abdur Razzak. Sri Lanka decided to go in with an unchanged squad that beat the visitors by an innings and 234 runs in the first Test. bdnew
