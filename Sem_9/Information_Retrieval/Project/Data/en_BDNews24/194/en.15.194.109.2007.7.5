 Chapainawabganj, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities have sued 5,000 fertiliser-starved farmers who went berserk Wednesday, attacking government officials and setting ablaze files at the office of local government administrator in Nachole, police said. Nachole police chief Fazlur Rahman said Thursday Imdadul Haque, office superintendent of the upazila nirbahi officer (UNO), filed the case late Wednesday. Nobody, however, was arrested until late Thursday, he said. Thousands of farmers Wednesday went on the rampage in the area after the UNO allegedly assaulted a local agriculture department officer over distribution of tokens for rationing fertiliser. The angry farmers swooped on the office of the UNO and other government establishments in the upazila headquarters as the violence spread fast. Four people including UNO Manjur Morshed were injured in the violence. They smashed windows, doors and other furniture at the UNO office and set fire to many official documents. Many of the farmers, witnesses and upazila administration officials blamed the UNO who is known among his colleagues for having a short fuse for the incident. Rajshahi divisional commissioner Shafiul Alam and other top officials of the district administration visited Nachole to know of the incident in details. Alam along with the deputy commissioner and the district's police chief sat in a closed-door meeting with UNO Monzur Morshed at his home. After the meeting, additional district magistrate Mostafizur Rahman said the top officials reviewed the situation and decided to dig deep. Rahman, the convener of a three-member probe committee formed Wednesday, said their investigation was on. He hoped to submit a report soon. Meanwhile, several local officials on condition of anonymity told bdnews24.com that the UNO has taken a week's leave, and magistrate Iqbal Hossain will stand in for him. Some of the farmers who were the part of the Wednesday's mob came to the Upazila Parishad premises Thursday and heard about the case against them. The farmers alerted at the news started leaving the area, fearing arrest. There was no rush in fertiliser dealers' shops in the area Thursday. Some fertiliser dealers said they have enough stock of fertiliser. Mujibur Rahman of Niloy Enterprise at Nachole Bazaar said he got 787 sacks of urea on July 2 and was expecting another 50 metric tons of fertiliser. He will start distributing fertiliser among farmers from Friday morning. Jamirul Islam, another fertiliser dealer at Nachole Bazaar, said he has a stock of 179 metric tons of fertiliser which he will start distributing from Friday. Nachole upazila agriculture officer Abul Kalam Azad said Aus has been cultivated in 9,600 hectares of land this year but the dealers have got only 382 metric tons of fertiliser against a demand of 1,795 metric tons in July. He, however, said there was no crisis of fertiliser. But another official preferring not to be named said Wednesday's crisis brewed from a fertiliser. Several farmers also said they got a tiny portion of fertiliser over past few days. Abdul Manik, Ayeshuddin of Ujirpur village, Amir Ali of Bijlipara, Rezaul and Nazibur of Kosba village who came to collect token said after planting Aus paddy each of them got only 15 kilograms of fertiliser. They said they would need 10 kilograms of fertiliser per bigha now. The farmers of Nachole demanded a proper distribution of fertiliser in the area to ease the tension. They also demanded that the authorities withdraw the case and remove the UNO. bdnews24.c
