<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  A late header from Azmol Hossain Biddyut helped Muktijoddha Sangsad KS edge past Brothers Union by 1-0 goal in the second-leg match of the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday. The eighth triumph in 16 outings put Muktijoddha Sangsad on the top of the 11-team point table with 30 points, one point ahead of jointly second-placed Dhaka Abahani Limited and Dhaka Mohammaedan Sporting Club, who played a match more than Abahani's 14. Brothers Union, on the other hand, have almost quit the title race after conceding their fourth defeat in 15 matches. They were now relegated to the fifth position with 23 points. Muktijoddha Sangsad, who drew against Farashganj SC and Chittagong Abahani Limited in a row, were a bit lucky to have the decider after surviving several attacks by Brothers Union, who lost to the same rivals 2-0 in the first-leg match. The All-Orange outfit, Brothers, enjoyed comparatively superior ball possession and launched several attacks, but their shaky strikers failed to convert those efforts despite getting the opponent's net open. Muktijoddha Sangsad, however, launched the first attack in the 16th minute, but Brothers' goalie Nizamuddin frustrated Saifur Rahman Moni, who took a powerful shot capitalising a Rokonuzzaman Khanchan minus. Then, Brothers Union dominated the entire first half with Nigerian striker Elijah Obagbemiro Junior feeding the ball three times, but Monwar Hossain, Junior himself and Ashraful Kader Manju disappointed the two-time Premier League champions sending the ball outside. Ten minutes into the second half, Shakil Ahmed frustrated Brothers again sending the ball wide after dodging past two defenders with only opponent's goalkeeper Titumir Chowdhury to beat. Azmol Hossain Biddyut did not mistake to put the All-Red outfit ahead in the 80th minute as the midfielder headed home after Khanchan failed to meet a Moni cross from the right. Just two minutes later, Brothers Union could have equalised the margin, but the luck was not with them as a Mehdi Hasan Tapu header off a Liton cross was denied by the crossbar and Muktijoddha defender Firoz Mahmud Titu cleared the ball from the goal line to frustrate Brothers.
