<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government will not spare any corruption suspect whether or not they are pro-reform politicians, an adviser said Sunday. "A corrupt person is corrupt. We will take action against them whether they are for reforms or against reforms," communications adviser MA Matin told reporters in his office. "Those who are retiring on their own are doing a good job. The reforms must come from within. It is a first step toward bringing democracy to the parties," he said when asked if he supported Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad's decision to quit active politics. Matin said the efforts to bring changes to the political parties are good signs. bdnews24
