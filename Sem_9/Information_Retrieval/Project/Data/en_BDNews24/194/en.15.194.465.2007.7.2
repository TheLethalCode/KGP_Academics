<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian prosecutors have brought criminal charges against emigre tycoon Boris Berezovsky on suspicion of plotting to seize power, his lawyer said on Monday. "He has been charged with conspiring to seize power in a violent coup," Andrei Borovkov, Berezovsky's lawyer told journalists. Berezovsky lives in Britain where he has been granted refugee status. The charge was brought by Russia's FSB secret service and related to an interview the tycoon gave to Britain's Guardian newspaper in April in which he was quoted as saying force was needed to bring about a change of power in Russia. There was no immediate confirmation from officials that the charges had been brought. Relations between Britain and Russia have become strained following the death from poisoning in London last year of Russian emigre and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko.
