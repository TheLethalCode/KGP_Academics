 Colombo, July 3 (bdnews24.com) - Sri Lanka took a giant step towards clinching the series Tuesday, securing a 92-run lead at the close of the first day of the second Test after Bangladesh plunged to their lowest-ever innings total of 62 at the P Saravanamattu Stadium. Sri Lanka were 154 for one at stumps when bad light and rains forced to stop the play with 19 overs to go. The hosts won the first of the three-Test series by an innings and 234 runs. Malinda Warnapur was heading for his maiden hundred in only his second Test with an unbeaten 79 after the opener scored a duck on debut in the first innings of the first Test. Kumar Sangakkara was batting on 51, his 23rd Test fifty. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was the lone successful Bangladesh bower, who bowled opener Michael Vandort for a 51-ball 14. Put in by Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, Bangladesh batsmen repeated the familiar show of reckless strokeplay. It was another nightmare for the Tigers, who had been bundled out under 100 runs for the eighth time -- four times against Sri Lanka -- in 48 Tests since they got Test status in 2000. In the first Test, Bangladesh managed to edge past their lowest-ever total of 86 against the same rivals in Colombo, back in 2005, after getting all out for 89 in the first innings. The Tigers made three changes to their side that had suffered a massive defeat in the first Test, but it made no difference as eight batsmen fell with single-digit scores. Only Rajin Saleh produced some resistance with a 62-ball 21 in 107 minutes. Off-spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan cleaned up Shahadat Hossain for one to take his tally to 4 for 14 after Lasith Malinga tore through Bangladesh's top order with his fierce spell of four for just 25. Dilhara Fernando chipped in with two for 16. Malinga rattled the visitors upfront as he sent back Shahriar Nafees, Javed Omar, Habibul Bashar and Mohammad Ashraful in a row to reduce Bangladesh to 22 for four. Opener Nafees was trapped lbw by a fierce delivery from Malinga for a five-ball duck. Soon, Javed (8) followed Nafees giving a catch behind to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene. Struggling immediate past captain Bashar fell on five edging an easy catch to Mahela Jayawardne at second slip before skipper Ashraful became Malinga's fourth victim in the same over. Ashraful was unlucky to be caught at short leg by Malinda Warnapura off Malinga for a three-ball duck. Warnapura took a stunning reflex catch as the Bangladesh skipper flicked off his pad to leave the side at a precarious position. First-change Fernando bowled debutant Mehrab Hossain Jr, who had started promisingly, for six before Muralitharan had teenage wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim (9) caught behind the wicket with a doosra in his second over. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was caught by Jayawardene at the second slip off Fernando for a two-ball duck while Mohammad Rafique swiped Murali to be caught by Chaminda Vaas at deep square leg for a two-ball two. Muralitharan then had Rajin Saleh caught by Mahela at first slip with a doosra and cleaned up Shahadat Hossain for one in successive overs to sink Bangladesh again. Sri Lanka decided to go in with an unchanged squad that beat the visitors by an innings and 234 runs in the first Test. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Javed Omar, Shahriar Nafees, Habibul Bashar, Rajin Saleh, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Rafique, Shahadat Hossain and Mohammad Sharif. Sri Lanka: Mahela Jayawardene, Michael Vandort, Kumar Sangakkara, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralitharan, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando and Malinda Warnapura. bd
