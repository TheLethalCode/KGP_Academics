 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Beleaguered Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil has begged the government to free him from prison as he decided to call time on his political career and blasted Sheikh Hasina for her "authoritarian" leadership. "I have decided to retire from politics because of my physical condition and looking at the faces of my children and family," Jalil, known to be a close aide to Hasina for his unflinching loyalty to the former prime minister, said in a letter to the chief adviser dated July 2. The stunning twist in the emergency-era political tale has caught many in the Awami League struggling to stomach the shock. His wife Rehana Jalil Thursday morning handed copies of the letter signed by Jalil to journalists at a press briefing at their Gulshan home. She said her husband's life is at stake in the prison. She has also appealed to the president and the chief adviser to release her husband now under treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital under police guard. Jalil was arrested from his Mercantile Bank office in Motijheel on May 28. "I humbly request (the government) to release me and not to increase my detention on humanitarian grounds," said the statement addressed to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Jalil came down hard on the party chief for what he said was her authoritarian leadership. He said Hasina's stand against the makeshift government was not shared by the party and him. "If the Awami League cannot be freed from this absolute leadership, it will bring dire consequences to the party and the country. "A change should come soon. A string of mistakes and damage occurred in the party because of this," Jalil said. The AL leader said people with no political ideals have been promoted in the party because of the failure of the leadership. Jalil said the 58-year old party has lost its democratic characteristics and accused Hasina of being extremely authoritarian. "The party president has used her authority in a way that there is no scope to avoid her decisions." Hasina was not ready to listen to others in the party, he said. Referring to the political changeover on Jan 11 when a state of emergency was declared, Jalil said his party welcomed the new development and Hasina along with some other senior party colleagues attended the oath-taking ceremony of the chief adviser. He said the party had decided to continue to support the makeshift government to see the much-sought reforms to the electoral system. "But all on a sudden, trashing the party's decision, the party chief demanded immediate election without giving time to the government. None in the party supported her position," the letter said. He also accused the party chief of standing against the central working committee's decision taken on March 3 that opposed her demand of new elections by June. He recalled Hasina's statement that she and her party would ratify all activities of the government if voted to power. But she made contradictory statements when she was abroad, causing immense harm to the party, he added. "I was elected the party's general secretary at a council meeting. But I had to run myself as per the party chief's wish and direction. "I have tried to make her understand but failed. I have worked following her orders and against my conscience so that the party's unity is intact. "Then the question comes as to why I did not resign. The post of the AL general secretary is held in huge respect. Millions of party activists honour the position. "I could not do away with the greed of getting this honour. It's my failure. I am ashamed of that. I am sorry," the statement read. bdnews24.
