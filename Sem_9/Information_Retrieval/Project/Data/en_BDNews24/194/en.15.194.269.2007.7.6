<TITLE> New chief eyes reforms to restore democracy in JP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party's acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud simply wants "more democracy" in the party and says getting the house in order and reforming the party are his main tasks. The new supreme of JP, often dogged by bitter controversy and rebellion, has drawn up a plan to practise more democracy: Curbing the all-powerful chairman's authority and establishing context for shared decision making, a transparent party fund and a corruption-free nomination process. Mahmud, who recently took charge of the ailing but strategically important political platform, spelled out his future plan of action and other thoughts to bdnews24.com in a telephone interview Friday. A close aide to once omnipotent ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, Mahmud proposed new paradigm of balance of power between the prime minister and the president. Since the president is only a constitutional figurehead in the country's wobbling parliamentary democracy, Mahmud said: "A change is imminent." He proposed more power to the president. Since Tuesday when he got the new assignment from Ershad, Mahmud tried to make his position clear with words that he really wanted a democratic Jatiya Party in the new reality under the current regime backed by the influential military. During the announcement of his successor, Ershad also said he has no intention to run for the party's top post in the future. Ershad's long time party colleague and wife Rowshan Ershad, however, could not reportedly be happy with the new decision. Mahmud, a barrister, is trying to find his foot amid allegations that his tricky boss has pushed him ahead to create a comfort zone to absorb reported pressure from the makeshift government. Asked whether there was any schism inside the party, Mahmud emphatically said: "There's no division in the Jatiya party. We are all members of a family led by Ershad." About Rowshan's announcement that she is the acting chairperson of the party, Mahmud said: "She is a self-styled leader. The party constitution does not allow her to declare herself as the acting chief. She has worked completely against the party constitution." "The party is now disorganised. The grassroots activists are also confused. This is the time to restore confidence of the party activists. Only in this way can the party emerge as a strong political force and move ahead." To bring changes within, Mahmud, who had successfully negotiated with the Awami League-led political camp for an election alliance for the forestalled Jan. 22 polls, said balancing the power between the party chairman and the party presidium could bring meaningful changes toward a true democratisation of the party. He also thinks increasing the power of the party's executive committee should also get priority. "Any major decision should be taken collectively instead of unilaterally. That must be done through discussion at the party's highest decision-making body." "Accountability in raising the party fund should be ensured. Otherwise, corruption cannot be checked. Mahmud, a former foreign minister, is also against the long-practiced tradition of nominating party candidates. He thinks current nomination system encourages black money holders to come into politics. "A black money holder will buy nomination, it must be stopped. The politics must be freed from this vicious cycle." To make the national parliament functional, the lawmakers must be allowed to voice their concerns in the parliament, Mahmud said. He proposed necessary amendment to the Article 70 of the constitution, which does not allow a lawmaker to vote against his party's decision inside the parliament. "A lawmaker must be allowed to speak freely in the parliament on all issues except finance bill and no-confidence motion," he said. "It will make the parliament the centre of everything." He also proposed election of a non-partisan person as the speaker of the parliament. He thinks the mid-January change has opened new windows for changes to the political culture. About the Anticorruption Commission's activities, Mahmud said: "The commission must be empowered in a way so that it can work independently. "It should have powers to launch investigation into any allegation raised against the president, prime minister, cabinet members, lawmakers and bureaucrats." "It must be ensured that the commission does not need government permission to do so." Mahmud believed it was about time to think if the provision of an interim government needed to be in place if there was an independent Election Commission. "We will have to think whether the caretaker government is necessary if an independent Election Commission is in place," he said. "The complexity that was created recently over the appointment of the latest chief justice as the caretaker government chief is unwarranted. It has politicised the country's highest court. It must end." bdnews24
