<TITLE> Local government reforms will benefit nation most: Akbar A Khan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) Former interim government adviser Dr Akbar Ali Khan Sunday proposed holding both general elections and local government elections simultaneously. Speaking at a meeting on local government policy at the National Press Club, Dr Khan said: "Both the national elections and the local government elections have to be held concurrently as the latter will be difficult to organise unless the military-backed caretaker government oversees it." "Both the AL and the BNP governments failed to conduct local government elections despite their respective promises in 1996 and 2001," he said. Khan also expressed regret over the fact that even military dictatorship has backed local government in the past while democratic governments have subsequently sabotaged the cause of local government, "deploying guerrilla tactics." "Reforming modes of local governance is much more important than the proposed reforms within the political parties," claimed the former adviser. "Local government reforms will benefit the nation most, compared with all other reforms," he said. "Though ironical, it's fact that the gravest peril for the local government lies in the interference by local lawmakers," warned Dr Khan, saying such interference contravenes the constitution and is contrary to democratic practices. Khan suggested forming a local government commission comprising non-partisan citizens, through which local government issues could be resolved. Professor Dilara Chowdhury, a member of the caretaker government-formed committee to strengthen local government bodies, said: "The administrators are of the opinion that local government bodies will lose their accountability if made independent." "In reality, central control over local government must be divested. Local government representatives elected by the grassroots must be given responsibilities after assisting them to enhance their capacities." "The elected representatives will be accountable to a conducive local government commission and not to a upazila nirbahi officer or a deputy commissioner, which is the practice now." Keynote speaker at the meeting Professor Salahuddin Aminuzzaman of the Dhaka University public administration department said: "Though it may seem surprising, the fact remains that whatever little positive changes or reform has occurred in our local government regime, all happened during dictatorial and autocratic rule in this country." "A set of transparent principles should be there to govern national-to-local government financial transactions. The lawmakers should, in no case, be allowed to interfere with local government activities." Prof Aminuzzaman said an integrated Local Government Ordinance or Act should be made after evaluating and amending the existing legal framework. bdnews2
