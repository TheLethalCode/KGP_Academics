 LONDON, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bollywood film distributor Eros International saw annual profit jump 76 percent in its first year on London's AIM market, boosted by the success of films such as Omkara, a Hindi adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello. Shares in Eros rose almost 7 percent to 419 pence, valuing the firm at 461.6 million pounds ($931.4 million) on Wednesday, which was also Eros' 30th birthday. The company's maiden turnover increased 48.6 percent to $66.4 million in the year to March 31 and profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and IPO costs was $32.5 million from $18.4 million last year. Evolution Securities analysts see the trend in earnings accelerating due to the firm's strong project pipeline and raised their 2008 profit forecasts by 4 percent to $42.7 million. "Pre-tax profits are set to nearly treble between financial year 2006 and financial year 2009," they said in a note, adding the market has yet to fully factor the earnings growth into the share price. Eros established a cinema distribution network across India in Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta and Bangalore to take advantage of the increasing growth of cinema ticket sales, which underpinned its strong performance, it said in a statement. Revenues from India's film industry, valued at about $1.75 billion in 2006, are forecast to nearly double to $3.4 billion by 2010, according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Eros released movies 'Omkara', 'Salaam-E-Ishq', 'Eklavya' and 'Namastey London', which together grossed $50 million. Eros's pipeline of future releases include potential blockbusters 'Gandhi My Father', 'Hey Baby' and 'No Smoking
