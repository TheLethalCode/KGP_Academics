<TITLE> Japan defence minister resigns in fresh blow to PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's defence minister resigned on Tuesday over remarks that appeared to accept the 1945 atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, dealing a fresh blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his ruling camp ahead of a national election this month. Abe's support rates have already been slashed by outrage over government mishandling of pension records, and Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma's perceived gaffe has only added to his headaches before the July 29 upper house election. "I regret that my comments have caused trouble. I am very sorry," Kyuma told reporters, adding that Abe had accepted his offer to resign. Kyuma's decision to quit came after a prominent lawmaker in the ruling coalition's junior partner had said he should "decide his own course", a phrase that is often code for urging a politician to quit. Abe had attempted to quell the furore by reprimanding Kyuma, who said on Saturday that he thought the atomic bombings "could not be helped". But opposition parties, keen to press their advantage ahead of the election, had refused to let up pressure for him to resign. Abe can ill afford another furore ahead of the upper house election. A weekend survey by the Asahi newspaper showed the prime minister's support rate had slipped 3 points in the previous week to 28 percent, the weakest showing for the once-popular leader since he took office last September. Kyuma had already gained a reputation for verbal gaffes since taking office last year, angering Washington in January by calling the invasion of Iraq a mistake. More than 360,000 people ultimately died from the atomic blasts that hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, days before Japan surrendered to put an end to World War Two. The attacks hold a central role in Japan's collective memory, and the country has been criticised for stressing its status as victim while failing to acknowledge its own war atrocities. Nagasaki Mayor Tomihisa Taue had met Kyuma on Tuesday and was to visit Abe's office later to protest over the minister's remarks. Abe will not automatically have to step down if his coalition loses its upper house majority. But a big loss would mean the ruling bloc could not enact legislation, which must win approval in both chambers, threatening political paralysis and sparking calls for Abe to quit or even call a snap lower house electi
