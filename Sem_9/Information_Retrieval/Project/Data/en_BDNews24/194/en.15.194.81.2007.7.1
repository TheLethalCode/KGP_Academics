 KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States is boosting security at airports following an explosion at a Glasgow airport that British police described as an attack and car bombs found in London, the White House said on Saturday. White House spokesman Tony Snow said there was no indication of any specific U.S. threat, and the federal government's color-coded rating of the threat of a terrorist attack was not being increased. However, Snow said there will be an added presence of security officials for the sake of vigilance and travelers can expect some delays, especially at larger airports. "There is no indication of any specific or credible threat to the United States, no change in the overall security level," said Snow who is traveling with President George W. Bush while he is spending the weekend at his parents' summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. However, Snow said the Transportation Security Administration, the federal agency in charge of security at U.S. airports, is undertaking some "alertness-raising measures." "You're likely to see those (measures) in the increased presence of some TSA agents outside terminals. There will be some inconvenience to passengers in terms of longer wait times," Snow said, adding there will likely be additional local police as well. Earlier on Saturday, a four-wheel-drive vehicle crashed into the main terminal at Glasgow airport and exploded in flames, a day after police foiled a possible al Qaeda plot to detonate two car bombs in London. A Glasgow police spokeswoman said two people were arrested following the incident, and witnesses said one of the men was badly burned. The airport was closed after the incident. Asked if the beefed-up security was triggered by the London and Glasgow incidents, Snow said, "I think it's really a result of just trying to make sure that, when you're taking a look at developments around the world, that you're taking every necessary precaution." The extra security measures at US airports, which will include more local police as well as federal security officers, come at a busy time with many Americans traveling on holiday to celebrate Independence Day on July
