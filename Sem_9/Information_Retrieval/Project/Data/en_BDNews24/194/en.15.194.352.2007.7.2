 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) - Gusty to squally winds in the northern Bay are likely to continue through Monday affecting seaports as the monsoon strengthened, said the weather office. Thunder lined clouds may cause moderate to heavy rainfalls scattered all over the country, the latest weather bulletin said. The maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar and Mongla have been advised to hoist local cautionary signal three until further notice. Fishing boats and trawlers out in the Bay have been asked to stay anchored for safety until further notice. The Dhakaites woke up to a sunny morning, but it started raining moderate to heavily around midday. The commuters, as usual, have been facing traffic jams and waterlogged walkways in some areas of the city due to bad drainage. bdn
