 MADRID, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid expect to confirm Bernd Schuster as their coach next week and then unveil several new signings, club president Ramon Calderon said on Thursday. "The coach will be sorted out next week and we will also make two or three signings as well," Calderon told radio station Onda Madrid on Thursday. Getafe coach Schuster has been linked with the Real job since the turn of the year and is the strong favourite to take over from Fabio Capello who was sacked last month after leading the club to their first league title in four years. The recruitment of the German hit problems after Getafe president Angel Torres refused to release him from his contract unless he received a courtesy call from Calderon or the compensation fee stipulated in his present deal. "I think he has sorted out his contract and has to pay the compensation but the logical thing is that he will be the next coach of Real Madrid," said Calderon. "We will have to discuss the contractual issues like the length of the deal and the salary but it shouldn't be a problem." NEW PLAYERS One of the new players certain to be presented by Real next week is German centre-back Christoph Metzelder who joins the club after finishing his contract with Borussia Dortmund. Former Barcelona striker Javier Saviola, Roma defender Cristian Chivu, Chelsea winger Arjen Robben and Olympique Lyon midfielder Florent Malouda were among the other potential signings mentioned by Calderon in the interview. The Real chief reiterated the club's desire to sign AC Milan playmaker Kaka despite the fact that the Serie A side have said repeatedly that the Brazilian is not for sale. "We've got a problem because Milan have taken a strong line on him but we have to see if he really wants to come and is prepared to tell his club president that he wants a change. From what I've been told he wants to come." Calderon said the club now wanted Jose Antonio Reyes to remain at the Bernabeu despite earlier indications that they would allow him to return to Arsenal at the end of his season-long loan deal. "I think that with a new coach and with a new system Reyes could become an important player for this club," he said. Reyes scored two goals in the 3-1 victory over Real Mallorca in the final game of the season that secured Real the league title
