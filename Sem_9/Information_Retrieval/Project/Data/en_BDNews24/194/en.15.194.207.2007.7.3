 LONDON, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading index rose on Tuesday, buoyed by Rolls-Royce and stocks-friendly manufacturing U.S. data in the previous session, but lagged its European counterparts as sterling held above the $2 mark. Rolls-Royce was amongst the FTSE's top performers, up 3.4 percent after the British aircraft engine maker said its global customer base had expanded "significantly" in the second quarter with new clients in the Middle East, the U.S., Europe and Asia. The FTSE 100 was up 0.6 percent at 1043 GMT but bets that the Bank of England would raise rates to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent this Thursday kept the index behind its European peers. Even so, Robert Parkes, UK equity strategist at HSBC, said it was the United States which was giving the cue. "I think the domestic interest rate issue is more of a sideshow and I think the main focus is on developments on the U.S. interest rate cycle," said Parkes. "What we saw yesterday was a very market-friendly manufacturing survey out of the U.S. ... which actually picked up but the pricing component was a bit lower -- so best of both worlds really for equity markets." Pubs also put on a good performance, as upbeat results from British brewer Greene King boosted the sector. Green King rose 8.2 percent after posting a 17 percent rise in annual pretax profit and said trading in the current year was in line with its expectations. Punch Taverns rose 3 percent, Enterprise Inns gained 2.2 percent and Mitchells & Butlers added 1.6 percent. But Britain's biggest brewer, Scottish & Newcastle dipped 0.2 percent after it said operating profit at its UK business fell in the first half of this year. Back to gainers, United Utilities surged 2 percent after traders cited bid interest for the stock. The company declined to comment. Sterling rose to levels not seen for a quarter of a century only days before investors expect the BoE to raise rates. But analysts generally said they didn't see too much impact from the rise in the currency for now. Asked on the potential damages of a strong sterling on UK stocks, Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank said: "In the short-term not a massive impact, but in the longer term it's going to hamper profitability more than anything, which isn't going to do particularly the UK manufacturing sector any favours." UK stocks fell in the previous session as public security concerns also dented sentiment. Bucking the trend higher, gas producer BG Group fell 2 percent after UBS downgraded the stock to neutral from buy but raised its price target to 900 pence from 875 pence. But it was paper producer Mondi which put in the worst performance, falling 3.7 percent after launching in London and Johannesbu
