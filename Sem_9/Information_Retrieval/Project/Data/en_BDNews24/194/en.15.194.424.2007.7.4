 Chapainawabganj, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Some 3,000 fertiliser-starved farmers Wednesday went on the rampage at Nachal, setting the local government administrator's office on fire and injuring at least four people, witnesses and officials said. Trouble began when the upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) allegedly assaulted a local agriculture department officer over distribution of tokens for rationing fertiliser. The angry farmers swooped on the office of the UNO and other government establishments in the upazila headquarters as the violence spread fast. UNO Manjur Morshed, upazila agriculture officer Abul Kalam Azad and upazila monitoring officer Asaduzzaman were among four wounded. The fourth man, Abdul Latif, is a farmer. They smashed windows, doors and other furniture at the UNO office and set fire to many official documents. Asaduzzaman was taken to Nachal Health Complex while Latif was admitted to a local clinic. Witnesses said about 3,000 farmers gathered Wednesday morning on the premises of the UNO office to collect tokens for fertiliser, an arrangement for fertiliser rationing in the area. The area's junior agriculture officer Saidur Rahman was distributing the tokens among the farmers. At one point the UNO arrived there and allegedly slapped Saidur for distributing the tokens to the farmers with his own signature, witnesses said. Things spun out of control immediately as the farmers swooped on the UNO before setting ablaze his office. Additional police reached the scene immediately after the violence spread but they failed to restore order. Troops from a nearby camp were dispatched to finally bring the situation under control. The district's top officials went to the trouble spot to calm the rampaging farmers. Later, deputy commissioner Shahadat Hossen sat in an emergency meeting with the district's police chief Mokhlesur Rahman, representatives of the local army camp and 10 farmers. Hossain later said they would launch an investigation into the matter. "We have tried to determine if there was any fault with the fertiliser distribution," Hossain said. "Tough action will be taken if any government official is found guilty for the anarchy." He, however, said they have enough fertiliser in stock and promised a better distribution in the area. Later in the day, local administration formed a three-member probe committee with district magistrate Mostafizur Rahman as its head, officials said. The other members of the committee are assistant director of agriculture development directorate Ashim Kumar Malakar and additional superintendent of police Sajjadur Rahman, they said. Many of the farmers alleged that they often faced harassment when they came to collect tokens for fertiliser. They also accused the UNO of misbehaving with them when they would go to him for any administrative help. bdnews24.com/corr/r
