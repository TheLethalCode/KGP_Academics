 DAMASCUS, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kurdish poet Lukman Derky has long yearned to see Kurdish singers perform at a major Syrian venue. That day, he says, may not be far off. The Arab state seems to be opening up to its biggest minority, said Derky, one of Syria's most prominent Kurdish writers. "There is a clear and noticeable change," he said. The writer recently called for a concert of Syrian Kurdish artists, who he says are celebrated abroad but given little chance to perform at home. The provisional nod of approval he received from the Ministry of Culture was unexpected. "It was a very pleasant surprise," he said, listing Syrian Kurdish singers who he dreams of seeing play live in Damascus, home to many of Syria's Kurds. "It would be something very great and allow Kurdish culture to take its place in Syrian society," he said. Although Kurds in Syria speak Kurdish freely, the language is not taught in schools or spoken on Syrian television. Human rights groups say Kurds, who make up around 10 percent of the population, face repression because of their ethnicity. "The truth is that there is no oppression of Kurdish culture in the full sense of the word, but this culture is disregarded," Derky said. "In Damascus, Kurds are known in society but their culture is missing." Governed by the Arab nationalist Baath Party, Syria should give more recognition to Kurdish culture by, for example, allowing the publication of Kurdish newspapers, he said. Kurdish newspapers are already printed and distributed within the community but not sold publicly, he said. Such steps would "strengthen national unity", he said. "A national fabric requires everyone to be present." Derky writes a column on Kurdish issues in the weekly Kassioun newspaper of the Syrian Communist Party. The publication of the column is, in itself, progress, he said. Laced with humour, the columns tell the story of two fictional friends, Kurdo and Arabo. Derky, who writes the columns in Arabic, says he wants Syrian Arabs to learn more about their Kurdish compatriots. "Most of the articles are directed at the Arab reader. Kurds in Syria know everything about Arabs," he said. Derky describes his work as a reaction to riots in 2004 between Kurds and Arabs in the Kurdish heartland of northeast Syria. Some 30 people were killed in the riots, which were fuelled by decades of Kurdish discontent. "I felt sadness and shock," said Derky. "I want to forget this subject, turn the page and work on bringing together the Kurdish and Arab cultures," he said. Syria, like Turkey and Iran, has feared that Kurdish autonomy in Iraq could inspire separatism among its own Kurds. But Derky said the state had nothing to fear from Kurds, blaming the riots on extremists on both sides. "I don't think there is clear grounds for this fear of Kurds. We do not want to live the way the extremists wan
