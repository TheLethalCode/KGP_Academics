 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Bank has penalised 17 banks for not complying with the Money Laundering Prevention Act (MLPA) since it was enacted by the government in 2002. "So far we have received 372 suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from different banks. Seventeen banks have so far been penalised under MLPA provisions. The proper implementation of these laws are a major asset in the fight against financial crime," said Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, the central bank's governor, at a workshop on financial crime Sunday. "We have also taken an initiative to amend the 2002 money laundering Act so that it contains more precise legal definitions," he said. "The proposed Money Laundering Prevention Act 2007 will deal with the stock exchange, insurance companies, real estate businesses, professionals and sub registry offices more effectively," Ahmed said. The new Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will record, analyse and store transaction data from banks and other financial institutions as well as liaise with their overseas counterparts and other concerned international bodies. "To this end the Bangladesh Bank is planning to become a member of the Egmont Group, an association of FIUs from approximately 100s countries," Ahmed added. The central banks governor said Bangladesh has already adopted 12 out of 13 UN conventions related to money laundering, organised crime and terror financing. "Bangladesh is also a signatory of the Convention Against Corruption," Ahmed added. Citibank North America organised the programme, held at the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry's office. Mamun Rashid, chief executive of Citibank NA, chaired the session. bd
