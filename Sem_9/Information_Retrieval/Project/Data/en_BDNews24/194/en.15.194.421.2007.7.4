<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Experts Wednesday demanded China take tangible measures to narrow a $2 billion trade deficit with Bangladesh. "We are struggling to reduce trade deficits with India. If China does not take steps to bring down the gap, the relation between the two countries will not be sustainable," said Farooq Sobhan, president of Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, a nongovernmental research and advocacy centre. The former Bangladesh ambassador made the observation at a discussion meeting on Sino-Bangladesh relations. The BEI organised the programme attended mainly by experts, former ambassadors and officials from both countries. Bilateral trade between the two countries hangs in favour of China, Bangladesh's biggest trading partner, since the fiscal year 2005-06. The trade deficit was $1.98 billion in FY06 when Bangladesh exported only $64.35 million against its import of 2.04 billion. In the first quarter to September in the fiscal FY07, trade deficit touched $603.03 million. Bangladesh exported only $23.33 million worth goods to China in that time, according to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Sobhan suggested China invest in the ready-made garments and textiles sector here and exploit the duty-free export facility for its goods to the European Union. "China must take some measures to narrow down the huge gap," said Ghulam Muhammad Quader, a former parliament member. Hu Shushing, a scholar on China-South Asia relations, said Beijing took serious notes of the August 17, 2005 serial bomb blasts in Bangladesh. He said the suspicion about India and huge trade imbalance were the two major causes for further development of Bangladesh-China relations. Lailufar Yasmin, who teaches international relations at Dhaka University, referred to growing US presence in the region. "China can offset the US presence in the region by making its ties stronger with Bangladesh and other South Asian countries," she said. bdnews
