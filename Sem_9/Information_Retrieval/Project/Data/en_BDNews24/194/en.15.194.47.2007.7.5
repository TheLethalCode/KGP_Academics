 5ISLAMABAD Thursday, 5 July (bdnews24.com/AFP) - - Pakistani security forces arrested the leader of a radical mosque under siege in Islamabad as he tried to flee while disguised in an all-covering women's burqa on Wednesday. Abdul Aziz was detained as he left the Red Mosque in the capital amid a crowd of women wearing similar Islamic attire, who were surrendering a day after bloody clashes outside the building left 16 people dead. "I can confirm his arrest. He was trying to escape with the girls and was wearing a burqa," Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani told AFP. Television footage showed security officials dragging the bearded Aziz towards a black car after his arrest and being dumped in a black Toyota Corolla before being driven away. Officials said he was caught in a screening centre set up in a school near the mosque to check people leaving the mosque. Hundreds of female students at the mosque surrendered on Wednesday along with their male counterparts, but while the men were detained the women were allowed to go back to their homes. "We caught Abdul Aziz when he was trying to escape the mosque clad in a burqa. He did not offer any resistance," added a top security official involved in the capture. "He was the last in a group of women all wearing the same clothes. He was wearing a burqa that also covered his eyes," the official said on condition of anonymity. "Our men spotted his unusual demeanour. The rest of the girls looked like girls but he was taller and had a pot belly." His arrest defused the tension around the mosque, where troops in armoured personnel carriers enforced a shoot-on-sight curfew imposed early Wednesday after the violence. However there was still no sign of Aziz's brother, the mosque's deputy leader Abdul Rashid Ghazi, believed to be inside the mosque with about 1,000 diehards. Security officials involved in the operation said more than 800 had surrendered so far. Students had exchanged automatic gunfire with security forces as night fell, after police fired tear gas shells at the compound to drive out more radicals holed up inside, officials said. President Pervez Musharraf, already facing a political crisis ahead of elections later this year, ordered the crackdown after the mosque brazenly tried to set up a Taliban-style justice system in the heart of Islamabad. "They have no option but to surrender," Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Cheema told reporters. "There is no dialogue". Students leaving the mosque said two bodies were inside along with several injured people. Mosque sources said one of them was a militant from the banned extremist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Troops earlier killed a male student and an apparently mentally ill man in the early hours of the day as part of the shoot-on-sight curfew. Those holding out were believed to include Taliban insurgents from the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan and jihadis belonging to banned Pakistani sectarian groups. Hundreds of troops built sandbag bunkers around the mosque and rolled out barbed wire to block off all roads. Electricity to the area was cut during the night. The mosque has led a freelance anti-vice campaign in the capital including the abduction of people accused of running brothels -- including the seven Chinese -- and raids on local music and DVD shops. Military ruler Musharraf, embroiled in crisis over his suspension of Pakistan's top judge, has faced mounting criticism over his failure to crack down on the mosque. A policeman was killed by a rocket and four civilians died in a blast targeting a police chief's car in the northwestern region of Swat, a stronghold of one of the banned groups linked to Ghazi and his brother. Six Pakistani soldiers and five civilians died in a suicide car bombing Wednesday in a troubled tribal frontier region that officials said was another possible revenge attack. The Red Mosque students took over a government-run children's library in January, while in April it set up an Islamic court that imposed a "fatwa" on a paragliding minist
