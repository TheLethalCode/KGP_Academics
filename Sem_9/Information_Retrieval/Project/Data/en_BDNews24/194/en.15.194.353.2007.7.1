 Dhaka, July 01 (bdnews24.com) -- Some BNP leaders with close ties to party general secretary Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Sunday said they did not have any contradiction with chairperson Khaleda Zia over the reform plan. After a meeting with Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home, joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain told reporters that they had backed the chairperson on making the reform proposals final at a council. He said Bhuiyan's proposal was a draft. Senior BNP leader retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed echoed Ashraf. Khaleda Saturday said reforms to the BNP must be done in line with the councillors' thoughts. "I want reforms. Party leaders want reforms too, but that must follow a democratic way," the BNP chairperson told reporters after visiting ailing party treasurer Shahe Alam at his Malibag home. The BNP leaders welcomed the reform proposal of AL presidium member Abdur Razzak. They said reforms were the need of the time for political parties. Scores of BNP leaders and workers from Barisal, Joydevpur, Barguna, Bogra, Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Panchagarh, Rangpur, Noakhali and Chittagong met Bhuiyan at his home. Ashraf Hossain said preparations were on to hold a council. The council will be held once the preparations are complete. Hafizuddin said: "We don't have any dispute with the chairperson. She wants reform. We want it too." No council was held in the last 14 years, he added. bdnew
