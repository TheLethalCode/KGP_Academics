 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 06 (bdnews24.com)  The trend of spending the Annual Development Programme (ADP) funds in the last hours of the government has seen no shift even with the caretaker administration, according to government statistics. The current caretaker government has trimmed the ADP size to Tk 21,600 crore from the original Tk 26,000 crore for the fiscal 2006-2007. Only Tk 13,206 crore or 61 percent of the Tk 21,600 crore revised ADP outlay has been spent in the first 11 months of the last fiscal year, Planning Commission statistics revealed. It means the interim government could have fulfilled the target had it spent Tk 8,394 crore alone in June, according to the commission statistics. Of the Tk 13,206 crore expenditure, Tk 4,293 crore was spent by the immediate past BNP-led alliance government in the first three months of the FY 2006-07. The statistics showed that five ministries and divisions spent major portion of the total expenditure. The Local Government Division spent Tk 3,986.72 crore, communications ministry Tk 1,651.34 crore, primary and mass education Tk 1,329.24 crore, health and family welfare Tk 1,098.26 crore and power division Tk 1,894 crore, according to planning commission data. The spending was 63.29 percent for the same period of FY 2005-06, the statistics showed. Development partners and lending agencies, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and economists have long been blaming governments for its spending spree at the fag end of the fiscal year breeds corruption. Hossain Zillur Rahman, an economist and one of the main architects of the donors-pushed Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, said the spending extravaganza in the last hours erodes the quality of development works. He said the government was concentrating more on fighting corruption than other serious issues that need to be addressed. "Building implementation capacity of the administration is much bigger an issue than corruption," Rahman told bdnews24.com Thursday. Earlier in February, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters that the implementation of the annual programme suffered a setback because of the political unrest in October-December over electoral reforms. Two other major problems the adviser identified were failure of authorities in proper selection of the projects and inadequate inflow of foreign aid as against commitments. According to official data, some 886 projects were included in the just concluded ADP43 new. bdnew
