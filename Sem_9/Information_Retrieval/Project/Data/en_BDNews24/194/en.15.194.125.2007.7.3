<TITLE> Motia warns EC of secret handiwork </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury said Tuesday that the Election Commission should not be 'part of a handiwork by an invisible hand'. "We don't want the Election Commission be a spokesman for any invisible hand," Chowdhury told reporters after she met her party chief Sheikh Hasina at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi. Motia, an outspoken politician with a reputation of honesty, made the comment to apparently take a dig at election commissioner Sahul Hossain for his comment that they would not talk to politicians until reforms are done within their camps. Sahul Monday said the commission would sit with the political parties once they complete their reforms, an effort, many say, by some insiders because of pressure from the military-backed government. Motia was not happy with the statement. "We don't expect such comments from the election commissioners over ups and downs of the political parties," she said. "The commission should be an independent body." On the proposed reforms by two senior party colleagues that they want joint leadership in the party, Motia said the Awami League never believed in single leadership. In separate statements to media, presidium members Abdur Razzak and Tofail Ahmed recently placed proposals to end the so-called authoritarian leadership of the party chief. Replying to a query, Motia said her party signed an agreement with the Islamist group Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish and Sheikh Hasina directed to sign that deal. "Our party chief had supreme power that time due to the situation. The treaty does not exist anymore," she said. Hasina met some of her party aides at the museum. bdnews24.c
