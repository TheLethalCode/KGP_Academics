 HONG KONG, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao swore in Hong Kong's leader for a new term on Sunday and reminded the territory that the motherland comes first, as the city embarked upon its second decade under Beijing's rule. Many Hong Kongers celebrated the anniversary of the territory's 1997 return to Chinese rule on Sunday, watching People's Liberation Army parachutists perform stunt jumps, viewing a parade, and making plans to watch fireworks later. But the mood was not entirely joyous and in the afternoon thousands of people surged through downtown streets in an annual democracy protest march, waving banners and shouting slogans, like "One man one vote". When Britain returned Hong Kong to communist China on July 1, 1997, many feared the rights and freedoms enjoyed here would erode, despite the Beijing government's guarantees of sweeping autonomy under a "one country, two systems" formula. Those fears have since largely eased, and the city has thrived despite rocky patches, including the debilitating SARS epidemic and an economic slump. "Compared to 10 years ago when no one knew what to expect, things are clearer and firmer now," said bank employee Ada Yu, 36. "Reunification has mostly been a good thing." The South China Morning Post declared on Sunday that "one country, two systems" had been a success. "Despite all the controversy and heated debate surrounding the handover, Hong Kong's core values have remained intact. The rule of law, free speech, freedom of association and free markets have all survived," it said. Nevertheless, Beijing has kept a tight grip on the pace of democratic reform. Hong Kong's post-handover constitution says universal suffrage is the ultimate goal, but is vague on a timetable. The national parliament intervened to rule out direct elections in the former colony until at least 2012. FINAL SAY Chinese leaders have emphasised that Beijing has the final say, and Hu stressed on Sunday that China comes first. "One country is a pre-requisite of two systems," he said at a ceremony to swear in Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang and his cabinet for a new five-year term. "One country means that one must uphold the power vested with the central government and China's sovereignty, unity and security." At midnight, Chinese officials attended a Buddhist bell-chiming ceremony along with chanting monks to mark the countdown to midnight, the moment Britain had handed back Hong Kong after 156 years as a colony, and to bestow peace and prosperity on the territory. At the same time, across Victoria Harbour, pro-democracy lawmakers gave a stinging rebuke to China's rule on the balcony of the city's historic legislature. Ten years ago to the minute, many of the same people had mounted the same balcony to chant similar slogans as Prince Charles and then Chinese president Jiang Zemin shook hands and presided over the historic handover ceremony not far away. "Democracy is not any nearer to the goals stipulated in the basic law -- universal suffrage," said veteran democracy campaigner and legislator Martin Lee. "In fact it seems it is even more remote than 10 years ago." Polls show that most Hong Kongers favour democracy as soon as possible, which requires constitutional changes. Jason Chan, whose family is from Hong Kong but who lives in New York, summed up what he thought the message of the protest march was: "We're patriots too. We love China as well. We're trying to get what we deserve after British rule. Everyone should get one vote for ourselves." In Taipei, a representative of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which is banned on the mainland but legal in Hong Kong, said over 800 practitioners were barred from entering the city in the past week. Hong Kong's immigration department could not be reached for immediate comment, but officials in the past have declined to comment on specific cases and said the department reserves the power to decide who is allowed into the territory and who is not. Tsang has promised to "resolve" the universal suffrage issue during his new term. He and his cabinet face other problems too such as worsening air pollution and a widening rich-poor gap in Asia's financial hub.
