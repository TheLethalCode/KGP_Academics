<TITLE> Premier League referees favour Man United - Grant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea manager Avram Grant has made a stinging attack on Premier League referees, saying they helped Manchester United win the title, British newspapers reported on Thursday. Grant, who may risk the wrath of the Football Association over his remarks, added that he was glad the referee for the Champions League final against United in Moscow next Wednesday was not English. "In England there are very good referees, but there are some, a few that you can influence, like you saw," Grant told reporters. He was referring to United's last Premier League game of the season on Sunday, a 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic which clinched the title. "I looked at the game. (The referee) was, as expected, good for one team," Grant said. "I told you I believed in the tradition of the fair English game. I will not say anything against it, but what happened is what I expected." Chelsea went into the final round of matches level on points with United, although behind on goal difference. They needed United to drop points if they were to pip them for the title but conceded a stoppage-time equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Bolton Wanderers. Grant also said that in his first game in charge of Chelsea, a 2-0 defeat at United in September, midfielder John Obi Mikel was wrongly sent off. "I think in our game against Manchester United at Old Trafford, the referee changed the result for sure," he said. "I think that (Paul) Scholes should have had a red card on Sunday and Wigan a penalty also," he added. "I do not think the world is against Chelsea, or English football. But in this case there were some coincidences, for Manchester United. But again I congratulate them (on the title)." Chelsea beat United 2-1 last month to set up the nail-biting finale to the championship, a result they believe they can repeat in Moscow to deny United manager Alex Ferguson a second Champions League victory
