 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com) - Though it is always a symbolic participation for Bangladesh in the world's biggest sporting extravaganza, the Bangladesh Olympic Association is looking to spend Tk 6 million for the Beijing Olympics for a somewhat oversized contingent. BOA has sought Tk 5,788,000 from the National Sports Council for a 19-member delegation to the upcoming Olympic Games, scheduled for August 6-25. It is nothing new for the BOA to send a seemingly jumbo contingent ahead of any international sports event; it had sought Tk 6,512,448 for the 2004 Athens Olympics for a 19-member contingent, which was comprised of only five athletes. The 19-member delegation this year includes only six athletes, thanks to wild cards given by the International Olympic Committee. The BOA has probably taken a lesson from some national dailies that filed reports on the size of the Athens Olympic contingent in 2004, and has tried to avert the dispute surrounding the members going to the Beijing Olympics this year by not mentioning members by name. For the 20-day games, the BOA budget submitted to the NSC nevertheless includes a number of bloated and seemingly unnecessary costs. The Olympic association has mentioned that the chief adviser and a guest, a special assistant to the chief adviser and a guest, the BOA president and the BOA secretary general are among members of this year's contingent. The six have been invited by the hosts, who, however, bear only expenses of the BOA president and its secretary general. The airfares of the chief adviser, his special assistant and their guests, as well as that of the chef de mission , will total Tk 3.5 lakh. Hotel expenses for the CA and his guest of Tk 17.64 lakh and daily allowances of duo US$ 700 for 18 days are included in the budget. The hotel expenses of the special assistant to the CA and his guest at Tk 4.48 lakh and their daily allowances US$ 500 each for 18 days are also included. Asked whether the chief adviser would in fact go to Beijing for the Olympics, the CA's press secretary Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com: "At the moment I have no idea." However, there has been no instance of any head of government attending the games in the past. The Olympic delegation also includes six competitors (two athletes, two swimmers and two shooters), three coaches or officials, the chef de mission , general team manager and two representatives from the Youth Camp. The budget also includes Tk 1.70 lakh for the participants' uniforms, sports gear for the athletes and the officials at Tk 1.5 lakh, gifts worth Tk 2 lakh and Tk 3 lakh for BOA office expenses and meetings. It is also meant to cover airfare (six athletes, three officials, two youth representatives and general manager) of Tk 5.76 lakh, pocket money for athletes and youth representative totalling Tk 2.24 lakh, pocket money for the general manager of Tk 49,000 and pocket money for three officials Tk 1.05 lakh, for the 20 days. But a former BOA official, not wishing to be named, said: "The Olympic Solidarity Committee bears all expenses (airfares, food, accommodation) of the participating athletes, coaches, an official and two youth representatives to inspire the countries lagging behind in the Olympic Games in line with the Olympic charter." BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed, admitting the fact, claimed: "The solidarity committee disburses money after the conclusion of the games and that's why we have sought the budget from the government for the athletes and two youth representatives." There is no record so far that the BOA has returned money to the government in the past after receiving their funds from the solidarity committee. bdnew
