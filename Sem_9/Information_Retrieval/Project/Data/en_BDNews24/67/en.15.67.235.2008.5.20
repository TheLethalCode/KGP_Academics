 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division Tuesday halted for one month a High Court stay order on the functions of the Supreme Judicial Commission formed to recommend the appointments of HC judges. The appeals court directed both sides of the case to prepare for a final hearing on the writ petition in one month's time. The seven-member full bench led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin passed the order on a government appeal for staying the HC order. The HC on April 28 on a writ petition by Supreme Court lawyer Idrisur Rahman issued a stay order for three months on the functions of the Supreme Judicial Commission. At the same time, the court issued a rule nisi on the law secretary and the Supreme Court registrar to explain why the Supreme Judicial Commission Ordinance should not be declared unconstitutional and voided. The government on May 13 appealed to the Appellate Division, seeking suspension of the HC order. Participating in Tuesday's hearing, attorney general Fida M Kamal said: "Laws or ordinances are formulated for the welfare of people. The state suffers losses because of stay orders on them. So the High Court order needs to be halted." But barrister Amir-ul Islam, a counsel for the writ petitioner, told the court: "Of the nine members of the commission, two will be members of parliament, according to a provision in the ordinance. As there is no parliament now the two MPs don't exist." "So the commission is automatically ineffective." After the order, Amir-ul Islam told reporters that the Appellate Division had stayed the HC order for one month and asked both parties of the case to hold a final hearing. President Iajuddin Ahmed on March 16 promulgated the Supreme Judicial Commission Ordinance. bdnew
