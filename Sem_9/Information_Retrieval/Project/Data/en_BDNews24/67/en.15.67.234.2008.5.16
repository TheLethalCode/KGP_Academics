<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bikalpadhara president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury said Friday he hoped that the Awami League and the BNP would not boycott the next election. "The Awami League is an election-oriented party. Dialogue will fail if all the political parties don't take part in it. The political parties should not boycott the dialogue," the Bikalpadhara chief told a press conference at the party's Segun Bagicha office Friday. Chowdhury advised the government to have frequent talks with political parties in an effort to solve national problems. "The politicians will run the country. So frequent meetings should be held with them," he said. Chowdhury congratulated chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed for announcing a tentative time period for the national election in his address to the nation on Monday. "December 8 to 10 is the Eid-ul- Azha holiday. So the election can be held any day between December 25-29." Chowdhury said it would be better if the upazila elections were held in October. "The chief adviser should have announced a specific date for upazila elections in his address to the nation." The former president said he was disappointed by the government's failure to curb the prices of essentials and solve the power crisis. He demanded reintroduction of OMS and supply of one maund rice free of cost to every worker until rice prices went down. bdnew
