<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Members of the Buddhist community countrywide observed Buddha Purnima, their most important religious festival Monday. About two and a half thousand years ago, the great Siddharth Gautam or Buddha was born in Kapilavastu of Nepal during a full moon. Buddha Purnima is associated with Lord Buddha's advent, emancipation and physical end in the world. Siddharth Gautam, a prince, was disillusioned by royal glamour, purpose of life and futility of riches after witnessing humans' irreversible ageing and falling victim to inevitable death in the end. Siddharth left home and hearth at the age of 29, meditated for years and was blessed with transcendental knowledge or emancipation, when the time was ripe during a full moon. He left the world on a similar occasion. The day was observed in Bangladesh as a closed holiday. Members of the Buddhist community organised discussions and other programmes marking the day. The monasteries in Bangladesh observed the sacred and joyous day in meditation and exchanging greetings and blessings. Bangladesh Buddhist Federation observed the day through religious meditation and exchanging greetings at the International Buddhist Vihara. bdnew
