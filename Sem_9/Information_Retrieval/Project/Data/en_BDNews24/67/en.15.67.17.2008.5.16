 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Everton, trailing 3-0 from the first leg, hit back to win 4-1 at Audax Italiano and qualify for the Chilean championship semi-finals. In other mid-week action in South America, leading pair Libertad and Nacional enjoyed easy wins in Paraguay, where Osvaldo Ardiles's Cerro Porteno struggled to a 1-0 win over Guarani. CHILE Everton scored an injury-time goal to complete a stunning fight-back against Audax Italiano in their quarter-final second leg on Wednesday night. The outcome of the tie seemed a formality after Audax won 3-0 away in the first leg but Everton, led by former Chile coach Nelson Acosta, had other ideas as they took the lead with a Cristian Canio penalty in the 21st minute. Ezequiel Miralles added a second in the 56th minute, Carlos Garrido pulled one back for Audax in the 69th and Canio put Everton 3-1 ahead four minutes later. The drama was completed when defender Cristian Oviedo scored a fourth one minute into stoppage time from a pass by Miralles to send Everton through on the away goals rule. Universidad de Chile also went through, winning 2-1 at O'Higgins to complete a 6-3 aggregate victory. Hans Gomez put O'Higgins ahead in the 27th minute but the visitors hit back when Manuel Villalobos and Argentine Raul Estevez scored early in the second half. O'Higgins finished with nine men after Roberto Caceres and Felipe Rojas were sent off in the last 15 minutes. Colo Colo, attempting to win their fifth domestic title in a row, went through on Tuesday when a 1-1 draw with Universidad Catolica gave them a 4-2 aggregate win. Nublense were at home to Cobreloa on Thursday night, the first leg having ended goalless. PARAGUAY Leaders Libertad stayed four points clear of Nacional after they beat Silvio Pettirossi 4-0 and Nacional won away to 2 de Mayo by the same score. Colombian Vladimir Marin put defending champions Libertad ahead from a free kick after 13 minutes and Juan Samudio fired the second five minutes before halftime. Osvaldo Martinez added the third within 15 seconds of the restart and Victor Caceres completed the scoring in the 77th. Carlos Goroso missed a penalty for Silvio Pettirossi and coach Miguel Benitez resigned after the match. Ariel Bogado scored twice in Nacional's win with Fabio Escobar and a Ramon Ortigoza own goal completing the scoring. Cerro Porteno went third after winning for the second time in three games since former Argentina midfielder Osvaldo Ardiles took charge, beating Guarani 1-0 in front of less than 600 people. Guarani defender Joel Benitez turned Marcelo Estigarribia's pass into his own goal after 13 minutes. PERU Alianza Lima's miserable run continued when they were held 1-1 at Melgar after conceding a goal in the sixth minute of injury-time. Goalkeeper Enrique Bologna put Alianza ahead with a penalty in the 42nd minute but Richard Mercado headed Melgar's equaliser at the death to leave Alianza 11th in the 14-team table. Sporting Cristal stayed two points behind Universitario in second place when they lost 1-0 away to Juan Aurich, Fernando Garcia heading the only goal in the 47th minute. Universitario did not play
