<TITLE> Fiorentina's renaissance offers hope to Parma </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian clubs often go into freefall when they go down from Serie A, but Parma can at least seek solace from Fiorentina's remarkable renaissance. Parma were relegated on Sunday after 18 years in the top flight when they lost 2-0 at home to Inter Milan, who retained their title on the final day. Fiorentina won 1-0 at Torino to beat AC Milan to the final Champions League qualifying place, just six years after practically going out of business and being reformed in the lower leagues. The two clubs have similar recent histories and Parma hope one day to achieve the same happy ending. "We start again from a low point, it is a huge setback but I must accept it so we can go straight back into Serie A next year," Parma president Tommaso Ghirardi told reporters. Seen as a small provincial club before their first promotion to Serie A in 1990, Parma became one of Italy's top sides and boasted players such as Fabio Cannavaro, Lilian Thuram, Adriano and Hernan Crespo. They won the UEFA Cup in 1995 and 1999 but things started to go wrong when food group Parmalat, their major financial backer, collapsed in 2003. The club struggled on and narrowly avoided relegation last season under Claudio Ranieri, who left for Juventus. They were always around the bottom three this term, and coach Domenico Di Carlo was sacked in March. Big name replacement Hector Cuper fared no better and youth team coach Andrea Manzo was put in charge for the Inter game, all to no avail. "I apologise, but I should not be the only one," Ghirardi cryptically said. Fiorentina reached a UEFA Cup semi-final this season as well as holding off 2007 European champions Milan in the race for fourth spot in Serie A. Coach Cesare Prandelli, appointed in 2005 after the Florence club had fought their way back into the top flight, has achieved all this despite his wife dying earlier in the campaign. "I am eternally grateful to the players. They are a group of real men, and real men never wander," he said
