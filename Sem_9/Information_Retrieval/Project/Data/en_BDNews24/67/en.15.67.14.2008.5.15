<TITLE> Myanmar junta insists aid effort running smoothly </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military government said on Thursday its cyclone relief effort was moving along swiftly even as foreign powers warned of starvation and disease among up to 2.5 million people left destitute by the storm. The European Union's top aid official urged the junta to allow in foreign aid workers and essential equipment to prevent more deaths from the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, but the reclusive generals signaled they would not budge. "We have already finished our first phase of emergency relief. We are going onto the second phase, the rebuilding stage," state television quoted Prime Minister Thein Sein as telling his Thai counterpart this week. Separately, the junta announced an overwhelmingly favorable vote for an army-backed constitution in a referendum held after the cyclone despite calls for a delay in light of the disaster. Nearly two weeks after the storm tore through the heavily populated Irrawaddy delta rice bowl, leaving up to 128,000 people dead, supplies of food, medicine and temporary shelter have been sent in dribs and drabs to devastated communities. In the delta town of Bogalay, where around 10,000 people are thought to have died, people complained of forced labor and low supplies of food at state-run refugee centers. "They have to break stones at the construction sites. They are paid K1,000 ($1) per day but are not provided any food," said Ko Hla Min, who lost nine members of his family in the storm. Along the river in Bogalay rotting corpses are still tangled in the scrub. Villagers fish, wash and bathe in the same river. The United Nations has said over half a million people may now be sheltering in temporary settlements. The U.N. has also ramped up its estimate of the number of people in urgent need of aid to 2.5 million, and called for a high-level donors conference to deal with the crisis. Myanmar state television raised its official toll to 38,491 dead, 1,403 injured and 27,838 missing on Wednesday, but independent experts say the likely figures are far higher. POLITICAL PRESSURE Despite calls the postpone the charter referendum in light of the disaster, the junta went ahead on May 10 in areas not seriously affected by the cyclone. It said on Thursday more than 92 percent of the ballots cast were in favours of the charter. The military sees the constitution as a key step in its democracy roadmap, but critics say it will only entrench their rule because it gives the military an automatic 25 percent of seats in parliament and control of key ministries. "This referendum was full of cheating and fraud across the country," said Nyan Win, a spokesman for the opposition National League for Democracy. A vote in the cyclone-hit areas is set for May 24. The junta has consistently resisted outside calls for faster and more transparent moves to democracy, and since the cyclone has rebuffed calls for a full-blown international aid effort. Louis Michel, the European Union's top aid official, was in Yangon to further press the international community's case. "He made it quite clear that every hour counts right now and that thousands of lives continue to be at stake," John Clancy, Michel's spokesman, said. As the clock ticks and conditions deteriorate, with monsoon rains adding to the misery and aggravating transport problems, the political pressure on Myanmar is likely to grow. Britain's U.N. ambassador, John Sawers, said a proposed high-level conference on the crisis would be more than a donors' meeting, calling it a "major international meeting". PATIENCE WITH GENERALS However, the Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), one of the few groupings that allows Myanmar as a member, urged patience. "We are trying to work around a very, very strict resistance and mentality and mindset that have been there for a long, long time," Surin Pitsuwan, a former Thai foreign minister, said. The United States and other countries continued to fly aid into Yangon on Thursday despite unconfirmed reports some supplies were being diverted by the army. In Bogalay relief materials were being held in storage waiting for distribution and government officials sold tin-sheets for roofs at K4,900 ($5) apiece, far above the budget of most. Po Aung, who survived the tidal wave that tore through his village by clinging onto a tree, just wants to go home. "Those dead are gone. But, we the remaining want to return to our own place," said the 57-year old, one of 80 survivors from a village of over 500. "We are very sad and disappointed too. We just don't know what to do."
