<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Bar Association Thursday boycotted Appellate Division proceedings for two hours, protesting a series of recent verdicts including the one that prevents courts from granting bail in EPR cases. The protesting SCBA lawyers started their programme at 9am. Over 100 lawyers staged a sit-in in front of the SCBA office. Amid the boycott, a seven-member full bench of the Appellate Division headed by the chief justice started hearing cases at 9:30am. Up to 11am, the Appellate Division heard 25 casesmostly government appeals. A number of lawyers led by former Bangladesh Bar Council vice-chairman Khandakar Mahbub Hossain were present in the Appellate Division through the hearings. Attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal, additional attorneys general Salahuddin Ahmed and Mansur Habib and other government law officers also attended the Appellate Division. SCBA president barrister Shafique Ahmed told reporters that lawyers had refrained from attending the Appellate Division proceedings to establish the rule of law and uphold the constitution. A series of recent Appellate Division verdicts including the one that prevents courts from granting bail in EPR cases contradicts the rule of law and the constitution, he alleged. The SCBA has observed the boycott on behalf of "justice seekers", said Shafique. "Lawyers from a number of other countries endorsed the boycott saying that barring people from filing bail requests cannot be imagined in any democratic country," he said. "The chief justice has been told that dissolving High Court benches in the middle of the week has to be stopped and senior lawyers have to be vested with writ bench authority," barrister Shafique emphasised. Mahbub Hossain, who opposed the idea of boycotting court, told reporters, "This programme was announced to give rise to anarchy, which lawyers cannot support." "Such boycotts go against the dispensation of justice. It has been reduced to a sick attempt at tarnishing the image of the judiciary," he said. "A group of lawyers attempted such boycotts in the past too, just to achieve their own goals, perplexing the judiciary," he said. bdnew
