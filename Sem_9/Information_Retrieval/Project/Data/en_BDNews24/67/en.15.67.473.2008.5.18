 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Sunday the government's formal dialogue with political parties and civic leaders would be concluded in June. "We have so far received lists of representatives for three political parties to join the dialogue," Zillur told reporters at his office. The parties are Bangladesh Workers Party, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu). The government will hold talks with the three parties on May 22 and 25. The government had yet to receive the lists of representatives from other political parties, the adviser said, adding: "The dialogue will take place in phases after the lists of representatives come to hand." "If the dialogue begins on May 22 (as scheduled) it will end in June," said Zillur, one of the advisers that were assigned to conduct the recent round of pre-dialogue talks. The commerce adviser hoped all the political parties would join the formal talks. "We want to reach a solution. The political parties want the same," he said. Earlier in the day, communications adviser Ghulam Quader had told reporters that he is optimistic the political dialogue with parties will meet with success. "The national dialogue will be successful. It will begin on May 22 as per the announcement of the chief adviser," Quader said on his way to the chief adviser's office. "We will sit with the smaller parties first and the major parties later." The adviser said the government would try to reach a consensus with the parties on specific issues including how the next elected government would proceed in its administration, the stand of party leaders on political strikes and steps towards the country's economic development. Quader declined to make any comment on the government's position following the demands of the two major parties to release their leaders. bdnews24
