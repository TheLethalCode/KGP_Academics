<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Steel millers Saturday asked the government to take steps for appreciation of the taka against the dollar to cope with a hike in the prices of raw materials on the international market. Leaders of Bangladesh Re-rolling Mills Association and Bangladesh Steel Mills Owners Association at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity said appreciation of the taka against the dollar would help cut the prices of rods. Masadul Alam Masud, secretary general of the re-rolling mills association, said the hardening of the taka against the dollar was necessary. On what if the appreciation affected remittances, Masud said: "The amount of the taka in return for remitted dollars may be a bit smaller. But one can make up for the loss when one buys products." Production costs of rods had risen in recent months due to a price hike of raw materials on the international market, he said. "Sales have also dropped, forcing us to halve production. But we are still counting losses." Masud said the prices of raw materials rose by up to $100 a tonne in one month, which was why they were asking for a tax revision in the sector. The government had earlier decided to open up scrap imports and reduce duty to control rod prices. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said the decision would come into effect before the announcement of the next budget if the National Board of Revenue gave its opinion on it. Masud said that bureaucratic red tape was hampering re-rolling business. He asked for immediate implementation of the government decision. A committee investigating the price hike of rods alleged that owners were selling the essential construction materials at higher prices. Masud denied the allegation. "The investigation committee might have made the allegation after visiting only a few factories. "Only those who had bought scraps before were able to sell rods at lower prices." A tonne of 60-grade rod now costs up to Tk 72,000 and 40-grade Tk 62,000. bdnew
