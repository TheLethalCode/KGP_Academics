<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia-nominated BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Thursday the so-called pro-reforms leaders would be welcome back to the BNP if they complied with the chairperson's decisions. "There will be no obstacle to those who became so-called reformist (I would like to call them derailed) to return to the party if they accept Khaleda Zia's decisions," Delwar told reporters prior to a meeting with Manikganj district BNP leaders and lawyers at his NAM flat. The BNP leader said: "Saifur Rahman realised his mistake and cleared his position. Let Hafizuddin Ahmed make his position clear too. There would be no obstacle then. I have said it several times that the BNP will stay united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." On dialogue with the government, Delwar said the BNP would decide on whether to go to dialogue in discussion with four-party alliance leaders. Delwar, at the meeting, condemned what he termed government restrictions and pressure on the media. "The government intervenes in press freedom. It obstructs the media in telling the truth. Many private televisions lay off journalists," the BNP leader said. He demanded such interference be stopped. On the chargesheet against Khaleda in the GATCO scam case, Delwar said: "Politicians are being harassed with false cases." The BNP standing committee on Oct 29 last year appointed Saifur as acting chairman and Hafizuddin as secretary general. bdnew
