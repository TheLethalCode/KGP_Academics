 MILAN, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A champions Inter Milan will hold talks with coach Roberto Mancini amid fresh speculation about his future, club president Massimo Moratti has said. Inter retained their title on Sunday after a 2-0 win at Parma on the final day of the season, though Mancini refused to speak to the media. The 43-year-old said he would quit at the end of the season after March's Champions League defeat by Liverpool but the next day Moratti said his coach would be staying. Rumours former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has been lined up to replace Mancini have not gone away despite club denials. "He and I will talk away from the cameras," Moratti told reporters after Inter shrugged off a run of bad form to finally wrap up the scudetto. "I have seen his happiness, together we have suffered for this joy but with great faith in each other." British and Italian media have speculated Mancini is heading to Chelsea, whether or not Avram Grant's team beats Manchester United in Wednesday's Champions League final in Moscow. However, Inter chief executive Ernesto Paolillo thought it was likely Mancini, who has four years left on his contract, would stay to try for a fourth straight Serie A title next year. "There is an 80 percent chance we will continue with Mancini. Mancini will discuss a general vision and a shared programme with the president," he told Radio Anch'io. "If nothing had happened against Liverpool we would not be talking about this." Inter meet AS Roma, whom they beat to the title, in the Italian Cup final on Saturday so a decision on Mancini's future may come next week. Striker Hernan Crespo, a bit-part player at Inter this term, said he wanted to stay whether Mancini or his former Chelsea boss Mourinho was in charge. "If he arrives, I want to stay here," the Argentine said when asked what he would do if Mourinho was appointed. "If Mancini stays, I equally want to stay. But now is not the time to talk about it.
