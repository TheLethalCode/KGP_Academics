 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court warned police authorities on Tuesday to be cautious about arrests while bail appeal remain with the apex court. The Appellate Division gave the caution in an appeal hearing against a recent High Court order that quashed a bail petition filed by Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, an accused in the GATCO graft case. The full bench of the Appellate Division led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, however, did not award bail to Nizami on his appeal. Nizami's lawyer Abdur Razzak said in the hearing the police had arrested his client while his bail plea was still under consideration, which was a violation of the judicial process. "The police should have waited until the bail petition was resolved," barrister Razzak said. As his client had already been arrested there was no chance of bail now, he added. The High Court rejected Nizami's bail petition on May 18 in the GATCO graft case; he filed an appeal with the Supreme Court against the ruling the same day. But police arrested him that evening following the issue of arrest warrants against fugitives in the case including Nizami, a former minister during the term of the BNP-led alliance government. The Anticorruption Commission submitted chargesheet against 25 people in the case on May 13. The graft watchdog accused them of causing losses of Tk 14.56 crore to the state by awarding a permit to GATCO to run a container depot at Chittagong port. bdnew
