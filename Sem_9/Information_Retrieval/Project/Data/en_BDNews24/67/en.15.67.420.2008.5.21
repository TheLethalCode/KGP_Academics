<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  Russel Mahmud Jimmy slammed a hat trick as Abahani Limited crushed Dhaka Mariner Youngs 7-0 in the Premier Division Hockey League at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Wednesday. With the seventh win in eight matches, last year's joint champions Abahani raised their point tally to 22, two points behind leaders Usha Krira Chakra and four points ahead of the third-placed Mohammedan Sporting Club. Pakistani medio Imran Khan gave Abahani a lead in the very first minute before Moududur Rahman Shuvo doubled the lead three minutes later from a field goal. Having scored two goals in first four minutes, Abahani forwards could hardly trouble the backline of Mariner, whose performance was not up to the mark throughout the league. After the break, it seemed a new-look Abahani, who destroyed Mariner's defense to snatch five more goals in the second half. Jimmy widened the margin converting a penalty corner six minutes into the second half while Abahani skipper Mahbub Ehsan Rana made it 4-0 in the 47th minute before Jimmy completed his first hat trick in the league. Jimmy scored his second goal in the 57th minute and third goal in the 68th minute and completed his hat trick just one minute from time. His last three scores were field goals. In the other match of the day, Ajax Sporting Club tasted their second triumph in seven matches when they defeated Shadharan Bima 2-1. Sharafat Ali Jewel scored both the goals for Ajax in the 6th and 60th minutes while Faisal Hossain netted the lone goal for Bima in the 65th minute.
