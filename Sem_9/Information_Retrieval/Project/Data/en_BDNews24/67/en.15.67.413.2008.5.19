 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Monday claimed the judiciary was "still not free" despite recent separation from the executive branch. "The judiciary is not free despite being separated. It is being controlled from an invisible place," Ashraful told newly elected leaders of Dhaka Bar Association. "The judiciary must be made completely free," he said. The lawyers met Awami League leaders at the Gulshan home of the party's acting president Zillur Rahman. The AL leaders also reiterated their position that the party would not enter into dialogue or participate in the polls without the full participation of party chief Sheikh Hasina. bdnews
