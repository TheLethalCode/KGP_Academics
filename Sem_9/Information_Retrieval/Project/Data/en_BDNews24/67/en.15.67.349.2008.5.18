<TEXT>
 SAN FRANCISCO, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Singer Ashlee Simpson on Saturday married her fiance, rocker Pete Wentz, People magazine reported. Simpson's father hosted the wedding at his Encino, California home, performing a nondenominational ceremony in front of about 150 guests, the magazine said on its Web site, quoting a representative of the couple. Simpson and Wentz announced their engagement in April and have been romantically linked since 2006. The marriage is the first for both. Several media organizations have also reported that Simpson is pregnant, but Wentz has denied this. Simpson, 23, released her third music album, "Bittersweet World," in April. She is the younger sister of singer and actress Jessica Simpson, who acted as maid of honor at the wedding. Wentz, 28, co-founded Fall Out Boy in 2001. The band has since built a loyal following with albums like its popular 2005 release, "From Under the Cork Tree."
