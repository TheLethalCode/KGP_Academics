 AMSTERDAM, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Edgar Davids will leave Ajax Amsterdam after this season as his contract expires on June 30, the Dutch club said on their official Web site (www.ajax.nl) on Tuesday. "It is a pity that we will separate as I am a boy from Amsterdam and have special feelings for the club," Davids was quoted as saying. "But I don't want to stay at Ajax at any price. I said before that the chance I would stay was not big. "At this time I don't know where I will go. There has been interest from domestic and foreign clubs. I am fit and still feel good enough to play football on this level." The 35-year-old midfielder has won 74 caps and scored six goals for the Netherlands but has not been called up for the national side since Marco van Basten took over as coach after Euro 2004. Van Basten will take charge of Ajax after next month's European championship. Davids started his professional career aged 18 at Ajax and won the UEFA Cup and Champions League with the club. In 1996, Davids joined AC Milan but he moved on 18 months later to sign for Juventus, where he played for six years. After spells at Barcelona, Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur, Davids returned to Ajax in January 2007
