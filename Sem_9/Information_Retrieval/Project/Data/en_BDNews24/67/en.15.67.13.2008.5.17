<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has indicated its willingness to extend the mobile phone network beyond the municipal areas of the Chittagong Hill Tracts following years of restricted coverage in the area, an official said Saturday. MA Malek, a special assistant to the chief adviser, made his remarks at an event to mark World Telecommunication and Information Society Day at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. The special assistant said the post and telecommunications ministry, which he oversees, would make a proposal to the government regarding the move soon. "CHT is one tenth of the country's total area. The mobile network has been extended to municipalities and twenty-five upazilas are now connected by BTTB's analogue telephones," said Malek. "However, some areas are lagging behind other parts of the country. We will ask the government to extend the mobile phone network beyond the municipal areas," he said. The CA's special assistant ruled out fears that widening phone facilities in the area would add fuel to the insurgency: "I say they have even better technology. We have to see things positively." Malek also rolled out a proposal to amalgamate the science and information technology ministry with the telecommunications ministry and information ministry. On a separate issue, Manzurul Alam, chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, said physically challenged people should have greater access to information technology resources. "It's our duty to open up the door of information technology for communities lagging behind in society," said Alam. bdnews
