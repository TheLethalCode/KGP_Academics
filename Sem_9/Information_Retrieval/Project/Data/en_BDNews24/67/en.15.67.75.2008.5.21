 MOSCOW, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson sought on Tuesday to take some of the pressure off Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney by singling out Carlos Tevez as a potential Champions League final match-winner. Ronaldo has taken most of the credit this season, after scoring an incredible 41 goals, but Ferguson warned against expecting too much of the 23-year-old Portugal winger and his other high-profile forward Rooney, who is 22. "They are young, first of all," Ferguson told a news conference the night before United face Chelsea on Wednesday in the first all-English Champions League final. "They have big futures ahead of them in terms of their ability, temperament and nerve, and their courage to play. "It's a big stage for them tomorrow and a big challenge for them but it's a challenge for every one of the players." But Ferguson added: "You can't look on those two lads as our saviours tomorrow. You need 11 players performing at the top level. That way we have a massive chance." He singled out Tevez as the player who could make the difference at the Luzhniki Stadium, adding that the directors were working hard to keep Tevez at the club beyond next year. "Tevez has been a fantastic player for us. It amazes me that a man can have so much energy in a game. The most important facet is his ability to score important goals," said Ferguson. Tevez, who joined United on a two-year loan deal last year, has been an unsung hero at Old Trafford this season. Ferguson likened the Argentina forward to Eric Cantona, the Frenchman whose habit of scoring goals at vital moments played such a big part in turning United back into England's top team. "We had a player like Tevez years ago in Cantona, who could make and score goals at important times," said Ferguson. "Tevez can do that, and he's one of the reasons we won the (Premier League) championship and we're here in the Champions League final.
