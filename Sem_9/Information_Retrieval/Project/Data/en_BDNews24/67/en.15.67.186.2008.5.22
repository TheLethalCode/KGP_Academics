 Gaza, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Palestinian suicide truck bomber attacked a key border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel on Thursday causing damage but no casualties. A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad group said they carried out the attack on the Erez crossing in cooperation with the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's more secular Fatah faction.

Israeli and Gaza Strip residents who live over 30 km (20 miles) from the crossing reported hearing the blast.
