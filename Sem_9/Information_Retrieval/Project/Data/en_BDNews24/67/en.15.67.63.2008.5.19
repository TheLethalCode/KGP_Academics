<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Workers Party has expressed support for the Awami League's probable decision not to join dialogue without its party chief Sheikh Hasina. "We will attend the dialogue to say that it will not be successful without Sheikh Hasina," party president Rashed Khan Menon told a press conference Monday. Awami League and Workers Party leaders held a meeting earlier in the day at AL's acting president Zillur Rahman's house, ahead of the formal dialogue. Zillur told reporters: "We have had a successful meeting. Both the parties have agreed that the chief adviser's address to the nation is not acceptable anyhow." "We think the state of emergency should be withdrawn ahead of the national elections and the presence of Sheikh Hasina in the dialogue is crucial." "Both the parties have agreed that the dialogue will not be meaningful without her," the AL acting president said. Menon echoed Zillur's stance on the lifting of emergency rule. "The national elections should take place prior to all," he added. His party would go to the dialogue, Menon said. "But we will go just to say that the dialogue will not be successful without Hasina." bdnews2
