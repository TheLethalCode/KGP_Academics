 LONDON, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook posted their first test opening century stand on Sunday before falling victims to the accurate New Zealand pace attack on the fourth day of the first test at Lord's. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori then captured the prize wicket of Kevin Pietersen lbw for three to reduce England to 160 for three at lunch in reply to his side's first innings 277. The sun shone for the first time in the match after 153.2 overs were lost to rain and bad light on the first three days but England, resuming at 89 for no wicket, made little headway against the Kiwi bowlers. The England openers passed 100 for the first time in 23 test outings before Cook fell, caught behind off the impressive Chris Martin for 61. Strauss was dismissed lbw by Jacob Oram for 63 after recording his 12th test fifty. Both were forced to labour hard against Martin, who bowled an excellent spell from both sides of the wicket from the Pavilion End. He bowled two maidens in a row to Cook, who had been the more enterprising of the pair. Cook relieved the pressure in Martin's next over with a pulled four but was then badly beaten outside the off-stump. Martin was finally rewarded for an intelligent spell when he squared Cook up with a delivery moving into the batsman which then cut away off the pitch. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum took the edge tumbling in front of first slip Ross Taylor. Kyle Mills, who also bowled a tight line, conceded only 15 runs from 5.4 overs on Sunday before he was replaced by Jacob Oram. Oram, who immediately beat Strauss outside the off-stump won an lbw decision from umpire Simon Taufel with a ball pitching on leg-stump. Martin was finally rested 80 minutes into the session after figures of 8-3-20-1 for his morning's work with Vettori coming on for the first time in the match. The slow left-armer made a significant contribution for his side with the wicket of Pietersen, who was comprehensively beaten pushing forward to a straight deliver
