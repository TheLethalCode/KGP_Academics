<TITLE> Fuel subsidies threaten efforts to curb poverty: ADB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Development Bank's country chief Hua Du indicated Sunday that huge subsidies for fuel might be hindering the government's targeted interventions to protect the poor. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation's losses in FY 2008 totalled US$ 1.1 billion, and large fuel subsidies pose significant fiscal challenges, said the bank's latest Quarterly Economic Update. Asked whether ADB had any suggestions to ease the pressure from BPC, the bank's country director said: "The subsidies in fuel prices are huge. Bangladesh needs more focus on targeted interventions to protect the poor." The March issue of ADB's Quarterly Economic Update on Bangladesh, released Sunday, said the government's revenue collection rose by 23.1 percent in July-March FY2008, over the corresponding period of FY2007, but it estimated the fiscal deficit would also rise. Speaking to the press on the release of the report, Hua Du said streamlining and simplifying tax laws, expanding the tax base, boosting private sector development and reducing tax exemptions and evasion is much needed for increased revenue collection. The multi-lateral agency said that revenue had improved after several years of poor performance, but the fiscal deficit is also likely to rise to 4.8 percent of GDP compared with 3.2 percent in the preceding year. The report also said that GDP growth is expected at 6 percent, down from 6.5 percent in FY 2007 due to a slash in agricultural growth following extensive flooding and 2007's cyclone while inflation rate reached at 10 percent in March this year. Bangladesh as a net importer of food grains is seriously affected by food price shocks, driven by higher international food prices and domestic production shortfall following consecutive natural disasters, said the bank. Bottlenecks in the distribution and retail management chain, monetary accommodations of previous years and panic also pushed inflation higher. "Although upward price pressures somewhat eased by early May 2008, prices of rice and wheat in the domestic market is still 50 percent higher than in FY2007," the ADB said. Speaking on policy responses in wake of the elusive food security situation, with an estimated food deficit of 0.34 million tonnes, Hua Du stressed improving agricultural productivity. "Over the medium to longer term, the focus should be on broadening use of modern production technologies, reliable and expanded irrigation system, efficient fertilizer distribution, producing quality seeds," she said. "In the short-term the focus should be on targeted interventions to protect the poor and vulnerable in the face of rising prices." On the state of industry, ADB said the sector was affected by sluggish investment and low export oriented manufacturing activity during the first half of FY2008. Nonetheless, the industry sector has rebounded during the second half, indicated by an upward trend in export oriented manufacturing, especially the RMG sector, with effective measures taken by the government to restore business confidence, according to the economic update. The ADB's Bangladesh chief gave particularly mention to the telecoms sector in Bangladesh, saying it was undergoing rapid structural change and dramatic economic growth. "Rational and transparent regulatory regime and a congenial atmosphere for investments is essential for further growth of the service and industry sector," she added. Hua Du also mentioned that her tenure in Bangladesh has almost expired and she would be leaving the country by the end of June. Asked to point out the most critical challenges facing Bangladesh based on her 5-year experience in the country, she said huge investments for infrastructure developments in power, education and transport remain one of the biggest challenges. "Then I would say Bangladesh has to do a lot regarding governance issues like increasing efficiency, bringing about transparency and faster decision-making; and lastly, political stability is fundamentally important for Bangladesh's economic growth," the ADB country chief said. bdn
