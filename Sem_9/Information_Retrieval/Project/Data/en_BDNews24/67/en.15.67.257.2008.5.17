<TITLE> Tevez looks for happy ending </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, England, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Tevez, whose life story is to be put onto film, could add an extra dramatic scene by helping Manchester United win the Champions League. The film should tell of Tevez's dramatic impact on English football, which will hit a new peak if he helps United beat Chelsea in the Champions League final in Moscow on Wednesday. "Once this game is over, I will be going back to Argentina. In June a film about my life will be started and that will be a thrilling project to be involved in," Tevez told reporters on Friday. After a first season in the Premier League when Tevez almost single-handedly saved West Ham United from relegation, the Argentina international moved to Old Trafford last year. He has already helped Alex Ferguson's side win the league title and success in Europe will further vindicate his decision to join United. "I know a lot of South Americans prefer to play in Italy or Spain when they move to Europe but I am really pleased that I came here," said Tevez, who has scored 19 goals this season. "This is the best league in the world and I am among some of the best footballers in the world here. I am really happy about that. "I am not one to be making comparisons between clubs but Manchester United are right up there with anyone in the world. "From day one, everyone has treated me well and made me feel right at home. The fans even shout 'Argentina'. "As a player, to come somewhere like this and have the opportunity to win two big trophies is absolutely fantastic. It is not just me, it is everyone. The atmosphere around the squad is amazing. "Maybe one day I will play in (Spain's) La Liga but that is a long way off. At the moment I am more than happy here. I would certainly love to extend my contract. I would go and sign right now if the opportunity was there." Tevez scored vital goals against AS Roma and Olympique Lyon to help United reach Wednesday's final, which the 24-year-old believes will be closely watched in his home country. "After the World Cup and the domestic tournaments, it is the most followed competition," said Tevez. "For a player, being involved in it, it is the second biggest thing you can be involved in after the World Cup.
