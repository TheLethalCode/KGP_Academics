 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Sunday began hearing the anticipatory bail petitions submitted by former ministers MK Anwar, M Shamsul Islam and Matiur Rahman Nizami, accused in the Gatco graft case. All three arrived at the High Court Sunday to be present through the hearings. After the three bail petitions were submitted to the two-member High Court bench, comprising justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Rais Uddin, the judges said they would start the hearings at 2pm. Barrister Abdur Razzak submitted the bail petition of Jama'at-e-Islami leader and former minister Matiur Rahman Nizami on his behalf and advocate Mahbubur Rahman did the same on behalf of MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam. A large number of BNP and Jama'at-e-Islami supporters assembled at the High Court to witness the court hearings involving their top leaders. Earlier in the week a two-member HC bench, of justices Md Mozammel Hossain and Syed AB Mahmudul Haque, had initially said it could not accept bail petitions submitted by Anwar and Islam. Following a recent Supreme Court ruling that even the higher courts cannot consider granting bail in EPR cases, such bail petitions cannot be accepted for hearing, the HC bench said Thursday. However, when the bail petitions were submitted later the same day to another HC bench, of justices Khandakar Musa Khaled and Mainul Islam Chowdhury, lawyers for the former ministers told reporters that the bench might hear the anticipatory bail petitions on Sunday. Barrister Ruhul Quddus, counsel of the accused, said: " These anticipatory bail petitions have been submitted under special circumstances. The High Court doesn't ordinarily consider any anticipatory bail pleas after charge framing in an ordinary case." "Originally, the case details didn't mention MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam; their names were later included in the charge sheet. Therefore, the court can consider the bail petitions." The Anti-Corruption Commission pressed charges on May 13 against detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, Matiur Rahman Nizami and 22 others in the Gatco graft case. The court has issued warrants of arrest against 12 people accused in the case including former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Matiur Rahman Nizami, MK Anwar, M Shamsul Islam and Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and ordered confiscation of their assets. bdnews24.com/a
