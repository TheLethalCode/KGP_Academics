 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami at his Maghbazar home Sunday night amid protests by several hundred party workers. Jamaat activists led by some senior leaders took to the streets amid heavy rain and briefly blocked the road to stop a police car from leading their leader away. Nizami was taken to the Cantonment Police Station after arrest, officer-in-charge Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com by phone "I have done no wrong," Nizami told reporters and Jamaat workers as he was being driven to the Cantonment Police Station. A former minister in the previous BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government, Nizami is the last of the chiefs of the three major political parties to have been arrested in an anticorruption crackdown by the interim government. Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, chiefs of the Awami League and BNP, also former prime ministers, were arrested last year on charges of corruption. Deputy police commissioner for Ramna zone Atiqul Islam led the team in the raid on Nizami's home. The team including Ramna police chief ABM Daulat Akbar arrived at Nizami's home around 10pm. The police had also hemmed in the house of former minister MK Anwar, who was not at home, senior assistant superintendent of police for Ramna zone Hamida Parveen told reporters. Nizami and MK Anwar, both accused in the GATCO case filed by the Anticorruption Commission, were facing an arrest warrant issued by a Dhaka court. Police entered Anwar's house on Elephant Road at 9:50pm. Former secretary general of BNP and former minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan had surrendered to court in the same case earlier in the day. He was sent to prison. M Shamsul Islam, former information minister under the Khaleda administration, also landed in jail after he turned himself in to court in the same case. bdnews24.
