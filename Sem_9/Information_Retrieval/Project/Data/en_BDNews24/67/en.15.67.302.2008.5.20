 BUENOS AIRES, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Carlos Tevez was left out of the Argentina squad on Monday for next month's friendlies against Mexico and the United States. Porto's Lisandro Lopez and Fernando Cavenaghi of Girondins Bordeaux were named as two of the forwards along with Sergio Aguero, Lionel Messi and Julio Cruz. Manchester United striker Tevez also missed the 2-0 friendly win over Egypt in March, the only match Argentina have played this year. Tevez's recent international form has been poor and he was sent off on his last appearance, in a World Cup qualifier in Colombia in November, for petulantly kicking an opponent. Colombia went on to win 2-1. Tevez is suspended for the World Cup qualifier at home to Ecuador in June. Argentina face Mexico in San Diego on June 4 and United States in New York four days later. Goalkeepers: Roberto Abbondanzieri (Getafe), Oscar Ustari (Getafe) Defenders: Gabriel Heinze (Real Madrid), Fabricio Coloccini (Deportivo Coruna), Pablo Zabaleta (Espanyol), Javier Zanetti (Inter Milan), Nicolas Burdisso (Inter Milan), Martin Demichelis (Bayern Munich) Midfielders: Fernando Gago (Real Madrid), Maximiliano Rodriguez (Atletico Madrid), Gonzalo Rodrguez (Villarreal), Jonas Gutierrez (Real Mallorca), Ever Banega (Sevilla), Esteban Cambiasso (Inter Milan), Jose Sosa (Bayern Munich), Javier Mascherano (Liverpool) Forwards: Sergio Aguero (Atletico Madrid), Lionel Messi (Barcelona), Julio Cruz (Inter Milan), Lisandro Lopez (Porto), Fernando Cavenaghi (Girondins Bordeaux)
