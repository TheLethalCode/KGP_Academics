 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)US deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labour Erica Barks-Ruggles said Wednesday that Washington wanted a strong democratic government in Bangladesh so it could play its role more effectively in the region. The senior State Department official said her country was waiting to see a democratically elected government assume office by the end of December and the military go back to the barracks. Barks-Ruggles said there was some ambiguity in the caretaker government about the role of the military. "We need a strong partner in Bangladesh, we need a strong democratic partner in Bangladesh," she told a roundtable with journalists at the American Club in Gulshan. "We believe that Bangladesh has an important role to play in the region. It has a vigorously growing economy and we would like to see grow it faster, it could go faster," she said. "A strong democratic institution can help Bangladesh play that role and I am trying to reinforce that." Barks-Ruggles, who arrived on May 19 in Dhaka, met the advisers and top government officials, military officers, the political parties, civil society representatives and other stakeholder during the last two days. "There has been a little bit ambiguous (about the role of the military) in the caretaker administration. We look forward to the day when a democratic government is placed and the military can go back to their traditional roles," Barks-Ruggles said. She said that the military had assured her that there would be no military takeover in Bangladesh. "We view the role of the military in any democracy as a guarantor of the security of the borders of the country and the security of the country itself." Barks-Ruggles said all political parties would take part in the upcoming elections. "I have had my meetings with the political parties as part of my efforts. I have not heard anybody saying that they are not going to participate in the elections yet," Barks-Ruggles said. She said the state of emergency should be lifted before the election. Barks-Ruggles said the political parties, military, NGOs, civil society, media and other stakeholder wanted restoration of democracy in Bangladesh. She stressed that the political parties should sit with the government and address the unresolved issues. bdn
