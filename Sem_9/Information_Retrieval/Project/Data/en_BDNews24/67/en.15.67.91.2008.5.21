 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The government sent a team of doctors and a consignment of medicine to Myanmar Wednesday in aid of the country's cyclone victims, a senior army officer said. Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, Quarter Master General of the Bangladesh Army, spoke to reporters after inspecting Kurmitola airport in the morning. He said a transport plane carrying four tonnes of medicine took off at 9 am and another aircraft carrying a 34-member medical team departed an hour later for Myanmar. "Our own country being disaster-prone, we're able to rush to our neighbouring countries in such crises to assist them with our own experience of handling such predicaments," Chowdhury said. "In this spirit, our government has taken necessary initiatives to provide help to the cyclone-stricken Myanmarese." The QMG said that army, navy and civilian doctors, led by Lt Col Anwar, constituted a self-sufficient medical team that will be able to provide all kinds of medical interventions including surgery during its 15-day stay in the country. The planes carried medicines and all necessary equipment for treating the sick, Lt Col Anwar told bdnews24.com. "We are going to Myanmar in aid of humanity in distress. This is the third batch of aid our government has decided to send to Myanmar following the cyclone." "We have always stood beside our own people in all calamities. Similarly, we are going now to Myanmar to help the cyclone victims there." Bangladesh sent aid to Myanmar immediately after the Cyclone Nargis hit, in two batches on May 7 and May 8. bdnews24.co
