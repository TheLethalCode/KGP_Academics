 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Saturday the caretaker government would take all necessary steps to ensure the labour law is observed in the shrimp industry. "This (compliance with labour law) is an essential instrument to access the global market," Rahman told a seminar on labour issues in the shrimp processing industry. The adviser said the government and other stakeholders were taking a "proactive and problem-solving approach" towards the issue. "Bangladesh has embarked on a very important journey to improve the livelihoods of workers and other citizens of the country," he said. Rahman stressed the need for ongoing monitoring of employers' compliance with labour laws, calling for a "credible body of evidence" within the area that would build confidence in all stakeholders. Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation (BSFF) and Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association (BFFEA) co-organised the seminar. In his key note presentation, Dr Mahmudul Karim, an executive director of the BSFF, said it had been decided with frozen food exporters that the BFFEA would issue a declaration that all plants under their purview would have to comply with labour laws. Dr Karim said areas of concern included child labour issues, the provision of complaint boxes, and access for labour rights bodies to assess workplace conditions. Panuddha Bonpala, director of the International Labour Organisation's Bangladesh chapter, stressed the importance of providing children with access to an education to put an end to child labour. "Children should be provided with the right opportunities such as formal and informal education as well as vocational education," she said. Acting labour and employment secretary Mahfuzul Haque said anyone found violating labour laws would face dire consequences. "I would like to say this very clearly: violators of the labour act will not go unpunished," he said. Haque added that his ministry had taken an initiative to train labour inspectors to ensure strict adherence to the law. BSFF chairman Syed Mahmudul Haque referred to the release of a report "Degradation of Work: True Cost of Shrimp" by AFL-CIO late last month bringing allegations of violation of labour rights in Bangladesh and Thailand. "When we have been trying to build a relationship among employers, workers, government and NGO officials based on mutual respect and trust, instead of allegations and counter allegations, to realize the common goal of improving the workers rights, the release of the report was really unfortunate." "It took us all by surprise." Mahmudul Haque said: "By releasing this report to the press and public, they (allegations) have gone to a larger audience, over which they do not have any control. It might prompt some consumer right groups or politicians to call for a boycott of Bangladeshi and Thai products that would certainly affect our exports and employment." "The AFL-CIO representative in Dhaka, when contacted, assured us that they do not have any intention to harm Bangladesh's exports and are ready to work together with BFFEA and BSFF to contain the fallout arising out of their publishing this report," he said. David J Welsh, country director of the American Centre for International Labour Solidarity, said progress in the area of labour issues had been quite impressive, although he called for stricter measures in the future to ensure greater compliance in all domestic industries. Welsh made it clear that he did not support any boycott of Bangladeshi products. "We are in no way for a boycott, rather we are advocating labour compliance issues for greater global acceptance of Bangladeshi products," he said. The chief adviser's special assistant for fisheries and livestock Manik Lal Samaddar, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, fisheries and livestock secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, USAID country director Denise Rollins and BFFEA president Kazi Belayet Hossain also spoke. bdn
