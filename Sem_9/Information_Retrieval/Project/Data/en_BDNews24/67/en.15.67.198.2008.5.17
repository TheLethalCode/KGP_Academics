 LONDON, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five stoppages for bad light deprived spectators of 43.1 overs in the first test between England and New Zealand at Lord's on Friday. Frustrated spectators, who had paid around 60 pounds ($116) for a a ticket, whistled and booed as the players left the field and returned with no apparent change in the light. The senior umpire, Jamaican Steve Bucknor, was a particular target as he stood with Simon Taufel in the middle consulting his light meter while making no move to call the players out again. "The International Cricket Council will call it thoroughness but from elsewhere it simply looked like another white-coated official being a jobsworth at Lord's," Derek Pringle wrote in Saturday's Daily Telegraph. "As one of the press photographers confirmed, the light did not really change all day, except through the light meter wielded by Mr Bucknor." Former England international and coach David Lloyd said Friday had been "an absolute shocker today for everybody concerned". "I think that there should be better communication from the umpires out in the middle and from the announcements just so that everybody knows exactly what is happening and what the light meter readings are," Lloyd told the cricinfo Web site (www.cricinfo.com). "You can tell the public that the conditions have now improved so we're going on. If the umpire was microphoned-up and you could hear him in the ground, he could then tell everybody on the ground." Rain delayed the start of play for 25 minutes on Saturday and the players left the field 40 minutes later after another shower on a dull, overcast day in which bad light could again be a factor
