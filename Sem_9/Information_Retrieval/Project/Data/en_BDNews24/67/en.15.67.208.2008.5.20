<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court issued an arrest warrant Tuesday against former army chief Mostafizur Rahman, an accused in the MiG-29 case, after revoking his bail. Dhaka divisional judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder also deferred the case proceedings to May 28 as Mostafiz could not attend the court for illness. The court had earlier deferred proceedings for the same reason on May 11, in the case involving the purchase of eight MiG-29 war planes during Sheikh Hasina's term as prime minister. Hasina and six other accused in the case were produced in the Dhaka Divisional Judge's Court, on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises, Tuesday morning. The now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the case on Dec 11, 2001, with Tejgaon Police Station against seven accused including Hasina alleging misconduct in the purchase of the war planes. The case details said the government incurred losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore due to the contentious purchase in 1999 during Hasina's tenure as prime minister. Hasina made an appeal to the High Court in 2003 to cancel the case, which was rejected. bdnew
