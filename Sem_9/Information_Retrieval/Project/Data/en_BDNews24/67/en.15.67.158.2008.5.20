 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced former minister barrister Aminul Haque to 10 years on charges of accumulating illegal wealth and concealing wealth information from the Anticorruption Commission. Judge Tanzina Ismail of Special Judge's Court-6, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex, also fined him Tk 1 lakh, or another three months behind bars if he fails to pay, and ordered authorities to confiscate his illegal wealth. Aminul is currently fugitive; his sentence will come into effect from the day of his arrest or surrender. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Ramna Police Station against the former post and telecommunications minister on Dec 21 last year. A Rajshahi court last year sentenced Aminul to 31 years and six months, along with 24 others, for aiding and abetting militants. bdnews24
