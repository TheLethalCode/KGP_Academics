 TEL AVIV, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Avram Grant's success at Chelsea is a "one-in-a-million" story, an Israeli coach who also played under him told Reuters ahead of Wednesday's Champions League final against Manchester United in Moscow. Grant replaced Jose Mourinho last September and although a swift downfall was predicted for the Israeli, he led Chelsea to within a whisker of the English Premier League title and has guided them to the biggest match in European club soccer. "Nobody could have imagined three years ago that Avram would become the head coach of Chelsea. It is a story in a million," said Nir Levin, coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv, a club at which Grant had success with in the 1990s. Like many Israelis who see Grant as an ambassador for their country, Levin will watch Wednesday's clash in the hope that Chelsea can win one of the sport's most coveted trophies. He said Grant had the ability to get the win. "His great knowledge comes with an ability to teach the players... he is often quiet and sometimes shy but he also knows to shout and get the best from his players," Levin said. Maccabi midfielder Avi Nimni, whom Grant appointed as Israel captain when he coached the national team, also speaks highly of his mentor. "He knows what the players need, he instills confidence in them and he does his homework well on opposing teams. I think this is why he is at the top of his game," Nimni said. The 36-year-old Nimni, who retired at the weekend after a very prominent 18-year playing career, said Grant's success could raise the profile of Israeli soccer. "He is a symbol and an emissary for Israel because Chelsea is a top club in world soccer. I don't think there are any soccer fans who do not know Avram Grant and this is very important for Israeli football," Nimni said. Nimni said there were some in Israel who were "a bit jealous" of Grant but added: "What he is doing for us is something unbelievable and I hope others will follow his example by coaching and playing at top clubs." Levin was not so certain that other Israeli coaches would soon be emulating Grant at the top level. "I cannot believe that it will happen again but perhaps it will open a small window for Israeli coaches, perhaps not in England, but in other places. We want him to win on Wednesday and then we'll see if it can help us," Levin said. UNBELIVABLE APPOINTMENT But not all Israelis will be rooting for Grant. Journalist Avi Meller, a leading expert on English soccer, said that even in Israel there was much opposition to Grant. "Israel is divided between appreciating, admiring and hating Avram Grant. Some find the appointment unbelievable, illogical and insane... for them it looks as if somebody has broken the order of things in the English game." Meller said that some Israeli Chelsea supporters wanted the Blues to lose on Wednesday so that Grant would be sacked. "They cannot digest the fact that a coach they consider has no pedigree has taken the club from them," Meller said. He added that while Grant was the complete opposite to the flamboyant Mourinho in terms of media appeal, Meller felt the Israeli had made his mark where it mattered most: with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. "Mourinho was a world beater and an erotic dream for the press. He could supply the goods on the pitch and off it. The grey Grant, with his monotonous tone, is the total opposite," Meller added. "But he should have done enough by now to win the hearts and minds of the Chelsea supporters and I think he has done enough in the eyes of Roman Abramovich.
