"I am sure the major parties are responsible organisations. They will show a sense of responsibility in the dialogue," Zillur told reporters in a discussion meeting at the National Academy for Education Management in the capital. Zillur, one of the advisers assigned to conduct pre-dialogue talks, asked all political parties to join the dialogue with a positive view to resolving issues. "The dialogue will see a good result if the parties go forward with an attitude of solution," the adviser said. "We have already sent letters to all political parties. Seven parties have sent back lists of their representatives." "We are working on the schedules now," Zillur said. The purpose of the dialogue is to fulfill the people's desires and expectations and these will be met through holding a proper election, he said.
