 Maruf Mallick Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Norwegian telecoms group Telenor Tuesday responded to reports of dangerous job conditions and the use of child labour by Grameenphone's subcontractors in Bangladesh. A Danish television documentary by Tom Heinemann last week revealed dangerous working conditions, accidental deaths, pollution and use of children at subcontractors in Bangladesh, unleashing a flood of criticism in Norwegian media. Telenor holds 62 percent of Grameenphone, which employed the subcontractors to make mobile antenna towers. "I am both saddened and surprised to learn that Telenor's regulations have been violated and that key terms in our contracts with our suppliers have been breached," said Telenor CEO Jon Fredrik Baksaas in a statement released in Oslo. Previous inspections carried out on production sites by representatives from Grameenphone have failed to bring to light the unacceptable conditions at the sites of the suppliers, the CEO said. "Telenor has drawn up comprehensive and unambiguous guidelines to ensure our corporate responsibility and that operations are run in accordance with our ethical standards." "We recognise however that inspection routines have been inadequate and that we have failed to follow up our extensive regulations with respect to these suppliers. We have now taken immediate steps to ensure that required standards are adhered to," Baksaas said. The documentary's revelations that children were employed at the Bangladeshi suppliers caused stern rebukes in Norway of Telenor from organisations like Save the Children. Baksaas, who has faced criticism for not knowing about the conditions, was called in to brief the board about the situation on Tuesday. The CEO has the full confidence of the Board and we are satisfied with the initiatives that (Telenor) has taken," the company's chairman Harald Norvik said in a statement. Norvik said this was a "serious situation" which should never had happened, but that the focus should now be on measures to rectify it. Shares in Telenor, the world's seventh largest mobile operator, traded flat at 197.25 crowns by 1316 GMT, valuing the group at about 180 billion crowns ($35.91 billion), after rising as much as 1.6 percent on the day. "This may affect Telenor's reputation, but financially, it is less important," said analyst Espen Torgersen at Carnegie. The documentary said children as young as 13 years old worked at the factories, climbing with no safety net in the 50 metres tall antenna towers. It also revealed how a 22-year old worker died when falling into a non-secured pool of acid and that farmers had their crops ruined by waste from the factories. ZERO TOLERANCE Grameenphone said it was working with the vendors to ensure compliance with all relevant local regulations and to improve conditions in factories but admitted it did not do enough. "We have zero tolerance for any breach of local laws and regulations and we are committed to improve the working conditions in these vendor factories," said Anders Jensen, chief executive of Grameenphone, top cellphone carrier in Bangladesh. "We have been working methodically with the tower vendors to ensure compliance with all local laws and regulations relating to the use of child labour and health, safety and environment issues," he told Reuters in Dhaka. "However, our follow-up measures may not have been adequate," he added. The vendors were providing services to the entire telecoms industry in Bangladesh, not just Grameenphone. ACTIONS TAKEN Telenor said it had carried out inspections at factory premises, requested confirmation that conditions were in accordance with standards and that it terminated business connections with one vendor. 1. All GP's suppliers have been asked to confirm that conditions are in accordance with standards specified in the contracts. 2. GP's business connections with vendor Mizan Hatim Engineering have been terminated after inspections revealed that a boy below the age-limit set for this specific industry was working on the facilities. 3. Working conditions at the facilities of the four remaining suppliers of mobile antenna towers to Grameenphone will be subject to thorough review. Reuters contributed to the report. bdn
