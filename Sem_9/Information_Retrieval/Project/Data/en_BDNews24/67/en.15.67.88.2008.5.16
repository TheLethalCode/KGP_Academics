<TITLE> McCullum brings one-day skills to Lord's test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brendon McCullum transported the special skills of limited overs cricket to the spiritual home of the game on Thursday in a bitter-sweet day for the New Zealand wicketkeeper. McCullum rescued New Zealand's first innings on the opening day of the first test against England at Lord's with a run-a-ball 97, taking the visitors from a precarious 104 for five to a comparatively respectable 208 for six. A boundary short of his first test century against England he then missed a straight ball from Money Panesar and was bowled. While Panesar and the England team celebrated without restraint, McCullum stood for a minute with his head bowed before walking slowly back to the pavilion. Four years ago he fell four short of a century at Lord's batting at number three. "If we had been bowled out for 150 there was only one team that could have won this game," McCullum told a news conference. "England are on top but for us it's not a bad day either. It was pretty bitter-sweet, I'm proud but a touch disappointed. "Last time I got very nervous through the nineties. I have spend the last four years thinking about it. "This time I felt quite comfortable, I just thought remain aggressive, I just missed a straight one." McCullum battled hard and had a share of luck in his first 50 runs. James Anderson was the pick of the England attack with three wickets but the ball moved around for all the bowlers after Michael Vaughan had won the toss and asked the Kiwis to bat. UGLY INNINGS "It was extremely tough batting conditions. You could be happy with playing an ugly innnings for a period of time," McCullum added. "Runs on the board was going to be the most significant aspect. At 100 for five it was teetering and in real danger of being rock and roll." After reaching his ninth test half-century, NcCullum began to take charge, moving down the pitch in a manner he has introduced to one-day cricket where he bats at opener. "We have got plans for him but it's disconcerting," Anderson confessed. McCullum said his good form in one-day cricket helped in what he called "the pinnacle of the game". He was also self-deprecating about a magnificent six over extra-cover off the distinctly quick Stuart Broad. "I think it was the only one I hit in the middle. It was quite nice," he said. McCullum said the Kiwis, with Jacob Oram and captain Daniel Vettori at the crease, were still targeting around 300 or 350. "That would be a fantastic effort after losing the toss on that wicket with the overhead conditions the way they were," he said. "That's the goal, if we do that we will head into our bowling with a lot of confidence.
