<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Last year's joint champions Usha Krira Chakra consolidated their lead in the Premier Division Hockey League with an emphatic 5-3 win over Mohammedan Sporting Club at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Tuesday. With the eighth straight triumph, the Old Dhaka outfit, Usha, raised their point tally to 25, five points ahead of Abahani Limited, who, however, played one match short of the leaders. Mohammedan stuck to their 17 points from eight outings. "Our strategy was to keep pressure on Mohammedan, whose young players, we knew, would fail to take pressure from the beginning and we eventually came out successful," said Usha's Pakistani coach Rana Jahir. Jahir also said that they had guarded Mohammedan's Pakistani key player, Mohammad Sabbir, tightly and tried to confine him from the beginning." Mohammedan coach Jahirul Islam Mitul said they went down due to lack of experience despite taking an early lead in the match. Mitul also admitted that they depended on Sabbir, but he failed to show his natural play and Mohammedan took a defensive strategy in face of a series of attacks from the opponents. Having seen the scoreline it seemed that Mohammedan fought brilliantly against Usha, but the fact was that the match was totally a one-sided affair. Usha's trio Pakistani Akter Ali, best performer of the game, Tariq Aziz and Sajjad Anwar took control of the midfield while forwards Jahidul Islam Rajon and Maksudul Alam Habul kept the Mohammedan defenders busy throughout the game. Mohammedan forwards could hardly break Usha's defence marshalled by Tabib A Noor, Shamsuddin Tuhin and Khandakar Hasan while the Dhanmodi-based outfit forwards were totally off-colour, compared with their performance against Abahani in their previous match. Sabbir stunned Usha goalkeeper Mahbub Ullah Shakil with a reverse hit to give Mohammedan a fourth-minute lead, which was short-lived when Pakistani Akter levelled the margin in the 12th minute. Three minutes later, Akter scored his second goal converting a penalty stroke while Habul made it 3-1 in the 31st minute before Akter made it 4-1 two minutes before the breather. After the break, Mohammedan reduced the margin to 4-2 with Qumruzzaman Rana converting a penalty stroke in the 48th minute. Akter scored his fourth and team's fifth goal with a superb combination of Rajon and Shahidullah Titu. Usha's goal margin could have been double had Mohammedan's young goalkeeper Mehrab Hossain Kiron not salvaged his side foiling at least four or five attempts from Usha in the second half. However, Isa Mia converted a penalty corner to reduce Mohammedan margin to 5-3 five minutes from time.
