 MILAN, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan supporters have been banned from attending Sunday's final Serie A match at Parma, authorities said on Thursday, two days after supporters of title rivals AS Roma were barred from their game at Catania. Inter lead Roma by one point heading into the final weekend of the season with the two games also crucial for the bottom end of the table with Catania just two points above third-bottom Parma, who occupy the last relegation place. Fan violence has marred the Italian game in recent years with a policeman being killed in riots outside a match in Catania in February last year. A national anti-hooligan body, set up to rule on whether away supporters can attend certain high-risk matches, has been meeting all week and left the decision to the individual city authorities. The head of Parma's civil security body told reporters they had decided to ban Inter fans. "Yes, the body has agreed to the closure of the visitors' section of Parma's stadium for Sunday," Michele Formiglio said. Antonio Matarrese, the head of the Italian league, has been among those to criticise the decisions to ban the fans from possibly seeing their team win the title. Authorities say public safety is more important. Media reports said fan groups have threatened violence at Sunday's matches, with some away supporters still planning to travel to the games to protest. Roma fans were also banned for an Italian Cup semi-final, second leg at Catania last week. The match finished 1-1 but Roma reached the final 2-1 on aggregate
