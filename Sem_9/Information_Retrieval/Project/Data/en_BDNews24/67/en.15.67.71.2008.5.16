A special EU-wide telephone helpline and advertising campaign has been set up to help supporters deal with problems such as fake match tickets, delayed or cancelled air travel, double-booked hotels, health insurance and unsafe or damaged goods. "We want fans to have the best possible experience when they travel to Euro 2008," EU Consumer Affairs Commissioner Meglena Kuneva told reporters. "Understanding their consumer rights will help them greatly. This campaign is about giving people practical advice and sets out the things they should know before they go and the helpline is there to sort out problems for fans on the ground." UEFA president Michel Platini urged fans travelling to the finals in Austria and Switzerland, which kick off on June 7, to consult the special Web site (www.supportersrights.eu) set up as part of the campaign before travelling. "If fans have the right information before they arrive, then they will have more confidence and enjoy the experience more," Platini said. Although only Austria is a member of the EU, Kuneva said she expected the Swiss authorities to match the consumer rights in place across the 27-member bloc
