Four power plants were scheduled to go into production on May 15 and a fifth on May 23, but none of them would be able to start off before July. Power secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com: "Action will be taken, as per agreement, against the power plants that did not go into operation on schedule or were failing to do so. The agreement provides for punishment."

Kumargaon 50 MW power plant, scheduled to start on May 14, will go into operation by the end of this month.
