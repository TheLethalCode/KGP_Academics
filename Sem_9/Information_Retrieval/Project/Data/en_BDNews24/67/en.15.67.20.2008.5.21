<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court is expected to give a verdict Thursday on a writ petition seeking an order to hold national elections within a "reasonable time frame". A High Court bench of justices MA Rashid and Ashfakul Islam concluded its hearing on May 7 on the public interest writ petition filed by barrister Masud Reza Sobhan on Jan 24. The court ordered the Election Commission on Apr 30 to give official notification regarding an election date. On May 6, the commission replied that the Jatiya Sangsad polls would be held in December in line with the election roadmap and that work on the final voter listing would be ended in October. The High Court ordered the EC to explain why it should not be directed to hold the elections within "a reasonable timeframe". It also asked the EC and the government why the delay in holding an election within 90 days from the dissolution of parliament should not be declared illegal. bdnew
