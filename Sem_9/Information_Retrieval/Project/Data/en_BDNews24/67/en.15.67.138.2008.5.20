<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)Reformist BNP leader Hafizuddin Ahmed Tuesday asked the caretaker government to stop its fresh drive to arrest political leaders and to pay attention to creating a proper environment for the polls. The comment marks his first public criticism of the caretaker government, which came two days after former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan landed in jail in the GATCO scam case. "Instead of creating an environment for elections, the government has again started another arrest drive," said Hafizuddin. "It must be stopped. It will hinder the environment for the election," said Hafizuddin, an opponent of the Delwar-led faction of the divided party. "A case against former lawmakers and politicians for making recommendations for CI sheets is not acceptable when a meter reader of Titas Gas amassed crores of taka in illegal wealth." Expressing doubt about the success of probable dialogue, Hafizuddin said: "The government should not have arranged dialogue with political parties. It put the government in a double bind." Speaking at a press briefing at his Banani home, he said: "If the dialogue is not held with the two top political partiesBNP and the Awami Leaguethe talks will not be successful." "The main task of the caretaker government is to arrange a fair election at the earliest opportunity and transfer power to the elected representatives of the people." "Implementing the agenda for political parties is not the task of this government," Hafizuddin said. He said a final decision on whether his party would participate in the dialogue would be taken in consultation with party leaders and former lawmakers. However, the BNP leader added that his personal opinion was that it would be wrong to boycott the dialogue. He went on to criticise the government on a number of points, including their proposal for a national charter. He said it was up to political parties to formulate any such charter, not the caretaker administration. Hafizuddin said the only notable success for the government in the previous one-and-a-half years lay in the anticorruption drive. "It could not build food security in the country. They could not even generate one megawatts of power." "The economic indexes show the country has gone back 10 years. The country is lagging behind in all sectors, including poverty alleviation and export earning," Hafizuddin said. The acting secretary general, nominated by the BNP standing committee, further criticised the caretaker administration for failing to clearly state his position in the invitation letter sent to the party to take part in dialogue. bdnews24
