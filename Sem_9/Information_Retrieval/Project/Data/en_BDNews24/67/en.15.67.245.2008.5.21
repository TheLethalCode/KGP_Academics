 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com) - Abahani Limited retained the title of the Premier Division Cricket League when they handed a convincing four-wicket defeat to Surjo Torun Club in the last match of the Super League at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground Wednesday. Dhanmondi-based outfit Abahani raced to 162 for six in reply to Surjo Torun's paltry total of 160 all out in 39.2 overs. Biman were runners-up in the league, despite a huge 124 loss to Mohammedan in their last match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Mohammedan bundled Biman out for 115 in 28.3 overs after racking a competitive 239 all out in 50 overs. Biman and Abahani went on to play their final matches with equal points of 25 from 15 outings, but the latter were ahead in terms of the net run rate. The team needed the straight win against minnows Surjo Torun to win their second league trophy in a row. But national flag carrier Biman went down against Mohammedan. Abahani had started their Super League campaign behind leaders Biman and star-studded Mohammedan, but they emerged unbeaten defeating both Mohammedan and Biman at the end in back-to-back matches. With 13 wins in 16 matches, Abahani topped the points table with 27, followed by Biman on 25 points and Mohammedan on 24 points from 16 outings. Abahani vs Surjo Torun Left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny claimed five scalps as Surjo Torun ended up at 160 all out after deciding to bat first. Opener Shamsur Rahman and Shakil Haider gave Surjo Torun a fine start putting on 44 runs for the stand before Mohammad Rafique broke the stand removing Haider for 11 in the seventh over. In the next over, Sunny sent back Shamsur (29) before he saw some resistance from Nizam Uddin (24) and Naeem Islam (57). However, he again broke the third wicket stand having Nizam caught by Nadif Chowdhury while Tushar Imran removed Naeem to leave the side at 143 for six in 30.3 overs. Last six batsmen of Surjo Torun failed to cross the double digits in face of some brilliant bowling from Sunny (5/13), Tushar (2/10), Rafique (2/13) and Talha Jubaer (1/49). Chasing the target, Abahani had to wait for the 42nd over to reach home after being reduced to 29 for three in eight overs. However, Shahriar Nafees (31) and Sri Lankan Wwilna Sahan (46) repaired the damage to take Abahani to 98 before being separated. Sahan was caught by Shakil off Mohammad Younus for a 73-ball 46 and soon Nafees also followed Sahan to be trapped lbw by the same bowlers to leave the side at 108 for five in 23.1 overs. Skipper Tushar (13) and Nadif Chowdhury almost took the side to the shore putting on 39 runs for the fifth wicket and Nadif along with Arafat steered the side home remaining unbeaten on 34 and 10 respectively. Mohammedan vs Biman Two fifties from late order Suhrawardi Shuvo and Dollar Mahmud helped Mohammedan recover their poor start to post a challenging 239 all out in 50 overs after being put in to bat first against Biman Bangladesh. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza claimed five wickets, but could not restrict Mohammedan to a less total as Shuvo and Dollar put on 97 runs for the seventh wicket with both batsmen reaching fifties. Faisal Hossain Dickens, Imrul Kayes and Rashedul Haque chipped in with 38, 25 and 20 respectively before Shuvo and Dollar came to the middle. Shuvo struck 57 off 70 smashing five fours and one six while Dollar hammered a 42-ball 60 hitting four fours and as many sixes. Both, however, were victims of Mashrafee. In reply, Biman became 34 for five and never stood still in the face of superb bowling from Mohammedan's all bowlers. Pacer Tareq Aziz led the attack with three for 33 while spinners Shuvo and Yasin Arafat grabbed two wickets each for 30 and 22 respectively. Dollar and Imitaz took one wicket apiece. Mushfiqur Rahman scored team's highest of 25, followed by Mashrafee on 23. BKSP vs City Club BKSP beat City Club by five wickets at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. The country's lone sports institution BKSP reached home making 117 for five in 30.1 overs after bowling City Club out for 113 in 35.4 overs. bdne
