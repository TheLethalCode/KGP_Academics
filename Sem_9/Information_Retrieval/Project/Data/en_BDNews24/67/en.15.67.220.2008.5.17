 LONDON, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori led a spirited Kiwi fightback on Sunday with three cheap wickets on the fourth day of the first test against England at Lord's. At tea England, who resumed the day at 89 for no wicket in reply to New Zealand's 277 after 153.2 overs had been lost to rain and bad light, were 239 for six. Vettori, who had contributed a typically gritty 48 from nearly three hours at the crease in the New Zealand innings, accounted for Kevin Pietersen (3), Paul Collingwood (6) and Tim Ambrose (0). Collingwood and Ambrose fell to the first two deliveries of Vettori's 10th over and the hat-trick ball just eluded Stuart Broad's groping bat.

England skipper Michael Vaughan stood firm while the middle-order crumbled around him, playing some delightful strokes through the leg-side to reach his 19th test half-century. Vaughan, who said before the match he badly needed runs after an indifferent series in New Zealand this year, had taken his total to 61 with seven fours at the interval while Broad was on 10. In the morning session, under the first sun of the match, Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook completed their first test century opening partnership. They had to work hard for their runs against some disciplined and intelligent bowling from Chris Martin, who extracted movement off the seam from the Nursery End. Martin squared Cook up with a delivery coming into the left-hander from around the wicket which nipped away for wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum to take a tumbling catch in front of first slip. Cook had contributed 61 to the first wicket partnership of 121. Strauss reached his 12th test half-century before he was lbw to Jacob Oram for 63 and Vettori, bowling for the first time in the match, captured the important wicket of Kevin Pietersen lbw pushing forward. Ian Bell was caught by McCullum from another fine Martin delivery moving away from the right-hander for 16 and Collingwood fell to a slip catch off Vettori. Ambrose was beaten through the air with the next ball and Broad was lucky to survive the ove
