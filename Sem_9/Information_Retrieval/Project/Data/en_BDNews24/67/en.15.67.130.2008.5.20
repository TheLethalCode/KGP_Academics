 Kuala Lumpur, May 20 (bdnews24.com) - Newly-elected Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) President Kazi Salahuddin has promised a significant change in the Bangladesh football scene over the next two years. Salahuddin, who was here to meet AFC President Mohamed Bin Hammam, told www.the-afc.com that his top priority is to bring the "game back to the field". "The players are sitting idle for more than six months as there are no activities in Bangladesh and that's one of the main reasons for our team's lacklustre performance at the international stage," Salahuddin was quoted by the afc.com as saying. He said the federation would start the second season of the Bangladesh League in August, preceded by the Federation Cup in July. "We have a lot of problems at hand and it will take some time to streamline the process. I have received good response from the sponsors and I believe things will change significantly within a year," said Salahuddin, a legend in his country for his goal-scoring exploits as a player. "We are planning to hire three foreign coaches for our senior, under-20 and under-17 teams. Though the senior team does not have any international engagement after the South Asian Football Federation Championship next month I would like them to train throughout the year," said the 54-year-old. He said Bangladesh would have a training camp in Bangkok from May 25 where the team will play two friendlies before leaving for Sri Lanka for the SAFF Championship. Salahuddin said he would appoint a full-time general secretary of the federation next month and after that work out details of re-launching the Vision Bangladesh project. "I am very optimistic about Vision Bangladesh as it can change the face of Bangladeshi football. We need to concentrate on grassroots and youth football and I think this project will show us the right direction," he said.
