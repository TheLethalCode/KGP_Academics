<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Jamaat-e-Islami has put forward a five-point charter of demands over the arrests of party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, a party leader said Tuesday. The demands included unconditional release of the three party chiefs, withdrawal of all false cases, including GATCO and Barapukuria graft cases, which Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed said were meant for political harassment. The party will place memoranda on behalf of the organisation to local administrations in six metropolitan cities on May 26, in districts on May 27 and in upazilas on May 28 in support of their demands. The party will also observe a prayer day on May 30 across the country and run a mass signature campaign from June 1 through June 10. The party also demanded national elections in October, curbs on the prices of essentials, providing subsidies and lifting all conditions imposed on indoor politics. The government launched campaigns to file false cases to bring corruption charges against Nizami, Hasina and Khaleda, Mojaheed told a press conference at the party headquarters in Moghbazar. "Corruption has spread to every corner of society. Corruption has not decreased. It's increasing instead," he added. Mojaheed said it was a heinous act by the government to arrest Nizami. "The way in which he was arrested was unexpected and disrespectful to law," he said. "The law says a person cannot be arrested until the decision of the Appellate Division comes. The rule of law cannot be established this way," the leader said. Condemning the caretaker government, Mojaheed said: "The country has been in the state of emergency for 17 months. The people are being deprived of their fundamental rights. They cannot speak freely and run their political activities." "The government is talking of holding dialogue, but is not creating an atmosphere favourable to dialogue." "Each step of the government is making the environment critical. Doubt about the national polls runs deep," the Jamaat leader said. bdnew
