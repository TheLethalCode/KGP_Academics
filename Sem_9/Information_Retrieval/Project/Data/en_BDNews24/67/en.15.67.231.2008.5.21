 MOSCOW, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Avram Grant appeared as reluctant as ever to speak in public on the eve of Wednesday's Champions League final but Chelsea's unassuming Israeli coach gave a subtle reminder to his critics about what he has achieved. "Look, we are here today nine days after the league finished," Grant said ahead of the final against Manchester United at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. "If it's a normal season for Chelsea we would be on vacation now, but we're here and we've reached maybe the most important game for two teams in the world. "But me, personally, I'm not the most important man here." Ever since replacing Jose Mourinho as coach in September last year Grant has had to put up with people questioning just how much influence he has had on the team's results. Grant has had the last laugh after taking Chelsea through to their first appearance in the Champions League final but masterminding victory in that game still looks quite a task. On Wednesday he will pit his wits against one of the world's most successful managers in Alex Ferguson, who is eyeing his second Champions League trophy after leading United to success as part of a treble in 1999. WILY OPPONENT Grant was too wise to be drawn on the question of how he could expect to outfox such a wily opponent. "First, I really respect Alex as a person, and as a manager. He's done great things," Grant said. "It's his second time in the final, and the first one, he won. I'm now in my first final. "I don't think it's important. We've done our work and now it's down to the players. I respect him, but I want to win. On the tactical side, I don't think there are any surprises." While Ferguson and United will draw inspiration from the memory of those who died 50 years ago in the Munich air crash, Grant revealed that he keeps portraits of a number of historical figures and looks to draw strength from their achievements. "I can say I like to learn from leaders," he explained. "I have pictures of Gandhi, of Winston Churchill, a great leader, Michael Jordan, also Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, Anwar Sadat. They were great people because they went their way to the end and got their achievements." If Chelsea win on Wednesday, Grant said he would be happy to break his teetotal habit and share a glass of vodka with Chelsea's Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, as well as with his critics in the media. "I'm not a drinker but in this case, OK, I will drink more than one glass," Grant said. "I'll even have one with you. "I know the media all love me. They must care about me because they're always asking me if I'm going to stay or go.
