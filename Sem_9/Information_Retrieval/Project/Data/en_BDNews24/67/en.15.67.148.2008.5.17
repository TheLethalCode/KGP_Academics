<TITLE> Farewell Bangladesh: Anwar Choudhury </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Outgoing British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury, popular yet often blamed for creating some buzz of controversy, left Dhaka Saturday, ending his four-year diplomatic assignment in Bangladesh. Choudhury flew British Airways from Zia International Airport shortly after eight in the morning. As he emerged from the airport's VIP lounge prior to his departure, an emotional Choudhury told reporters: "Farewell Bangladesh. Stay well. See you." In a sign of the envoy's popularity, other ambassadors, including German ambassador Frank Meyke, came to the airport to see their colleague off. Referring to the friendship that had developed between them, Meyke said: "This was just a very personal moment." "I am very grateful for the friendship and good support and cooperation under Anwar Choudhury's tenure." The German ambassador added that he hoped the departing envoy's successor would further advance the good relations that exist between Bangladesh and the UK. Choudhury's tenure as the top UK diplomat for Bangladesh ended on May 13; Stephen Evans, as new high commissioner, will replace him. Choudhury will join the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a director of international organisations. During his tenure, Choudhury, who was born in Bangladesh, was noted for his enthusiasm in the diplomatic circle. He is particularly noted for his shuttle diplomacy between different political leaders in 2006, when the BNP and the Awami League found themselves in their most violent phase of political bickering. Critics had often blamed Choudhury for being too close to Bangladesh's politics. Part of the blame was focused on former US ambassador Patricia A Butenis, who had exerted huge leverage on the political scenelargely chaotic at the time. Choudhury came to Bangladesh in May 2004. On May 21 of that year, the envoy was targeted in a failed grenade attack, in which he was wounded. The attempted assassination came as he was leaving Friday prayers in Sylhet. bdnews
