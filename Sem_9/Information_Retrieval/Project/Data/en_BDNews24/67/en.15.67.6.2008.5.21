 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court began taking witness testimonies Wednesday in the barge mounted power plant trial against detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Anticorruption Commission deputy director AMM Sabbir Hassan, a plaintiff in the case, was the first to give his testimony to the special court set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. After a two-hour long deposition beginning shortly after 10 am, and presided over by judge Md Feroz Alam, defence lawyers questioned the witness. Their cross examination will continue Thursday. Meanwhile, the High Court set Thursday as the final hearing on the writ petition filed by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging the proceedings of the case against her. A High Court bench of justices MA Rashid and Md Ashfakul Islam set the final hearing date Wednesday following a plea by Hasina's lawyer barrister Shafique Ahmed. The former prime minister filed the writ petition on May 11, challenging the legality of the trial proceedings as it had not been concluded within 60 days. The High Court asked the government, the Anticorruption Commission and a special judge's court to explain the delay, but did not halt the trial proceedings of the case. According to law, trial of a case should be normally completed within 60 days of the court taking the charges into cognisance. The court accepted the charge sheet on Jan 10, while charge framing against Hasina and other accused in the case was concluded on May 18. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2, 2007, against eight people including Sheikh Hasina. According to the case details, the Power Development Board floated international tenders on Oct 24, 1996, for installation of three barge-mounted plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. During Sheikh Hasina's tenure as prime minister, two private firmsSummit Group and United Groupwere allegedly awarded the contracts through irregular means during the period Oct 24, 1996 to Nov 24, 1997, depriving the lowest bidders. The AL president is also accused of accepting a house in Dhanmondi and a plot of land registered in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust from the Summit and United Groups in exchange for the contracts. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on Sept 20 last year. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 last year and she was shown arrested in the case on Sept 19. If found guilty of the charges, Hasina may face a prison term of three to 12 years. She may also be barred from contesting any elections, if convicted. bdnews24.com/
