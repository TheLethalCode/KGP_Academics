<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  Detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has said that any 'ill forces' against democracy would exacerbate the country's current situation and asked people to be prepared to take action against such forces. She expressed her apprehension to her lawyer Kamrul Islam in the court following the day's proceedings in the barge-mounted power plant trial. Kamrul briefed reporters emerging from the court. "A plot is taking place within the country. Democracy is facing threat. There is confusion whether the polls will be held, and over holding of the dialogue," Hasina was quoted as saying by her lawyer. "There is no other option but to remain united in the present political situation. All conspiracies can be wiped out if people remain united," Hasina was quoted to say. Witness depositions in the trial began around 10 am, with Anticorruption Commission deputy director AMM Sabbir Hassan, a plaintiff in the case, being the first to give his testimony to the special judge's court set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. His cross examination by defense lawyers will continue Thursday. Meanwhile, the High Court has set Thursday as the final hearing on the writ petition filed by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging the proceedings of the trial. The former prime minister filed the writ petition on May 11, which challenges the legality of the trial proceedings as it had not been concluded within 60 days of the court taking cognisance of the charges. The court accepted the charge sheet on Jan 10, while charge framing against Hasina and the other accused was concluded on May 18. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2, 2007, against eight people including Sheikh Hasina. According to the case details, the Power Development Board floated international tenders on Oct 24, 1996, for installation of three barge-mounted plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. The AL president was arrested on July 16 and shown arrested in the case on Sept 19. If found guilty of the charges pressed, Hasina may be jailed for three to 12 years. She may also be barred from contesting any elections, if convicted. bdnews24
