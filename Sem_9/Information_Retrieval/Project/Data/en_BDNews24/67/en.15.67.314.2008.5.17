<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Local and foreign diplomats Saturday discussed the future development of SAARC, with the idea of a common parliament being floated between the eight member South Asian countries. They joined a roundtable on "Future of SAARC: Expectations of Citizens" at the National Press Club. The discussion focused on ways SAARC, an economic and political organisation, could better address their common problems and launch collective efforts to face challenges regarding food, energy and the environment. Stefan Frowein, high commissioner of the European Union delegation, brought up the possibility of setting up a common parliament in the region to address common issues facing the SAARC nations. Referring to the European Union, Frowein said the EU provided funds to improve the region's infrastructure and make a major contribution to the overall development of member countries. Frowein went on to stress the importance of the free movement of people within the region to spur development. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said a collective regional approach is needed to face growing challenges posed by the increasingly volatile global financial market. He also highlighted the problems of increased protectionism, the looming energy crisis and the ever changing international political environment. "We should concentrate on what unites us rather than what divides us," he said. The adviser asked for greater market access through a reduction and elimination of non-tariff and para-tariff barriers, and the introduction of other trade measures to maximise free trade. Chowdhury said the future of South Asia would depend on the political will of member states. "The region's per capita GDP is much below the developing country average. Intra-regional trade accounts for only about 5 percent and flow of global FDI to South Asia is mere 1 percent," he said. Hua Du, country director of the Asian Development Bank, highlighted the need for strengthening links between nations within the region. In another reference to the EU, Du said it was now possible to travel the all member states with a single visa and currency. "Only by working together, we can cope with manmade disasters," she said. Envoys from SAARC states were present at the discussion, which was also addressed by Afghan ambassador Ahmed Karim Nawabi. SAARC Citizens Council and Grameen Nagarik Federation co-organised the discussion. bd
