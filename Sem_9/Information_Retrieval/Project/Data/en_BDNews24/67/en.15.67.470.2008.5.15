 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has started exporting ships to the world market with Ananda Shipyard and Slipways formally handing over a ship to Denmark's Stella Shipping. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman was the chief guest at the handover ceremony at Ananda Shipyard at Meghnaghat in Narayanganj Thursday. "It is a historic moment. With this, the door to a tremendous potential has opened. Ship building is a new area, and through it, an example of export diversification has been created." Rahman and Ananda Group chairman Abdullahel Bari handed over the ship "Stella Maris", with a 3,000-ton carrying capacity and built at a cost of Tk 45 crore. Danish ambassador to Bangladesh Einar H Jensen and Stella Shipping chairman Jan Fabricus received the ship. Rahman said: "Today Bangladesh enters the 400 billion dollar world ship exporting market." "There is a possibility of Bangladesh becoming a global leader in this sector as different countries including Singapore, China and Japan are moving away from building small and medium ships," the adviser said. "The government has realised the potential in this sector and extended its cooperation. It is being considered a priority sector." Ananda Shipyard has received orders for 24 ships for export, with their value amounting to Tk 1,500 crore. Of the ships, four will be exported to Denmark, 14 to Germany, and six to Mozambique. Ananda Group managing director Afruza Bari told bdnews24.com: "Government-owned Basic Bank has provided assistance in building the Tk 45 crore Stella Maris." Islami Bank is providing financial assistance in building eight other ships, including Stella Moon. Islami Bank has already given Tk 580 crore loans and Basic Bank Tk 110 crore to Ananda Shipyard. "Islami Bank has pledged to provide Tk 6,600 crore loan in this sector," she said. Ananda Shipyard signed an agreement with Stella Shipping in 2005 on ship exports. Afruza Bari said the building of Stella Maris took a little longer due to the delay in arrival of different equipment. "If it could be built in one year, the ship building industry would be more profitable," she added. Industry secretary Md Nurul Amin, Islami Bank executive chairman Mominul Islam Patwari, former BUET vice chancellor MH Khan and managing director of BASIC Bank AH Iqbal Hossain were present at the handover ceremony. Ananda started ship building in Bangladesh in 1985. bdnew
