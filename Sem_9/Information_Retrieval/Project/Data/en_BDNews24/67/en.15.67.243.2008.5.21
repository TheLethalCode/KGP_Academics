 LUGANO, Switzerland, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Euro 2008 co-hosts Switzerland have been hit by more injury and illness problems, including the withdrawal of reserve goalkeeper Fabio Coltorti and striker Blaise Nkufo. Nkufo was ruled out of the tournament on Tuesday after picking up a groin injury while playing for Dutch side Twente Enschede. Thomas Haeberli, 33, was a surprise replacement for him, having played just one previous match for Switzerland, featuring in a 6-0 World Cup qualifying win over the Faroe Islands in 2004. He has been in impressive form for Young Boys, finishing the season as the league's second-highest scorer behind team-mate Hakan Yakin, but was previously overlooked by Swiss coach Koebi Kuhn in favour of younger players. Coltorti, 27, reported for Switzerland's 10-day training camp in Lugano on Monday but was sent home after being diagnosed with post-viral fatigue syndrome. The Swiss FA announced on its Web site (www.football.ch) the Racing Santander keeper would be replaced by uncapped Eldin Jakupovic of Grasshoppers Zurich. Swiss hopes of having experienced central defender Patrick Mueller back in the team for Saturday's friendly against Slovakia have been dampened due to an injury to his Olympique Lyon team mate Jean-Alain Boumsong. Lyon have said they would not make a decision over Mueller's availability until Wednesday at the earliest. The Ligue 1 champions are due to play in the French Cup final on Saturday. Mueller still has to prove his fitness after a cruciate knee ligament injury sustained in December. Switzerland have already been deprived of playmaker Xavier Margairaz following a cruciate ligament injury while regulars Philipp Degen, Ludovic Magnin, Johann Djourou, Marco Streller and Alex Frei have all missed chunks of the season through injury. Kuhn is due to select his final 23-man squad for the tournament on May 28. Switzerland are then due to play a final warm-up against Liechtenstein two days later before heading for their tournament base in central Switzerland on June 2. Euro 2008, which is being co-hosted by Switzerland and neighbouring Austria, runs from June 7-29
