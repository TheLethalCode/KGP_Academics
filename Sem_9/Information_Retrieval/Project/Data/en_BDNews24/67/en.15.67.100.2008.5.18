<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet Sunday approved the Antiterrorism Ordinance 2008 with a provision for death penalty as the highest punishment, a government spokesman said. Updated The final approval to the ordinance came from a cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting. In another decision, the cabinet had sent back a proposal on an independent salary structure for Bangladesh Bank employees to the law ministry for further review, Munaim said. The new ordinance stemmed from the fact that the existing laws related to crimes using bombs and firearms had not been sufficient. Besides, there should be a new law to resist terror financing by individuals, groups or organisations, the government said in defence of the antiterrorism ordinance. The antiterrorism law outlines punishment for killings or injuries, property damage, abduction, use and possession of explosives, firearms and harmful chemicals. If anybody commits any crime under the law, he may face a minimum of three years in jail in addition to fines, or death sentence as the highest punishment, Munaim said. There are provisions in the ordinance that spells out different punishments for abetting in criminal acts, he added. Financial help to any act of terrorism will be considered a punishable act, which warrants a maximum of 20 years in jail. If anybody joins any outlawed organisation, he has to face six-year imprisonment or fine or both. People campaigning for outlawed organisations will be sentenced to at least two years in prison and a maximum of seven years, according to the ordinance. A person responsible for sheltering any criminal sentenced to death will face a maximum of five-year imprisonment. Persons responsible for sheltering any criminal sentenced to life-imprisonment will have to serve a maximum of three years in jail. If any organisation has any complaint about the ordinance, it can appeal to the government to re-examine the ordinance. The government will settle it in 90 days. The organisation will be able to appeal to the High Court if the government rejects its appeal. Bangladesh Bank would be responsible to take necessary steps to detect terror financing through banking channels. Trials of Bangladeshis at home or abroad, working against Bangladesh or other countries, will be held in Bangladesh. bdnews
