<TITLE> Zimbabwe military plotted to kill Tsvangirai: party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition accused the government's military intelligence division on Monday of plotting to assassinate party leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who is due to contest an election run-off with President Robert Mugabe. Movement for Democratic Change leader Tsvangirai postponed his return to Zimbabwe on Saturday after his party said it had discovered a plot to assassinate him. Tsvangirai had spent more than one month abroad. "We know there are 18 snipers, and the military intelligence directorate is in charge of this," Tendai Biti, secretary general for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, told Reuters before a news conference in Nairobi. Tsvangirai was due to return from Europe on Saturday to campaign ahead of the June 27 presidential run-off, and Biti said he would still return "very soon." Zimbabweans hope the June poll will help end political and economic turmoil which has brought 165,000 percent inflation, 80 percent unemployment, chronic food and fuel shortages and sent a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries. Tsvangirai won the first round on March 29, but not by enough votes to avoid a second round against Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly three decades. bd
