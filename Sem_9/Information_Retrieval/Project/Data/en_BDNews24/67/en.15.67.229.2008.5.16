<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Winger Cristiano Ronaldo hinted he could leave Manchester United after next week's Champions League final, British media reported on Friday. The Portuguese international, whose 31 goals this season helped United to secure the Premier League title on Sunday, has long been linked with a move to Spain and he did not rule out a transfer in the near future. "I am happy here but lets see what happens after the Champions League final," Ronaldo told Spanish Television in an interview that was reported in Friday's Daily Telegraph newspaper. "I am feeling calm here. I'm happy here but in the future I don't know." The 23-year-old had pledged last week to stay on with the English champions, with whom he has a contract until 2012, but his latest comments will no doubt cause confusion. "I have said millions of times that I would love to play in Spain but it's one thing to dream and another thing for it to be reality." United face Chelsea in the Champions League final in Moscow next Wednesday
