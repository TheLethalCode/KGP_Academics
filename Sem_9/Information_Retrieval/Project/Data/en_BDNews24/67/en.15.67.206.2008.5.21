<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  The chief of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Wednesday sought one last chance for businessmen to legalise undeclared money to boost investment. Speaking at a seminar on "Budget of the Fiscal 2008-09: Reality and Expectations," at Dhaka Reporters Unity, FBCCI president Annisul Huq said: "We want a chance to legalise only legally-earned money to boost investment." Former caretaker government adviser Professor Wahiduddin Mahmud and National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid said the opportunity to legalise undeclared money should not continue for long. Wahiduddin said: "Many countries offer opportunities to whiten black money, but they are not for a long time. If such an opportunity continues, it will turn out to be a common practice and will affect the habit of ordinary people of paying tax." NBR chairman Abdul Mazid agreed with Wahiduddin on the matter. "It's sort of discrimination that a taxpayer pays tax regularly in compliance with rules while the other legalises his money two years later. It's likely that the other person has come to legalise his money on which he received interests from banks," the NBR chief said. "All I want to say, a thief is a thief, a burglar is a burglar." Annisul Huq said the FBCCI in its budget proposals asked the government to allow businessmen to legalise their undeclared money. The apex business body proposed no fine as the penalty to legalise the money meant for investment. Annisul Huq also defended himself after he was asked if such a chance meant to shelter corruption. "We didn't want a chance to whiten black money. We wanted a chance to legalise the money earned by legal means," he said. Huq said political government often offered such an opportunity. "We are seeking a chance from the caretaker government for the last time," he said. On the next budget, Wahiduddin Mahmud said the caretaker government might face three challenges to prepare a budget for the next fiscal year. The three challenges are giving subsidies on fuel prices, fertiliser, foodstuff and many other sectors, keeping the inflation rate at a tolerable level and taking effective measures to roll out loans to the private sector. The former caretaker government adviser said he heard that Tk 25,500 crore would be allocated for the Annual Development Programme. "It sounds the ADP will be based on reality," he said. bdnews
