<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Abahani Limited eye the second straight title of the Premier Division Cricket League when they face Surjo Torun in the last match of the Super League at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground Wednesday. Abahani and Biman Bangladesh are sharing the lead in the points table with 25 points each, but the Dhanmondi-based outfit are ahead of the national flag carrier thanks to their net run rate. On a head-to-head count, both lost to each other once. If both teams win their respective last match Wednesday, Abahani will be declared champions following their superior run rate. Though Abahani face comparative minnows, Biman have to square off with Mohammedan at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Having defeated two giants Mohammedan SC and Biman Bangladesh in a row, Abahani are flying high and take on Surjo Torun with more confidence. "We feel no pressure in the last match as we are in a better position in terms of net run rate after having defeated Mohammedan and Biman," said Abahani skipper Tushar Imran. Tushar hinted that they might play against Surjo Torun with an extra batsman instead of taking a bowler. Biman, who could have clinched the title beating Abahani in the previous match, are also set to bring change in their squad with opener Javed Omar coming in for injured Nafis Iqbal. Biman captain Sanwar Hossain seemingly gave up hope of becoming champions despite having stayed with Abahani on the top. "Abahani are ahead of us with net run rate," Sanwar said, "It only can come true if Abahani lose to Surjo Torun and we win against Mohammedan Wednesday."
