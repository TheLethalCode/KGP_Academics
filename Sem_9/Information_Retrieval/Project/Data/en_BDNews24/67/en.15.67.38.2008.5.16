<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Indian high commissioner Pinak R Chakravarty has said the people who die in border shootings are not innocent and are mostly smugglers. Border management is an important day-to-day issue between India and Bangladesh and cooperation between the two countries has improved over the years, Chakravarty said. Chakravarty talked in detail about different aspects of the Indo-Bangladesh relations on the weekly discussion series 'Shomoyer Kotha' aired on BTV Friday and moderated by Syed Munir Khasru of IBA, Dhaka University. On exchange of terrorists hiding in each other's territory, the high commissioner said India offered an extradition treaty to Bangladesh. He assured that even without treaty, India will hand over any suspected absconder to Bangladesh whenever caught in India. "Terrorists have no religion and only have self-serving agendas. They are enemies of both the countries." On trade and investment between the two countries, Chakravarty hoped that the Tata investment will eventually take place in one form or the other and this could send a positive signal to all foreign investors from both India and other countries. Chakravarty said the Indian economic boom represents an opportunity for all the South Asian countries and India intends to liberalise trade with Bangladesh to enable it to take advantage of the growing Indian consumer market. On the sharing of the Ganges water, he emphasised the need to deal with the issue in a pragmatic and clinical manner as opposed being too emotive about it. He underscored improving connectivity between people of the two countries to strengthen the relationship and to remove the doubts and misunderstandings that may be there.
