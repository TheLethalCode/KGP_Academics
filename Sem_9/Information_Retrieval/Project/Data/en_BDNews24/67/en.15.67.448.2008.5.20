 Baghdad, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush apologised to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and promised prosecution of a US soldier accused of using a copy of the Quran for target practice, Iraq's government said on Tuesday. It said in a statement Bush had tendered a personal apology in a telephone call with Maliki. U.S. military commanders in Iraq had already apologised to Iraqi leaders after a copy of the Muslim holy book was found riddled with more than 10 bullet holes at a shooting range near Baghdad on May 11. The soldier accused of carrying out the shooting has been disciplined and ordered out of Iraq. The U.S. military has not said whether he will face a court martial. "The American president apologised on behalf of the United States ... promising to present the soldier to the courts," the Iraqi cabinet said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy said she was unaware of the telephone call and the White House was not immediately available for comment.
