 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  The War Crimes Fact Finding Committee Monday urged the government to take into cognisance all allegations of war crimes against Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, arrested on charges of corruption. Dr MA Hasan, convenor of the committee, told bdnews24.com: "There are many allegations against Nizami for his role in 1971 and beyond. Now that he has been arrested on charges of corruption, all allegations against him should be probed. This is the demand of the people." Hasan said the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee, Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee and other organisations had made allegations against 'war criminals'. "Nizami has not been arrested as a killer." During the Liberation War, Hasan alleged, Nizami was the president of Jamaat's student front Nikhil Pakistan Islami Chhatra Shangha. "Al-Badr Bahini was formed under his direct supervision to resist and eliminate freedom fighters," he alleged. The committee presented detailed information about Jamaat leaders Golam Azam, Nizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Muhammad Qamaruzzaman. The committee from an April press conference published a list of 1,597 people that it said were involved with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in 1971. bdnews
