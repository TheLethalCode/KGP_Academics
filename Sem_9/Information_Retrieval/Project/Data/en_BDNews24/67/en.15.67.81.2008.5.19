 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) - The pro-Delwar BNP has sent back the government invitation letter for dialogue, a leader said Monday. The letter was sent to Khandaker Delwar Hossain's NAM flat by a special messenger from the Chief Adviser's Office Monday. The letter was sent back as it had not addressed Delwar as BNP secretary general, the party's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com. "Khandker Delwar is the secretary general of the BNP. But the letter did not mention it. So we returned the letter," he said. bdnews24
