<TEXT>
 MILAN, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cafu and Serginho will leave AC Milan at the end of the season, the Brazilian full backs said on Friday. Last season's European champions are letting the pair go after deciding to bring in fresh blood following a poor campaign, with Barcelona defender Gianluca Zambrotta a target. World Cup winner Cafu, 37, will return to Brazil but is unsure if he will retire. "I have had five marvellous years in which I have managed to win everything," the former AS Roma right back told Milan Channel. "The moment has arrived to leave. It is sad and hard but I knew sooner or later the time would come to go home, to return to Brazil. I don't know if I'll still play when I'm in Brazil." Cafu, a reserve this term, is not certain of playing in Milan's final game of the season at home to Udinese on Sunday. Fifth-placed Milan will only reach next season's Champions League qualifiers if they win and Fiorentina slip up at Torino. Serginho, 36, joined the club in 1999 but has also decided to return home. "After a back problem hit me two years ago, I've not been able to return to my best form, which is why I believe the moment has come to say goodbye to the team," he said. Milan captain Paolo Maldini, 39, is expected to stay at the San Siro for another season with a final decision due soon
