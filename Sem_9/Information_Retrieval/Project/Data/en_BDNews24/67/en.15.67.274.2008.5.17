 MILAN, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of the final round of matches in Serie A this weekend (all kick offs 1300 GMT on Sunday except Sampdoria v Juventus): Leaders Inter Milan, who will retain the title with a win at relegation-threatened Parma, have doubts over flu victim Maxwell so Nicolas Burdisso may be forced to play left back. Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to make the bench after a month and a half out with a knee problem while captain Javier Zanetti has returned to full training. Inter's preparations have been upset by a late decision to ban their fans from Parma and a police drugs probe involving a tailor used by the club's players and coaches. There is no suggestion anyone at Inter has done anything wrong but the Italian press is still full of the story. AS Roma, who will snatch the scudetto if they win at Catania and Inter slip up, have no new injury problems for the trip to Sicily. Media reports have said midfielder Alberto Aquilani will get the nod ahead of Ludovic Giuly. Parma, who will go down after 18 years in the top flight if they lose, welcome back experienced Portuguese defender Fernando Couto from a long ban but injury and suspension continue to bite. Catania, one place outside the three-team relegation zone, have injury doubts over striker Giuseppe Mascara as they seek the point that will effectively keep them up. Empoli, one from bottom, must beat already-relegated Livorno and hope other results go their way to avoid the drop. Defender Andrea Raggi may miss out with a swollen ankle. AC Milan, two points behind Fiorentina in the race for the fourth and final Champions League spot, are without suspended duo Gennaro Gattuso and Alessandro Nesta for the visit of Udinese. Fiorentina travel to Torino with no new injury problems but striker Adrian Mutu and midfielder Marco Donadel are banned. Third-placed Juventus visit Sampdoria on Saturday (1300) with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon expected to rest his injured back as there is nothing left to play for. Brazilian striker Amauri is poised to play his final game for Palermo at Siena ahead of a move to Juventus or Milan
