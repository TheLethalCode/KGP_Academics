<TITLE> BNP 'reformists' look to unity, Delwar unbent </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday insisted that so-called reformist leaders would have to cancel the controversial Oct 29 meeting that divided the party. The ray of hope flickers among the BNP's pro-reform faction about unity in the party cleaved by infighting, but Delwar is unmoved. "If the reformists want to return to the party they must admit their mistake," he said. "They will also have to cancel the October 29 meeting of the standing committee," Delwar said. Both factions of the BNP are continuing talks on unity over the last few days without any clear progress. A formal announcement on unity was expected to come from a joint meeting Thursday, but the move fell apart. Pro-reform leader Hafizuddin Ahmed blamed the debacle on the Delwar-led faction. On the other hand, Delwar Saturday rejected the idea of making a joint declaration with the "derailed" party leaders. Asked to comment on progress in the process of unity, Delwar said: "BNP is united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." "There is no division here. There is no disunity, there is no need for a joint declaration." "Why should I make a joint declaration? If they (reformists) are sincere let them admit their mistake." A meeting of the BNP standing committee on October 29 last year made M Saifur Rahman acting chairman and Hafizuddin acting secretary general in a controversial decision, deepening the crisis of the party. Leaders of Jhalkathi Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum met with Delwar on his Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat Saturday. Delwar urged the lawyers to play a role in a movement for establishing the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Delwar asked the local leaders to work for strengthening the BNP at the grassroots level. "Those who have worked for the party in difficult times would be evaluated and recognised." The forum's president Khan A Karim and Hossain Ali Khan Hassan led the team to the meeting with Delwar. bdnew
