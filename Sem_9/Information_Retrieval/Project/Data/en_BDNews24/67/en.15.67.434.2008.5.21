<TITLE> Ponting leads new faces into Caribbean test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For all the talk about a Caribbean cricket revival and a weakening of Australia's grip on the game, Ricky Ponting's new-look side have the familiar role of favourites in the test series against West Indies which opens in Kingston, Jamaica, on Thursday. Wicket-keeper batsman Adam Gilchrist's recent retirement, following the departures of Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, means that Ponting will lead a very different side to the one which triumphed 3-1 in a four-test series in the Caribbean three years ago. The hosts have undergone plenty of changes themselves in the past year -- record-breaking batsman and long-standing captain Brian Lara has retired, they have a new coach in Australian John Dyson and, after the misery of their World Cup campaign, restored some pride in their recent (1-1) drawn test series with Sri Lanka and (2-0) one-day series win. Those changes need to be kept in perspective, however. Australia are unbeaten in their last six test series against West Indies, going back to 1993 and the past 12 tests between the two teams have been won 11-1 by Australia. Australia are in a period of transition, bedding in some new faces, but their squad still boasts plenty of experience and quality. Opening bats Matthew Hayden and Michael Hussey, pace-bowler Brett Lee, spinner Stuart MacGill and all-rounder Andrew Symonds are the core of Ponting's side. For the first test though, Ponting may have to shuffle his pack a little with vice-captain Michael Clarke given compassionate leave following the death of his fiancee's father and Hayden struggling with an Achilles injury. Batsman and spinner Simon Katich is set to make his first test appearance since facing West Indies in Brisbane in 2005, wicket-keeper Brad Haddin will make his test debut with 31-year-old Queensland all-rounder Ashley Noffke also in contention for a first test appearance. West Indies have been pinning their hopes on keeping the momentum from their positive series against Sri Lanka going and taking advantage of a perceived moment of uncertainty in the Australia side. The hosts have been hit by two setbacks, however, with captain and opening batsman Chris Gayle ruled out with a groin injury and another frontline batsman, Marlon Samuels, banned for two years for breaching the International Cricket Council's (ICC) code of conduct. Ramnaresh Sarwan will deputise for Gayle as skipper at Sabina Park but he too will be relying on some inexperienced players to deliver -- Jamaican opening batsman Brenton Parchment has played just one test, as has slow left-armer Sulieman Benn while off-spinner Amit Jaggernauth has yet to make his debut. Former West Indies opening batsman Gordon Greenidge, now convenor of the selectors, says it is crunch time for the hosts. "The players must believe that they can step up and show what they are really capable of. We have to decide to be more forceful, more positive and spend time at the crease. What we want is consistency. This is something we have been fighting for over the years. "This series presents an opportunity for players to be counted -- new players and established players," he said. The tour consists of three tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 game. West Indies: Ramnaresh Sarwan (captain), Dwayne Bravo, Sulieman Benn, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Fidel Edwards, Ryan Hinds, Amit Jaggernauth, Runako Morton, Darren Sammy, Devon Smith, Brenton Parchment, Daren Powell, Denesh Ramdin (wicketkeeper), Jerome Taylor. Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Beau Casson, Stuart Clark, Brad Haddin (wicketkeeper), Matthew Hayden, Brad Hodge, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mike Hussey, Phil Jaques, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Brett Lee, Stuart MacGill, Ashley Noffke, Andrew Symond
