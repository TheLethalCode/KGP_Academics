<TITLE> Jamaat isn't an extremist party: Barks-Ruggles </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Visiting US deputy assistant secretary of state Erica Barks-Ruggles said Wednesday Jamaat-e-Islami was not encouraging any extremist activity. But the senior US State Department official denied that the US had recognised Jamaat-e-Islami as a moderate Islamic party. "Jamaat-e-Islami represents a sector of the society. They have a voice in the political process. They are participating in the political process as a political party," Barks-Ruggles told a roundtable with journalists at the American Club. "They (Jamaat) are not advocating violent overthrow of the government. They are not indulging any extremists act. So, they are part of the political process," she said. As one journalist asked whether the US had "certified" Jamaat as a moderate Islamic party, Barks-Ruggles reacted sharply and said: "There is no certification by the United States. We support the political process." "The United States does not support any political party, we support institutional democracy." "We support the political process and the vigorous participation of all parties in the political process. We do not support any party or any ideology. We never have and we will not," she said. bdn
