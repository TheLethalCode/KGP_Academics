 PRAGUE, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Czech Republic coach Karel Brueckner named a 23-man squad on Wednesday for a Euro 2008 training camp and excluded Pavel Nedved, who had been rumoured to be considering a return from international retirement. The 35-year old former captain, who has just extended his contract with Juventus, will be missing from next week's camp in Austria as will skipper Tomas Rosicky, who underwent surgery to his injured knee tendon on Tuesday and misses the tournament. The only newcomer is Banik Ostrava striker Vaclav Sverkos, the leading Czech league scorer with 15 goals this season. Brueckner told reporters there may be slight changes in the final squad to be announced on May 28 after the home friendly against Lithuania. The Czech Republic play Switzerland, Portugal and Turkey in the Group A of the European championship. Squad: Goalkeepers: Jaromir Blazek (Nuremberg), Petr Cech (Chelsea), Daniel Zitka (Anderlecht) Defenders: Zdenek Grygera (Juventus), Marek Jankulovski (AC Milan), Michal Kadlec, Tomas Sivok (both Sparta Prague), Radoslav Kovac (Spartak Moscow), Zdenek Pospech (FC Copenhagen), David Rozehnal (Lazio), Tomas Ujfalusi (Fiorentina) Midfielders: Tomas Galasek (Nuremberg), David Jarolim (Hamburg), Marek Matejovsky (Reading), Jaroslav Plasil (Osasuna), Jan Polak (Anderlecht), Daniel Pudil (Slavia Prague), Libor Sionko (FC Copenhagen), Stanislav Vlcek (Anderlecht) Strikers: Milan Baros (Portsmouth), Martin Fenin (Eintracht Frankfurt), Jan Koller (Nuremberg), Vaclav Sverkos (Banik Ostrava).
