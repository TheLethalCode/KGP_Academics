 MILAN, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gennaro Gattuso will stay at AC Milan following talks with chief executive Adriano Galliani, the Italy midfielder said on Monday. The 30-year-old had been considering his future and was strongly linked with Bayern Munich, while he had also spoken fondly of the English Premier League having previously played for Rangers in Scotland. The arrival of Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini at Milan had also increased speculation that Gattuso was on his way. However, he has decided to remain at the San Siro despite Milan finishing fifth in Serie A and missing out on the Champions League next term. "I am not going away because all my doubts have been cleared up. I want to make clear I have never talked about money," he told a news conference. "I will finish my career at Milan, I will definitely stay until 2011." Galliani was relieved to have convinced Gattuso to stay. "May 19 is a very important day because from here we start to create a new Milan, a winning Milan for next season," he said. However, Italian media reports have said Milan have missed out on Palermo striker Amauri, who is poised to sign for Juventus this week with the Rossoneri's failure to reach the Champions League a factor in his decision. Milan hope to seal a deal shortly for Barcelona and Italy full back Gianluca Zambrotta with a revived bid for Ronaldinho also possible
