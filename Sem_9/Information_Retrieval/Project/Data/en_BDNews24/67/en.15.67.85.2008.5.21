<TITLE> Lift curbs on loans from abroad: BKMEA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  Knitwear exporters Wednesday asked the government to lift restrictions on taking loans from outside the country as interest rates in local banks were high. Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the BKMEA executive committee made the request at a meeting with finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam at the planning ministry. After the meeting, Hoque told reporters that loans were available at 6 to 7 percent interest rates in banks abroad, much lower than local rates. "Besides, it will cut pressure on local banks. It will be helpful for us as we have to repay the loans in foreign currency," Hoque said. The BKMEA leader said the businessmen also suggested that bank interest rates be cut down to 12 percent. "Neighbouring countries give loans at single-digit interest rate." The knitwear exporters at the meeting proposed a hike in financial assistance to 7.5 percent from 5 percent. Adviser Azizul Islam said that lowering interest rates depended on the inflation rate and costs of loan defaults. He said the knitwear exporters' request would be discussed later. The adviser said businessmen and bankers had earlier decided to keep the interest rate on bank loan at 14 percent. "Our first task will be to implement this decision," he said. The adviser said the government would consider the BKMEA request to increase financial assistance. "I told them about some problems regarding the matter. They talked about setting up a knitwear village. I have assured them of considering the matter with sincerity if the related ministry takes up such a project," the adviser said. The finance adviser said the BKMEA leaders alleged that a bank had shown negative attitude towards loans rescheduling. "I told them that I would talk to the relevant authorities about it." bdnew
