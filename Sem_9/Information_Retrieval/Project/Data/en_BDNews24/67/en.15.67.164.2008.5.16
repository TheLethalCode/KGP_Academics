<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)Two BNP factions Friday expressed firm belief that an announcement of party unity would come before the May 30 death anniversary of Ziaur Rahman. ASM Hannan Shah and Hafizuddin Ahmed were of the same view. Hafizuddin, acting secretary general of the pro-reform faction, alleged that the unity process had been delayed as pro-Delwar people cancelled a joint meeting in this connection at the last moment Thursday. He also urged the party's standing committee members to take steps for unity. Closed-door meetings have been held over the last few days to find ways to forge unity. Retired brigadier general ASM Hannan Shah, a pro-Delwar faction leader, told reporters at his Mohakhali DOHS home: "You will see the party united before May 30. The announcement of unity is being delayed due to some differences of opinion." "However, the chairperson has wants party unity and it will be carried out soon. Nothing will stand in its way," he said. Hafiz at his Banani home told an afternoon press briefing: "We will continue talks for unity." He alleged that a quarter did not want unity in BNP. "That quarter was spreading falsehood." Hafiz said he had also protested the branding of the pro-reformists as "people gone astray" by pro-Delwar people. Refuting BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain's statement that "the pro-reform faction was manufactured in government factory", Hafiz said: "If that is so, why have Saifur Rahman and Mannan Bhuiyan been accused in the GATCO case?" "We are in BNP politics under the leadership of Begum Zia. We don't move at the directive of the government or any agency." Hafiz said that in the next election his party would not allow any party a walkover. He said, "A united BNP will contest the next election." "The party cannot remain divided because of personal ego. Khaleda Zia is our leader. The party leaders and workers should understand that there are some who want to keep the party divided." bdnew
