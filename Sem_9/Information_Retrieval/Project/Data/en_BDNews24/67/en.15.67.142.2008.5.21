 JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Xenophobic violence that has killed at least 24 people spilled over to South Africa's volatile Zulu heartland on Wednesday and security officials discussed whether to use troops to quell unrest. The attacks on African immigrants, accused by many poor South Africans of taking scarce jobs and fuelling crime, have forced thousands of people from their homes, unnerved investors and hit the rand currency. Local media in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province said at least six immigrants were wounded in an overnight attack on a Nigerian-owned tavern in the port city of Durban. The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, the ruling ANC's main rival in KwaZulu-Natal, said the Durban attacks showed the anti-foreigner violence had spread to the province -- home to South Africa's biggest ethnic group, the Zulus. "We are ... saddened by reports that such barbaric acts have spread to our province and Durban in particular," it said. Police and provincial officials said the attack was not sparked by xenophobia, but it increased fears the violence could spread from the Johannesburg area where it erupted on May 11. "There is a real fear that the violence will spread here," said independent researcher Mary de Haas, who has been monitoring violence in KwaZulu-Natal since the 1980s. Essop Phahad, a senior aide to President Thabo Mbeki, told reporters police, defense and justice departments were discussing whether to send troops to restive areas. Police have already asked the army for equipment to help combat the violence in shantytowns and black townships, a defense ministry spokesman said. The United Nations' International Organisation for Migration said on Tuesday that the violence had displaced 13,000 people. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said the violence reflected growing global tensions. "The underlying factor is basically poverty," he told reporters in Geneva. "We are witnessing an increase in the number and intensity of crises that generate displacement around the world ... We are feeling very worried." South Africa's currency fell sharply on Tuesday, largely due to the violence. The rand was slightly firmer on Wednesday at about 7.66 to the U.S. dollar. LOOTING Flashpoints around Johannesburg were calmer on Wednesday. Police armored vehicles patrolled areas east of Johannesburg and thick clouds of smoke hung over many squatter settlements. But many African immigrants were taking no chances. "We must leave, It is not safe here," said a Zimbabwean woman who only gave her name as Amelia. In Primrose, where immigrants had been forced out of shacks in squatter settlements, scores of South Africans carted scrap metal from destroyed shanties on wheelbarrows and shopping carts to sell to scrap metal dealers. "We are going to get their jobs. They (immigrants) work for too little and South Africans must make money," said Nomsa Nini, who received 50 rand ($6.52) for a barrow of scrap metal. Government officials fear the crisis could damage the lucrative tourism industry and cripple the nation's bid to host the 2010 soccer World Cup. The violence has also increased political instability at a time of power shortages, rising inflation and disaffection among the poor over President Thabo Mbeki's pro-business policies. South Africa, with a population of about 50 million, is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants. The biggest group -- an estimated 3 million -- are from Zimbabwe. They have fled economic collapse at home and the violent political standoff since disputed March 29 elections.
