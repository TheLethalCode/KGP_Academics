"Dallah Group wants to recruit 5,000 unskilled Bangladeshi workers soon," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters. The Group's president Alwa Kamel called on the adviser in his office. "The government is trying addresses some of the problems some workers are allegedly facing," Iftekhar said.
