 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court sentenced Rajuk authorised officer Mozaffer Uddin to three years rigorous imprisonment Tuesday for taking bribes while in the employ of the city's development authority. Judge AKM Arifur Rahman of Special Judge's Court-10 also awarded Mozaffer a Tk 4 lakh fine, or another six months behind bars on failure to pay, and ordered the state to confiscate Tk 5 lakh in bribe money. Another employee of Rajuk (Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha), Harun-or Rashid, was given two years rigorous imprisonment for assisting Mozaffer. He was also fined Tk 1 lakh or another three months' imprisonment. Maxwell Rodrigues, manager of real estate company Advanced Development Technologies, filed a Tk 5 lakh bribery case against the accused on April 15 last year with Motijheel police. It alleged the accused persons demanded Tk 7 lakh in bribes for passing a plan for construction of a 15-storey building in the city's Motijheel commercial district. The complainant agreed to pay Tk 5 lakh, and a RAB squad caught the accused red-handed while receiving the bribe money. The charges in the case were framed on Feb 3. Seventeen witnesses gave testimony during the trial. bdnew
