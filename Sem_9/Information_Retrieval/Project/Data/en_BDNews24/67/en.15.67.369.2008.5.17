 Sumon K Chakrabarti Jammu, May 17 (bdnews24.com) The right-wing Hindu government in Rajasthan declared Friday their decision to deport "illegal Bangladeshi migrants" in Jaipur within 30 days in the wake of growing concerns over the alleged role of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami in the May 13 serial bomb blasts in the tourist city. Now, the chief of the Indian Border Security force (BSF) has added his voice to a growing number of officials calling for the move, criticising Bangladesh for "living in a state of permanent deniability". "We need to find an easy way of deporting these illegal Bangladeshis," Ashish K Mitra, director general of the BSF told bdnews24.com while returning from the Indo-Pakistan border. "So far as Bangladesh is concerned, deportation is a very long drawn process. The Bangladeshi authorities deny most of the cases we put forward," added Mitra. Emphasising India's need for a tough and effective anti-migration law; Mitra, however, did not endorse the idea of pushing back illegal migrants from all neighbouring countries, which has seen increased support since the Jaipur blasts. "Pushing back is not a solution. If we push back illegal Bangladesh migrants, their border guards will immediately push them back." "Then their will be a humanitarian crisis with a certain set of men, women and children whom no one will own up," Mitra added. Additional home secretary Sheikh Abdur Rashid said the government did not have any information regarding the deportation plan. "We will review the matter officially once we know it," he said. "We don't have any information about Huji's involvement in the attack," he added. Reuters reported that Bangladesh said on Friday that militant group, which Indian police suspect could be involved in bombings this week in a tourist city, had been marginalised following a crackdown. Top government officials in Dhaka urged the Indian media not to jump to conclusions and point the finger at "foreign forces" for the multiple explosions in the western city of Jaipur that killed 61 people on Tuesday.
