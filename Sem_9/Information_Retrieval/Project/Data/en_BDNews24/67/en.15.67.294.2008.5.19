 MILAN, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan will not allow World Player of the Year Kaka to play as an over-age player for Brazil at August's Beijing Olympics, the Serie A club said on Sunday. Milan, who will play in the UEFA Cup next term after finishing fifth, had previously hinted that the 26-year-old's wish to go to the Games would be granted if they failed to make August's Champions League qualifiers. However, a statement on their Web site (www.acmilan.com) said only Alexandre Pato and Kaka's brother Digao, both under 23, would be permitted to play in Beijing.
