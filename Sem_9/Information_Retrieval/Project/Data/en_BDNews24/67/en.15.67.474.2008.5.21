 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser MA Matin Wednesday claimed that law and order improved to a great deal, helped by better security measures. "Law and order in the country is now much better. Related people have been asked to work to improve it further," the adviser told reporters after a meeting of the advisory committee on law and order. Asked if the state of emergency could be withdrawn in this situation, Matin said: "It's up to the government to decide." On reported skirmishes between Bangladesh and Indian border guards, Matin said talks were on to take necessary steps about the matter. He ducked a question on if former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia would be freed. Home secretary Abdul Karim also echoed the adviser. But Karim said the law and order situation deteriorated in some cases, but did not explain the situation. "The number of killings and robberies dropped," Karim said. A senior government official who was present at the meeting said the number of incidents of rape and attack on the police was higher in April than in March. Karim said that 13 suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack on police in Bagmara in Rajshahi. The robbed arms were retrieved in a space of 48 hours. He said the government decided in principle to evict shanties occupying 47 acres of government land in Karail area in Mohakhali. The government would rehabilitate the slum dwellers. NGOs will be involved in the rehabilitation process. The families illegally occupying the six plots of the housing and public works ministry in Mirpur area would be evicted. The government also decided to shift 450 non-Bangalee families now living in Adamjee Jute Mills area. The committee on law and order discussed eviction of some slums in Chittagong city too. Spelling out restrictions on public functions, the home secretary said death and birth anniversaries of famous persons could be observed, but feeding orphans must be inside an orphanage. "Prayers can be arranged in mosques." The inspector general of police, director general of Bangladesh Rifles and representatives from other law-enforcement agencies were present at the meeting. bdnews24.c
