<TITLE> Insurer QBE needs to sweeten bid to win over IAG </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Insurance Australia Group Ltd has so far stonewalled a A$8.2 billion ($7.7 billion) bid from QBE Insurance, but a 5-10 percent sweetener could be enough to seal the deal. With IAG's earnings sliding this year and its credit rating recently cut, the market sees little chance of another suitor trumping QBE, as it has the most to gain from putting the businesses together. QBE has left its proposal for Australia's top home and car insurer open until Monday. While it could extend the deadline further, launch a formal hostile bid, or walk away, investors are betting QBE will top up its offer slightly to try to secure a recommendation from IAG's board. "IAG dealt itself a difficult hand by downgrading its profit," said Tom Elliott, managing director of hedge fund MM&E Capital. "At the same time, there's probably a fair chance they might be able to squeeze a small increase out of QBE, but I don't think it'd be anything substantial." Analysts estimated QBE could afford to increase its offer by 5-10 percent and still justify a takeover, and that might be enough to secure an IAG board recommendation. "Something that allows them to save face," said Elliott. QBE shareholders said there is little incentive for QBE to significantly increase its bid, except to lure IAG's board back to the table. "It would expedite proceedings quite a bit to get board recommendation," said Matt Williams, Australian equities manager for Perpetual Investments. While QBE wants a nod from IAG, IAG needs QBE's offer to avoid a slide in its share price. What could force IAG's board to cave in? "It might be the realization by the IAG board that if QBE does walk away, their (IAG's) financial structure may be under a bit of pressure," said Paul Xiradis, Chief Executive of fund manager Ausbil Dexia, which owns shares in QBE. With its earnings set to fall 55 percent this year, IAG might have to cut its dividend to shore up its capital, analysts have warned. IAG's biggest institutional shareholder, Colonial First State, with a 4.3 percent stake, declined to comment. Its second largest shareholder, 452 Capital, did not return calls. "I'm sure there have been long-suffering shareholders who'd like to see a deal," said Matt Williams, Australian equities manager for Perpetual Investments, another QBE owner, talking about IAG shareholders. ON THE CHEAP In talks last month, IAG rebuffed two offers from QBE. The second offer was pitched at 0.142 of its own shares plus A$0.70 in cash for every IAG share, a premium of just 1.5 percent to IAG's shares at the time. IAG reiterated its rejection over the past two weeks, despite cutting its outlook for premium growth and insurance margins and losing its 'AA-' credit rating from Standard & Poor's. The view on IAG's side is the ball is in QBE's court. "Nothing has changed since our last statement. As we made clear, IAG views QBE's takeover proposal as incomplete and inadequate," an IAG spokeswoman said this week. In its defense, IAG said QBE was trying to get away with paying no premium for IAG at a low point, when it has been battered by storm claims in Australia and tough competition in the UK. To offset some of the hardship, IAG has been looking to cut costs. On Friday, IAG shares were trading 2 percent higher than QBE's proposed offer value of A$4.35 a share, down a third on its life high in January 2007
