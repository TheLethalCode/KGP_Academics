<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Zaragoza were relegated to the second division after losing 3-2 away to Real Mallorca on the final day of the Primera Liga season on Sunday. Racing Santander secured their first UEFA Cup place with a 1-0 victory at home to Osasuna thanks to a late goal from Ivan Bolado. The league's top scorer Daniel Guiza notched his 27th of the campaign to put the pressure on Zaragoza. Although Ricardo Oliveira levelled for Zaragoza in the second half it was Pierre Webo and Gonzalo Castro who sealed their fate. Zaragoza, who had started the season tipped as top four contenders, finished 18th with 42 points, one short of Osasuna, and join Real Murcia and Levante in the second division. "Life goes on and we have to pick ourselves up. The players are distraught but we are in the second division and we have to get used to the idea," Zaragoza coach Manolo Villanova said. Champions Real Madrid hammered relegated Levante 5-2 at the Bernabeu with two apiece for Ruud van Nistelrooy and Sergio Ramos. Alexandre Geijo bagged both goals for the league's bottom club. Racing finished sixth with 60 points taking the last UEFA Cup place along with fifth-placed Sevilla (64), who thumped Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at home. Mallorca were seventh with 59. Almeria beat Espanyol 3-1 to take eighth place on 52 points just ahead of Deportivo Coruna who lost 2-0 at home to Villarreal. It was a nerve-jangling afternoon at three stadiums as the games involving relegation-threatened quartet Zaragoza, Recreativo Huelva, Valladolid and Osasuna were all forced to wait an hour due to a heavy downpour in Mallorca. Zaragoza, who started the day two points short of 15th-placed Valladolid, fell behind to Spain striker Guiza's deflected shot after only 15 minutes. Recre, who started 16th, also went a goal behind after Valladolid striker Joseba Llorente scored with a close-range header in the 40th minute. RECRE DOWN Zaragoza drew level in Mallorca thanks to Olveira's header in the 56th which pushed Recreativo down into the relegation place. Recre's Florent Sinama Pongolle rounded the goalkeeper and fired into the sidenetting with the goal gaping, and Valladolid's Sergio Asenjo pulled off a superb one-handed save to deny Ersen Martin. But the drama swung back to the Ono Estadi as Webo powered in a header in the 65th to put Mallorca back in front 2-1 after a dreadful defensive mix-up to put Zaragoza back in the bottom three. Zaragoza's desperation had them piling forward at the end but they were hit on the break as Castro finished off a swift counter-attack in the 92nd minute. Oliveira's goal for Zaragoza two minutes later sparked brief hopes of a late equaliser but it was to no avail, and Javi Guerrero grabbed an injury-time leveller for Recre for them to draw 1-1 with Valladolid
