 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court sent former Chittagong Port Authority member AK Rashid Uddin Ahmed to jail Wednesday after he surrendered as an accused in the GATCO graft case. Lawyer ASM Abdul Wadud told bdnews24.com that his client had turned himself in to the court in the morning. Senior special judge Md Azizul Haque ordered authorities to award him division in jail. Twenty-four people have been accused in the GATCO case so far; 17 have been detained to date, while seven remain fugitive. The court on May 15 issued an arrest warrant against the then 12 fugitives in the case and ordered authorities to confiscate their wealth. Rashid Uddin was a member of the CPA engineering and development department. He served as acting chairman of the CPA for one day, the day the contract for running Chittagong port and Kamalapur container depot was signed with GATCO. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 last year. The commission later submitted a charge sheet against 24 people including former prime minister Khaleda Zia. bdnews24.com/
