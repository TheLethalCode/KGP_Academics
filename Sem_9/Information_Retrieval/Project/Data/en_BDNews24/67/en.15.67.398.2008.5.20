 MELBOURNE, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket Australia (CA) is looking into the idea of establishing its own Twenty20 tournament in response to the success of cash-rich competitions in India. CA chief executive James Sutherland said the use of overseas players and the possibility of private investment in teams were all part of discussions with the competition tentatively set to begin in time for the 2009-2010 season. Australia already has a Twenty20 competition involving its first class teams but Sutherland said given the interest created from franchise-based competitions in India, it was considering developing its own tournament along similar lines. "We are currently looking at a revamped Twenty20 domestic competition that will significantly enhance the competition in this country," Sutherland told reporters on Tuesday. "We are under no illusions that our market is a different size (to India) and we would need to tailor our product but we see tremendous benefits to flow from Twenty20 cricket that will bring new people to the game." Sutherland refused to confirm any details of any proposals, though local media had reported it could include a player draft that involved international players, a salary cap, protecting "franchise players", and non state teams being established. A New Zealand-based side could also be included, media reported. Sutherland said proposals were still being discussed and that there was still a lot of work to do before anything concrete was presented. "There are lots of challenges that we are working through but we are committed to revamping our domestic competition in a positive way that will enhance the game," he said. He also said the organisation was investigating holding test matches at night, though problems with being able to see the red ball under lights and whether a different colour ball would last 80 overs, were major considerations. "My view as a cricket administrator though, is it is something we should explore -- the opportunity for cricket to be played at a time when more customers can come and watch. "Whether it works or not, is something we need to go through all the hoops with and we won't launch into night test cricket until we have.
