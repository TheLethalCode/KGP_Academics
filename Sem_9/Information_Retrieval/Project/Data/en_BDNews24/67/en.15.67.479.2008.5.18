<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited came close to retaining the title of the Premier Division Cricket League when they handed a convincing seven-wicket defeat to Biman Bangladesh in the penultimate Super League encounter Sunday. Abahani raced to 129 for three in 22.4 overs after bundling Biman out for a paltry total of 125 in 36.3 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. With the back-to-back win, Abahani joined the leaders Biman with 25 points each. Holders Abahani now need a win against Surjo Torun on Wednesday to clinch the premiership title as they are far ahead of Biman in term of net run rate. It would have been a title-celebrating day for Biman with a match to go, had they passed the Dhanmond-based outfit in the penultimate round, but their dismal batting show threw them into a huge frustration. "We batted very badly and it was not possible to win a match after such dismal performance," said Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, a key player of the national flag carrier. Abahani coach Aminul Islam Bulbul also said that Biman's batsmen threw their wickets away. Biman got off to a fine start with achieving five runs per over before first-change pacer Nazmul Hossain rattled Biman's top order removing four batsmen in a row and Biman slipped to 63 for four from 40 for no loss. Nazmul dismissed both openers Tamim Iqbal (18), Pakistani Nasir Jamshed (19), Mosharraf Hossain Rubel (1) and Mushfiqur Rahman (3). Middle order Alok Kapali struck the highest score of 33 before spinners Arafat Sunny (2/19), Mohammad Rafique (2/15) and pacer Talha Jubair (2/29) shared six wickets to wrap the opponent innings up. One-down Nafis Iqbal remained unbeaten on 19 off 53 balls. Abahani, in reply, initially faced some trouble in losing both openers with the scoreboard reading 36 for two in 8.5 overs, but they rode on a fine 48-run knock from Twilina Kandanbi to reach home. Shahriar Nafees and Kandanbi repaired the initial damage to put on 37 runs for the third wicket before Nafees was out for 36, leaving the side at 73 for three in 15 overs. Kandanbi and skipper Tushar Imran (16) steered the sky-blue outfit home with 56 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket. Kandanbi, Sri Lankan batsman, quickfired 48 off 47 balls smashing six fours and two sixes. At the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground, Mohammedan without Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and Junaed Siddique thrashed City Club by seven wickets. Mohammedan reached home making 141 for three in 30.2 overs after bowling City Club out for 136 in 28.2 overs.
