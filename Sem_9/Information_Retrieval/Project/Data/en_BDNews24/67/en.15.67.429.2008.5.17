 LONDON, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swing bowler Matthew Hoggard has been ruled out of England's squad for the second test against New Zealand after fracturing his thumb on Friday. In a statement on Saturday the England and Wales Cricket Board said Hoggard, who was left out of the final XI for the first test at Lord's, had been struck on the thumb by Steve Harmison playing for Yorkshire against Durham. Both players were dropped after the first test loss to New Zealand in Hamilton this year although Hoggard was included in a 12-man squad for the first two tests of the return series. The second test starts at Old Trafford next Friday
