 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The right-wing Hindu government in the tourist state of Rajasthan has accused India's central government of suggesting that "illegal Bangladeshi migrants" should be put in a "transit camp like Guantanamo Bay". With this, the issue of Bangladeshi migrants in the north Indian state has snowballed into a major controversy. Chief minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje, who participated in a Tuesday TV talk show, endorsed the interviewer's suggestion that "rounding up" illegal migrants would amount to a Guantanamo Bay-type situation. "They wrote to us saying 'round them (Bangladeshis) up and put them in transit camps and feed them'," she said. But Indian home minister Shivraj Patil, who has continuously been accused of being soft on terror, hit back saying that the chief minister was lying and her statement only exposed her 'weakness' in tackling terrorism. "Perhaps she (Raje) is shaken after the recent blasts in Jaipur and is saying anything that is not true. She should have avoided it (making the statement). She has just exposed her weakness," Patil said. But things took a different turn on Tuesday. As Rajasthan's home minister Gulab Chand Kataria showed the media a copy of the letter that the Indian central government sent to the Rajasthan government, it was clear that the war-of-words over so-called illegal Bangladeshi migrants have taken a different turn. The Rajasthan government, rocked by nine serial blasts in Jaipur, had earlier said all "illegal Bangladeshi migrants" would be deported from the state as Bangladesh based militant group Harkat-ul Jihad al Islami (HUJI) had been pointed out as the group behind the blast. According to official figures, there are more than 50,000 Bangladeshis in various districts and about 10,000 of them live in different colonies in Jaipur. "All district superintendents have been asked to complete surveys and send the reports to the government. If someone has proper documents, there is no question of taking any action against him or her," said Rajasthan's police chief AS Gill.
