 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government dialogue with political parties began Thursday at the Chief Adviser's Office at 10 am, said a government spokesperson. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led the five advisers who held pre-dialogue talks with the political parties in the first sitting with Workers Party of Bangladesh, said the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim. Rashed Khan Menon led the seven-member WPB delegation, with the party's general secretary Bimal Biswas and politburo members Haider Akbar Khan Rano, Anisur Rahman Mallick, Fazle Hossain Badsha, Hajera Sultana and Quamrul Hasina. Bikalpadhara Bangladesh will be the next party to sit with the government at 4 pm. Political leaders and advisers will brief reporters after each meeting. With political parties demanding direct meetings with the chief adviser, five advisers held informal talks in April leading up to the formal dialogue -- law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Fakhruddin in an address to the nation on May 12 hoped that national unity would be achieved on every important issue through the dialogue. bdnews24.co
