 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Security concerns caused a Dhaka court to send proceedings of the Niko graft case filed against detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a special court Wednesday. Corrected Senior special judge Md Azizul Haque ordered transfer of the case proceedings to the Special Judge's Court-2 set up in the specially secured area of the Sangsad Bhaban complex. Advocate Khandaker Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com: "Preparation for starting the trial of the Niko graft case has been completed. The trial proceedings will now be held in the special judge's court set up in the Sangsad Bhaban area." The eight others accused in the case include former state minister Rafiqul Islam, former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former energy secretary M Akmal Hossain, former vice president of Niko Resources Ltd Bangladesh Kashem Sharif, former chairman of Petrobangla Md Mosharraf Hossain and a former Petrobangla director, Syed Anwarul Haque. The Anticorruption Commission submitted the charge sheet in the case on May 7 accusing all nine named, including Sheikh Hasina, of abuse of power, office and authority in handing over three 'abandoned' gas fields to the Canadian oil and gas exploration company Niko. The charges allege that Hasina approved a Niko deal in 2001, during her term as a prime minister, which cost the government Tk 13,630.50 crore in losses. The case also claims that Niko Resources Ltd was "very inefficient" in different aspects of its operations, including technical expertise in exploration, but the deal was nevertheless approved in violation of a proper procedure. bdnews24.com/p
