 COLOMBO, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Veteran Sanath Jayasuriya has been recalled to Sri Lanka's one-day squad for the Asia Cup in June. Jayasuriya, 38, was dropped for Sri Lanka's West Indies series in April after a lean run that included a highest score of 41 in his previous 20 innings. However, the opening batsman won his place back in the team after smashing 114 from 48 balls for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League, an innings that included 11 sixes and nine fours. Opener Upul Tharanga was axed to make room for Jayasuriya who will open the batting with Mahela Udawatte, who made his debut in the West Indies. Sri Lanka also included spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who was rested for the West Indies tour. All rounder Farveez Maharoof and fast bowler Dilhara Fernando returned to the squad in place of pace bowlers Thilan Thushara and Ishara Amarasinghe. The six-nation Asia Cup will be played in Pakistan from June 24 to July 6. Squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara (vice-captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Udawatte, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Chamara Kapugedera, Kaushal Weeraratne, Farveez Maharoof, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Fernando, Muthiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Jehan Mubarak, Nuwan Kulasekera
