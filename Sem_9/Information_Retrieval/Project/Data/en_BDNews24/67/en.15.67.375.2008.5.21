<TITLE> Elected govt must take reform forward: Moriarty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador to Bangladesh James F Moriarty said on Wednesday that a new elected government must carry forward the reforms undertaken by the caretaker government. "As Bangladesh returns to an elected government, it is vital that recent reforms under the caretaker government are respected by the new leadership," said US envoy in his speech to the monthly luncheon meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. "I pray that the spirit of reform lives on into next year and beyond. I urge you all to continue to work with your leaders in finding new ways to transform this country into the best it can be," he said. "This is a critical time for Bangladesh, a country in transition in a part of the world that is vital to US interests, and much work remains to be done to enable Bangladesh to reach its full potential." Moriarty stressed three most important goals of bilateral partnership: promoting democracy, ensuring development and denying space to terrorism. "Bangladesh faces numerous obstacles acting against these goals, but there is one challenge that obstructs all three," he said. "The challenge is corruption." "Corruption is the enemy of democracy, for it distorts the choices of the people and inhibits their self-determination. Corruption misplaces the benefits of development efforts, benefiting those who are least in need." "When terrorists lose the support of the population, corruption allows them to purchase additional support. Corruption is a cancer eating away at the vital organs of the nation," he said. The ambassador cited an estimate that corruption costs Bangladesh between 2-3 percent of GDPa figure that accounts for about $2 billion in losses every year. "You all recognise that it is a drag on the economy and a deterrent to international trade and investment in Bangladesh," Moriarty told the audience. "But some of you may have come to accept it as inevitable; a fact of life of doing business in this country, with no prospect that it will ever change. I urge you not to think that way." Moriarty said Bangladesh is not alone in its struggle with corruption. "Every nation faces it, and some countries, including my own, have endured difficult times under corruption's grip. There was a time when corruption was rampant in the United States." "If Bangladesh is to tackle corruption it will require a national consensus, among the government, the business community, the legal community and civil societya commitment from all sectors of society to work together." No sector can effectively address corruption on its own; it must be a team effort, he said. "It should be the duty of every businessman, every politician and every civil society leader to do his or her part in the struggle against corruption." "The culture of impunity must be eradicated. People must be held accountable for their corrupt practices; otherwise there is no incentive to change. Past actions will need to be addressed, and the process for addressing those actions  whatever that process may be  should be fair and transparent." Moriarty emphasised that the legal environment must be addressed. "Anticorruption legislation must be adequate and effective. At the same time, effective enforcement must be balanced with respect for human rights." Moriarty focused on business and investment potential of Bangladesh, a "dynamic country with an enormously talented population". "The constraints on Bangladesh's infrastructure and the circumstances of its geography present some serious challenges to potential exporters and investors, but it is corruption that really scares them. Corruption is the most serious obstacle to Bangladesh's meeting its full economic potential." "The struggle against corruption is a central feature of our bilateral relationship, and we will continue to engage with all sectors of society on this issue." The ambassador said USAID is implementing an anticorruption program to support parliamentary oversight committees, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, citizen advocacy and watchdog initiatives, legal reforms and investigative journalism. bdn
