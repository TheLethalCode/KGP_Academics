 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is contemplating holding elections to tenure-expired city corporations from mid-July through early September, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said Sunday. Of the five term-expired city corporations, polls for Dhaka will be held towards the end of August or early September, Sakhawat told reporters at the EC secretariat. Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet city corporations are likely to have elections in mid-July. On the preparations for the elections, Sakhawat said: "Voter lists for corporation and municipal polls are ready and the City Corporation and Municipality Ordinances 2008 of the local government are awaiting publication." City corporation and municipal election schedules may be announced in the first week of June. "In that case, we would like to hold the polls in the second or third week of July," Sakhawat said. He said: "The draft voter lists will be published towards the end of May, following which the voters will be notifying their objections and suggesting ways of righting them." Replying to a query, Sakhawat said: "As the DCC is much larger in area compared with the rest of the city corporations, the polls here will be held separately." Sakhawat said the Election Commission has undertaken holding the city and local level elections as a practical exercise before the national polls. On voter registration being carried out across the country, Sakhawat said: "The voter lists will be finalised before October and simultaneously, we are moving ahead with other preparatory activities." District administrations countrywide have been instructed to send in the lists of presiding officers and polling centres, he said. Two lakh transparent ballot boxes will be delivered at the EC. "The Canadian government has agreed to provide transparent ballot boxes as grant, after they have already started manufacturing them." bdnews24.
