<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court ordered Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami to jail Monday, after his arrest the previous night in the GATCO graft case. The capital's chief metropolitan magistrate's court simultaneously ordered jail authorities to treat Nizami as a first division prisoner and make arrangements for his medical treatment. The Jamaat-e-Islami chief was produced in the courtroom of magistrate Md Waliul Islam shortly before 10 am. An hour later, a prison van carrying Nizami left the court for Dhaka Central Jail. On arrival in the court-room, as Nizami settled on a first row bench, senior police officers requested his lawyers to escort the accused to the dock saying: "Mr Nizami is an arrestee; he is not here to surrender himself." Nizami's lawyers protested, saying Sheikh Hasina was allowed to sit in the lawyers' corner when she was brought into the court after her arrest and the law should be equally applicable in all cases. Since the courtroom dock looks like a cell encaged within an iron frame, the lawyers insisted on keeping the accused seated on the bench. Large numbers of police were deployed in and around the CMM court as Nizami was produced in the court, while senior Jamaat-e-Islami leaders and supporters  including Ali Ahsan Mujahid, Makbul Ahmed, Kader Molla and Delwar Hossain Saidi  gathered in the area. Moshiul Alam, lawyer for Nizami, told the court that Nizami was not included in the original chargesheet for the case. Nizami's lawyer said his client was arrested illegally while his bail appeal remained with the Appellate Division. He served for two ministries with honesty, the lawyer added. "Nizami is the model of honesty in Bangladesh. Those who do not want wellbeing of Bangladesh have included him in the chargesheet," Alam said. Alam told the magistrate: "As the case is filed under the emergency powers rules, there is no chance of considering bail. But we appeal for his bail as the charges are false  for that reason you should allow bail for my client." Th lawyer requested the court to allow Nizami to make a statement. The magistrate asked the accused to deliver no statements other than pertaining to the case. "As the judiciary is independent now, I expect justice in this false case. I have been produced on charges of corruption that are very unfair to me," Nizami said. "I served in the agriculture and industry ministries during the previous government's term. Nobody will find any corruption there even with if they search with a microscope" "I was only a member of purchase committee and signed my name," the Jamaat leader claimed. "This is a politically motivated case. I was not involved in the GATCO deal." "I was shown fugitive in the chargesheet. That is a false accusation. I was staying in my house and attending various meetings. Why did they show me fugitive?" he asked. The police arrested Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami at his Maghbazar home Sunday night amid protests by several hundred party supporters. Nizami was taken to the Cantonment Police Station after arrest. A former minister in the previous BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government, Nizami is the last of the chiefs of the three major political parties  after Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia  to have been arrested in an anticorruption crackdown by the interim government. bdnews24.com/pb/
