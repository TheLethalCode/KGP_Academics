 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said Saturday high inflation would not put strains on consumers if the purchasing power of people could be strengthened. Inflation, trade deficit and balance of payments are linked with budget and the economy, the governor said at a seminar on "Zero-Based Budget" coorganised by Bangladesh MBA Association and Northern University Bangladesh at the National Press Club. "Up to 2 percent inflation is not worrying at all. What is important is the purchasing power of people," the central banker said. "Many countries faced up to 40 percent inflation but they did not have much problem. But 10 percent inflation turned out to be a matter of concern for us. It is because of the level of our purchasing power," he added. Salehuddin suggested the government give emphasis on job-creating sectors, including the agriculture sector to enhance purchasing power. The seminar focused on zero-based budgeting (ZBB) which is defined as a technique of planning and decision-making which reverses the working process of traditional budgeting. ZBB requires the budget request justified in complete detail by each division manager starting from the zero-base. The zero-base is indifferent to whether total budget is increasing or decreasing. Salehuddin said preparing a 'zero-based budgeting' was difficult in the present situation. "Such budget requires huge data and information. It needs transparency, accountability and the sense of responsibility. But we, unfortunately, lack all these things," he said. Salehuddin said allocation for the agriculture sector should be increased to boost food output in view of the global food crisis. The BB chief also stressed decentralisation of budget. "Strengthening local government will not be fruitful at all if we fail to decentralise budget," he said. MBA Association president Ibrahim Khaled said zero-based budgeting was a new concept for Bangladesh. "Bangladesh government does not have the capacity to prepare a zero-based budget," he said. "Our budget is the budget of the poor. The poor never have a surplus budget. It's needless to say that allocation for the agriculture sector should be increased." Hafiz GA Siddiqi, vice chancellor of North South University, presided over the seminar. bdnews
