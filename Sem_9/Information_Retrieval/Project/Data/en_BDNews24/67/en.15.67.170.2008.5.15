 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Thursday decided to relegate only one team from the B. League this season following the threat of boycotting the ongoing player transfers and upcoming B. League by the clubs. The decision was taken at an emergency meeting with acting president Salam Murshidi in chair. Of the 10-member committee, seven were present at the meeting. "We have decided to relegate one team from the professional football league this season and the clubs also agreed with us," said Murshidi after having met with the club officials. Of 11 participating teams, nine clubs Wednesday threatened the federation that they would boycott the transfer along with the upcoming B. League if the federation stuck to their decision of relegating the team this season. The BFF acting boss said that the meeting had also proposed to stage a second-tier B. League from where the clubs would be promoted to the B. League. Abu Naeem Shohag, manager of the B. League, said that the 2nd B. League will be held with 12 teams as the B. League Committee has given permission to Rajshahi Diganta Prasari to play in the country's top football league. Shohag also said that the next year's B. League would be held with 13 teams as one team would be relegated this season while one team each from the National Football League and the Senior Division Football League would qualify for the B. League next year. No club turned up to the federation on Thursday, the first day of the 36-day player transfers.
