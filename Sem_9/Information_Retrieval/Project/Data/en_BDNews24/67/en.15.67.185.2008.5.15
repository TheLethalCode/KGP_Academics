 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Two fine fifties from Shahriar Nafees and Shahagir Hossain Pavel powered holders Abahani Limited to a massive nine-wicket win over Mohammedan SC in the Super League encounter of the Premier Division Cricket League Thursday. Abahani raced to 136 for one in 21.2 overs in reply to Mohammedan's paltry total of 133 all out in 47.2 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. It was the third defeat for Mohammedan to Abahani this season as they first lost to their archrivals in the Twenty20 tournament and the second one was in the first-leg match of the ongoing league. Pacers Talha Jubaer and Ziaur Rahman justified their captain Tushar Imran's decision to bowl first removing Junaed Siddique (2), Pakistani Aqeel Arshad (13) and Rakibul Hasan (0) to reduce Mohammedan to 31 for three inside 14 overs. Mohammedan skipper Mohammad Ashraful (24) and Anwar Hossain produced some resistance to put on 37 runs for the fourth wicket before ace spinner Mohammad Rafique had Anwar (34) caught by Tushar to break the stand. Afterwards, Mohammedan slipped to 99 for six and the Motijheel-based outfit crossed the triple digits as Aftab Ahmed played a 43-ball 26 before being run out. Rafique (2/15), Zia (2/17), Jubaer (2/31) shared six wickets while Nazmul Hossain, Arafat Sunny and Tushar took one wicket apiece. Abahani, in reply, faced hardly any trouble and reached home in half way of the second innings with Nafees and Shahagir putting on 129 for the unbroken second wicket. Pacer Tapash Kumar drew the first blood for the Motijheel-based outfit dismissing opener Mahbubul Karim (2) in the very fifth delivery, and that was the lone success for the Mohammedan. Shahagir, the man of the match, scored 67 off 70 balls that included nine fours and one six while Nafees struck 62 off 54 balls featuring also nine fours and one six. In the day's other matches, league leaders Biman Bangladesh defeated Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan by 69 runs while Surjo Torun beat City Club by five wickets.
