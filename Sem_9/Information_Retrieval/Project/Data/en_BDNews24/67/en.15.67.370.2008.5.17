 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser's special assistant Dr M Tamim has said the country has energy safety for the next 20 years. His comment came at a roundtable on "Energy Safety" organised by Bangla-language daily Jugantor at BIAM auditorium in the city Saturday. "I think the country has energy safety for the next 20 years. I do not know what will happen after that," Tamim said. Describing different aspects of the power and energy situation in the past, he said: "Whenever a new government comes to power, it blames the previous government for whatever went wrong. And it claims credit for whatever good happened." "However, the people put all blame on and give credit to the incumbent. They forget to keep the previous government accountable." "Despite adequate gas in the country, work could not be done properly due to line and supply problems, he added. Transparency International, Bangladesh chairman Prof Muzaffer Ahmad alleged: "There is still corruption in electricity billing. There are still corrupt meter readers." Jugantor acting editor advocate Salma Islam presided over the seminar. Justice Golam Rabbani, former PDB chairman Quamarul Islam Siddiqui, Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed, FBCCI senior vice president Abul Kashem, Rural Electrification Board director BD Rahmatullah also spoke. bdnews24.c
