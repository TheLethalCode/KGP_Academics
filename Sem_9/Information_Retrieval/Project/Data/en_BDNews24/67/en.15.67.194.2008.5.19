 ROME, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Italian police officers were injured during clashes with fans before a soccer match in Parma on Sunday, local media reported. A 28-year-old policeman suffered multiple abdominal injuries and was admitted to a local hospital. Italy's ANSA news agency later said his condition was not as serious as initially feared and that he was expected to recover within around three weeks. The other officer was injured by rocks hurled at him by fans during clashes outside the stadium, it said. Inter Milan won the match 2-0 in Parma to retain their Serie A league title. Defeat meant Parma were relegated to the second tier of Italian soccer. Italy is trying to crack down on a serious soccer violence problem at its club matches. A Lazio fan was shot dead by police in November after a scuffle at a motorway rest stop and a policeman was killed in riots outside a match in Catania last year. The league was suspended for a period after the death in Catania and new measures were brought in to try to clamp down on hooliganism
