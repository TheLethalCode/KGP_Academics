 HC sets final hearing on Hasina petition for Thursday Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set Thursday as the final hearing on the writ petition filed by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging the proceedings of the barge-mounted power plant case against her. A High Court bench of justices MA Rashid and Md Ashfakul Islam set the final hearing date Wednesday following a plea by Hasina's lawyer barrister Shafique Ahmed. The former prime minister filed the writ petition on May 11. On May 12, the court issued a rule nisi on the petition, which challenges the legality of the trial proceedings as it had not been concluded within 60 days. The High Court asked the government, the Anticorruption Commission and a special judge's court to explain the delay, but did not halt the trial proceedings of the case. According to law, trial of a case should be normally completed within 60 days of the court taking the charges into cognisance. The court accepted the charge sheet on Jan 10, while charge framing against Hasina and other accused in the case was concluded on May 18. The Special Judge's Court-1, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises, began taking witness depositions Wednesday. Anticorruption Commission deputy director AMM Sabbir Hassan, a plaintiff in the case, was the first to give his testimony to the special court set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking bribes in return for allowing installation of three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna during her term as prime minister. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on Sept 20 last year. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 last year and she was shown arrested in the case on Sept 19. bdnew
