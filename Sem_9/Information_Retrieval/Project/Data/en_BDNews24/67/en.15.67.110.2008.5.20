 MOSCOW, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian airport authorities will struggle to process fans through passport control in time for this week's Champions League final in Moscow, a British tour operator said on Monday. The first supporters began arriving in the Russian capital in preparation for the first all-English Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester United at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday. More than 40,000 fans are expected to arrive in Moscow for European club soccer's showpiece, creating a logistical and policing headache for the Russian authorities. The only previous European club final staged in Moscow was the UEFA Cup final between Parma of Italy and Olympique Marseille of France nine years ago. "We haven't had much in the way of problems but today there were only 100 of us and the line for passports was an hour," Paul Gill, a representative with Manchester-based Champion Sports Tours told Reuters. "There's no way they're going to get everybody through there in time on Wednesday. That's going to be 10,000 people, and that's just one team." He said his company had organised trips to the match for more than 2,000 supporters. RUSSIANS CONFIDENT Russian officials say they are confident the event will run smoothly. The government earlier this month waived visa requirements for ticket holders, easing fears supporters would not receive entry permits in time. Alexei Sorokin, a Moscow city official involved in preparations for the match, said airport authorities would lay on extra staff to handle the influx of fans. "Obviously, they'll just add more people," he told Reuters. "So far, everything has been running according to plan  The fans have started to arrive and we are ready to welcome them to Moscow. "We just had a big meeting with (Interior Minister Rashid) Nurgaliyev, where once more we went through all the security measures and procedures." Russian police are expected to mobilise thousands of police at the stadium, and elsewhere in Moscow, to prevent any trouble involving supporters. European soccer's governing body UEFA is confident the fans heading to Moscow will not cause trouble similar to the riots that blighted the UEFA Cup final in Manchester last Wednesday. The first contingent of fans for the Champions League final landed at Moscow's Domodedovo airport on Monday from where they were taken by bus to their hotels. The two teams were expected to arrive in Moscow later on Monday. The supporters said they were not anticipating any trouble. "We are looking forward to it," said Paul, a Manchester United supporter. "I do not think it is as bad as it is painted." "Very excited," said another supporter, who gave his name as Gareth, when asked for his reaction on arriving in Moscow. "I've never been to Moscow. It is a brand new city. I am looking forward to seeing the sights of Moscow.
