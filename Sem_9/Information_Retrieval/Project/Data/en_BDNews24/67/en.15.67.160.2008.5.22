<TITLE> Austria captain Ivanschitz hopes to imitate Greeks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most Austrians have little hope of their team doing well at Euro 2008, but whatever expectations remain rest largely on the shoulders of captain Andreas Ivanschitz. Now 24, the Panathinaikos midfielder became Austria's youngest captain when he took the armband in a 2003 European qualifier against the Czech Republic when he was just 19. Unassuming and quietly spoken, Ivanschitz has often been seen as a strange choice for the captaincy, particularly in the difficult times that have seen the tournament co-hosts winning just one of their last 14 matches. In a side that has been frequently divided by rifts in the past, however, Ivanschitz's relaxed, almost bland, disposition could help prevent another meltdown if the opening match against Croatia does not go Austria's way. His constantly positive outlook, despite those recent results, may also give encouragement to the team's latest batch of young players. "It is very special if you are the host because you have the fans in your own country and I think we can surprise some people," Ivanschitz told Reuters in December. "We are not the favourites. People are not expecting a lot from us so maybe the bigger teams will be saying 'it is an easy game, the Austrians are not good' and that will give us our chance." As well as geeing up his team psychologically, Ivanschitz can lead by example as one of the few Austrian players to have secured a regular starting place outside his own country. A nimble playmaker who is often at the heart of Austria's best moves, the left-footer has been a key figure for Panathinaikos in the Greek top-flight. His move to Athens on a loan deal from Salzburg has also given him the chance to rub shoulders with some of the Greek players who stunned Europe by winning Euro 2004. "Everything is possible," Ivanschitz said. "The Greeks showed it can happen when they won last time. We have to believe in that and then we can have a good tournament. An Austria-Greece final would be perfect.
