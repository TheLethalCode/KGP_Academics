 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  A High Court bench has declined to hear an appeal filed by former prime minister Khaleda Zia to cancel the Niko graft case. Khaleda's lawyers took back the appeal Tuesday after the High Court bench of justices Sharif Uddin Chaklader and Md Imdadul Haque Azad expressed 'embarrassment' in hearing the appeal filed by the BNP chairperson on May 18. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year with Tejgaon Police Station against five accused for causing losses to the state through signing oil and gas exploration deals with Canadian company Niko. The commission submitted a charge sheet on May 5 against 11 people in total accusing them of causing a loss of Tk 13,700 crore to the state. bdnews24.
