 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Arch rivals Abahani Limited and Mohammedan SC shared the Premier Division Hockey League honour when they played a tense 3-3 draw at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey League Saturday. With the first draw in seven matches, Abahani raised their points- tally to 19, one point ahead of Usha Krira Chakra, who played one match less than the leaders, and two points adrift of Mohammedan SC. A youthful Mohammedan took a comfortable 3-1 lead in the first half, but they failed to keep the lead against the re-organised Abahani in the second half and had to be satisfied with a second draw in seven matches. The coaches of both sides were pleased with the results. "We have no gripes over the results as the boys played well against Abahani compared to their previous performance," said Mohammedan coach Jahirul Islam Mitu adding that both sides played nicely throughout the 70-minute game. "After trailing in the first half, we played all out in the second half with packing the defense as we conceded three goals in the lapse of defense, which was not up to the mark in the first half," said Abahani coach Mahbub Haroon. Abahani, who enjoyed superior ball possession in the game, launched the first attack, but striker Russel Mahmud Jimmy disappointed the Dhanmondi-based outfit sending the ball outside from a very close range. Soon Abahani had to pay the price of their failure as Jahid Bin Talib, set by Asif A Noor, gave Mohammedan a 13-minute lead with a fierce hit. It could have been double lead for Mohammedan in the next minute, but Pakistani Mohammad Sabbir missed the chance. In the 15th minute, Jimmy was denied by Mohammedan young keeper Mehrab Hossain Kiron, who also foiled three penalty corners of Abahani. Abahani saw themselves go two goals down in the 19th minute when Shuvo tapped the ball home with a superb combination from a penalty corner. Substitute Moududur Raham Shuvo, however, brought some life back to the match pulling one goal back in the 24th minute for Abahani, who beat Mohammedan 5-4 in a tie- breaker in the Club Cup semifinals. In the span of the next minutes, both Abahani and Mohammedan missed one each before Mohammedan extended their lead to 3-1 with Isa converting a penalty corner in the 30th minute. After the breather, Abahani changed their game strategy with attacks being produced from the midfield on small passes, and they got the dividends 11 minutes into the second half. Pakistani Imran did not hesitate to tap a through pass from his compatriot Modasser home to reduce the Abahani margin to 3-2 in the 46th minute. One minute later, Abahani's Shuvo missed the target from a close-range before Mamunur Rahman Chayan levelled the score in the 63rd minute through a penalty corner. The result could have been different had Mohammedan's Pakistani recruit Sabbir not missed the target in one-on-one position with Abahani's keeper Jahid Hossain five minutes from time. In other match of the day, Krishna Kumar struck four goals including a hat-trick as Sonali Bank came from behind to beat Waril 5-1 at the same venue. Apart from Krishna's four goals, Iqbal Nader scored one for Sonali Bank while Sanjit netted the lone goal for Wari.
