 LONDON, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Jacob Oram steered New Zealand towards a draw on the final day of the first test against England at Lord's on Monday after team mate Brendon McCullum retired hurt because of a blow to his left forearm. At tea New Zealand were 199 for four in their second innings, a lead of 157, with 39 overs remaining. Oram was on 55, his fifth test half-century, and debutant Daniel Flynn had scored 19. McCullum was taken to hospital after he was struck on the arm by Stuart Broad. The Kiwi wicketkeeper, who top-scored with 97 in the first innings, was on 11 at the time and New Zealand were in trouble at 120 for four, a lead of only 78. An X-ray revealed no fracture and McCullum returned to the changing room where he was able to watch Oram and Flynn craft an unbeaten stand of 79. Oram relieved the pressure after McCullum's departure by sweeping Monty Panesar for six to take the lead past the 100 mark and cover-drove Ryan Sidebottom for another boundary. Flynn was lucky to get away with a four which flew through the slips off Sidebottom while Oram batted with increasing authority, square-cutting Anderson to bring up his half-century from 67 balls with a six and six fours. Captain Michael Vaughan turned to Kevin Pietersen's occasional off-spin but it was Anderson who nearly made the breakthrough shortly before tea when a skied hook from Oram off Anderson fell safely between two fielders. England made early inroads when play resumed with New Zealand on 40 for no wicket on a cloudy morning before a sprinkling of spectators. Aaron Redmond, out without scoring in his debut innings, was caught by Andrew Strauss off Anderson for 17 and James Marshall fell lbw to Sidebottom for a duck 17 balls later. Jamie How, 26 not out overnight, survived a straightforward chance to Strauss off Broad on 46 to reach his second test fifty from 98 balls with seven boundaries. He was eventually caught at third slip by Alastair Cook trying to turn Broad to leg for 68. Ross Taylor was the other batsman to succumb, lbw Panesar for 20
