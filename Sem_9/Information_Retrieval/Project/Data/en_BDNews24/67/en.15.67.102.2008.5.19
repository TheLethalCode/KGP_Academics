 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League will decide on its participation in dialogue with the government after an extended meeting of the party's central working committee to be held on May 26, said acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Monday. "Our participation in the dialogue will be decided at the May 26 meeting by party leaders of all levels," he said following an AL presidium meeting at the acting party president Zillur Rahman's home. "We have asked the leaders to an extended meeting for their comments on the dialogue. Based on their comments, the party will decide on the issue of participation or otherwise." Asked to comment on the arrest of Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, Ashraf said: "But Mr Nizami hasn't been arrested for war crimes." Invitations to participate in the May 26 extended meeting have gone out to the presidents and general secretaries of 72 district and metropolitan units, 73 members of the central working committee, 41 members of the advisory council, 58 former lawmakers, 109 assistant secretaries of the various divisional sub-committees, 18 representatives of the front organisations, 10 representatives of Dhaka metropolitan Awami League and the national committee members, Ashraf said. He added that Monday's presidium meeting also discussed such issues as the May 20 programme of a nationwide hunger strike. A mass hunger strike will be observed by the party countrywide on the day to press home a six-point demand by the AL. The party has planned an elaborate programme on the occasion, Ashraf said. AL's central leaders will visit neighbouring districts on May 20 to participate in local programmes. Ashraf said the presidium meeting had also addressed the party's relief activities in Sidr-affected areas and the anomalies detected in allocation of funds in Pirojpur district. The AL presidium has asked the party's Pirojpur general secretary to explain why and how he failed to forward a statement of accounts for the funds he was given to provide relief for cyclone victims. Asked to comment on the unsavoury incident, Ashraf said: "Yes, an incident has occurred. The meeting of the central working committee will discuss the matter and then we'll let you know how it has been done." bdnews24.co
