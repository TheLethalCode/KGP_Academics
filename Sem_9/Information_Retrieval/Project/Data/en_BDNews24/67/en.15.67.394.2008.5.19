 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  The finance adviser said Monday the upcoming budget will stand at Tk 99,500 crore, of which Tk 25,500 crore will be marked for the annual development programme. Speaking to reporters after inaugurating a seminar on privatisation at Sonargaon Hotel, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said non-development spending, expenditure in the food sector, expenditure for structural adjustment and loan and advance would amount to Tk 74,000 crore. Azizul added that the overall budget deficit would stand at 5 percent for the upcoming fiscal year 2008-09, and that the full budget would be announced on June 8 or June 9. Replying to a question from bdnews24.com, the finance adviser said: "Tk 25,500 crore for the ADP has already been finalised and the total size of the next budget will stand at Tk 99,500 crore." Azizul conceded that this year's budget deficit would increase, but it would not be by more than 5 percent. The overall deficit for the current fiscal year was estimated at 4.2 percent, said the adviser, although he cautioned the figure in the revised budget was likely to increase slightly in view of elevated costs in energy, fertiliser and food imports. Because of these pressures, Azizul said the upcoming budget would contain measures to increase subsidies in these sectors. The adviser confirmed that no measures are being considered to increase the tax rate in the new budget, although the tax net would be broadened to increase overall tax collection. "Instead, in some cases, the tax rate may be reduced." "However, to protect the interests of domestic industry the import duty on some commodities may be increased," said Azizul. The adviser said the upcoming budget set a target of 6.5 percent GDP growth, adding that in an average account of 12 months, the rate of inflation will be estimated at 9 percent. "The target of revenue income growth has been fixed at 17 percent," said Azizul. The GDP growth target was fixed at 7 percent in the current fiscal year's budget, and the average rate of inflation was estimated at 6 percent. However, in a recent press conference the central bank predicted GDP growth in the upcoming fiscal year would remain between 6 percent and 6.2 percent. GDP growth in fiscal 2006-07 stood at 6.5 percent. The finance adviser summed up by saying one of the main strategies for fiscal 2008-09 would be to increase revenue collection through an expanded tax net, rather than attempting to increase the rate of tax. The upcoming budget marks the first time a caretaker administration has presented two consecutive budgets. The finance adviser will announce the budget through Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar. bdnews
