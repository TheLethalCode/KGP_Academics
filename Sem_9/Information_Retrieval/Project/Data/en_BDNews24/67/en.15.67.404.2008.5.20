<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)--A corruption-free government is not enough for a society's development, the Prince Aga Khan said Tuesday, at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone of a new Aga Khan Academy in the capital. Corruption in the health, education and financial systems and in the judicial process also hampered social progress, the visiting head of the Ismaili Muslim community said. The Aga Khan also stressed that rural people were the worst victims of corruption. "The absence of corruption or fraud in government is not enough," he said while addressing the ceremony in Bashundhara city. "Fraud in medicine, fraud in education, fraud in financial services, fraud in property rights, fraud in the exercise of law enforcement or in the courts, are all risks which can have a dramatic impact on social progress." "This is especially true in rural environments where fraud is often neither reported nor corrected, but simply accepted as an inevitable condition of life," said the visiting prince. Because of these issues, the Aga Khan academies emphasised ethical conduct of the students and teachers, he added. "Bangladesh is the first Muslim country in which we have laid a new academy foundation stone," the Aga Khan said. He said the Aga Khan Academy in Dhaka would teach students in both Bangla and English. "They would be fluently bilingual, our students will be prepared to unlock the rich treasure chests of history and culture, art and music, religious and philosophical thought, which are integral to one's identity and one's values and which are such powerful elements here in Bangladesh," the prince said. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, who attended as the chief guest, said the media were busy in covering politics, but they paid little attention to ethical issues. He urged people to build an ethics-based society. The proposed Aga Khan Academy will be receted in Bashundhara city over the next two years. The Aga Khan Foundation will spend US $50 million to construct the academy. bdn
