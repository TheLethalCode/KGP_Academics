 LONDON, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England international Rio Ferdinand has signed a new five-year contract with Manchester United, the Premier League club announced on Thursday. "I am delighted Rio has signed a new contract. Rio's contribution this season has been a major factor in our outstanding defensive performance," manager Alex Ferguson told the club Web site (www.manutd.com). "It is a great honour to be part of this trophy-winning team and to share in the success, which I am sure will continue for many seasons to come," added Ferdinand. United won the Premier League title on Sunday and face Chelsea in the Champions League final in Moscow next week. Ferdinand joins fellow defender Wes Brown in committing himself to the club, with his new deal keeping him at Old Trafford until the summer of 2013. Speaking at a later news conference at Old Trafford, Ferdinand said: "To be able to stay at Manchester United for another five years is something I have wanted desperately. "To be able to achieve that and sign another contract I am definitely very happy. "You see the surroundings, training every day at Carrington and playing in front of 70,000-odd fans every week, what more could you ask for? "We won the championship and now we are looking towards the Champions League and winning the Premier League is now at the back of our minds. Ferdinand said that only victory in Moscow would make it a memorable end to the season, though. "If we win that then I'll say it's been a fantastic couple of weeks for me, but if we don't then it will end on a disappointment.
