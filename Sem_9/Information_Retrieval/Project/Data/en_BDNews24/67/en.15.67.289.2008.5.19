 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) In a meeting with the chief adviser Monday, Prince Karim Aga Khan said he is keen to act as a bridge to create more markets for Bangladeshi goods in Central Asia. The Aga Khan also expressed an interest in investing in Bangladesh's education sector by establishing a world-class institution in Dhaka, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting. After a private discussion between the Prince and the chief adviser, a more formal meeting got underway, also attended by foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, special assistant Devasish Roy and Munaim among others. "The chief adviser informed the Aga Khan that there was scope for investment in the economic sector and work in the development sector," said the press secretary. "The Aga Khan said they want to encourage those with merit, and in particular, they wish to patronise primary and secondary school pupils." The visiting spiritual leader of the Ismaili Muslims said his organisation had been working towards economic development in Pakistan and India among other countries, and they already have a project in Bangladesh named IPDC, (Industrial Promotion and Development Company), a non-banking financial institution. The chief adviser said: "There is scope for work in the economic sector in our country. Three state-run banks have been made into public limited companies." "Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board has also been turned into a public limited company so that private entrepreneurs can invest in the telecommunication sector," Fakhruddin was quoted as saying. The chief adviser went on to express his hope that Bangladesh would emerge as a middle-income country in the next 15 years, said Munaim. The chief adviser's press secretary added that Fakhruddin drew attention to possible investments in the health sector, especially nursing.
