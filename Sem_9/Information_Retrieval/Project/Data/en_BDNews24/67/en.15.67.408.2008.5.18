 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, a day before he was sent to jail on Sunday, called on the party and its supporters to work together in an effort to establish democracy, leaving aside all differences. "No more division. The party is in the process of unity and it will happen soon," he told bdnews24.com in an exclusive interview. "The split in the party will take people, the country's freedom and sovereignty toward uncertainty and create unrest," he said ahead of his surrender to court in the GATCO graft case. A number of ministers of the governing BNP-led four-party alliance, who were members of the cabinet committee on public purchase, are accused in the case. Bhuyian, also accused in the case along with party chairperson Khaleda Zia, spoke of the urgent need for BNP unity, his faith in the party's chairperson and ideals, and his expulsion by Khaleda. bdnews24.com : What is your opinion about progress in the process of unity in the party? Bhuiyan : There is no alternative to unity. I have been saying all along that unity is a must. It is only a matter of time. I have faith in the leaders and activists of the party that they will bring an end to all kinds of misunderstandings. We are united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia and will remain so. The unity process is nearing its final stage. bdnews24.com : What will be your position in the party after reconciliation? Bhuiyan : This is something for the party chief to decide. I have faith in the ideals of the BNP. I joined the party, inspired by the principles of the party founder, Ziaur Rahman. After his death, Khaleda Zia has made the BNP the most popular party through her efficient leadership. I had served as secretary general for 11 years under her leadership. I have been working jointly with leaders and activists of the party. I did not work for personal gains. I am not thinking about myself. I want unity in the BNP as the party is the symbol of national unity and power. The split in the party will take people, the country's freedom and sovereignty toward uncertainty and unrest. To get over such a situation there is no other alternative to unity. I have been in politics all my life for the sake of people and the country. I maintain the same principles in my personal life. I have never craved position or power. bdnews24.com : Do you want freedom of the chairperson? Bhuiyan : Why should I not? Obviously I want my leader to be released. I also want freedom of all leaders and activists of the party. I believe all of them will be released soon. bdnews24.com : The chairperson expelled you for allegedly breaching party discipline. What is your view on this? Bhuiyan : I think it was an injustice to me. I have worked relentlessly for the party with all my ability. I did nothing violating party discipline. I have worked in line with the ideals of the party. bdnews24.com : Do you think the united BNP will overcome the leadership crisis it has faced due to the change of scenario after 1/11? Bhuiyan : I believe BNP is holding a significant position in the geographical and political context of Bangladesh. If the party is united it will be able to overcome all crises whatever comes before it. The BNP has overcome many such ordeals before. The people are already aware of the role of BNP in the movements against dictatorship and towards the establishing of democracy. Khaleda Zia led all those movements. bdnews24.com : Is the GATCO case political? Bhuiyan : The chargesheet in the case has been submitted. It might be sub-judice to comment in this situation. But I must say decisions come to us at the top level after passing through multiple layers of administration. We make recommendations after evaluation in different phases. bdnews24
