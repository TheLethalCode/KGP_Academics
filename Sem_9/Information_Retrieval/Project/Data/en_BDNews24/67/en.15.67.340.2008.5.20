 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)A senior US State Department official Tuesday expressed concern over the "continuing human rights violations" in Bangladesh. Erica Barks-Ruggles, the US deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, said she had discussed with the government the issue of "some of the political detainees". "We also discussed  where the issue of some of the high-level political detainees may come up in the upcoming dialogue," Barks-Ruggles told reporters after her meeting with law adviser AF Hassan Ariff at the law ministry. She, however, did not name the political detainees. Barks-Ruggles, in Bangladesh since Monday, said: "We had a very good discussion on the issues of political dialogue, how the institutions of governance can be strengthened so that justice can be delivered to all Bangladeshis." "We have concerns about the continuing human-rights violations here. We are continuing to have a discussion with the government on how to address the issue," said Barks-Ruggles. She said she discussed with the law adviser a series of difficult issues such as anticorruption drive and protecting human rights. "We have talked about the need for transparent trials and prosecutions of those who have been arrested," she said in reply to a question whether she had discussed the issue of trials of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. "We hope that we would see transparent trial procedures," she said. Barks-Ruggles earlier had meetings with home affairs adviser MA Matin and labour adviser Anwarul Iqbal at their respective offices. After her meeting, a press statement issued by the American Centre said that the US supported the chief adviser's announcement on holding the ninth parliamentary polls in the third week of December. bdn
