 MADRID, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid have signed Argentine centre-back Ezequiel Garay from Racing Santander, club president Ramon Calderon confirmed on Monday. "We've signed Garay," Calderon told reporters during Real's celebrations of their 31st league title with city authorities in Madrid. "I don't know if he will come to the club this season or next, but we have signed a contract. He is a young player and the signing is proof of our desire to create a young, committed team full of enthusiasm and ambition." The 21-year-old Argentine, who is recovering from a knee injury, is reported to have cost Real in the region of 10 million euros ($15.60 million). He has caught the eye at Racing since joining the Primera Liga side from Newell's Old Boys in the 2005-06 season and has made a name for himself as a pacy, confident defender with a devastating shot from free kicks and penalties. Garay, who may remain on loan at Racing for another season, was linked with a possible move to Barcelona earlier this year
