 LONDON, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum perished in the nineties for the second Lord's test in a row on Thursday after reviving his team's fortunes on the opening day of the first test against England. McCullum batted with increasing authority to reach 97 from as many balls, adding 99 with Jacob Oram (23 not out) for the sixth wicket, after New Zealand had been reduced to 104 for five. When bad light stopped play early after the first session had been lost to rain, New Zealand had taken their score to a more competitive 208 for six. McCullum was only one boundary from his third test century and his first against England when he was unexpectedly bowled by Monty Panesar. Four years ago, batting at number three after the order had been reshuffled, he scored 96 in the Kiwis' second innings at the same venue. An explosive one-day cricketer and acrobatic wicketkeeper, McCullum fully justified his promotion from seven to five following another feeble performance by the inexperienced top order. He rode his luck after a series of airy waves outside the off-stump to reach his ninth test half-century from 65 balls with eight boundaries while Oram played the anchor role at the other end. McCullum unveiled his best stroke of the day with an imperious cover-drive for four off Ryan Sidebottom before smacking the England left-arm paceman to long-off for another boundary and whipping Stuart Broad to the mid-wicket boundary. He struck a four and six off Panesar before lofting Stuart Broad for a another six over long-off. Left-arm spinner Panesar, who had had several lbw shouts turned down, took his revenge when an attempted drive deviated off McCullum's pads on to the stumps. ANDERSON STRIKES Michael Vaughan, eager to expose the inexperienced New Zealand top order, opted to field after winning the toss. His decision was vindicated in James Anderson's opening over when Aaron Redmond was dismissed without scoring, guiding a full-pitched delivery at comfortable height and pace to Alastair Cook at third slip. His five-ball duck in his debut test contrasted starkly with his father Rodney's 107 and 56 in his solitary test. Jamie How (7) also fell to Anderson, edging a full delivery to wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose and Ross Taylor slashed a frenetic 19 from 20 deliveries before skying a rash hook off Broad to Paul Collingwood at second slip. Taylor also did his best to gift England another wicket when he set off for an impossible single. James Marshall had given up all hope of making the striker's end but received a let-off when Anderson missed a shy at the stumps. Marshall, who had been caught behind off an Anderson no-ball, grafted his way to 24 from 104 minutes, before he too proved fallible outside the off-stump, edging Broad to Andrew Strauss at first slip. Daniel Flynn, New Zealand's other debutant, was bowled leg-stump by Anderson for nine. Anderson was the most successful of the bowlers with three for 42. Sidebottom, England's top bowler over the past year, struggled with his line and finished with none for 50
