 COBHAM, England, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea will go into next week's Champions League final against Manchester United in good spirits despite losing out to their rivals for the Premier League title, France forward Florent Malouda said on Wednesday. "We have the players to overcome the Premier League disappointment We have the potential (to win), we are optimistic for this final", Malouda said after their first training session since Sunday's Premier League finale. Chelsea missed out on the domestic title after finishing just two points behind United, but Malouda said the players had quickly switched their focus to next Wednesday's final. "What makes the difference is to concentrate, to give the best we can for this match," added Chelsea's 13 million pounds ($27 million) signing from Olympique Lyon. He said United had been worthy Premier League champions but Chelsea were now determined to make up for the setback by lifting the Champions League trophy in Moscow. "I think they (United) deserved to be in the final, they deserved to win the Premiership but for this match we have more things to say," said the 27-year-old. His France team mate Nicolas Anelka, who joined Chelsea from Bolton Wanderers in January for 15 million pounds ($29.30 million, said he was ready to make an impact in the final despite scoring only twice in 23 appearances for the club. "I hope he will let me play but it's up to the coach (Avram Grant) to take the decision", said the 29-year-old who has rarely played in his favourite central striking role. "I've played on the left and on the right. It's not my position really but it took me a long time to join a big club like this (again)," added Anelka, who has also played for Fenerbahce, Manchester City, Arsenal and Real Madrid
