 BEICHUAN, China, Sun May 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China said it would start three days of national mourning on Monday after raising the death toll from last week's earthquake to nearly 32,500. Hundreds of aftershocks have rattled Sichuan province following the devastating 7.9 magnitude quake, and police tried to stop people from entering the area amid concerns the tremors could bring down more unstable buildings and rupture already leaky dams. Compounding their worries are rivers blocked by landslides. Xinhua state news agency said the most dangerous build up of water was only about 2 miles upstream from Beichuan town where rescue workers were still searching for survivors. Six days after the main quake hit, the overall death toll stands at nearly 32,500, Xinhua said, and 220,000 more injured. Early on Sunday, a 5.7 magnitude tremor caused thousands to flee swaying buildings in the provincial capital, Chengdu, some 125 miles south of the latest aftershock's epicenter. Xinhua said there had been no reports of casualties, but roads had been seriously damaged. France said it had sent a plane carrying 380,000 euros ($588,000) worth of aid. Herve Ladsous, French ambassador to China, had arrived from Beijing to ensure that local authorities received the aid, which includes medicines, blankets, tents and water tanks. The Chinese military moved to quell concerns over the safety of its nuclear facilities, including the main nuclear weapons research lab, close to the affected zone. "I could say in a responsible manner that all these facilities are safe and secure," Ma Jian, a senior People's Liberation Army officer, told a news conference in Beijing. "There is no problem at all." China will observe three days of national mourning from Monday, with flags flying at half mast, public entertainment suspended and a three-minute silence to mark exactly one week since the quake, the government website www.gov.cn said State TV said the Olympic torch relay through China would also be suspended for three days. RELATIVES DESPERATE In Beichuan, hard hit by the quake and which many people fled on Saturday following warnings a dam may collapse, worried relatives quarreled with police who tried to prevent them entering the area, citing safety reasons. "I've traveled all this way, and I don't know where my father is," said Chen Shiquan, who had come back from work in the neighboring province of Qinghai to look for this father, Chen Xiaoqu. "To let me get this far and then not let me in is too cruel," he added. Thousands of people have fled the Beichuan area amid fears a lake could burst its banks, hampering rescue efforts after the deadliest earthquake in more than three decades. At least three lakes, formed after rocks blocked a river, had burst their banks but caused no casualties. Officials were monitoring 21 cases where landslides had dammed rivers, Xinhua reported. Fu Xingyue, looking for his daughter who was supposed to turn 6 the day after the quake happened, brushed off safety concerns. "I don't think the dam is a big threat, and anyway, there's nothing I can do. I have to keep searching," said Fu, who works as a truck driver and has spent days desperately searching though rubble and shouting out his daughter's name. Rescue work involving some 110,000 soldiers has also been complicated by bad weather and treacherous terrain. Yet still more victims were pulled alive from the rubble. On Sunday morning, rescuers pulled a man out of a collapsed hospital in Beichuan, but had to amputate his legs first, it said. "The survivor, in sober mind, was carefully carried out by firefighters amid strong applause," the agency added. Some 10,000 people are thought to be still trapped under the rubble, but most are feared dead. Dozens of schools collapsed in the area, crushing to death thousands of children taking classes at the time. Officials pulled out more bodies from the wreckage of the local primary school in Beichuan on Sunday. Forty-one corpses were laid out in front of the school. A strong smell of ammonia and incense hung over the town, which was littered with massive boulders from a nearby mountain slope. All of the buildings in the town were either destroyed or appeared beyond repair. China's Health Ministry said on Sunday there had been no disease outbreaks so far. Offers of help have flooded in and rescue teams with sniffer dogs and specialized equipment from Japan, Russia, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States and Singapore are assisting. Donations from home and abroad have topped 6 billion yuan ($858 million). Statistics from past earthquakes show some victims have survived up to nearly a fortnight under rubble. Yet Fujiya Koji, head of the Japanese rescue team in Sichuan, conceded: "Generally by this stage the likelihood of survival is low. They say they have been finding some in Beichuan and we'll certainly keep trying." China has said it expects the final death toll from the earthquake to exceed 50,000. About 4.8 million people have lost their homes
