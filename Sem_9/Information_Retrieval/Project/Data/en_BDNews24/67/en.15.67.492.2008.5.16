 Khulna, May 16 (bdnews24.com) Khulna University students have put up barricades since 9 am Friday morning on the Khulna-Satkhira motorway protesting assault of KU students by transport workers and demanding punishment of the offenders. Despite requests from the police, the KU students didn't lift the blockades till 12:30 pm. As bdnews24.com correspondent reached the spot in the morning, he found over two hundred students guarding the roadblocks they'd put up on the motorway in front of the university. They said, they'd not lift the blockade until the offenders were punished. SM Atiar Rahman, KU public relations officer said, as the university was closed for summer vacation, four Chittagong bound students went Thursday night at 10 pm to the ticket counter of Hanif Poribahan at Sonadanga bus stand in town to board their bus from there. But trouble started as the bus staff refused to load the students' personal computers and accompanying equipment on to the bus, which led to an altercation between the parties and the transport workers took the students' bus tickets away forcibly and the bus left Khulna without taking the students, the KU PRO said. He said, the helpless students then phoned their friends at the KU and conveyed the matter to them. Students from KU rushed to the bus stand at night and after some altercations again with the staff of Hanif Poribahan, they vandalised the sales counter there. At that, the transport workers at the depot got together and resisted the rioting students. They chased and assaulted each other by throwing brickbats at around 12:30 am and continued for long time. At 3 am, the local police arrived and brought the situation under control. The agitating students lit fires in the middle of the motorway and continued with their demonstrations, bdnews24.com correspondent said. bdnews24
