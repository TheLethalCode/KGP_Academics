<TITLE> Petraeus faces Senate on Central Command job </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Army Gen. David Petraeus, praised for curbing violence in Iraq, seeks to persuade senators on Thursday he can handle the task of heading the US military in the entire Middle East and beyond. Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan are all likely to feature as senators consider Petraeus' nomination to run US Central Command, the headquarters responsible for an unstable swath of the world that includes the Middle East, Central Asia and East Africa. Petraeus has been credited with pulling Iraq from the brink of all-out civil war since he took over as the top commander there in February 2007 and pursued a strategy that added more troops and got them off big bases and out protecting Iraqis. Although factors such as a cease-fire by Shia militiamen and Sunni tribes' rejection of al Qaeda also played a major role in cutting violence, the change in Iraq has added to Petraeus' reputation as the US military's brightest star. Senators on the Armed Services Committee will want to hear his views on the broader region as they question him and his designated successor for the Iraq command, Army Lt. Gen Ray Odierno, a former No. 2 to Petraeus in Baghdad. "One of the things he has to prove himself on is that he's going to open the aperture, that he's going to widen his scope and that he's going to put as much attention into the new responsibilities that now fall within his purview," said analyst Michele Flournoy of the Center for a New American Security. IRAN QUESTIONS Petraeus has accused Iran of training Iraqi Shia militant groups and supplying them with weapons to attack and kill US troops. But he has avoided saying whether he favors direct US military action inside Iran. In the face of persistent speculation the Bush administration may go to war with Iran and US allegations that Iranian small boats have harassed US Navy vessels in the Gulf, he is likely to be pressed on that point on Thursday. The last Central Command chief, Adm. William Fallon, stepped down in March after a magazine article portrayed him as trying to stop the United States from going to war with Iran. Petraeus has become closely identified with the Bush administration's Iraq policy, now characterized by a large troop presence and a cautious approach to withdrawals. Democrats, who want rapid troop cuts in Iraq, may seek assurances he is willing to consider other courses of action if ordered to do so by the next president. "Petraeus is a very thoughtful guy. He's not the sort of person who sees only one side to an issue," said Stephen Biddle, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who has advised the general in Iraq. "He has his views. But if presented with an alternative position, I suspect he would make a counter-argument if he thought it was appropriate, and then at the end of the day, either salute and execute or resign." Democrats have argued the Bush administration's focus on Iraq has distracted the United States from the war in Afghanistan, where violence is on the rise. They are likely to press Petraeus for his views on that war and on Pakistan, where al Qaeda has been able to regain strength in lawless tribal areas, according to US officials. The two generals' nominations must be approved by both the Armed Services Committee and the full Senate before they can take effect. The Pentagon has said it does not foresee any problems with the confirmation process
