<TITLE> Pakistan not bound to take back 'Biharis': top diplomat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Alamgir Babar, the Pakistan high commissioner for Bangladesh, Monday reaffirmed his country's view that they are not legally bound to take back large numbers of disputed Pakistani nationals living in the country. The high commissioner told reporters at a meeting at the National Press Club that most of the stranded Pakistanis, locally known as Biharis, remained reluctant to be resettled back in Pakistan. "In 1974 there was an agreement signed by both Pakistan and Bangladesh. In that agreement, certain criteria were laid down for relocation," said Babar. "Everybody who met the criteria was relocated with the involvement of the Bangladesh government and the international community." "As far as legal obligations under part of Pakistan, those have been fulfilled. Nonetheless we continue to regard this (repatriation) as a humanitarian issue," said the high commissioner," he said Babar pointed to a survey by some international organisations that he claimed showed most of those left in the political no-man's-land did not wish to go to Pakistan. "I doubt how many of them will willingly go," he said. Many Biharis, however, claim to be Pakistani even though they have never visited their stated homeland. The Biharis arrived in Bangladesh (former East Pakistan) from India in 1947, when partition divided the Indian sub-continent into India and Pakistan following the withdrawal of Britain. At that time, an influx of Muslim Biharis arrived in East Pakistan, but it was only following Bangladeshi independence in 1971 that their status became uncertain. The plight of the Biharis was further confused by their role in the Bangladesh Liberation War, when many sided with the Pakistan army. The newly formed Bangladesh subsequently refused to recognise them as citizens, following which many demanded to be resettled in Pakistan. A great number of these stateless individuals live in slum conditions as political wrangling continues to leave their status unresolved. On a separate issue, the high commissioner said Bangladesh-Pakistan bilateral trade was falling short of expectations due to a lack of mutual understanding. "We set a target of $1 billion in trade...but this has not been achieved. There continues to be a lack of awareness on both sides," Babar said. The Pakistan envoy, however, said the situation was improving with increasing numbers of Pakistani businessmen coming to Bangladesh. The volume of Bangladesh-Pakistan bilateral trade is nearly $340, with the balance of trade in Pakistan's favour. "To reduce the trade imbalance, Pakistan has allowed Bangladesh to export jute duty free. Besides, we have allowed 15,000 tonnes of Bangladeshi tea in duty free," Babar told bdnews24.com. "Seventy-five percent of Bangladeshi export items from Pakistan are raw materials for ready made garments. The value addition is done in Bangladesh. "The benefit of the raw materials is going to Bangladesh," he said. The high commissioner said a lack of shipping service between Bangladesh and Pakistan remained one of the main causes hampering trade between the nations. "The two countries should settle the shipping problems," he said. Diplomatic Correspondents' Association of Bangladesh (DCAB) organised the dialogue. bdn
