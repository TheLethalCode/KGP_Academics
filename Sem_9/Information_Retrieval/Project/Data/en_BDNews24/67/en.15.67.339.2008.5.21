 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal urged Awami League Wednesday to participate in the forthcoming dialogue with the government and help in electing a democratic government in December to save the nation from its present uncertainties. "We are sceptical about the outcome of the dialogue, and we don't quite trust everybody there, but we're going to attend the talks," said JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu after a meeting at the residence of acting AL president Zillur Rahman. "But I'm afraid the dialogue will not be successful if Awami League and all other political parties do not join in the process." The JSD president stressed: "We should all participate in the reform dialogue, as this is the last straw for us to catch and make good use of, if we really want the polls to take place in December, to elect a democratic government and end the current political stalemate." "We, therefore, urged Awami League to join the talks." After the morning's hour-long meeting between the two parties, Zillur Rahman told the press: "We've had crucially important discussions with JSD over the current political situation. We haven't yet decided if we'll attend the dialogue in the end, though JSD will attend the talks, they said." The chief adviser's most recent address had disappointed the nation, he said. "Therefore, we're in doubts as to what extent the dialogue would be successful. JSD also considers that the talks might not bear the desired outcome in the absence of Sheikh Hasina." "Differentiating between political parties by calling them 'small' or 'big' is insulting and will give rise to disparities. No one in the political arena should be described as big or small; every party has a manifesto," said Zillur Rahman, slating an adviser's recent comment to this effect. He said the hunger strike programme observed by his party and its supporters countrywide pressed home its six-point demand including the release of Sheikh Hasina. Zillur claimed that even members of Jamaat-e-Islami observed the token hunger strike on Tuesday in solidarity with AL. When reporters asked him if the AL would be launching any movement jointly with Jamaat-e-Islami, he said there was no such possibility at all. When reporters asked JSD president Inu if they will discuss Sheikh Hasina's release with the government in dialogue he avoided the question, responding: "We are optimistic that the government will do something about paving the way for Sheikh Hasina to join the dialogue." The AL-JSD meeting was attended by senior party leaders. bdnews2
