 HARARE, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe told police on Wednesday to ignore opposition accusations they are behind political intimidation and blamed his foes for violence ahead of a presidential election run-off. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change said police had arrested two party officials elected to parliament in March when Mugabe's ZANU-PF party lost its majority for the first time since independence. Official results showed MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also beat Mugabe in the first presidential vote on March 29 but fell short of the absolute majority required to avoid a run-off on June 27. The opposition maintains Tsvangirai won outright. Speaking at a ceremony to confer ranks on senior police officials in Harare, Mugabe said the MDC was on an "evil crusade" to divide the people of Zimbabwe. "The Zimbabwe Republic Police and all security agencies should not shudder because of the barrage of false and orchestrated criticism by the opposition...," Mugabe said. "The MDC opposition, formed at the behest of Britain in 1999, is on an evil crusade of dividing our people on political lines as they continue to fan and sponsor heinous acts of political violence targeting innocent citizens," said Mugabe, who dismisses his opponents as stooges of the West. The veteran leader, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, says the MDC enjoys the backing of Western powers out to oust him over his seizure of white-owned farms to give to landless blacks. The MDC denies the charge. On Wednesday, the opposition said newly-elected legislators Ian Kay and Amos Chibaya had been arrested in what it called "an onslaught on key party activists and leaders to render it comatose ahead of the runoff." "The charges against Chibaya are that he addressed a rally two weeks ago where he sought to incite junior police officers to rebel. The charges against Kay are unclear," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa told Reuters. At least six MDC lawmakers have been arrested since the combined March presidential parliament and council vote, and the opposition says 43 of its members have been killed by militias loyal to Mugabe. The International Crisis Group said on Wednesday there was danger of a coup by military hardliners to prevent Tsvangirai from toppling Mugabe, and called for African mediation leading to a national unity government led by the opposition leader. Zimbabweans hope next month's run-off will arrest a downward economic spiral that has saddled them with 165,000 percent inflation, 80 percent unemployment, chronic food and fuel shortages and has sent millions fleeing to nearby countries.
