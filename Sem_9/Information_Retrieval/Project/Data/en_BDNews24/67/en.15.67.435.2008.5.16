<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 16 (bdnews24.com)The disappointment of Chittagong consumers deepens by the day, a mismatch in their incomes and expenditures clearly evident due to the continuing spiral of commodity prices. In the retail markets in Chittagong, prices of all commodities, except rice, have increased. As the newly harvested rice started arriving in the market, retail prices went down by Tk 1 to Tk 2 per kg. Buyers, however, were rather averse to buying the 'new' rice. The price of old rice remains unchanged. On the other hand, soybean oil, sugar and flour are selling at the same prices as they did last week. A visit to the retail markets in the city Friday revealed that the new paijam rice was selling at Tk 38-Tk 39 per kg, local beti at Tk 31, miniket at Tk 34, pari (boiled) at Tk 35 and coarse (boiled) at Tk 32 per kg. On the other hand, old Indian beti was selling at Tk 34 a kg, Burmese beti at Tk 29, miniket at Tk 37, miniket (boiled) at Tk 36, paijam (boiled) at Tk 40, paijam at Tk 39 and jira (boiled) Tk 42 per kg. Rice retailer Abdur Razzak at Reazuddin Bazar told bdnews24.com that the prices went down a little as newly harvested rice started arriving in the market. The buyers, however, prefer buying old varieties of rice. He said rice prices might go down further if the supply of new rice varieties increased. None of the rice varietiesboiled or nearly-boiledwould go any lower than Tk 30 a kg. Although the government had fixed the prices of edible oil, there was no control in the market. Seven days ago, a kg of loose soybean sold for Tk 110. A kg of 'super soybean' was then selling for Tk 106-Tk 107. A service holder Ahmed Raihan, who came to the kitchen market at Reazuddin Bazar, told bdnews24.com: "If you have to buy things in the market, you must come carrying unlimited money." "Only those who have lots of money would be able to shop. It is not possible for people like us these days to make both ends meet in any manner using our meagre limited incomes." On the retail market, a kg of sugar was selling for Tk 35 and a kg of flour of different brands for Tk 40 to Tk 42. bdnews24
