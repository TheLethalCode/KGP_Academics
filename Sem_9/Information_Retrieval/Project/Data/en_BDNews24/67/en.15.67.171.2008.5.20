 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court sent former minister MK Anwar to jail Tuesday after he surrendered as an accused in the GATCO graft case. Anwar was ordered to jail minutes after he entered the court to give himself up. Anwar's lawyer Masud Ahmed Talukder had earlier submitted a surrender appeal on his behalf to the court of senior special judge Md Azizul Hoque. The development came following the issue arrest warrant against 12 fugitives in the GATCO case, and the High Court's rejection of bail petitions by three former ministers including Anwar. Former ministers Motiur Rahman Nizami, M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam and Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury were also among the 12 named. Following the court order Mannan Bhuiyan and M Shamsul Islam surrendered to the court on Sunday, while police arrested Nizami at his house the same day. The police also raided MK Anwar's house on the day, but failed to arrest him as he was not present. He has been fugitive since. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 people alleging that GATCO's contract to run a container depot at Chittagong Port was illegally awarded. The ACC later submitted a chargesheet against 25 people in total, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia. bdnews24.com/
