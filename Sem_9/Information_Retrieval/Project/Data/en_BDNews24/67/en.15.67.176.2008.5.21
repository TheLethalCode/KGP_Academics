 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced Sonali Bank CBA leader BM Bakir to 13 years in jail on twin charges of hiding information about wealth and amassing assets by illegal means. In a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission, Bakir will also have to serve one more year in prison in failure to pay Tk 10 lakh in fine, slapped by special judge Md Firoz Alam. The Special Judge's Court-1 also jailed Bakir's wife Nazma Hossain for three years for abetting her husband in acts of corruption. Nazma will have to serve one more month behind bars if she fails to pay a fine of Tk 1 lakh. According to the sentencing, the CBA leader will serve a maximum of 10 years as the two terms of punishment will run concurrently. Bakir is behind bars, but his wife is on the run. Md Jahangir Alam, an assistant director of the ACC, filed the case with Motijheel Police Station on May 30 last year. The case alleged that Bakir had amassed Tk 1.51 crore and concealed information about it in a wealth statement submitted to the ACC last year. The country's official graft watchdog released a list of 50 people, including politicians and businessmen; and Bakir was on the list. Bakir faces a second case on tax dodge, but its trial is on hold because of a High Court stay order. bd
