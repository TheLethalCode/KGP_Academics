<TITLE> Austria keen to avoid Euro 2008 embarrassment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ask most Austrian fans what they think of their team's Euro 2008 chances and you are likely to hear the German language equivalent of 'zilch'. As they prepare to co-host the June tournament with neighbouring Switzerland, there is little sense of euphoria in a country much better known for its success on the ski slopes. Several local polls suggest interest in the tournament remains unusually low and the recent fortunes of the national team have clearly played a part in the general feeling of gloom. Austria has, however, managed to punch above its weight in the past. The country has qualified seven times for the World Cup and coach Josef Hickersberger was in the highly-talented side that upset Germany during the 1978 World Cup. But 'Hicke' does not have the likes of former greats Toni Polster, Andreas Herzog, Hans Krankl and Bruno Pezzey and results in the run-up to the finals have been worrying. Austria can point to just one win in their past 14 matches and even that came against an Ivory Coast side reduced to 10 men for the final 30 minutes. One group of supporters even launched a petition calling on the team to withdraw and make way for a more attractive side. Home advantage has of course been an influential factor at major tournaments and Belgium are the only European Championship hosts not to have got beyond the group stage. Having seen their team handed a tough draw against Germany, Poland and Croatia in Group B, most Austrians seem to think the Belgians will not be alone for long. Looking on the positive side, not all Austria's performances have been as hopeless as the statistics might suggest. They were by far the better team in a goalless first half against Germany in a February friendly, although Joachim Loew's men stepped up their game to win 3-0 after the break. A shock win over the Netherlands in their last big test before Euro 2008 seemed on the cards after Hickersberger's men took a 3-0 lead in the opening 35 minutes but once again they failed to maintain their strong start and lost 4-3. Nevertheless, there is an argument that any team putting three goals past the Dutch cannot be totally useless. Austria's improvement, at least over the first 45 minutes, suggest Hickersberger's stubborn decision to concentrate on young players is perhaps slowly being rewarded. Veli Kavlak, Sebastian Proedl, Erwin Hoffer and Martin Harnik have all stepped up to the senior team since helping restore some national pride with a run to the semi-finals of last year's under-20 World Cup in Canada. There are also plenty of solid, experienced players in the side including team captain Andreas Ivanschitz, goalkeepers Alex Manninger and Juergen Macho and defenders Martin Stranzl and Emanuel Pogatetz, the latter back in the side after patching up his much-publicised differences with Hickersberger. A shortage of truly creative players and an apparent problem with scoring goals could be the team's ultimate undoing however. In the 14 games under Hickersberger, Austria have scored just 10 times with all but two of those goals coming from the midfield or defence. Given the worrying build-up to Euro 2008, a place in the quarter-finals would be a major achievement although many fans will simply be hoping their team avoids humiliation
