 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  Footballers outside the national team are very much worried over the reported "gentleman's agreement" among the professional clubs ahead of the upcoming B. League. Their anxiety came Monday while they met the reporters in an informal discussion at the central playground of the Dhaka University. All the clubs except the Brothers Union had a meeting on Saturday to come with a verbal agreement that each of the big names will select seven of their own players who will not be targeted by rival clubs. For the smaller teams, the number would be five. The footballers contemplate meeting Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president Kazi Salahuddin in a couple of days to tell him about their anxiety. "Something happened-- whether it was a gentleman's agreement or not. We will be financially affected heavily if the clubs are going to rope in players with the reported agreement among them," said former national striker Alfaz Ahmed. Muktijoddha Sangsad player, Ahmed, alleged that most of the footballers haven't even got their full payments from the clubs last season and they also almost sat out for a season with no football in the field. Meanwhile, fearing underpayment due to the agreement, the national footballers, who are gearing up for next month's SAFF Championship in Colombo and the Maldives, also skipped Sunday's morning session training, but they returned to action in the afternoon after the interference of the officials of the BFF. Jewel Rana, former national defender, said that they had faced such agreement and pool system in the past and saw some of good players fail to secure a place in the team. Jewel questioned why the footballers would always have to fight against such odds as football is cake and butter for them. The veteran defender also said that he had retired from the national team in 1999 to skip from the pool system. Amit Khan Shuvro, a defender of Brothers Union, alleged that most of Brothers Union players got only 30 percent of their contracted payments in the last season. He expressed his anxiety over the low payment this time if the clubs walk their own way. The footballers are also deeply thinking of refraining from the player transfers to avert the underpayment. Firoz Ahmed Titu, Mohammad Sujan and Jonny were among others present on the occasion.
