 MANCHESTER, England, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Losing the Champions League final with Monaco in 2004 is a malaise Patrice Evra said on Friday he hoped to cure with a Manchester United victory. Evra also wants United to beat Chelsea in the Moscow final on Wednesday to reward long-serving manager Alex Ferguson, whose sole success in the competition from his 21 years at Old Trafford came nine years ago. "Since I lost the final it's been in my mind every day," France international defender Evra told reporters. "That's why, when I signed for Manchester United, I said in my first interview I just want to play in the Champions League and win to cancel this bad memory with Monaco. "It's my second final but I can't just play this game. I need to win this game." The 27-year-old added: "It's very important for Manchester United because it's a long time since 1999. "And for Alex Ferguson. It's just his second final in the Champions League and I think a manager like that deserves to win it more than once. "This is why I hope that everyone gets the present for him, out of respect for what he has done for Manchester United." ENGLISH FAN Evra took several months to settle into English football after his January 2006 move from Monaco, with whom he lost the 2004 final in Gelsenkirchen 3-0 to Porto. But the left-back has been one of United's outstanding performers in helping them to retain the Premier League title this season and is now a big fan of the English game. "When I came here a lot of people told me football in England is just 'kick the ball away' but now I just laugh because the football is the best in the world," Evra said. "To have four teams in the quarter-finals (of the Champions League) is unbelievable and I think you have to congratulate all of English football, for Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. "I feel like I started another job when I came to this country. I got to the final with Monaco but when you come to England you see the fans, the intensity of the game, and every team is physically strong. "For me playing football in England is the best football in this world and now I hope Manchester United and Chelsea show that in the final of the Champions League. "I think the team that wins the Champions League will be the team that plays with the most fighting spirit and I hope we show that we have more character than Chelsea to win the Champions League.
