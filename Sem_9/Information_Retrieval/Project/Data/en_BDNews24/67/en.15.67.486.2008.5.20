 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League staged hunger strikes across the country Tuesday to press home a six point demand including the release of party president Sheikh Hasina. AL and its front organisations began the daylong programme around 10 am in districts and upazilas, excluding the capital, following the party's declaration on May 14. Central leaders of the party participated in programmes in areas surrounding Dhaka city. Addressing party leaders and workers at the local chapter office in Gazipur town Tuesday, AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said: "There will be more programmes in future for the release of Sheikh Hasina." He urged the party leaders and supporters to make the movements a success, saying: "The AL leadership will not make any mistake while taking decisions in the interests of the party and Sheikh Hasina." The six-point demands include making arrangements for releasing Hasina to take part in dialogue with the government, sending her abroad for better medical treatment, withdrawal of the state of emergency and lifting all conditions imposed on indoor politics. The party also wants withdrawal of all charges against political leaders, release of detained leaders, no further interference with the media, announcing the electoral schedule, suspending the redrawing of constituencies, trial of war criminals and disallowing them to contest the elections. Amu asked the party leaders and supporters to be cautious. Referring to a statement by Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami seeking Hasina's and Khaleda Zia's release, Amu warned: "We will have to remain alert so that we do not fall into any trap." "We do not want to return to 1991. We have to remain cautious so that none can make their activities valid using our name for their own ends." AL organising secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury inaugurated the hunger strike at Trishal upazila in Mymensingh in the morning. Local AL leaders of Narayanganj, Narshingdi, Patuakhali and Sherpur said they were observed programmes at their party offices. Party members in other districts countrywide also observed the programme. bdnews24.com/c
