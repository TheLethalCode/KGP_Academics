 BERLIN, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayer Leverkusen have sacked coach Michael Skibbe after the Bundesliga side finished seventh and failed to qualify for the UEFA Cup, the club said on Wednesday. Leverkusen won only one of their last six Bundesliga matches of the season. They were still in fourth before last weekend's final round but lost 1-0 to second-placed Werder Bremen and were overtaken by Hamburg SV, VfL Wolfsburg and VfB Stuttgart. "Because of recent Bundesliga results and the failure to achieve the season's goal of reaching the UEFA Cup we have decided to part with Michael Skibbe with immediate effect," managing director Wolfgang Holzhaeuser said on the club's web site (www.bayer04.de). "We long wrestled with the decision in many meetings because Michael Skibbe did a very good job overall during his tenure," he added. "But there was much that argued for a fresh start with a new coach for next season." Skibbe took charge of the side in October 2005 and his contract was due to end in June 2009. The 42-year-old from Gelsenkirchen was deputy to Germany coach Rudi Voeller from 2000 to June 2004, helping the national side to the 2002 World Cup final, where they lost to Brazil. Skibbe is the second Bundesliga coaching casualty after the end of the season. Thomas Doll resigned as coach of Borussia Dortmund on Monday after the 1997 Champions League winners finished in 13th spot
