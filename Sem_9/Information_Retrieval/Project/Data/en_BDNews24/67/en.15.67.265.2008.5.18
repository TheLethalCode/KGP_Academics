<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com) - Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed said Sunday that the government was pushing the election into uncertainty. Speaking at a press conference at Jamaat's central office in Moghbazar, the former minister referred to the GATCO case against Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and rejection of a bail appeal by the High Court. "In the GATCO case we appealed to the High Court for bail to our leader. The court has rejected it," Mojaheed said. Later the Appellate Division accepted the counter-appeal and fixed May 20 for a hearing. "Our lawyer says it will not be proper to arrest or harass him in the interim period," he said. Mojaheed announced fasting for May 22-23 and two-day distribution of food among orphans across the country starting on May 24. Mojaheed said: "The programme has been announced to seek Allah's help to save the country from repression and conspiracy and to establish Islam." Replying to a question, the Jamaat leader said the GATCO case was "false and conspiratorial". "Withdrawal of all cases and the release of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia can create an atmosphere for dialogue. Without these, dialogue won't be successful." On whether his party will participate in dialogue he said any decision would be taken in consultation with other partners of the alliance. Jamaat leaders Delwar Hossain Saidee, Md Qamaruzzaman, Azharul Islam and other senior leaders were present at the press conference. bdnew
