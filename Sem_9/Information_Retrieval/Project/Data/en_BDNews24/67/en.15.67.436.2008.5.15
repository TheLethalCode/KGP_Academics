 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)An anticorruption taskforce has launched a drive to find out corruption and irregularities of Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, an official said Thursday. A team led by Lieutenant Colonel Monirul Islam held a meeting with BTTB chairman Ashraful Alim at the BTTB headquarters. After the meeting, Alim told bdnews24.com that the taskforce would identify "faults" in various departments and regional offices of the BTTB. "The taskforce will give us necessary instructions. Taskforce members will help us in the process of turning BTTB into a public limited company," he said. A team of the Anticorruption Commission has also been working along with the taskforce. "I hope it will benefit us," the BTTB chairman said. The taskforce in a statement said the taskforce started work in efforts to make BTTB more effective and service-oriented by speeding up work and enhancing efficiency of its employees. The taskforce will also dig into alleged corruption and irregularities in all levels of BTTB from the central office to upazila level. The taskforce will give instructions on technical matters to implement various BTTB projects undertaken to modernise the state-run telephone company. It will also give a set of recommendations to get rid of irregularities and corruption, and ensure transparency in implementing projects, enhance customer services and efficiency and prepare bills, the statement said. Lieutenant colonel Monirul Islam told reporters that BTTB's billing system was "very week". "It should be improved. The quality of services must be enhanced. Overall BTTB activities have to be intensified." He said steps would be taken to enhance efficiency of the employees. Major Shafiul Azam Parvez of the taskforce said a temporary office would be set up inside the BTTB office. Lieutenant Monirul Islam would coordinate the taskforce efforts. Six teams would work in the BTTB: four from the National Coordination Committee (which deals with serious crimes and corruption), one from the ACC and the sixth from the National Board of Revenue. bdnews
