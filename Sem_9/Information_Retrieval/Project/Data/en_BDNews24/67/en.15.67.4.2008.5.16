 MADRID, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of the final round of matches this weekend: Real Madrid's final match of the season is in doubt as players from cash-strapped Levante have announced they will strike unless they are paid money owed to them dating back to last season. The players have said they are owed 18 million euros ($27.8 million) and will only play if given an immediate guarantee they will receive 13 million. Real Madrid skipper Raul has accepted that he will not be included in the Spain squad for Euro 2008. "My next objective is to rest up and then prepare myself for next season," the striker was quoted as saying in the Spanish media on Friday. Spanish media report that Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o will join Deco in leaving the club in the close season. Tottenham Hotspur and Inter Milan are both reported to be interested in signing the former African Player of the Year, who is said to have a price tag of around 40 million euros. Atletico Madrid could still finish in third place if they win away against Valencia on Sunday and Barcelona do not beat relegated Real Murcia. Barca have won just one of their last eight league matches. Racing Santander will qualify for Europe for the first time if they beat Osasuna at home on Sunday. Any one of Real Zaragoza, Osasuna, Recreativo Huelva and Valladolid could fill the final relegation berth and join Levante and Real Murcia in the second division next season. Zaragoza are away at Real Mallorca, Osasuna travel to Racing Santander and Recreativo are at home to Valladolid. Real Murcia coach Javier Clemente is expected to extend his contract for another two years despite the team's relegation. The former Spain coach took charge in early March when they were second from bottom in the Primera Liga, six points from safety. They remain in the same position in the table, but are now 12 points behind Real Zaragoza and 13 adrift of Osasuna, who are just above the drop zone. Getafe coach Michael Laudrup is expected to clarify his future at the club in the next few days. Spanish media have reported the former Danish international has told club president Angel Torres that he will leave at the end of the season. Getafe reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in their debut season in Europe and also reached the final of the King's Cup for the second year in succession. They are assured of survival in the top flight
