 Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt,May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush arrived in Egypt on Saturday for talks with Palestinian leaders who will be looking for signs they will not be neglected after he lavished praise on Israel during a visit to the Jewish state. In the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the final stop of his Middle East tour, Bush faces growing skepticism over his chances of securing an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal before he leaves office in January. Bush's visit to Israel to celebrate its 60th anniversary raised fresh doubts in the Arab world over his ability to act as an even-handed broker between Israel and the Palestinians. He hailed Israel as a "homeland for the chosen people" and pledged that Israelis could forever count on American support against enemies like Hamas and Iran. Palestinians were dismayed that Bush, in his speech to Israel's parliament on Thursday, made only one reference to their aspirations for a state of their own and did not use the occasion to press Israelis to make compromises. The White House denied Bush was ignoring the plight of the Palestinians, insisting he would address their concerns in his meeting on Saturday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. "What he will make clear is that the Palestinian people deserve a state," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe. Bush's trip to Egypt followed a stop in Riyadh where he met Saudi King Abdullah to appeal for help in easing record oil prices. Saudi Arabia announced that a modest increase in oil output was made last week but said any more supply would not ease prices at the pump for Americans. Bush meets Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Afghan President Hamid Karzai as well as Abbas on Saturday and will see Jordan's King Abdullah, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and Iraqi officials on Sunday at an international economic forum. PEACE PROCESS STALLED Bush's Middle East tour, his second this year, follows a US-hosted conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in November where Israeli and Palestinian leaders pledged to try to reach a peace agreement by the end of Bush's term. Since then, talks have bogged down over Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and violence in and around the Gaza Strip, where Hamas cross-border rocket fire has triggered a tough Israeli military response. Bush has voiced optimism that a deal can be reached as he tries to carve out a foreign policy legacy beyond the unpopular war in Iraq. Israelis gave Bush a hero's welcome this week, many seeing him as the best friend the Jewish state has ever had in the White House. Critics said Bush showed insensitivity by heaping praise on Israel on the day Palestinians annually mark what they call the "Nakba," or catastrophe, when some 700,000 Arabs fled or were forced from their homes during the war over Israel's creation. "He should have told the Israelis no one can be free at the expense of others," Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said. "He missed this opportunity and we are disappointed." As Bush visited Riyadh on Friday, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal told reporters: "What is required is equality in dealings ... and not selectiveness in dealings." Abbas will make his case for Bush to put more pressure on Israel. But he has little leverage and is weak at home, governing only in the West Bank while Hamas controls Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is also on the ropes, facing a corruption scandal that could force his resignation and possibly derail the peace process altogether
