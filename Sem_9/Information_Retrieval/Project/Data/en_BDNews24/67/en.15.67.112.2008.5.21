 NEW DELHI, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Doubles specialist Mahesh Bhupathi wants to dump estranged partner Leander Paes to boost his hopes of a medal at the Beijing Olympics, local media reported on Wednesday. A running feud between Bhupathi and Paes, in their 30s and winners of three grand slam doubles titles together, has left sports officials in the medal-starved nation frustrated.

Bhupathi has written to the federation seeking permission to partner Davis Cup team mate Rohan Bopanna in the August Games because Paes did not seem keen to play together in the build-up. "I reached out to Leander in different ways but I haven't received a response," the Hindustan Times quoted Bhupathi as saying in a letter to the All India Tennis Association (AITA). "I don't want to go to Beijing to make up the numbers. I would rather play with Rohan," he said. "We have played on a few occasions and we get along well." The Indian Olympic Association has asked Paes and Bhupathi to play together on the tour to boost their medal chances. The relationship between the duo worsened in February after Davis Cup team members threatened a boycott if Paes was not axed as captain before being persuaded to continue under him.

Paes won a singles bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic
