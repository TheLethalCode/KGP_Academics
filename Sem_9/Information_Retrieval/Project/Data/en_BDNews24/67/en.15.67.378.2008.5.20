 Taipei,May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan's new president took office on Tuesday with pledges to forge historic trade and transit ties with China, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory. Ma Ying-jeou, 57, the Nationalist Party (KMT) candidate and a former Taipei mayor, took over from Chen Shui-bian in a ceremony at the presidential palace, beginning a four-year term after his landslide election victory in March. The pair shook hands and walked, smiling, through a presidential office hallway rimmed with military officials and KMT leaders to an auditorium where the Taiwan flag and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, founder of modern China, hung in the background. Ma campaigned for the presidency on a platform focused on breathing new life into Taiwan's economy and pushing Beijing for trade ties and a peace accord. China has claimed Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's Communists won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's KMT Party fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan back under its control, by force if necessary. "It's a big day," said Joseph Cheng, a political science professor at City University of Hong Kong. "China will definitely be expressing hopes for a new beginning." In a speech later in the day, Ma is expected to offer peace to China, responding to recent conciliatory words from Chinese President Hu Jintao and suggesting that the two sides cooperate in international organizations, Taiwan newspapers said. China opposes Taiwan membership of the United Nations and other bodies that require statehood to join. Taiwan stocks have risen 5.3 percent over the past five sessions and the Taiwan dollar hit a two-week high in early trade against the U.S. currency on Tuesday as investors anticipated better economic prospects under Ma. "(Ma's) inauguration marks a new positive era for China-Taiwan relations," said Donald Straszheim, vice-chairman of Roth Capital in Los Angeles. "It represents a big plus for the Taiwan economy and is already being reflected in Taiwan stocks." Ma has pledged to launch direct weekend Taiwan-China flights by July and initially allow up to 3,000 Chinese tourists in per day. The flights will cut out time-consuming stop-overs in places like Hong Kong for Taiwan investors in China and ease the passage for tourists. China-listed shares of several Chinese airlines surged on Tuesday on hopes that Ma's inauguration could soon lead to direct commercial flights. China Eastern Airlines Corp rose 9 percent by midmorning while Shanghai Airlines Co was up more than 5 percent. Ma has also said he would make the Chinese yuan convertible with the Taiwan dollar, let Chinese buy Taiwan real estate and push for a common market. A peace accord with Beijing and better ties with staunch ally the United States are on Ma's political agenda. Ties with both frayed under Chen's hardline policies against China since 2000. "I think the inauguration means a big change for Taiwan," said Alexander Huang, professor of strategic studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan. "Ma Ying-jeou has a mandate to improve relations with China," Huang said. "He's going to use that mandate to change course from over the past eight years." Ma will hold events in Taipei and the southern city of Kaohsiung throughout the day on Tuesday. He is set to meet delegations from Japan, Singapore and the United States at the presidential office, local media said
