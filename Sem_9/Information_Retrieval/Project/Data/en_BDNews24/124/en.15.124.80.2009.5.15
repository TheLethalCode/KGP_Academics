 DURBAN, May 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Rajasthan Royals and the Bangalore Royal Challengers secured thrilling last over victories in their Indian Premier League (IPL) matches on Thursday. Bangalore edged out the Chennai Super Kings by two wickets with two balls to spare, while in the day's second match in Durban the Royals claimed three Mumbai Indians wickets in the final over to snatch a two-run victory with just one ball left.
