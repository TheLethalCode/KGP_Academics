 Chandpur, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  India will not build Tipaimukh embankment without sitting with Bangladesh, the water resources minister said on Friday. India has already proposed a meeting and the matter will be discussed prioritising national interests, Ramesh Chandra Sen added. "We are convinced about that. The rumour of construction of embankment there is not true," the minister said while inspecting river protection measures in the Beribandh area with the officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board. Primary and permanent steps will be taken to prevent the Meghna from eating into banks in Chandpur, he said about the river erosion there. "The situation would not have been so dire if the work of river protection was done in the last seven years as it had been during the previous rule of Awami League," he said. He inspected the situation in Chandpur Sadar and Himechar and urged the local people to have patience. bdnews2
