 LONDON, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's Premier League matches (all times GMT): Tottenham Hotspur defender Ledley King will be disciplined by the club following his arrest for an alleged assault outside a London night club last weekend. Manager Harry Redknapp did not say what the punishment would be but added King, who was released on bailed by police, would be in the team for Saturday's home game against Manchester City (1400). "Ledley will play tomorrowhe has apologised," Redknapp was quoted as saying on the BBC website (www.bbc.co.uk). "He knows he was wrong. He made a mistake and he has to learn from that and make sure it doesn't happen again. I've had a good chat with him." Aaron Lennon (groin), Darren Bent (knee) and Michael Dawson (ankle) are set to miss the match. Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand (calf) will miss Saturday's home game with Arsenal (1145). United need a point to clinch a record-equalling 18th English league title. If they avoid defeat against Arsenal, it will be the first time they have been crowned champions at Old Trafford since 1999. Arsenal's injury-plagued Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky completed his first full training session on Thursday after 16 months on the sidelines. However he is unlikely to play any part in Saturday's game. West Ham United manager Gianfranco Zola has praised Carlton Cole's attitude as the striker returned to full training following a groin injury. "He's not the kind of guy who makes noises to get himself noticed," Zola told the club's website (www.whufc.com). "If he plays he will give everything, if he doesn't, then he will know the reason why." Cole could make a return to the team for Saturday's game away to Everton (1400) after more than two months out. Aston Villa captain and Danish international defender Martin Laursen has announced his retirement due to ongoing knee troubles. His injuries have limited him to only 91 appearances since joining Villa from AC Milan in 2004. Villa play away to relegation-threatened Middlesbrough on Saturday (1400)
