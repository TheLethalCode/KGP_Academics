<TITLE> Ferguson wary of Arsenal spoiling Old Trafford party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alex Ferguson will happily win it anywhere but the prospect of sealing his 11th Premier League title as Manchester United manager at Old Trafford on Saturday is an added bonus. His side need just a draw against Arsenal to clinch a record-equalling 18th championship but Ferguson was not expecting an easy ride. "Arsenal will want to do well because they've had a bit of criticism recently," Ferguson told reporters. "They will want to register their abilities on a day when everyone expects United to win the title. They are a threat." Should United, who are on a seven-match winning streak in the league, avoid defeat it will mean the title was decided at Old Trafford for only the second time in Ferguson's glittering reign. Only in 1999, when they beat Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, have Ferguson's United been confirmed as champions on their home turf. "It's strange that we've won it four times on the last day of the season elsewhere," he said. "We've only done it once, in the 10 times we've won the trophy, at Old Trafford and we have got great fans and it'd be great for them. "I've never cared where we win it but on a day like tomorrow, when you have the opportunity, it'd be nice." Arsenal head to Old Trafford on the back of a 4-1 aggregate drubbing against United in the Champions League and a 4-1 reverse at home to Chelsea last week, leading to questions about manager Arsene Wenger. "We live in a world of instant opinions. I have nothing against that, but it doesn't mean that instant opinions are right," Wenger, whose side will finish a distant fourth, told reporters. "I live in a job of responsibility and of commitment. There is a difference between the two. I am here to produce what I can. If it's not good enough, it's not good enough. "That is not down to me to judge that. I feel very proud of the commitment of the players." Wenger, whose rivalry with Ferguson has often been a bitter one, is respectful of United's achievement but believes Arsenal can re-emerge next season. "United bounced back very well (after Chelsea took the championship in 2005 and 2006) and that is all credit to them," he said. "For me, today, they look the best team in England and they arethat is credit to Ferguson, as well. But it also shows that nothing is definite. It can all turn very quickly.
