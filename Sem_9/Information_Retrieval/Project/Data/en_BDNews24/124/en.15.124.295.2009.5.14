 Abdur Rahim Harmasi bdnews24.com senior business correspondent Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will host a donors' meeting in the capital in mid-Sept., after a pause of over three years, to seek assistance from the donors to execute its election pledges, the finance minister said on Thursday. Speaking exclusively to bdnews24.com, AMA Muhith said local and international representatives from donor countries and organisations including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will join the meeting, styled as Bangladesh Development Forum. Muhith said the government will seek extra assistance from the donors to implement the Public Private Partnership plan to be under taken in the next budget. "Earlier, formal meetings were held with the donors each year, where the donors used to pledge their assistance. Accordingly, the governments sketched their development plans," Muhith said. "But the meeting has not been for over three years. We think such formal meetings are essential to ensuring greater role [of the donors] in the development of our country." "So we want to resume the Bangladesh Development Forum," Muhith said. The decision came following a meeting with local representatives of around 30 donor countries and organisations, including the World Bank, ADB, Sweden, DFID (UK) and USAID. Planning minister AK Khandker and officials of Economic Relation Department were also present. Muhith, however, said the donors' meeting may resume in Sept. with another name, but the aim will be the same. The last BDF meeting was held in Apr. 2005 He was optimistic about increased assistance from the donors after the Sept. session because 'there will open discussion with donors'. "We are a political government and want to do everything openly. We will present our vision in the meeting and seek assistance." In Thursday's meeting, the local donor representatives appreciated the PPP concept, Muhith said. He was hopeful that they would response positively to provide extra assistance to implement it. The Bangladesh donors' meeting used to take place in Paris from 1997 as 'Paris Consortium Meeting' until 2002. It was moved to Bangladesh from 2003 and took the present name, BDF.
