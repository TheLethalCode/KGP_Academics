 MUMBAI, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian consumers are largely shrugging off the global economic downturn, with more than two-thirds saying they have no plans to cut spending over the next year, Boston Consulting Group said in a report on Thursday. Spending has grown at annual rates of 10 percent in recent years, and Indian consumers felt secure about their jobs and finances, and were optimistic about the long-term prospects of the country, the report found.

Nielsen earlier in the week found while consumer confidence had dropped in India, there was also optimism about the situation changing in the next 12 months. "Consumer confidence in India may have fallen but it is not yet vanquished," the Nielsen survey said. "Forty-seven percent of Indians have an optimistic perception about local job prospects in the next 12 months, with 6 percent considering them to be 'excellent' and 41 percent considering them 'good'," it
