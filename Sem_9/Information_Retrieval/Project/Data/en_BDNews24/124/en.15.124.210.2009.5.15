 VIENNA, Fri May 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-born journalist Roxana Saberi arrived in Austria on Friday from Iran days after being released from a Tehran jail after being acquitted of charges of spying for the United States, a US official said. "We can confirm that she has arrived in Vienna," said a spokeswoman for the US embassy in Austria's capital. The spokeswoman declined further comment.

Tehran does not recognise dual nationality and told Washington not to interfere. Obama has offered Iran a fresh start in relations, though Iran says Washington must first show real policy change. Analysts and diplomats have said Saberi's arrest should not be seen as a sign that Iran is rejecting Obama's overture, but say her case and her release may have been influenced by it. Some saw the arrest as a warning to foreign media ahead of Iran's June presidential election, while others say it could have been a bid by hardliners to obstruct any thaw in US-Iran ties or to use her as a "bargaining c
