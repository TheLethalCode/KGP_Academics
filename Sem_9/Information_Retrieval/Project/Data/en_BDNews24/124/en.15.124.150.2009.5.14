 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)The government has appealed to withdraw the extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury against prime minister Sheikh Hasina, sister, Rehana, and cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Mozammel Hossain, acting judge of Dhaka Special Judge's Court-5, has set May 17 to hear the petition and deliver verdict. Public prosecutor of Dhaka Metropolitan Session Judge's Court Abdullah Abu filed the appeal. The High Court on Tuesday revoked its previous orders that halted the proceedings of the case in June 2007 with the Gulshan Police Station. A lawyer for Hasina had said after the High Court verdict that the step was necessary to process her petition to withdraw the case. Azam Chowdhury has maintained he did not want to sue Hasina and indicated he was forced to sign the case documents under pressure from certain quarters in the military-installed caretaker government. The High Court on Sept 16 last year granted Hasina bail and froze the proceedings of the case. The home ministry on Jan 5 sought the opinion of metropolitan public prosecutor Ehsanul Huq Samajee who said legal proceedings to drop the charges would be undertaken after the court settles a writ petition for staying the case. "The government has decided under Section 494 of the Criminal Procedure Code to discontinue the prosecution of case no. 34 dated 13/6/2007 and seeks opinion of the learned metropolitan public prosecutor and necessary actions," said a letter from the ministry to the PP. The home ministry in a circular on Jan 1 said it would accept petitions to withdraw 'cases for political persecution'. The businessman, whose interests range from energy to banking, filed the case against Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, a former minister, on June 13, 2007. He charged them with accepting a Tk 3 crore "bribe" from him. The charge sheet, submitted on July 24, 2007, later included Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana. Charge framing against the accused was conducted on Jan 13 in the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. The businessman told reporters on Dec 14, "I did not directly file any case. Neither did I name anyone. There was a misunderstanding, which will be over when the case will be withdrawn." bd
