 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Tax lawyers have proposed to put political parties under tax net to increase revenue in the budget of 2009-2010 fiscal year. The proposal has been put forward by the National Tax Lawyers Association at a press conference at the National Press Club. "For years we have been saying that the big political parties are spending crores of taka but there is no system to ensure accountability for their source of funding," said Zakir Hossain, president of the organisation, said. "If they are brought under the tax net their transparency will increase and so will revenue." The lawyers also demanded that the wealth reports of politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and their families charged with corruption be made public. They demanded an increase in the powers of tax ombudsman, making the guest control law realistic, reintroducing 10 percent tax on plot sale and introducing advanced tax system for TIN certificate. Introduction of tax laws instead of the Income Tax Ordinance '84, starting fiscal year from May instead of June, coordination between VAT and income tax and appointment of skilled lawyers to resolve tax cases are some of the 24-point charter of demands. b
