<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)The government has no powers to withdraw cases the Anticorruption Commission has filed, ACC lawyers said on Saturday. The powers vested with the home ministry, according to section 494 of Criminal Procedure Code, cannot be applied to withdraw the corruption cases, they added. If anyone wanted to withdraw the cases, they should appeal to the ACC, the lawyers observed. Applications were earlier made to the home ministry to withdraw cases filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Public prosecutor at Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, Mohammad Abdullah Abu, had recommended the ministry to cancel cases against quite a number of MPs, ministers and the prime minister, saying that those had been filed to politically harass them. The government started legal initiatives to withdraw such cases in Feb. The sub-section-4 of section-10 under Criminal Law Amendment Act-1958 stated that the cases filed by the Anticorruption Commission Act-2004 cannot be withdrawn without the antigraft body's written order, Mosharraf Hossain Kajal, special public prosecutor of the ACC, told bdnews24.com. The ministry has no jurisdiction, according to this law, he also said. Kajal added that the government should tell the commission which cases it wanted to withdraw. Cases withdrawn without orders from the ACC will amount to demeaning its independence, he also said. Another ACC public prosecutor, Annisul Haq, said the government, according to that Act, held the jurisdiction until 2004 to withdraw the cases filed by the ACC. But the caretaker government inserted the word 'commission' instead of 'government' in sub-section 4 of section 10 of Criminal Law Amendment Act, and since then the government has lost the authority, he added. Around 1500 petitions have so far been filed with the Dhaka deputy commissioner's office since the Awami League-led government offered the opportunities for applying to withdraw political cases. Most of the cases are criminal, but over 200 cases were filed by the ACC. Petitions for withdrawing the cases include those against former and present MPs and ministers, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, and her two sonsTarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco. b
