 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Detained JMB bomb expert Boma Mizan's wife Sharmeen Haq Lata says she detonated a bomb to commit suicide along with her children as per her the husband's instruction. But RAB officials say Lata, now undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital after losing her right wrist to the blast, tried to attack the them. "I blasted the bomb by holding my two-month-old daughter in my lap and my two two-year old son's hand. "I tried to commit suicide along with my children," Lata told reporters at ward 33 of the hospital on Friday. She said her husband had earlier told her to commit suicide to evade arrest. Mizan, arrested on Thursday evening, is the explosives expert and had been with the banned Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujaheedin Bangladesh's founder Shaekh Abdur Rahman and military commander Sidduiqul Islam alias Bangla Bhai. Rahman and Bangla Bhai were executed for militancy. RAB raided Mizan's rented house in Pirerbagh in Mirpur area as per Mizan's information. Mizan stockpiled huge quantity of ammunition at the house. As RAB members approached the doorstep of Lata's room, she got a signal from Mizan and detonated the bomb. Her right wrist blew up as the bomb went off in her hand. But her two children are safe, according to doctors. RAB officials said her claim that she tried to commit suicide was not credible; she tried to hurl the bomb at them. RAB's additional director general Rezanur Rahman Khan told bdnews24.com, "Her attempt to commit suicide is not credible." Why did she detonate the bomb in front of the door had she had not intended to toss it at the law-enforcers, he questioned. "Besides, there were more bombs in the house." Khan said they could not question Lata as they were busy quizzing Mizan. "Our main priority is Mizan. So, his wife is yet to be questioned", he said. Lata said she would not have married Mizan if she knew he was a militant. She said Mizan's parents disowned him for his involvement with the JMB. Lata said she was in love with Mizan while studying in Karotia College in Tangail and they married three years ago ignoring her parents. "I became a member of the JMB after marriage." bdnews
