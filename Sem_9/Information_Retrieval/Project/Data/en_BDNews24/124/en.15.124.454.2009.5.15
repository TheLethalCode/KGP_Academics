 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has said if the parliamentary panel investigating his alleged corruption summoned him to appear before the committee on June 10, then he would 'definitely not be there'. But, he would 'consider' attending the meeting if the parliamentary standing committee sought his cooperation in the investigation. "They cannot compel me, but they can compel witnesses to give their statements in connection with the investigation," Sircar told bdnews24.com on Thursday. The 11-strong all-party committee led by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mia on Thursday served a summons on him, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to appear before the committee on June 10. He said the investigating panel had no legal base. "Then again, according to the constitution and procedures, Fazle Rabbi Mia cannot force me to appear before the committee. And, parliament or any parliamentary committee has no authority to cancel an MP's membership," he added. "No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself," Sircar quoted from the constitution. The BNP MP challenged the legality of the committee and contended the speaker had formed the investigation panel in line with 'the sentiment of the House'. "The speaker cannot form a committee like this; there is a procedure to do it, " said Sircar and quoted from Rules of Procedure. "No proposal was made to form a probe committee against me, except that some MPs spoke against me in parliament." "The speaker formed the probe committee unlawfully. The plaintiff can never take the seat of the judge," he said. "Members of the probe committee talked about me both in and outside parliament which is a gross violation of the law." On Mar 19, in the face of demands made by the MPs, speaker Abdul Hamid formed the all-party probe committee. Committee chief Fazle Rabbi Mian accused him of committing massive corruption including embezzlement of money. The committee was assigned one month's time to complete its task, but later the speaker extended time considering the huge tasks involved. Sircar said the time frame can only be extended in the parliament through opinion polls. "According to parliamentary procedures, the findings of the committee cannot be disclosed to the media. The committee can brief the media on their activities and progress after each sitting." He termed the allegations against him as 'false and politically motivated'. "As per section 18, the speaker is the sole authority to approve all parliamentary expenditure though he is accountable to the members of parliament," he said. Sir said he had sent a letter to then the prime minister asking for Tk 27 lakh, but the prime minister told him instead to follow in former speaker Humanyun Rashid Chowdhury's footsteps. Chowdhury had drawn Tk 35 lakh from the government funds in line with parliament secretariat law, he added. "So I drew Tk 27 lakh as per law and made a written statement that if necessary, I would return the money to the government." Sircar said only the Supreme Court could decide the legality of his drawing money from the government fund. On his recruitment of parliamentary employees, the former speaker said, "The pro-Awami League people filed a writ petition challenging my authority over recruitment of employees, but they lost the legal battle in the High Court and the Supreme Court." "Former speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury appointed Abdul Hye, brother of the incumbent speaker, to a first-class post in violation of law. "A legal battle is still going on over the issue. So, it is 'really unethical' to level allegations against me over recruitment of employees." Asked to comment on Sircar's remarks, speaker Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com, "Why did Sircar not cancel the appointment during his seven years in office?" bdnews
