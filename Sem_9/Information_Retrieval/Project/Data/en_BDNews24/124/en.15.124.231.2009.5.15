 NEW DELHI, Fri May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country's top carmaker, on Friday launched its premium hatchback, Ritz, as it battles to boost sales in a segment that is set to see greater competition. Maruti, which sells one of every two cars sold in India, expects to get a "good response" for the new car, Managing Director and CEO Shinzo Nakanishi told reporters, but he declined to give sales forecast. The price of the petrol version varies from 390,000 rupees ($7,860) to 480,000 rupees ex-showroom in New Delhi and 465,000 rupees to 499,000 rupees for the diesel variant, the company said. The company, 54.2 percent owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, will face stronger competition in the upper-end of the compact car market with a number of launches expected in the coming months and next year. Japan's Honda Motor will unveil its Jazz, Volkswagen's Czech unit, Skoda Auto, will launch its new Fabia and General Motors has a compact car lined up for later this year. These will be followed by Volkswagen's Polo supermini and its sedan variant next year and Toyota's Yaris and Nissan's supermini March. Car sales in India had slowed sharply in the past year as the global economic downturn hurt demand and drove borrowing costs up, but analysts expect a faster recovery when the tide changes because of low vehicle ownership. Industry sales are forecast to expand 3-5 percent in the year to next March, after slowing sharply to 1 percent growth in the year just ended, according to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers data. The upper end of the compact car segment reported sales of 79,339 units in April, up nearly 8 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. The petrol Ritz comes fitted with the new K12M engine, manufactured at the company's engine-making facility in Gurgaon, near Delhi. The diesel version of the company's Swift hatchback, which forms the platform for the Ritz, has been seeing good demand with a waiting period of 3-4 months, company officials said. "Maruti is planing to increase (diesel) engine capacity to 300,000 units by the end of this fiscal year from 200,000 now," Mayank Pareek, executive officer for marketing, said. Shares in Maruti, which has a market value of $4.9 billion, were trading up 1.6 percent at 848.65 rupees at 2:44 p.m. (0914 GMT), while the Mumbai market was up 2.7 per
