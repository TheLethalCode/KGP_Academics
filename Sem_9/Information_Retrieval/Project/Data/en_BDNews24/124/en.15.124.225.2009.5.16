 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh leave Dhaka on Sunday to take part in the AFC U-13 Festival of Football in Tehran, Iran scheduled for May 19-23, with eight nations playing in the meet. "Football is not confined to Dhaka. We have taken initiatives to spread the game across the country and we have just started the journey with U-13 team in a bid to strengthen the grassroot level and other age-group teams like U-16 and U-18 will also be built this year. I think these initiatives will inspire other children to come into football," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin said at a press conference on Saturday. The BFF boss, however, expressed his frustration over the sponsorship for the age-group teams. "Everyone speaks about the development of football at the grassroots but they never come forward with financial support. What do we do, we do it on our own. The AFC is giving us $5,000 for participating, but a total of $20,000 would be spent for the U-13 side," said Salahuddin. BFF vice-president and development committee chairman Kazi Nabil Ahmed said that they had picked the squad from the grassroot level through the U-13 festival of football in eight venues across the country. He added that the selected players later were given six weeks training and strictly examined their age though a medical committee. Apart from Bangladesh, hosts Iran, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives and Afghanistan will take part in the meet. BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi, technical director Shahidur Rahman Shantu, BFF members Golam Rabbani Helal and Shafiquzzaman were present during the briefing bd
