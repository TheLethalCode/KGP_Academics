 MANILA, Thu May 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global trade in counterfeit goods, including medicines, CDs and DVDs, is expected to rise to nearly $1 trillion this year as economies worldwide continue to slump, security experts said on Thursday. An estimated $800 billion in fake cigarettes, branded shoes, bags and belts, and pirated movies flowed across the globe in 2007, Stephen Sayell, vice president of Hong Kong-based Asia Risk group, told Reuters.

In the Philippines, the health department has already issued a warning against offers by some medical facilities to provide anti-flu shots against the deadly strain of A-H1N1 virus that originated from Mexico. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against the proliferation of fake anti-malaria medicines in the Mekong area, blaming the counterfeit drugs for the emergence of a new strain of malaria that could spread in the re
