 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)BNP will reform district committees to strengthen the party, the main opposition party's top policymaking forum decided in a meeting Thursday night, an official said. Maruf Kamal Khan, press secretary to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, said the decision is in the process of being finalised by the national standing committee. Khan told bdnews24.com that the meeting that started at Khaleda's Gulshan office at around 8:30pm was going on and continue late into the night. Earlier in the day, committee member Moudud Ahmed said the issue of reforming the party was at the final stages. The chairperson will finalise the matter in the meeting. The committee members said convening committees were recommended by grassroots leaders by dissolving 75 organising district committees through election. A four-member special sub-committee led by Khaleda earlier reviewed the names of possible conveners for the district convening committees. This sub-committee went through all the reports submitted by six divisional teams, containing suggestions of the grassroots-level leaders to reorganise the party. The teams' leaders have submitted their reports to the chairperson, suggesting three names for a convenor and there-four names for a joint convenor of each of the proposed district units. After the debacle in the Dec 29 general election, the party formed six central teams that jotted down feedback from district leaders in Feb to reorganise itself. The standing committee later decided to replace district committees with convening committees by Apr 7, but the task remained unaccomplished. The new district convening committees will be assigned to organise council sessions at the districts, upazilas and unions, according to party sources. The party will hold its national council session after completing the district council sessions, the sources further said. bdne
