<TEXT>
 Rangpur, May 16 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed said on Saturday the crackdown on Islamist militancy will continue until the country was fully purged of the menace. "No apathy will be tolerated in the drive," the state minister told reporters before a special meeting with Pirganj Sadar law-enforcers in Rangpur. Pointing to opposition leader Khaleda Zia, he said, "She does not see militants in the country. Whereas people of Bangladesh have seen how four-party coalition government had supported the militants in their regime." He focused on the recent seizure of huge cache of bombs, arms and ammunition at a banned Jama'atul Mijahideen Bangladesh-run training centre at east Manipur in Dhaka. Long-term plan has been adopted to reduce crime, he added. "Police patrol has been increased in the capital. We made special teams integrating two-three police stations. Efforts have been made to ensure that police reach the crime scene in 10 minutes." bdn
