<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)Police will not clamp down on some 500,000 unauthorised rickshaws in capital Dhaka anytime soon, the city police chief said on Saturday. "No action will be taken against them, rather some of them can be legalised after having talks with [Dhaka] City Corporation," Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque said. "More rickshaws are in demand in the city," he said at a views-exchange meeting with senior police officers on the problems of rickshaw pullers in the city. Unemployment, poverty, terrorism and other crimes may rise in case of any action against them unless alternative sources for income was created for them, he said. However, the road from Kuril Bishwa Road to Sayedabad will be out of bounds for rickshaws for the time being. Some other areas will be off-limits to rickshaws later, Haque said. On a question, he told reporters after the meeting, "Coordinated operation has been launched in the capital to catch terrorists and extortionists." Police are also using many ploys to catch them, he said. A parliamentary standing committee recently decided to free the road from Kuril Bishwa Road to Sayedabad of illegal rickshaws to ease gridlock, he further said. "But, if it did not reduce traffic jam, rickshaw movements will be entirely stopped." The city police chief believed professional organisations should be non-partisan in pressing demands under any government He called on the professional organisations to be non-partisan in making demands. On allegations that different illegal and interest groups are running rickshaw organisations, he said "A committee should be formed in coordination with [Dhaka] City Corporation to scrutinise illegal organisations." He also called on rickshaw-pullers to help police with information about crimes and criminals. Mohammad Jashim Uddin, joint commissioner (traffic) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, presided over the meeting. bd
