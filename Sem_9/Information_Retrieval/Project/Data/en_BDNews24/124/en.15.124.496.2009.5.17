 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)The government will form a cell comprising officials of foreign and home ministries to bring the fugitive killers of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the junior foreign minister has said. "We are thinking of constituting a joint-cell with foreign ministry and home ministry officials," state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud told reporters at his office on Sunday after ending a week-long visits to the US and Canada. "The cell will collect information about the Bangabandhu's killers now hiding in many countries," Mahmud said he talked to US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher and other US officials who responded "positively" to Bangladesh's request to extradite the killers. Hasan said a number of the killers were hiding in the North American countries. The Awami League government in its 1996-2001 term formed a high-level committee and its members visited many countries to find out the killers of Sheikh Mujib was killed with most of his family in a military putsch on Aug 15, 1975. On the allegations by expatriates that Bangladesh missions officials do not cooperate, he said the missions could not perform due to manpower shortage. For instance, he said, a maximum 40 staffers served the mission in Saudi Arabia where 22 lakh Bangladeshis lived. "Among the forty, five to six officers are diplomats. We should not blame the officials always. "Is it possible for them to serve so many people?" he asked. He, however, said the officials should consider them as public servants, not masters.
