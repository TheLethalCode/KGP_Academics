<TITLE> Myanmar positive on fibre optic cable link </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)Myanmar has responded positively to Bangladesh's proposal for setting up an inland cross-border fibre optical cable line to facilitate communication between the two neighbours. Foreign minister U Nyan Win on Saturday told his Bangladesh counterpart Dipu Moni that both Myanmar and China were interested in setting tri-nation road, according to information received from the reclusive country. Dipu Moni and three of her aides reached Myanmar capital Naypyidaw on Thursday and had talks with prime minister General Thein Sein, foreign minister U Nyan Win and energy minister Lun Thi. "The foreign minister of Myanmar [told them] that they would examine the prospect of installation of an inland cross-border fibre optical line, which could be used to connect with other regional countries, between Myanmar and Bangladesh," said a press statement received from Naypyidaw, the Myanmar capital. It said Dipu Moni asked her counterpart to link Bangladesh and its second neighbour through ICT. After a spate of undersea cable network cuts, Dhaka last year asked Myanmar to allow use of its submarine cable in case of cuts in Bangladesh's network. In return, Bangladesh offered similar concessions to Myanmar. The Myanmar foreign minister also said both Myanmar and China were interested in setting up the tri-nation road network provided that necessary fund was available, the statement said. The two countries in July 2007 signed a deal on construction of a cross-country road from Gumdum in Bangladesh to Tumbro in Myanmar. Bangladesh will provide necessary fund for construction of the road which could be stretched up to China. Myanmar has refused to fund for constructing the tri-nation road. If finished, the road would give China the chance to use Chittagong port via Myanmar to reach its products in eastern part. Besides, the road is expected to contribute hugely to boost bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Myanmar. "Both sides agreed to establish direct air links between the two countries either at government or private level," the statement said. Dipu Moni proposed sending a Bangladesh delegation to study necessary amendment to the agreement on the issue. She also raised the issue of repatriation of remaining Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh. During her meeting with energy minister Lun Thi, Dipu Moni sought Myanmar gas for producing urea in Bangladesh and export the same to its neighbour. "He (the minister) assured (her) that whenever there would be sufficient gas to export to Bangladesh that would be made available for production of urea," the statement said.
