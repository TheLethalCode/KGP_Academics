<TITLE> Congress alliance heads for victory in India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The ruling Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) appeared to be heading for a victory in a national election, TV networks projected as votes were counted on Saturday. No alliance is expected to win a clear majority but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition was well ahead of an alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress party-led coalition was projected to win more than 200 of the total 543 parliamentary seats at stake. To rule, a party or a coalition requires the support of 272 members of parliament. "So if you want to project from this, it looks like Congress will not only emerge as the single largest party but will be comfortably ahead," Vinod Mehta, editor of Outlook magazine, said. India's booming economic growth for the past four years, including rising rural incomes, may well have worked for the Congress-led coalition headed by the reformist Singh. A severe financial downturn that began last year and is continuing in Asia's third largest economy appeared to have had little impact on the fortunes of the ruling alliance. "It seems to me that we must acknowledge the economy," said political analyst Mahesh Rangarajan. "Despite the slowdown in the economy in the last year, these four or five years have been among the best in India's recorded economic history." Congress party supporters, their arms in the air and carrying banners of star campaigners Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, set off firecrackers in celebration in New Delhi on news of the election returns. "Victory is ours, the writing is on the wall for the BJP and all the other parties that thought they could beat us," said Mukesh Narula, wearing a party flag as a bandana. Computerised counting of votes at hundreds of centres across the country began at 0230 GMT with the results for all parliamentary seats due later in the day. Despite the Congress gains, analysts said days of backroom dealings may still lie ahead before a new government is in place with supporting groups seeking their pound of flesh. A "Third Front" of regional and communist parties may hold the balance of power, stoking concerns that big ticket reforms such as privatisation and liberalisation of the insurance sector will remain on the backburner. "If it is a Congress coalition with the left backing it, you can forget about any major decisions on reforms," said political commentator Prem Shankar Jha. "It will be a weak coalition, a waste of time actually." India is faced with its slowest economic growth in six years and instability in Pakistan that some fear may eventually spill into the country. Any new government will have to tackle the question of ties with Pakistan that have been in deep-freeze since an attack on Mumbai by Pakistan-based militants last November. Both the Congress and the BJP have taken broadly similar positions on Pakistan, with neither willing to give much ground until they are convinced Islamabad has prosecuted those behind the attack. Since then the Pakistan Army, prodded by the United States, has launched an offensive against Taliban militants in the Swat valley. The United States, which considers India to be a key part of its regional strategy to fight Islamist militants in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, is expected to lean on New Delhi to begin talks with Pakistan to help stabilise the region. About 714 million people were eligible to vote in the largest such exercise in the world staggered over a month to allow security forces and election officials to supervise.
