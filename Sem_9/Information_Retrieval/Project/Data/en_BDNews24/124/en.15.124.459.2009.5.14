<TITLE> Crackdown a boon for exchanges, bane for dealers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Thu May 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Obama administration's plan to regulate over-the-counter derivatives, announced on Wednesday, could help exchanges and hurt the dealers who have fought hard to keep the opaque market private. The US plan expands growth horizons for exchange operators, particularly those with clearinghouses, which have scrambled over the last eight months to take advantage of new OTC business amid the credit crisis. So far the exchanges have targeted credit default swaps, or CDS, which regulators quickly identified as problematic. But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Wednesday the government will require that "all standardized" OTC contracts run through a central counterparty, or clearinghouse. The plan will also push more standardized OTC derivatives trading onto the regulated and transparent exchanges. Analysts said Chicago-based derivatives exchange CME Group Inc and smaller peer IntercontinentalExchange Inc, of Atlanta, are poised to benefit because they already own and operate US clearinghouses. CME shares jumped 6 percent on Wednesday, while ICE edged marginally higher. Meanwhile, derivatives dealers could suffer as the customized contracts they have specialized in are forced into a standardized straight jacket. "Clearly, there could be a loss of profit for someone like a Goldman Sachs," said James Ellman, president of Seacliff Capital, a San Francisco-based hedge fund focusing on financial firms. "The exchanges have been trying to get this business to go electronic for a while." About $193.6 trillion in US OTC derivatives trades OTC, while $6.8 trillion trades on-exchange. CME and, more recently, Nasdaq OMX have tried with limited success to clear interest rate swaps, by far the biggest OTC product. Derivatives, instruments that derive their value from other assets, have been an important revenue stream for broker-dealers that have so far battled successfully to keep the market private. They can make money from trading the securities or arranging their sale to institutional clients. "The spreads were just too good," Marc Groz, managing member of risk management advisory firm Topos LLC, said of dealers' hold on derivatives. "If you could keep all the information to yourself, there were healthy profits." But now the government wants to drag the shadow market into the light, proposing a "robust regime of prudential supervision and regulation" for dealers in an effort to protect capital markets from a repeat of the current crisis. "It's not only a push on clearing, but also on central marketplaces and electronic trading, and that's incrementally favorable for exchanges," said Edward Ditmire, analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. While ICE has handled an increasing amount of CDS since it began clearing the default-insurance contracts in March, CME, which also wants to trade CDS, has yet to launch its CDS clearinghouse. "Maybe this is something that proportionally helps CME because CME hasn't been getting a lot of traction," Ditmire said. "They (CME) seem like someone who could benefit from a stronger government push." CME shares closed up $15.62 at $274.10, and ICE added 9 cents to $96.59. Analysts said the shares may have reacted to media reports ahead of the government's plan, announced after the close of US markets. In an email, a CME spokesman said: "We need to look at the technical details of the plan before we can assess the impact." An ICE spokeswoman had no comment. NYSE Euronext, which runs the New York Stock Exchange and has a CDS clearer in Europe, said in a statement it looks forward "to an expansion of this dialogue to other global regulators." The administration's move is part of a wider push to revamp rules for banks and financial markets, in response to the mortgage market-inspired credit crisis. "You can almost see potentially how it has a ripple effect because it really puts a kibosh on risk taking," said John Jay, senior analyst at consultancy Aite Group. "It puts a kibosh on innovation, and you're not letting the private sector go where it wants to
