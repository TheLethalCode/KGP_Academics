 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)The BNP policymakers sits on Saturday evening to reach a final decision on reforming itself, the main opposition party officials said. The party's top policymaking forum, the national standing committee, will sit in the meeting at chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office at around 7:30pm, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com. "The issue of reforming the party is at the final stages. The chairperson will finalise the matter in today's meeting," committee member Moudud Ahmed added. The committee members said convening committees were recommended by grassroots leaders by dissolving 75 organising district committees through election. A special committee led by Khaleda earlier reviewed the names of possible conveners for the district convening committees. After the debacle in the Dec 29 general election, the party formed six central teams that jotted down feedback from district leaders in Feb to reorganise itself. The standing committee later decided to replace district committees with convening committees by Apr 7, but the task remained unaccomplished. bdne
