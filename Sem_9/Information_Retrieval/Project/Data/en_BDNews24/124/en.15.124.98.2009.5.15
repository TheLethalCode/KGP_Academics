 TEHRAN, Fri May 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-born journalist Roxana Saberi flew to Europe early on Friday, days after being released from a Tehran jail after being acquitted on charges of spying for the United States, one of her defense lawyers said.

Analysts and diplomats have said Saberi's arrest should not be seen as a sign that Iran is rejecting Obama's overture, but say her case and her release may have been influenced by it. Some saw the arrest as a warning to foreign media ahead of Iran's June presidential election, while others say it could have been a bid by hardliners to obstruct any thaw in US-Iran ties or to use her as a "bargaining c
