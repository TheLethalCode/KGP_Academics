 New Delhi, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of India's main Communist party said on Saturday they would sit in the opposition after the ruling Congress party-led alliance was projected to win a second term. "We will sit in the opposition," said Prakash Karat. The left, which fared badly in its stronghold in West Bengal, helped prop up the Congress party-led coalition government for four years before falling out over a nuclear deal with the United States. The Congress party was projected to win about 250 seats of a total 543 parliamentary seats.
