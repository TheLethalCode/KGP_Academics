 JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rohit Sharma hit 26 runs off the final over to carry the Deccan Chargers to a pulsating six-wicket win over the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday. In the other match, Sachin Tendulkar's Mumbai Indians had their semi-final hopes wrecked by a seven-wicket defeat at the hands of the Chennai Super Kings. Chennai are second in the table, one point behind leaders the Delhi Daredevils, while Deccan are in third spot a further point adrift. Mumbai are second from bottom, immediately above Kolkata. Deccan needed 21 off the last over by Bangladesh seamer Mashrafe Mortaza in Johannesburg and managed 26 thanks to Sharma. The Chargers, chasing 161 to win, made a good start when openers Adam Gilchrist (43) and Herschelle Gibbs (28) put on 68 in 57 balls. Excellent spin bowling by Murali Kartik (1-12) and two run-outs affected a turnaround for Kolkata before Sharma blasted 32 not out in 13 deliveries. He smashed two sixes in the last over, the second off the last ball. The Knight Riders had earlier scored 160 for five, Brad Hodge top-scoring with 48. In Port Elizabeth, the Super Kings passed Mumbai's total of 147 for five with five balls to spare. Matthew Hayden, who leads the race for the Orange Cap award given to the tournament's leading run-scorer, ensured victory with an unbeaten 60 in 57 deliveries. Earlier, JP Duminy (62) made his fifth half-century of the competition for Mumbai
