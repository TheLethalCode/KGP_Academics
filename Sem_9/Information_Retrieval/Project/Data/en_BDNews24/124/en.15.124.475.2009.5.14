<TEXT>
 DURHAM, England, May 14 (bdnews24.com)- Ravi Bopara became the first England batsman to score three Test centuries in consecutive innings since his hero and mentor Graham Gooch in 1990, while another of Gooch's protgs, Alastair Cook, made an unbeaten 126, as West Indies were made to toil with minimum reward on the first day of the second Test at Chester-le-Street. By the close, England had moved effortlessly along to 302 for 2, with Cook still in situ at the close, his ninth hundred and first at home for two years. He and Bopara came together half-an-hour before lunch following the demise of Andrew Strauss, caught for 26, and were not separated until five overs before the close, when Bopara was bowled through the gate by Lionel Baker for 108 by one of the few deliveries that moved off the seam all day.
