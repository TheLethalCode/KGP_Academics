 WASHINGTON, Fri May 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Washington has given Pakistan data on militants in the Afghanistan border area gathered by surveillance drones in Pakistani airspace under an agreement with Islamabad, US officials said on Thursday. Confirming the existence of the program, which started in mid-March, US military officials said it allowed the Pakistani military to request missions over specific areas of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

Mullen's public comments prompted Senator Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate panel, to criticize Islamabad for publicly condemning CIA missile strikes in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. "I wish they'd tell their public about their support of our operations instead of attacking us for them, because that is one of the things that just creates propaganda fodder for the very people who are out to destroy us and them," Levin said.
