 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and the United Kingdom on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding to run a project aimed at providing sports facilities to 1 million children by 2012. As per the agreement on "International Inspiration", the British government will provide trainers and other facilities to 20 Bangladeshi schools linked with the UK institutions. Youth and sports ministry, education ministry, primary and mass education ministry, women and children affairs ministry, the British Council and Unicef will jointly implement the project. Youth and sports secretary Ehsan Ul Fattah and British high commissioner Stephen Evans signed the MoU. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid and state minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarker also attended the signing ceremony. "If you can develop good projects, my government can provide at least five million pounds in five years to give Bangladeshi children sports access," Evans said before the signing. The project, according to government officials, will help tap sports for physical and mental developments of children plagued by drug addiction and other social problems. Carel de Rooy, unicef's country representative, said, "Every day 45 children aged between 1 and 10 die of drowning in Bangladesh. "So, sports will also save lives too." He said more than 3000 boys and girls will learn swimming under the project. "In the next phase, a further 16 schools will join the youth sports leadership programme which will ultimately reach 100,000 young people, their schools and communities," said Charles Nuttall, British Council director. He said 41 teachers from secondary schools in the UK completed visits to their 20 partner schools and madrasas under the school link element of the programme. Eight tutors and 32 young people from four local schools, attending youth sports leadership course, will demonstrate their new-found expertise on Saturday at a festival at Dhanmondi women's sport complex, he said. The British government provides the facilities to Bangladesh as part of its pledge before the 2012 Olympic bid in Singapore that it would create sustainable structures and sports systems in 20 countries. At least 12 million young people are expected to improve their lives though sports access.
