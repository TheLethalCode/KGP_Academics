 New Delhi, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The election commission began on Saturday the official count of votes after a month-long, mammoth general election that is expected to throw up a weak coalition. The main battle is between the ruling Congress party-led coalition and the Hindu-nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance, but neither was expected to gain a majority from the 543 parliamentary seats at stake. Following are highlights from the vote count that will be updated over Saturday. Congress-led alliance was leading after an early computerised count in almost 425 of the total parliamentary seats at stake, according to several national television channels. While NDTV channel said the Congress-led alliance was ahead in 198 seats, it put the BJP-led alliance ahead 126 seats. CNN-IBN television said the Congress alliance was heading in 185 seats and the BJP combine in 120 seats. To rule, a party or a coalition requires the support of 272 members of parliament. The DMK, a key Congress ally in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, was ahead in 25 of 39 seats in the state, according to state-run Doordarshan television. Congress party supporters, their arms in the air and carrying banners of star campaigners Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, set off firecrackers in celebration in New Delhi on news of the election returns.
