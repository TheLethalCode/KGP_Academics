<TITLE> Spike in birth among unmarried women concerns US policymakers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Are more and more young American women abandoning marriage and preferring to have children out of wedlock? The question has become uppermost after a new study revealed that is the case. A government study released by the Centers for Disease Control Wednesday titled "Changing patters of nonmarital childbearing in the United States," found that unmarried mothers gave birth to 4 out of every 10 babies born in the United States in 2007, a share that is increasing rapidly both here and abroad. Until 1970, policymakers and sociologists were worried about rising pregnancies among teenagers, who were mostly unmarried. But in recent years the birthrate among unmarried women in their 20s and 30s has soared  rising 34 percent since 2002, for example, in women ages 30 to 34. In 2007, women in their 20s had 60 percent of all babies born out of wedlock, teenagers had 23 percent and women 30 and older had 17 percent. The study has also found that much of the increase in unmarried births has occurred among parents who are living together but are not married, cohabitation arrangements that tend to be less stable than marriages. The pattern has been particularly pronounced among Hispanic women, climbing 20 percent from 2002 to 2006. Eleven percent of unmarried Hispanic women had a baby in 2006, compared with 7 percent of unmarried black women and 3 percent of unmarried white women. Some experts say that marriage or cohabitation cements financial and emotional bonds between children and fathers that survive divorce or separation, improving outcomes for children. But since familial instability is often damaging to children, they may be better off with mothers who never cohabitate or marry than with those who form unions that are later broken. Out-of-wedlock births are also rising in much of the industrialized world: in Iceland, 66 percent of children are born to unmarried mothers; in Sweden, the share is 55 percent. (In other societies, though, the phenomenon remains rare  just 2 percent in Japan, for example.) But experts say the increases in the United States are of greater concern because couples in many other countries tend to be more stable and government support for children is often higher. In Sweden, for instance, there's very little variation in the outcome of children based on marital status, but in the U.S., there's much more disparity, experts say. Children born out of wedlock in the United States tend to have poorer health and educational outcomes than those born to married women, but that may be because unmarried mothers tend to share those problems. Decades ago, pregnant women often married before giving birth. But the odds of separation and divorce in unions driven by pregnancy are relatively high. So when a woman gets pregnant, are children better off if their parents marry, cohabitate or do neither? That question is still unresolved. In an enduring mystery, birthrates for unmarried women in the United States stabilized between 1995 and 2002 and declined among unmarried teenagers and black women. But after 2002, the overall birthrate among unmarried women resumed its steady climb. In 1940, just 3.8 percent of births were to unmarried women. Mississippi and Washington DC had the highest rates of out-of-wedlock births in 2007: 59 percent and 54 percent, respectively. The lowest rate, 20 percent, was in Utah. In New York, the rate was 41 percent; in New Jersey, 34 percent; and in Connecticut, 35 perc
