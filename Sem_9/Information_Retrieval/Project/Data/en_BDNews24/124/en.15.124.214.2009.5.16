 Chittagong, May 16 (bdnews24.com)Police probing the much-vaunted 10-truck arms haul have arrested two former chiefs of National Security Intelligence, according to highly-placed home ministry officials. The officials, who declined to be named, told bdnews24.com on Saturday that retired brigadier general Abdur Rahim and retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury were detained at their houses late Friday night and would be questioned by the CID. Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad confirmed the arrest of the former DGs. Earlier, home minister Sahara Khatun did not deny the news when reached by phone but asked bdnews24.com to contact the appropriate authorities. Rahim, then a retired officer, was appointed to the top NSI job by the BNP-led coalition government. Gen Chowdhury succeeded him later and was removed immediately after the army intervened to slap emergency on Jan 11, 2007. Chowdhury was also sent into retirement from the army. Police seized ten trucks loaded with arms at the secured jetty of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd on the midnight of Apr 1, 2004. Earlier, a Chittagong court on Friday sent to jail former director (security) of National Security Intelligence retired wing commander Shahabuddin after recording his confessional statement. Magistrate of Chittagong Metropolitan Magistrate's Court Abu Hannan recorded his statement in the afternoon. Investigation officer Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, senior superintendent of Criminal Investigation Department, told bdnews24.com that Shahbuddin's statements were recorded from 3pm to 6pm. Chowdhury, however, declined to say what Shahbuddin disclosed in his 16-page written statement. He was remanded on May 9 for six days ending on Thursday. Earlier on May 3, he had been taken into three-day remand. Shahbuddin was arrested on May 3 at his house in Dhaka on the basis of NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan's confession. bdnew
