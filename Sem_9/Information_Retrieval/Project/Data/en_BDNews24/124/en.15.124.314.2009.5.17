 MOGADISHU, Sun May 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Clashes between moderate Islamists and the hardline al Shabaab have killed 68 people in central Somalia and sent 3,300 others fleeing, pro-government forces and a rights group said on Sunday. The Horn of Africa nation has been hit by some of the worst fighting in months and the interim government is struggling to control a powerful insurgency trying to topple President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed's administration. "We have killed 47 al Shabaab fighters including a white man in Mahas and Wabho," Sheikh Abdullahi Sheikh Abu Yusuf, spokesman of the moderate Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca, told Reuters.
