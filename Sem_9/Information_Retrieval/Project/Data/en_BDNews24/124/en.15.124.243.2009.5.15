 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com) The BNP will make a final decision on reforming itself at a meeting on Saturday, the main opposition party's national standing committee member Moudud Ahmed said on Friday. A special committee led by party chief Khaleda Zia has reviewed the names of possible conveners for the district convening committees. After the debacle in the Dec 29 general election, the party formed six central teams that jotted down feedback from district leaders in Feb to reorganise itself. The standing committee later decided to replace district committees with convening committees by Apr 7, but the task remained unaccomplished. "The final decision will be taken by [Khaleda] in the meeting of the standing committee on Saturday evening," added the former minister. He demanded an all-party expert committee and a national plan on water resources for resolving river-water sharing problems with India. Moudud spoke to reporters after attending a discussion meeting titled 'Indian water aggression: From Farakka to Tipaimukh' at National Press Club, organised by Chironton Bangladesh Kendrio Sangsad. He said the government should work with the opposition to resolve the issue. "We need to work together to create public opinion in the country and in India as well about the embankment project at Tipaimukh and water sharing of different rivers." The BNP MP said the summons on former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to appear before the parliamentary standing committee on June 10 was left people wary of the intentions. "It was a wrong decision on the part of the committee not to make the complaints public and not to inform the accused about the allegations by correspondence. People are thinking that this investigation is not to look into corruption and [the three] are being harassed politically." He said BNP will continue protests as per law as long as the government will be 'persecuting' it. On the second notice from the government to Khaleda to leave Dhaka cantonment house he said, "We demanded a response from the government and relevant authorities within five days regarding the legality of the second notice. Today is the last day. "We will go to the court on the matter on Sunday. For this an application for affidavit has been made for filing a writ petition. But the registrar office of the Supreme Court informed us that this time it is not possible to send (a member of) the oath commission to Khaleda. "We don't know whether it is happening because of political pressure. This kind of behaviour is against the rules." He said, in case of the first notice, a member of the oath commission was sent to the house of Khaleda for her signature on affidavit for filing the writ petition against its legality. But this is not happening this time. Former energy adviser Mahmudur Rahman, Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general M Kamruzzaman, publicity secretary Abdul Kader Molla, former director general of BDR Fazlur Rahman spoke among others at the discussion. Keynote paper was presented by Prof Tareq Shamsur Rahman. The discussion was presided over by Mustafizur Rahman, president of Chironton Bangladesh Kendrio Sangsad. b
