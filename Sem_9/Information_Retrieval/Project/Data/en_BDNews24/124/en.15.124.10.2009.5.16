<TEXT>
 ROME, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Serie A (all times GMT): Inter Milan's top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to return for Sunday's possible Serie A title clincher at Siena (1830) after serving a suspension. Argentine forward Julio Cruz is suspended for the match, however, which Inter may not need to win to claim a fourth consecutive title. They will become champions on Saturday if second-placed AC Milan lose at Udinese (1830) and if their crosstown rivals draw, they will only need to match the result on Sunday. Milan's England international David Beckham is suspended this weekend, along with defender Giuseppe Favalli, which may open the door to a return for fellow midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, who has recovered after knee ligament surgery in December. Third-placed Juventus will host Atalanta behind closed doors on Sunday (1300) after the club lost an appeal against a stadium ban handed down because their supporters racially abused Inter striker Mario Balotelli in a 1-1 draw in Turin last month. Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini is suspended for the match, which Juve need to win to give some respite to under-fire boss Claudio Ranieri and hold off pressure from Fiorentina for Italy's third automatic Champions League berth. Atalanta striker Sergio Floccari has a thigh injury, while midfielders Tiberio Guarente and Simone Padoin are suspended. Fiorentina, three points behind Juve in fourth place, look set to be without Adriano Mutu again for Sunday's home game against Sampdoria (1300). Media reports suggest a knee problem is likely to keep the Romania forward out for the rest of the season. The team finishing fourth will earn a spot in the Champions League qualifying round. Fiorentina defender Gianluca Comotto is suspended as is midfielder Marius Stankevicius for Samp, who will be seeking to bounce back after losing the Italian Cup final to Lazio on penalties on Wednesday
