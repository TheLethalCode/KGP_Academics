 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Two alleged gangsters were killed early on Friday during a so-called 'gunfight' with RAB in Shabujbagh of the capital. RAB said 'Sohel' and 'Babu' were members of 'terror Shahadat legion'. Anisul Islam, sub-inspector, Shabujbagh Police Station told bdnews24.com in the morning that police and RAB had been seen setting up check-posts at different city localities and stopping and checking mobile transports. Quoting RAB sources, Islam said, "As a microbus in Shabujbagh area refused to stop after it was signalled to do so, RAB chased the vehicle." "Shots were fired from the fleeing van and RAB retaliated, when Sohel and Babu died." RAB claimed that the two Shahadat group members had been engaged in extortion and other terrorist activities centred around 'jhut' (excess fabric, cut pieces) business in the city. RAB seized the microbus and recovered three pistols and narcotics. Police retrieved the bodies and sent them to Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue for autopsy. On May 6, one Alamgir Hossain, also known as Delwar Hossain Dilu, was killed during a 'gun battle' with RAB. Earlier on May 5, Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam said the government would no more allow extrajudicial killing. The state minister for home, Tanjim Ahmed, said on Wednesday that the BNP-led coalition government created a culture of killing in custody based on a "politically-motivated hit list" and that those involved will be punished. "Following the confession of the arrested criminals, they would be taken to a place where they were killed," he told reporters after a top-level meeting on law and order.
