<TITLE> Abahani, Ashgabat fire blanks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  A defiant Abahani kept their hopes of playing in the AFC President's Cup semi-finals alive after holding Turkmenistan's FC Ashgabat to a goalless draw at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. The result meant both Abahani and Ashgabat FC are equal on four points, but Ashgabat, the last edition semi-finalists, emerged Group B champions on goal difference to book a semi-final place. The Sky Blues finished Group B runners-up and have still a bright chance of playing in the last four as the best runners-up among three groups, depending on the outcome of two other groups, which will be held in Nepal and Kyrgyzstan this month. Though the professional football league champions of Bangladesh were in hesitation whether to attack or defend against favourites Ashgabat, they finally produced superb performance on the pitch with a combination of defend and attack that forced the visitors to be kept at bay. Abahani interim coach Satyajit Das Rupu chose Samad Yousuf, M Sujan, Nazrul Islam, Wali Faisal and Ibnul Siraji in the backline with Nazrul and Wali successfully blocking both flanks, the positions from where Ashgabat created the attacks and enjoyed success in their 5-1 triumph against Sri Lanka Army. Midfielders Mamunul Islam, arguably the finest performer of the day along with Pranotosh Kumar and Jahed Parvez Chowdhury worked hard in the middle to control ball procession throughout the game, though they could hardly produce a telling pass to strike duo Jahid Hasan Emily and Ghanaian Iwudu Ibrabim, who were virtually shackled by the Turkmen. Abahani, however, had the first shot on target in the fifth minute though goalkeeper Harchhik Pavel faced no problem to grip Emily's effort. Ashgabat took 22 minutes to muster their first shot with Guvanch curling a corner from the right and goalkeeper Biplob superbly foiled the effort at the cost of a corner while Jahed almost opened the Turkmen's net from the left, but there was no one to cash in on the Jahed minus in the 35th minute. Guvanch once again curled a threatening cross from the left and it was again Biplob, who managed to palm it away two minutes from the breather before Ashgabat goalkeeper Pavel gripped a Sujan header smoothly from a scramble in first half injury time. Ashgabat stepped up their attacks after the break to keep the Abahani defenders busy in the first 15 minutes, but the hosts reorganised to control the midfield, but could hardly break the opponent backline. Abahani, however, almost grabbed the lead in the 75th minute when a long-range shot from Nazrul with a deflection was goal-bound, but keeper Pavel managed to save it. Minutes later Ashgabat from a counter attack went close to break the deadlock with Mirzoyev Arif and Serdar opening the Abahani defence before being denied by goalkeeper Biplob. With 11 minutes to go, Abahani turned into 4-4-2 instead of 5-3-2 with midfielder Abul Hossain replacing substitute right-back Wabaidur Rahman, but it had no impact, and they even almost conceded a own goal in the 89th minute when Wali was attempting to clear a Gunanch free-kick from the left. Abahani, however, were a bit unlucky in the stoppage time when substitute Shahajuddin Tipu, who struck the deciding goal against Sri Lanka Army, rattled the Ashgabat sidebar to frustrate the 4,000-strong crowd at the big bowl. bd
