 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)Hours after it busted a JMB den in Sheorapara in Mirpur on Thursday night, RAB found a training centre run by banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh on bomb-making at nearby east Manipur in the capital. RAB legal and media wing director Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com after the JMB bomb maestro Jahedur Rahman a.k.a. Bomb Mizan and his wife were quizzed after arrest, Mizan divulged some tips. Based on the information, they found another bomb-making plant at 676/2 East Manipuriparha. A room on the third floor in the house was found to be storing huge quantities of bomb-making equipment and materials including grenade casing, fuse, detonator, plastic explosives and chemicals, he said. Lt Col AKM Shamsuddin, RAB-4 director, told reporters at the scene, "We can easily call this place a laboratory. We have retrieved 11 live bombs from here." He said they also found huge quantities of bomb-making materials with which at least 1,000 bombs could be manufactured. "We have also found equipment and chemicals with which land mine and anti-personnel mine could be made. This is the first time we have found mine-making materials from a militants' den. "One of Mizan's assistants used to live here. Off and on, Mizan would come too and make bombs." Since JMB chief Shaikh Abdur Rahman and military commander Sidduiqul Islam alias Bangla Bhai's era, Mizan had been the outfit's bomb specialist, said Uddin. "RAB had been long out to nab him." Bombs were being manufactured for carrying out attacks on specific targets, he believed. RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker told bdnews24.com, "JMB set up a well-appointed laboratory here. Mizan used to come to this place and make bombs." Asked if the house owner would be taken to task, the RAB DG said, "Let's see." He urged all house owners to look into the tenants' antecedents before renting out places. Earlier, the law enforcers had asked the house owners to do the same and that anyone failing to take the precautionary measures would be punished. RAB said Mizan was from Charsi Khalifa area of Jamalpur. He had studied at Tejgaon Polytechnic Institute. It said it recovered a number of books on chemistry and two pistols from another room of the three-room flat. Emdad, the caretaker of the building, told reporters, "Mizan had rented the flat at a rent of Tk 5,000 per month in December. He said he would live here with his wife, children and his brother." "After some days, he sent his wife and children home on the plea that his wife was ill. His brother used to live here since. "Mizan also would visit and stay at times. But most of the time, the flat used to remain locked." One Chan Miah who lives in Kuwait owns the house. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque, RAB additional director general Col Reza Noor Rahman Khan and other police and RAB officials have visited the bomb den. bdnews
