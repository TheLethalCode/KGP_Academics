 BRUSSELS, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zenit St Petersburg coach Dick Advocaat will decide by the end of May whether to accept an offer to take charge of Belgium. "The deal is not done yet. He said he will give us an answer by the end of the month," a Belgian Football Association spokesman told Reuters on Friday. Rene Vandereycken was sacked as coach last month after poor results severely damaged the team's World Cup qualifying hopes. Belgium are fourth in Group Five, 11 points behind runaway leaders Spain with four games left. Nicknamed the 'Little General', Advocaat led Russian club Zenit to the UEFA Cup and European Super Cup double last year. He has previously coached Netherlands, South Korea and United Arab Emirates. Advocaat has also been in charge of PSV Eindhoven, winning the Dutch league and cup, and Rangers where he won two Scottish Premier League titles
