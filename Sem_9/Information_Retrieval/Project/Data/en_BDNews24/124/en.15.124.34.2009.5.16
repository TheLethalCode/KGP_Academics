<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com) Islamist militancy in Bangladesh is under control, RAB director general Khandaker Hassan Mahmud has said in a private TV channel. "We can say very well that the religious militancy is under control. No major occurrence happened in recent times though we heard of many activities of the militant groups," the chief of the elite force said in a programme on ATN Bangla on Friday night. His comments came hours after the recovery of huge cache of explosives and grenades after the JMB explosives kingpin Boma Mizan and his wife were quizzed after arrest on Thursday and Friday. Mahmud believed militancy can be curbed if public became more aware of the threat and more involved. He also hoped that the recently formed national committee on curbing and militancy and terrorism would also play a crucial role. On the crackdown in the early hours of Friday he said they had been searching for Mizan for long. It was clear from the JMB operatives arrested and documents seized that Mizan was an important member of the party. "It was too early to say that a good number of women are getting involved in militancy. But we have noticed they tend to get involved." The RAB chief said women were being recruited by the male activists. "Otherwise their involvement is very little." Asked why he thought Mizan's wife Sharmin Haque Lata had detonated a grenade inside the apartment, Mahmud said as the woman and her children survived it did not seem that it was a suicidal attempt. Mahmud believed that the suicide attempt was only a discrete incident. Observers say JMB is reorganising after reeling for long from crackdown. Asked about the issue, he indirectly said they were trying to capture JMB organiser Saidur Rahman. Home minister Sahara Khatun said on Friday those who were in power in the last seven years patronised militancy. "It will take some time to keep militancy under control," she said. RAB arrested Mizan on Thursday evening and later cracked down on a hideout of JMB militants at midnight in the capital's north Pirerbagh, Shewrapara in Mirpur. bdnew
