 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites FC Ashgabat began their AFC President's Cup campaign with an emphatic 5-1 win over Sri Lanka Army on Thursday at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Turkmenistan's FC Ashgabat, the semi-finalists of the last edition, now need just a draw on Saturday against hosts Abahani to see them in the last four from Group B. If the Abahani-Ashgabat match ends in a draw, then Turkmenistan's side will emerge group champions on better goal difference, and Abahani will have a chance to qualify for the semi-finals as the best runners-up in thee groups though the matches of two other groups are yet to begin. Forward Arif struck twice in the first half while midfielder Amanov slotted a brace and Urazov netted the fifth in the second half to see off Sri Lanka Army, who went 2-1 down to the hosts Abahani. Priyankara pulled a goal back for the losers. Ashgabat took just two minutes to open the account with striker Arif just nodding a Ahmed left-side free kick home. Sri Lanka Army, however, almost hit back in the eighth minute when Izzadeen, the scorer in the Army's 2-1 loss against Abahani, drove a Lasantha Kumar lob at the top of the box that went just inches over the Ashgabat goalpost. Then Guvanch played a neat one-two with Arif to advance into the danger zone and latched on to a powerful left-footer that went wide of the far post of Sri Lanka Army in the 25th minute. Five minutes later, the Army men found the back of the Ashgabat net from a free kick, but Chinese referee Fan Qi ruled out it for indirect spot kick while Arif doubled the margin in the 37th minute as the striker drove a low cross from Rustom past opponent goalkeeper Fernando. Ashgabat stepped up the tempo after the break and notched the third goal five minutes into the second half as Amanov capitalising on a lofted lob from Arif sent the ball over the on-rushing goalkeeper to make it 3-0. Sri Lanka Army reduced the margin to 3-1 in the 59th minute when Priyankara side-volleyed a minus from Izzadeen while Amanov turned into a provider for Ashgabat's fourth goal. Amanov slide a ball to unmarked Urazov, who came on in the 57th minute, and easily placed the ball to the right hand of Army goalkeeper Fernando. Then, Amanov sealed the match four minutes from time with Urazov feeding the ball him. bd
