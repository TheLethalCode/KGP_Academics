 Sylhet, May 16 (bdnews24.com)Upazilla chairmen and vice-chairmen will go to court this month to get back their stature and powers, they said on Saturday. "We respect law and so are taking a legal measure," Muhibur Rahman, chairman of Bishwanath Upazilla Parisad and convenor of Bangladesh Upazilla Parisad Chairmen and Vice Chairmen, said. He spoke to reporters after a views-exchange meeting at a hotel in the city at midday. Many of around 50 chairmen, vice chairmen and women vice chairmen, who attended the meeting, spoke. The local development is not the task of the government and yet it is intervening in projects which is 'entirely illegal', they said. Rahman said they will launch a movement if the government did not stop trying to make them 'puppets'. Rahman read out a written statement at the meeting. They demanded that the government upheld Upazila Parishad Act-1998 and revoke Upazilla Parishad Act-2009, and assign duty specifically to them, allow vehicular allowance and allocate funds for Upazila Parishad in the next budget. bdn
