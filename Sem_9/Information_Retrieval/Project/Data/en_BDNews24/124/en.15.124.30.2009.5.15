 MADRID, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Florentino Perez promised to construct a spectacular sporting project at Real Madrid if he is re-elected to the presidency, but gave away only nods and hints as to what that might entail on Thursday. "I am returning with more enthusiasm than when I first stood in 2000.

They won the Champions League in 2002 and league titles in 2001 and 2003, but Perez walked away as the club headed towards a third successive trophy-less season.
