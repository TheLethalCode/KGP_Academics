 ROME, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan want Ronaldinho to stay but they would consider a transfer request if the Brazilian playmaker made one, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday. The 29-year-old has struggled since his move to Serie A from Barcelona in July and has only managed the bench recently, prompting media speculation he could move in the close season. "Our desire is to keep Ronaldinho," Ancelotti told a news conference. "If then there's an expressed request from him to go it will be considered." Ancelotti denied reports in the British media that he will announce a move to Premier League Chelsea if second-placed Milan win at Udinese in Serie A on Saturday and ensure automatic qualification for the Champions League. "Tomorrow there will be absolutely nothing, no new developments," he said, although earlier he responded to questions about the speculation by saying: "We'll see what happens tomorrow evening." He described reports that he was already planning a move to Chelsea as "grotesque". The 49-year-old coach has repeatedly said he intends to serve out his contract at Milan, which runs until June 2010
