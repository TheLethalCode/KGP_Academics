 New Delhi, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The election commission began on Saturday the official count of votes after a month-long, mammoth general election that is expected to throw up a weak coalition. The main battle was between the Congress party-led United Progressive and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, but neither was expected to gain a majority from the 543 parliamentary seats at stake. Following are highlights from the vote count that will be updated over Saturday. The ruling Congress-led alliance was projected to win on Saturday a second term after a general election, according to television channels. The Congress party-led coalition was projected to win 243-250 of the total 543 parliamentary seats at stake, NDTV television projections said, as votes were counted. To rule, a party or a coalition requires the support of 272 members of parliament. The "Third Front", a loose coalition of smaller parties spearheaded by the communists, was ahead in 61 seats, state-run Doordarshan TV said. The communists were trailing in the election including in the bastion state of West Bengal which they have ruled for more than three decades, early projections said. The DMK and its allies, key Congress partners from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, was ahead in 24 of 39 seats in the state, according to Doordarshan TV. Congress party supporters, their arms in the air and carrying banners of star campaigners Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, set off firecrackers in celebration in New Delhi on news of the election returns. "Victory is ours, the writing is on the wall for the BJP and all the other parties that thought they could beat us," said Mukesh Narula, wearing a party flag as a bandana. COMMENTS ON ELECTION VERDICT VINOD MEHTA, editor of Outlook magazine: "So if you want to project from this, it looks like Congress will not only emerge as the single largest party but will be comfortably ahead." KAPIL SIBAL, Congress spokesman: "Together with our alliance partners we will have a safe majority. I think it is a vote for secularism, secular ideology and a vote for stability." AMBIKA SONI, Congress leader: "We had a positive program, with a positive manifesto for the next five years and the people have respected a transparent development-oriented government, which has inclusive growth for the people." VENKAIAH NAIDU, senior BJP leader: "The trends are out, not the results. I do concede Congress seems to be having a clear upper hand as of now." MARKET ANALYSTS SAMIR ARORA, fund manager, Helios Capital Management, Singapore: "This is a dream for the market. You could not have thought of anything better than this. The new government will not need the Left. Get ready for a 7-8 percent rally in the stock market on Monday. I don't expect them to do full-scale privatisation. They will some shares in government companies but will not cede control. "On reforms, what they were prevemnted from doing last time around, this time they will not be. So expect them to start off with some financial services and stronger pension reforms." SHUBHADA RAO, chief economist, Yes Bank, Mumbai: "It will help them pick up the pace of reforms as like-minded parties form the government, lending greater stability and ability to carry out reforms at a faster pace. Market sentiment and business confidence will find support." J MOSES HARDING, head of global markets, IndusInd Bank, Mumbai: "There is more clarity on who is going to win now. It is more or less a clear mandate. So it should be positive for all the markets. Congress has now to depend less on other parties. They can continue their focus on growth. The first half of the borrowing programme should go smoothly. Foreign investors will likely come into India now. This should help the stocks n the rupee. There could be some problem with money supply growth, which could put pressure on inflation. That is the only negative, otherwise it looks postive on the whole." President Pratibha Patil, who chooses which party is to be invited first to form a government, is meeting constitutional expert and former attorney general Ashok Desai to seek advice in the event of a tight result, local television said.
