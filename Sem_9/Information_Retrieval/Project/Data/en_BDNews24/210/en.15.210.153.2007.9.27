<TITLE> Polls plan keeping big leaders in jail will fail: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Thursday said free and fair elections would not be possible with the leaders of the main parties in jail. "The people are wary of any election without the two main leaders," Delwar told reporters at his Mohakhali home, referring to detained former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. "The election is still some time away according to the Election Commission's roadmap." "Nothing can be forecast regarding the election right now but it does seem that the government is working to a plan." "It is not possible to hold such a significant election without the participation of the major political parties," said the BNP secretary general. The Anticorruption Commission Wednesday filed a case against Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman, his wife Zobaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu on charges of concealing information on assets. Delwar termed the ACC cases as 'politically motivated'. "If the government chooses it can withdraw any case or exempt anyone from a case on special grounds," said Delwar. "I hope the government will consider this issue from a humanitarian point of view and think of the age of Tarique's only daughter Jaima Rahman." bdnews24.c
