<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com) Khaleda Zia is deeply concerned over the case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against her son Tarique Rahman, daughter-in-law Zobaida Rahman and Zobaida's mother Iqbalmand Banu, the former prime minister's lawyer said Wednesday. "Zia family members are in jail today. And now, family members of former naval chief, rear admiral, MA Khan have also been sued. I am upset and worried about it," lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan, who visited Khaleda in the special jail, quoted the former prime minister as saying. Azam said, "She (Khaleda) enquired about her grandchildren's studies while expressing worry about their future." Khaleda again requested the government for Coco's treatment in either Singapore or Bangkok, Azam added. "Arafat Rahman is sick. He was being treated abroad and that should be allowed to be continued," Azam quoted Khaleda as saying. Khaleda signed her tax return papers to be forwarded to the National Board of Revenue Thursday through the jail authorities, Azam said. He also said Khaleda had told him she knew nothing about the GATCO dispute and was not connected to it. The former shipping minister, late Akbar Hossain, knew about the matter, he said. The lawyer said Khaleda believes that she would be proven innocent in the GATCO scam case. bdnews24.com/nh/
