 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Thursday said in no unclear terms that his government would hold elections by the end of 2008. >>Full text of CA's speech to UNGA "In Bangladesh, the task of conducting a free and fair election is the responsibility of the Election Commission. The Election Commission, on its own accord, has announced a timeline for holding the next parliamentary election by the end of 2008." "Our administration is committed to ensuring that this timeframe is achieved," he said in his speech to the plenary meeting of the 62nd UN General Assembly at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. "We have pledged to put Bangladesh on a higher trajectory of good governance, rule of law and development. The CA made a pledge to "keep Bangladesh on the path of democracy". "My government is fully committed to ensuring that our reform initiatives are comprehensive and irreversible." Fakhruddin in his 15-minute speech asserted his government's "unflinching commitment to universal and inalienable human rights". "Any society committed to democracy requires the recognition and enforcement of human rights, and in Bangladesh, the fight against corruption and the strengthening of the rule of law go hand in hand with the protection of human rights," he said. On terrorism, he said Bangladesh remained resolute in its relentless campaign against international extremism and terrorism. "We recently acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism." "On the domestic front, we have taken stern measures against militant groups and their patrons." In the speech largely meant for image-building among world leaders of the administration he heads, Fakhruddin said: "The problems that we are facing today are not unique to Bangladesh. After all, in the developing world, democracy does not necessarily ensure good governance. "Many countries face similar problems of political violence, mis-governance and corruption." This is the second international event for Fakhruddin after the Saarc Summit in India since he took the reins of the caretaker government, where he represented Bangladesh in the backdrop of the state of emergency. Fakhruddin told the leaders of the crisis-riven countries: "We feel that a greater understanding of our challenges, and more importantly, of our efforts to rebuild political and social institutions can serve as benchmarks for others facing similar situations." He said Bangladesh represents an effective model of civil-military cooperation in crisis prevention. "One way in which we can share our governance experience is through our robust presence in UN peacekeeping operations." Towards the end of his speech, Fakhruddin touched on climate change, an issue that the other world leaders before him had highlighted in their speeches. "Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to global warming given that as much as 30 percent of our land will be submerged if the Bay of Bengal rises by just one metre. "We, therefore, urge enhanced international cooperation to meet the challenges of global warming and its consequence." bd
