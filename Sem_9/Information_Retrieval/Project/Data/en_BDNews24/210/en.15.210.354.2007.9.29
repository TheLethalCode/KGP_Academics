<TITLE> Britney's 'crime against choreography' </TITLE>

 Paul Majendie LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britney Spears' much maligned comeback at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards was picked as the most embarrassing dance sequence of all time in a survey published on Friday. Spears, whose performance was condemned as "a crime against choreography," topped the UKTV Gold poll after fighting off some tough competition from British comedian Ricky Gervais in "The Office" and actor Hugh Grant in "Love Actually." The singer, who shot to stardom in the late 1990s as a pop princess, has been plagued by personal crises that have proved irresistible fodder for tabloids around the globe. In July, she was derided for lip-syncing songs while performing at nightclubs in southern California. Critics then poured scorn on her earlier this month at the MTV Awards when she dressed as a stripper and mimed her new song "Gimme More." She is locked in a bitter custody battle with ex-husband Kevin Federline over their two sons. In her latest mishap, she was charged with hit and run and driving without a valid licence in California. Princess Diana's twirl around the White House dance floor with John Travolta was picked in the channel's survey as the most memorable dance routine of all time. Diana, a keen ballerina in her childhood, sparked a media frenzy in 1985 when displaying some spontaneous fancy footwork in Washington with Travolta during an official visit to the United States. Travolta filled three places in the top 10 -- he was also hailed for his hip-swivelling gyrations in "Saturday Night Fever" and "Grease." Diana also landed a second entry -- for dancing a duet with ballet star Wayne Sleep at the Royal Opera House to celebrate the birthday of Prince Charles. But nostalgia did get a look-in among fans with long memories. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers took fourth place for their classic celluloid dance routines in the Thirties while Gene Kelly landed sixth place for the 1952 classic "Singin' in the Rain."
