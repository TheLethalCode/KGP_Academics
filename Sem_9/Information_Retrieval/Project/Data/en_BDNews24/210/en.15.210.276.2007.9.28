 Biplob Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will use opaque steel ballot boxes for all local government elections including the city corporation elections, election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain said Friday. "The EC is set to utilise the sufficient number of ballot boxes it has in store during the forthcoming local elections to be held through 2008. "Besides, we don't have any transparent ballot boxes at the moment," Sakhawat said to bdnews24.com over telephone. "The political parties talked about using transparent ballot boxes for national elections, not for local elections. The issue of using transparent or opaque ballot boxes at the national elections will be settled after discussion with the political parties." "But one must consider the reality that transparent boxes have to be imported from abroad and therefore, they must be expensive and time-consuming to procure." The commissioner also said three political parties had favoured steel ballot boxes for the polls in the electoral reform dialogues. The city corporations of Rajshahi and Khulna have already started preparing voter lists with photos, he said. Rajshahi city authorities have made good progress and plan to hold elections in end-January or early-February. Dhaka City Corporation is scheduled to start enlisting voters on Dec 1. It will simultaneously issue the voters with national IDs too, he said. The EC will decide about holding the DCC and KCC elections after their voter registration is done, Sakhawat added. The tenure of Dhaka City Corporation ended on May 14, Rajshahi City Corporation on June 16 and the Khulna City Corporation on June 26. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda spelled out the elections timeline on July 15, which envisaged voter enrolment in 18 months and the national elections within 2008. During the BNP-led coalition regime, the Awami League and other political parties had demanded use of transparent ballot boxes and voter IDs to foil fake voting and ensure fair polls process. The EC says voter registration with photos undertaken by the incumbent government should do and expensive transparent ballot boxes wouldn't be necessary as the election processes would be transparent. bdne
