 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government and the Anticorruption Commission Monday sought Supreme Court freezes on the High Court bail to former prime minister Khaleda Zia and the stay on GATCO corruption case proceedings. The court of the chamber judge of the Appellate Division set Tuesday for next hearing on the appeal. "The government and the Anticorruption Commission have appealed to the Supreme Court for a stay order on the High Court order granting bail to Khaleda Zia and suspending the proceedings of the GATCO case," state counsel ASM Khalequzzaman told reporters. "The hearing on the appeal will be held at the court of the chamber judge on Tuesday," he said. On the latest government appeal, Khaleda's main counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq told reporters: "Political governments appeal for a stay on such orders. The caretaker government should not appeal. Khaleda Zia has been detained in the sub-jail. She is not fleeing the country." He said there was no precedent of a High Court verdict frozen in any civilised country. A High Court bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury Sunday granted bail to Khaleda and stayed proceedings of the GATCO case on a writ petition by the BNP chairperson. bdnews24
