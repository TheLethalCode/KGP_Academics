 MILAN, Oct 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kaka converted a second-half penalty to earn AC Milan a 1-1 draw with lowly Catania at San Siro as the European champions' poor domestic form continued on Sunday. Juventus moved up to second in the table when David Trezeguet's stoppage-time goal snatched a 1-0 win over cross-town rivals Torino. Milan, who visit Celtic in the Champions League on Wednesday, have not won in Serie A since their opening-day victory at Genoa five games ago. Kaka levelled the score after Uruguayan midfielder Jorge Martinez had headed the visitors in front in the 25th minute. Milan thought they had equalised three minutes after falling behind when an Andrea Pirlo free kick hit the crossbar and Filippo Inzaghi netted the ricochet, but the goal was disallowed for handball. Kaka's equaliser came in the 48th minute after Catania's Mark Edusei had intercepted a cross with his arm. Keeper Ciro Polito did well to stop a powerful Kaka shot from outside the area 15 minutes into the second half. Milan tried to push forward but Catania defended well and created some good chances on the counter-attack. After six games Milan are 11th with seven points. "We're not going through a good spell. We're a bit careless and a bit slow," Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti told Sky television. "There is no tension or friction. The team is very serene and serenity was the key to winning the Champions League last year". The Turin derby had been short of goalmouth incident before Trezeguet took advantage of a loose header to volley the ball home from the edge of the box. It was his seventh goal of the season. Juventus have 13 points from six games, one point fewer than leaders Inter Milan, who thrashed AS Roma 4-1 on Saturday. Fiorentina are third on 12 points after Saturday's 3-0 win at Tuscan rivals Livorno, while Roma are fourth with 11 points. Lazio, who rested several first-choice players ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match against Real Madrid, drew 1-1 at Reggina on Sunday
