 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com) - Sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury Wednesday congratulated chess player Abdullah Al Rakib on achieving the Grandmaster title. Tapan Chowdhury hoped Rakib would achieve more success in future. The sports adviser said, "His (Rakib) achievement inspires the little chess players in country, who will see more grandmasters in future." The third quarter presidential board meeting of the FIDE, held on September 13-14 in Mexico, approved Rakib's Grandmaster title, and the FIDE Elishta (Russia) office Tuesday confirmed it to the Bangladesh Chess Federation. Rakib, who earned his third GM norm in April, is now the country's fourth Grandmaster after GM Niaz Murshed (1987), GM Ziaur Rahman (2002) and GM Reefat Bin Sattar (2006).
