 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League sits with Worker's Party Saturday as part of a series of discussions with allies in the 14-party combine ahead of the upcoming discussions with the Election Commission. The deliberations aim to ensure that the alliance partners and political parties of similar ideology table similar proposals in line with the 31-point electoral reform proposal made by the combine when they sit with the Election Commission. Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Workers Party, told bdnews24.com Friday that the meeting will take place at the Gulshan home of AL acting president Zillur Rahman at 11am. Tofail Ahmed, a member of the AL's policymaking presidium who will mediate the talks, told bdnews24.com that he was optimistic about talks with the EC. "The goal of the 14-party alliance has always been same. We want to outline an identical [reforms] proposal for the elections to be acceptable to all. "Dialogues with the Election Commission would be based on this premise. That is what has prompted the talks with allies in the 14-party grouping," he said. "The two-party talks have been initiated to rejuvenate the 14-party alliance which was forged to bring about political reforms," Tofail added. bdnews2
