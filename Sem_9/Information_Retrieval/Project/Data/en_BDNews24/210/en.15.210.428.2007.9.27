 LONDON, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Rolling Stones may be ageing rockers but their pulling power is undimmed -- they topped the charts with the world's most successful music tour in the latest edition of Guinness World Records. Giving a handy fillip to their pension funds, the group's 'A Bigger Bang Tour' took $437 million dollars to give them a new record. Madonna also made the annual compendium as the most successful female artist -- her 60-date 'Confessions' tour grossed almost $200 million. That meant she earned more than $3 million per concert.

The highest-grossing actor award goes to Samuel L Jackson. His 75 movies have made over $7.84 billion at the global box office. Casino Royale, the film debut of Daniel Craig as the world's most famous spy, set a record as the most successful James Bond film of all time, grossing more than $587 million. The film also boasted the most cannon rolls in a car -- stuntman Adam Kirley did seven in Bond's Aston Martin DBS. For quirky quiz fans in search of a Trivial Pursuit teaser, Guinness even lists a category for the shortest title of any Oscar-winning film. It's the Algerian movie 'Z', which won two Oscars in 19
