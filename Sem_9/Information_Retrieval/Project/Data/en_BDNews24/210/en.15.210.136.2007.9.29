 ISLAMABAD, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani police clashed with lawyers and opposition activists outside the Election Commission on Saturday as it scrutinised military president Pervez Musharraf's nomination for re-election on Oct. 6. The Supreme Court dismissed on Friday challenges to army chief Musharraf's bid to seek re-election, clearing a major hurdle to his securing another term. But despite the ruling, nuclear-armed Pakistan faces months of uncertainty as Musharraf faces fresh objections to his bid to control a country whose support is seen as crucial to U.S.-led efforts to stabilise Afghanistan and battle al Qaeda. Violence erupted outside the Election Commission shortly after Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived. Aziz officially proposed Musharraf for president, and was at the commission in case he needed to defend the nomination during scrutiny. Musharraf's opponents said they would file objections to his nomination. In all, 43 candidates have filed papers to run in the presidential election. A final list will be published on Monday. Police fired tear gas and used batons to break up a group of lawyers and opposition activists who tried to march from the Supreme Court, across an avenue, to the commission. Black-suited lawyers, who have been at the forefront of opposition to Musharraf since he tried to fire the chief justice in March, threw stones at police and chanted "go Musharraf, go!" Two lawyers were seen with a bloody heads before the protesters dispersed, a witness said. "It was a peaceful protest but police beat up women lawyers. Policemen were laughing and enjoying it as they were beating lawyers," said prominent human rights lawyer Asma Jehangir, wearing a blood-stained white scarf. Security men in plain clothes were seen taking into custody a leader of opposition lawyers, Ali Ahmed Kurd. Police were seen beating another of their leaders, Aitzaz Ahsan. "DASHES HOPE" Members of parliament and of provincial assemblies will vote next Saturday for a president before the assemblies are dissolved for a general election due by mid-January. Musharraf's ruling alliance is expected to suffer big losses in the general election, losing its parliamentary majority. Opposition parties say they will resign their seats before the presidential vote, even though Musharraf has vowed to quit the army, his main source of power, after winning another term. The Supreme Court heard three petitions challenging Musharraf's right to hold the posts of president and army chief, the legality of being elected in uniform, and whether he can get a mandate from the outgoing assemblies. The court's dismissal of the challenges on the grounds they were not "maintainable" had averted turmoil but much uncertainty lay ahead, newspapers said. Had the court blocked Musharraf's re-election, analysts say he might have imposed emergency rule or even martial law. "The ... judgement dashes the opposition's hope and disappoints those who find the very idea of a man in uniform contesting a presidential election repugnant," the English-language Dawn said. "Nevertheless, the doomsday scenario is now behind us." The News said: "It seems the political uncertainty and air of dissent that has enveloped the country in recent months is not going to dissipate any time soon." Legal analysts said in ruling the three petitions "not maintainable" the Supreme Court was not saying they had no merit, but the Election Commission, not the Supreme Court, might be the appropriate forum to rule on them.
