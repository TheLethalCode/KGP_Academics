<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) -- ZA Khan, a backer of the Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan-led faction of BNP, Saturday said the party would not go for any united movement or compromise with any party discarding BNP ideals. "No unity will be forged with anybody outside the ideals of the party. However, unity can be with those believing in the nationalist ideology," he told reporters after a meeting with Bhuiyan, who heads the BNP pro-reform faction, at his Gulshan home. Asked about the comments on a united movement by acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman and BNP's pro-Khaleda faction secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Khan differed with them and said: "Unity can be on any issue on the basis of nationalist ideals." "We won't sacrifice our ideals. For the time being, we are not thinking about any united movement. It is not yet time for movement." Zillur Rahman had earlier told reporters: "There can be a united movement with the BNP if there is similarity of opinion and ideals." Delwar, responding positively to the idea, said: "Even if there is no similarity of opinion and ideals, there can still be a united and simultaneous issue-based movement with the Awami League in the greater interest of people." Khan said: "We represent the mainstream BNP that is one and united. We are in the BNP as it is the party of Shaheed Zia. Those who have deviated from the ideals of the BNP cannot claim themselves to be BNP workers." Criticising Hannan Shah's statement on the list of corruption suspects, Khan said: "There is nothing for him (Hannan Shah) to be excited if the name of anyone from the BNP is on the list." He said the BNP was continuing reform activities and would resume work as a strong, democratic party soon. bdnew
