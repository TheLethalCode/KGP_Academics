 BUDAPEST, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany called on Thursday for a crackdown on corruption after he was questioned in a case involving charges that a Socialist politician had siphoned off government funds. Gyurcsany became the first sitting Hungarian prime minister since the end of communist rule to be asked to make a statement to prosecutors on Tuesday. He was asked to account for his role in spending funds during his spell as youth minister. The investigation relates to Janos Zuschlag, a former MP from Gyurcsany's Socialist Party, who has been detained on charges that he abused funds from the Youth and Sports Ministry between 2002 and 2004. Zuschlag denies the charges. "I did not suspect it (corruption). Had I suspected it, I would have ordered an investigation," Gyurcsany told journalists on Thursday. As well as Gyurcsany, prosecutors plan to question other former youth ministers, including from the opposition. The main Fidesz opposition and its media allies have frequently attacked Gyurcsany, a millionaire, over his wealth which was earned in real estate deals in the early 1990s, but have not found any evidence that Gyurcsany did anything wrong. The investigation into the funds from the youth ministry comes at the same time as Fidesz has charged that most of the billions of euros of European Union funding which will flow into Hungary in coming years will be creamed off. Gyurcsany denies this and says he will implement a programme to tackle corruption, having already made big efforts to check Hungary's black economy which accounts for around a fifth of national output. He caused outrage among MPs earlier this week when he said that expenses would from now on require receipts. "Every bit of corruption must be eradicated, fully," Gyurcsany said on Thursday. Despite a plunge in support for the Socialists after the leaking of a tape in which Gyurcsany admitted to lying about the poor state of finances to win re-election in 2006, he appears to enjoy firm support from his party. Gyurcsany has won plaudits from the European Commission and investors for slashing Hungary's huge budget deficit and putting the country back on the path to the euro curren
