 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com) - The National Sports Council (NSC) has agreed in principle to upgrade the Bangabandhu National Stadium in line with FIFA requirements. "We, along with NSC officials, visited the BNS to see the existing condition of the gates, dressing rooms, field, floodlights and bathrooms and they have agreed in principle to upgrade those things in line with the FIFA guidelines," said Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. The FIFA, world football governing body, is assessing the football venues across the world, and advises respective federations to upgrade their venues if required. A one-member FIFA delegation headed by Salman Mohammad Namshan also visited Bangladesh last July and advised the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) to upgrade the entrances, the dressing rooms, bathrooms and floodlights of the BNS to get FIFA recognition as an international venue. However, the NSC is likely to prepare only the uneven surface of the BNS before the scheduled World Cup pre-qualifier between Bangladesh and Tajikistan on October 8. "We have requested them to remove the shops inside the entrances as the spectators frequently get confused about those entrances," said Malu adding that the NSC officials had told them that they would take necessary steps to fulfill the FIFA requirements. Malu said that the NSC would also construct a system to drain rainwater out of the pitch that gets submerged even after slight rainfall. The NSC is likely to start the work in May, 2008 after the second professional football league, said Malu. bdn
