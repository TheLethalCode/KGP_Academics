<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares edged up by midday on Monday as acquisition talk and gains in miners and travel stocks offset the impact of a hefty writedown at Swiss bank UBS that trained the spotlight back on credit worries. At 1020 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,552.66 points, after falling 0.6 percent in early trade when UBS unveiled a $3.4-billion loss, management changes and job cuts in one of the top casualties of a crunch in credit markets. Rival Credit Suisse said its results would be "adversely impacted" by the credit market turmoil, but that it would remain profitable in the third quarter. UBS fell 0.6 percent and Credit Suisse was flat. The DJ Stoxx European banks index was down 0.6 percent, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale among top losers, each falling around 1.4 percent. But mining stocks rose, and merger and acquisition talk returned to limit losses and nudge the benchmark into positive territory. Sugar and sweetener maker Tate & Lyle climbed 6 percent after a media report said it could be vulnerable to a takeover by a big food company such as Nestle. The stock had fallen 30 percent on Friday after a profit warning. German travel group TUI rose 5 percent on report that investor Guy Wyser-Pratte wanted to raise his stake in the company, and Air France-KLM gained 3.9 percent after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction list. But investors still kept their sights focused on financial stocks, which have taken a battering in recent months due to turmoil in credit markets stemming from a crisis in subprime, or risky, U.S. mortgages. Analysts and traders said that more bad news would emerge from the banks, but that the stocks were beginning to look cheap. "We'll probably have other banks emerging with things to declare, using the opportunity to make provisions for activities that were not too successful," said Mark Bon, a fund manager at Canada Life. "But quite a bit of the bad news on banks is priced in, and there's some valuation support starting to emerge," he added. Banks and other financials led a 13-percent decline in the broader European market in one month from mid-July, though a rate cut from the Federal Reserve spurred a recovery that has taken the FTSEurofirst 300 up 4.6 percent so far this year. "There's a realisation that once banks get this out of the way, there's no reason why they shouldn't be profitable again. The street has been short UBS, and now it doesn't see much further downside," said a trader in London. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline benefited from investors heading for defensive stocks in uncertain times, with the index heavyweight stock gaining more than 1 percent to break a five-day losing streak. bdnews24.com/lq/1852hrs Firmer copper and gold prices made miners the top sectoral gainer, with Kazakhmys up 3.4 percent, Vedanta up 2 percent, Xstrata up 1.4 percent and Lonmin up 1.45 percent. But German pharmaceuticals trader Celesio tumbled 10 percent after the company said it no longer expects double-digit pre-tax profit growth for the period 2006-2010. Germany's DAX index was up 0.1 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 was flat. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank hold their policy-setting meetings this week, events that will be closely watched after the Federal Reserve cut its main Fed funds rate by
