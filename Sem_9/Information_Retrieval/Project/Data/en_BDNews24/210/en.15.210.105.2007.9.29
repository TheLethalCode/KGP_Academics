 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor DHAKA, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - Grameenphone has urged the telecoms regulator to properly manage radio frequency as it is critical to retain the mobile phone market's growth and narrow the digital divide. "Bangladesh will have 45 million to 50 million mobile users within two to three years," the company's new CEO Anders Jensen said in a press briefing Saturday. He said GP will require further frequency to withstand such growth without compromising the quality of voice and data services. Jensen's predecessor Eric Aas also briefed the media. He said 20 percent (three million) of GP's 15 million customers use mobile internet, which has become ubiquitous. "Ninety-eight percent of the country's population is under Grameenphone network's coverage but more frequency is needed to serve the growing customers," said Aas who has handed over GP's charge to Jensen. Both of them apprehend, "Otherwise the industry will be forced to deploy excessive base stations, which will make the investments costlier and impact the tariff as a result." Jensen, a 38-year-old Swedish, is the first non-Norwegian CEO of Grameenphone and the fifth heading the country's dominant mobile outfit since launching in 1997. The former executive of Telenor Sweden is aware of the challenge in his first Asian assignment. Telenor Sweden's monthly average revenue per user is nine-times higher than Grameenphone. But Grameenphone's pre-tax margin (EBITDA) is more than twice of Telenor's Swedish venture. "I will make sure that Grameenphone's EBIDTA margin does not slide," Jensen told bdnews24.com on the sidelines of press briefing. Erik Aas has been also extensively briefing his successor on Bangladesh. He said the infrastructure rollout, especially ensuring seamless power supply, was his biggest challenge. In business front, Grameenphone's outgoing chief does not consider the fixed phone providers' "limited mobility" being any threat for the cellphone industry. "Let the customers decide if they are happy with a phone that works only in a small area," Aas said. "Even if the fixed phone operators are given full mobility licence, they can neither match the supremacy of GSM technology nor can they invest like the mobile phone operators." Erik Aas said only 50 percent of the population was under Grameenphone's coverage when he became its CEO three years back. "Now we cover 98 percent people and we have done it in just three years." Jensen is now facing the challenge to deliver the services at good quality. Ericsson has been the sole supplier of Grameenphone's core network. Chinese Huawei and Finnish-German joint venture Nokia Siemens Network are desperate to end the Swedish Ericsson's dominance in GP. Erik Aas has refused to comment on that.
