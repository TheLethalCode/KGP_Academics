<TITLE> Anti-US Chavez urges Bush help on Colombia hostages </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CARACAS, Wed Sep 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez urged his antagonist US President George W Bush to help him secure the release of hostages, including three Americans, held by Colombia's FARC rebels. Supported by neighboring Colombia's president, Alvaro Uribe, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who wants a French-Colombian woman freed, Chavez has taken on the role of mediator with the 40-year-old rebel group. "To President Bush: hopefully you can help us," Chavez said late on Tuesday during a televised meeting in Caracas with relatives of the US hostages. He did not specify how Bush should help. Right-wing Uribe is an unusual partner for Venezuela's self-styled socialist revolutionary. Any cooperation between Chavez and Bush -- a man he calls the devil -- would be the first between two leaders whose governments clash over everything from oil prices to arms deals to democracy. U.S. officials have charged that Chavez has openly aided FARC, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, without presenting evidence to support the accusations. Washington, which brands the FARC a terrorist group, says it welcomes any effort to win the hostages' release through mediation. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice approves of the possible involvement of U.S. congressmen in the mediation, Uribe said on Tuesday. The United States is a key player in Colombia's conflict, having provided billions of dollars in military aid and holding in prison extradited leaders of the FARC. The FARC says it wants to swap its captives for rebels held in government jails and demands its comrades held in the United States are returned to Colombia. "That's a tough issue," Chavez said. "To be able to free everyone, that's what they propose: it all happens at once." A sticking point so far has been the FARC's demand for a safe area to hold the negotiations. The FARC has held hundreds of police, soldiers and politicians for years, including French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt, snatched in 2002, and the Americans, who were taken while on a counter-narcotics mission a year lat
