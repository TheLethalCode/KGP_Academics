 BLACKPOOL, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Conservatives will unveil a series of tax-cutting pledges on Monday as the opposition party scrambles to prepare for a possible snap election. The party, meeting in Blackpool for its annual conference, is trailing badly in the polls, with one survey over the weekend putting it 11 points behind Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour Party.

Those trying to sue teachers for negligence after an accident would have to show there had been "reckless disregard" of obvious risks, copying legislation already in place in Western Australia. Education spokesman Michael Gove will unveil plans to extend the government's Academy schools programme to make it easier for charities, churches and voluntary groups to set up new, independent, state-funded schools. Parents would have the right to demand funds from local authorities to establish and run these so-called Pioneer schools, which would be free from local authority control and set their own teacher pay rates and curricul
