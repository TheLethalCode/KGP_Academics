 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)The government starts its so-called 'open skies policy' on Oct 1 to relieve a huge backlog of Bangladeshi workers unable to join their overseas jobs. But Biman, Emirates, Saudia Airlines and Qatar Airways are currently unable to meet demand due to a shortage of aircraft, aviation industry officials said Sunday. Once the policy is adopted, thousands of Middle East-bound Bangladeshi workers will be able to travel to those countries, airlines representatives said. To ease the congestion, the government agreed on Sept 19 to implement an 'open skies policy'. Under the plan, foreign airlines will be able to operate as many flights as they want for three months starting Oct 1 from Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet international airports. The decision follows a Civil Aviation and Tourism Ministry meeting on Sept 10 which reviewed domestic and foreign proposals from airlines to introduce the temporary measure. Biman is currently in negotiations with Phuket Air to rent a Boeing-747 to help meet the demand. "We do not currently have adequate planes to take advantage of the open skies policy," Biman managing director MA Momen told bdnews24.com. "If possible, we will lease a Phuket Air Boeing-747. It all depends on how our negotiations go." "We hope to be able to operate both scheduled and additional flights if we secure the aircraft," Momen said. HAM Bari, secretary general of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com that he had spoken to the Dhaka offices of Emirates, Saudia and Qatar Airways on the 'open skies policy'. Bari said the airlines cannot avail themselves of the opportunity now, as they are running short of planes. An official with the national carrier said they are desperate to put on additional flights to Kuala Lumpur and Dubai to take advantage of the huge demand. Only five of Biman's aging fleet of 13 aircraft are currently operational. bdnews24
