 ISLAMABAD, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani police wielding batons and firing tear gas clashed on Saturday with lawyers and activists opposed to President Pervez Musharraf as the Election Commission accepted his nomination for an Oct. 6 vote. On Friday, the Supreme Court dismissed challenges to army chief Musharraf's bid to seek re-election, clearing a major hurdle to his securing another term. But despite the ruling, nuclear-armed Pakistan faces months of uncertainty as Musharraf faces fresh objections to his bid to control a country whose support is seen as crucial to US-led efforts to stabilise Afghanistan and battle al Qaeda. Violence erupted outside the Election Commission in Islamabad after Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived. Aziz officially proposed Musharraf for president, and was at the commission in case he needed to defend the nomination during scrutiny. Musharraf's opponents later raised objections to his nomination, but the commission rejected them. A lawyer for the opposition said Musharraf's nomination would be challenged in court. In all, 43 candidates have filed papers to run and a final list will be published on Monday. Members of parliament and of provincial assemblies will vote for a president next Saturday before the assemblies are dissolved for a general election due by mid-January when Musharraf's ruling alliance is expected to suffer losses and lose its majority. Opposition parties say they will resign their seats before the presidential vote, even though Musharraf has vowed to quit the army, his main source of power, after winning another term. Police baton-charged a group of about 200 lawyers and activists who tried to march from the Supreme Court, across an avenue, to the Election Commission. Black-suited lawyers, who have been at the forefront of opposition to Musharraf since he tried to fire the chief justice in March, threw stones at police and chanted "go Musharraf, go!" as police fired tear gas. Two lawyers were seen with bloody heads and several people were overcome by tear gas. An official said 12 police were hurt. "It was a peaceful protest but police beat up women lawyers. Policemen were laughing and enjoying it as they were beating lawyers," said prominent human rights lawyer Asma Jehangir, wearing a blood-stained white scarf. "HOPE DASHED" Security men took into custody one leading opposition lawyer, Ali Ahmed Kurd. Police beat another of their leaders, Aitzaz Ahsan. Police later fired tear gas to keep the protesters bottled up in the Supreme Court compound. Reporters said police also beat them and reporters later pulled Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan from a vehicle and roughed him up. Cable news channels went off the air in Islamabad but it was not clear if authorities had blocked them. Aziz was for a while unable to leave the commission because of the disturbances outside, witnesses said. Police and protesters also clashed in Karachi and Lahore. The Supreme Court dismissed three petitions challenging Musharraf's right to hold the posts of both president and army chief, the legality of being elected in uniform, and whether he should receive a mandate from the outgoing assemblies. Their dismissal on the grounds the challenges were not "maintainable" had averted turmoil but much uncertainty lay ahead, newspapers said. Had the court blocked Musharraf's re-election, analysts say he might have imposed emergency rule. "The ... judgment dashes the opposition's hope and disappoints those who find the very idea of a man in uniform contesting a presidential election repugnant. Nevertheless, the doomsday scenario is now behind us," the Dawn newspaper said. The News newspaper said the verdict might embolden the authorities to be more aggressive with the opposition.
