<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com) The public's right to information needs to be brought under a legal framework, said speakers at a seminar Friday. "We must make necessary laws, keeping balance between maintaining official secrecy to ensure state security and good governance, and ensuring people's right to information," former chief justice Habibur Rahman said. The seminar was organised at the LGED auditorium in the capital to mark the International Right to Information Day. Member of the Law Commission Dr M Enamul Haque, however, said information should be held back from citizens for national security only in the interests of the people. Economist Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud said: "The right to information has to be viewed as a tool for empowering people." "Public awareness is a social capital and it has to be enriched though right to information," added Mahmud. "It is better if the right to information law is enacted by an elected government," said Rahman, who headed the 1996 caretaker government, said. "It will make more visible the acceptability of the law and government's accountability." An elected government must accept the right to information and implement it sincerely, he said. "Those that govern must give information to citizen's for the sake of the governance," said Rahman. The key-note paper of the seminar pointed out that information played an important role in dealing with natural disasters. The right information about impending natural disasters must reach people in time, the paper said. The International Right to Information Day has been observed on Sept 28 since 2002. Massline Media Centre and Manusher Jonno Foundation co-organised the seminar. bdnews2
