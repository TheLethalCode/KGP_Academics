 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has sought all import invoices for milk powder between January and September to identify reasons for the huge difference in import and retail prices, a senior commerce ministry official said Thursday. The decision came at a meeting between the government and importers at the commerce ministry, with commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed in the chair. The National Board of Revenue and Bangladesh Rifles officials attended the meeting. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed had earlier asked the commerce adviser to take a look why the retail prices of milk powder is 2.3 times the import value at Chittagong port. The interim government head had pointed out that no other imported commodity had such a large price difference between its import and retail prices. Milk power is a staple for children in Bangladesh with almost all demand being met by imports. Only a few importers control the import process, which leaves scope for price manipulations in the market, officials said. "We've asked the importers to give us their import invoices of the Jan-Sep period so that the commerce ministry can find out the reasons for the price hike at two levels and accordingly take follow-up actions," the official, who attended the meeting, told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. The official said: "We'll verify the importers' prices and the customs approved value of milk powder." Importers who attended the meeting said that the price of milk powder had almost doubled between November 2006 and September 2007. "We've asked the government to impose specific duty on import of milk powder, as is done for sugar," Faruque Hasan of Sanowara Corporation, one of the major importers, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. According to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, prices of a kilogram of imported packaged milk powder has risen almost 50 percent in last one year. The chief adviser's letter added: "If selling milk powder packed in tin boxes adds to the prices, importers should make it available in hygienically packed cellophane bags." "I don't think the difference between the import cost and retail cost of edible oil is anywhere near that for milk powder. Edible oil also requires refining and packaging," said the chief adviser's letter. bd
