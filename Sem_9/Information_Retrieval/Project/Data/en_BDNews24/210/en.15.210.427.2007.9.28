 NEW DELHI, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's judiciary is being accused of gagging the media and acting above the law after a court sentenced journalists and a cartoonist to jail for accusing a retired chief justice of misconduct while in office. Mid Day, a Delhi tabloid, ran a series of stories in May which said Y K Sabharwal, until recently the most powerful man in the Indian judiciary, had used his office to benefit his sons' businesses, among other allegations. Last week, Delhi High Court sentenced two editors who reported the stories, the paper's publisher and a cartoonist to four months in jail for criminal contempt of court, although they were released on bail while they appeal. Many commentators have accused the judiciary of using the law to gag the media and shield itself from scrutiny. Politicians and retired Supreme Court judges have added to calls for an inquiry. "Instead of going into the truth of these charges, which the judiciary can do with its means and mechanisms, it looks like orders are being passed to terrorise these people," Somnath Chatterjee, speaker of the lower house of parliament, was quoted as saying in Friday's Hindustan Times. Around 50 journalists protested in Delhi on Friday, demanding the case be dropped. Twenty-six activists and journalists applied on Thursday to be included as defendants in the case, saying they reiterated the allegations, but their application was rejected. The high court argued the stories damaged the reputation of the Supreme Court, although Sabharwal had retired months before the stories ran. "We live in a sort of judicial dictatorship," wrote Arundhati Roy, an activist and novelist, in an article in Outlook magazine. She said the contempt law "arms the judiciary with formidable, arbitrary powers to silence its critics and to imprison anyone who asks uncomfortable questions". Many of the paper's allegations relate to Sabharwal's controversial judgment in 2006 that unauthorised shops and other businesses running in Delhi's residential areas be closed down. Thousands of businesses have been affected, and at least three people died when police fired on protesters last year. The paper printed documents, and even a photograph of Sabharwal's letterbox, which purported to show that his sons had been running businesses out of his two homes, and were partners with two large commercial real estate developers in Delhi. The paper said commercial property developers stood to gain as many shops and businesses were forced to relocate to malls and office parks. It accused Sabharwal of asking for the case to be brought to his court when there was a conflict of interests. Sabharwal, writing earlier this month in the Times of India, denied any conflict of interests, and said he had never made a ruling for the benefit of his family. He said his sons' businesses were registered at his official home only for postal purposes, without his knowledge. He added the businesses have since been registered elsewhere. bdnews24.com/lq/1741hrs He also said that while his sons were business partners with mall developers, his sons were not involved with malls themselves, but instead were developing offices for software
