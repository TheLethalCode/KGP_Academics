<TEXT>
 Sept. 28 - Western governments have vowed to impose new sanctions on Myanmar after its crackdown on protesters demanding an end to 45 years of military rule and economic hardship. Here is an overview of the sanctions imposed over the years against the former Burma. AUSTRALIA: -- Visa restrictions on senior junta figures and a ban on defence exports since 1988. -- Australia said on Sept. 27, 2007 it planned targeted sanctions against leaders of the regime. CANADA: -- Limited trade sanctions. Permits are required for exports to Myanmar and one other country (Belarus). EUROPEAN UNION: -- In its 1996 common position on Myanmar, the 27-member European Union confirmed an arms embargo imposed in 1990 and the suspension of defence cooperation in 1991. It also set conditions for assistance and imposed a visa ban on senior military and government officials and their families. -- In 1997, citing forced labour issues, it scrapped duty-free access to the EU market for Myanmar's products. -- In 2000, it targeted the assets of people linked to economic or political activities of the junta. -- In 2004, the EU prohibited registered companies or organisations from making financial loans or credit available to named state-owned enterprises. NEW ZEALAND: -- A ban on visas for military leaders and their families. UNITED STATES: -- In 1988, broad sanctions imposed after a crackdown on student-led protests. -- In 1997, new investment in Myanmar by US persons or entities prohibited. -- In 2003, Burma Freedom and Democracy Act banned all imports from Myanmar, restricted financial services, froze the assets of certain Myanmar financial institutions, and extended visa restrictions on junta officials. Congress has renewed the Act annually. -- On Sept. 26, 2007, President George W Bush announced a tightening of economic sanctions on the leaders of the regime and an expanded visa ban on those responsible for human rights abuses and their families. -- The United States has accused Myanmar of condoning the use of forced labour. That could lead to restrictions on certain types of foreign assistance, such as funding for government officials and employees to participate in educational and cultural exchange programm
