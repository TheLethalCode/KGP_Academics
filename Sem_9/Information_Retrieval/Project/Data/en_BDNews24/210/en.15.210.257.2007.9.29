 YANGON, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Internet access was restored briefly in military-ruled Myanmar on Saturday a day after a Web blackout believed to have been imposed to stop reports and pictures of a major crackdown reaching the outside world. Internet users inside the former Burma were able to see domestic Web pages as well as send e-mails outside the country for a couple of hours before connections failed again. Pictures and video footage relayed by citizen reporters have played a major role in fuelling diplomatic revulsion at the crackdown against 45 years of military rule and deepening economic hardship. State media say nine people have been killed, although world leaders including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown say the figure is likely to be far higher. The widespread use of modern technology by protesters and dissident news networks is in stark contrast to 19 years ago, when reports of massive casualties from soldiers shooting into the crowds took days to leak out.
