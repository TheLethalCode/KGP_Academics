 KARACHI, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis scored his 25th test century to guide South Africa to a commanding 294 for three after the opening day of the first test against Pakistan at the National Stadium on Monday. Kallis (118 not out) and Hashim Amla (71) put on 170 for the third wicket to justify captain Graeme Smith's decision to bat first on a slow pitch. Ashwell Prince was also unbeaten at the close, on three. It was a triumphant return to the team for Kallis, who stepped down as vice-captain in August after being dropped from the Twenty20 World Cup squad. Seam bowler Mohammad Asif broke the third-wicket stand with the fifth delivery of the second new ball, a leg cutter clipping Amla's off stump to end a dogged innings that contained six fours and one six. Amla made only 22 runs in 67 balls after tea in contrast to Kallis who took 59 deliveries to sprint from 46 to reach his first century in 10 tests, and second against Pakistan. South Africa had been given a solid start of 87 by Smith (42) and Herschelle Gibbs (54) who reached 6,000 test runs. Smith was trapped leg before by Mohammad Hafeez before lunch while Gibbs was caught at gully by Hafeez slashing at paceman Umar Gul
