<TEXT>
 Kiev, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainians began voting to chose a new parliament on Sunday in an election that both President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich hope will resolve months of political turmoil. Polls to elect the 450-member assembly opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and will close at 10 p.m. (1900 GMT). Exit polls will be made public immediately afterwards with official results available from Monday morning. However no clear winner is expected in the snap poll and protracted coalition talks to form a government are almost certain. Yushchenko, swept to power in the 2004 "Orange revolution", has joined forces with the heroine of the street protests against presidential election fraud, Yulia Tymoshenko, and together they hope to unseat Yanukovich from the government. The president has waged a power struggle with Yanukovich since Yanukovich became prime minister last year, bouncing back from defeat in the 2004 presidential vote. Yushchenko called this election after dissolving parliament and accusing Yanukovich of making an illegal grab for power. Yanukovich's government has overseen strong economic growth and he says a vote for his Regions Party means stability and a rout of the "orange hordes". On the eve of the election, Yushchenko told voters in a televised address to leave behind the murky past of the ex-Soviet republic and vote for his orange camp if they wanted fundamental changes in the future. In Kiev, as a golden sun was just rising over the capital, several elderly people had already made it to polling booths. A large contingent of international observers is overseeing the vote, led by a 700-strong team from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
