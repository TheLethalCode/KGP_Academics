 YANGON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The normally bustling teahouses of Myanmar's main city were hushed on Thursday as soldiers readied barbed wire barricades and fire trucks to counter more expected protests against the military junta. Just a few blocks from Yangon's Sule Pagoda, where soldiers fired warning shots over the heads of thousands of angry civilians and monks on Wednesday, men and women huddled at small plastic tables bracing for another day of violence. "It will be dangerous," one elderly mother-of-nine murmured, the bangles on her wrists tinkling as she reached for another cigarette. "It's good, but dangerous."

It is now one of its most desperate. A retired sailor at a small shop selling water and nuts was resolute in his opposition to 45 years of unbroken military rule. "Every generation has to do its bit. It took us years to get rid of the British," he said, patting down his hair with a hand bearing an anchor tattoo. "The government is lousy. I wash my mouth out after mentioning them," he said, scanning the street carefully for plainclothes government spies who might be listening in. The 61-year old took part in Wednesday's march towards the Sule Pagoda and said he may join protesters again. "It depends on how I feel. I can't run very fast with my asthma," he said. But he also admitted he was scared. "Of course I feel terrible. I'm a human bein
