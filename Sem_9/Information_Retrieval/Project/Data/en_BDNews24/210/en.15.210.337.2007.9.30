<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali has directed a committee to settle the national coach issue by October 31, the board's spokesman said Sunday. "By any means we have to finalise the national team's coach by October 31 as the board president has given such a directive in the meeting," spokesmen Ishtiaq Ahmed told bdnews24.com after the fourth meeting of the BCB ad-hoc committee Sunday. BCB has been looking for a coach since the end of the World Cup in the West Indies following Australian coach Dav Whatmore's exit. The previous BCB committee short-listed three candidates for interviews. The ad-hoc committee has interviewed only Australian John Harmer, but the other two candidates -- Australian Jimmie Siddons and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton -- pulled out of the race citing personal reasons. Bangladesh tour New Zealand in December. The coach issue was revived in the board meeting, which discussed some names like Bangladesh's former West Indian coach Gordon Greenidge and former interim coach of Sri Lanka John Dyson, an Australian. "We have already contacted Dyson, who desired to be Bangladesh's coach," Ahmed said. "Greenidge is also in our mind, but we have to talk details with them." Ahmed said they were looking for other coaches apart from Dyson and Greenidge. The meeting also decided to defer the National Cricket League following requests from the participating divisional teams, who cited lack of preparations and Eid-ul-Fitr break. "We did not fix a start date, but it will now start after Eid instead of October 5 as was originally scheduled," Ahmed said. The board was determined to hold the relegation matches of the last edition of premier division cricket league despite the teams' unwillingness to play them, the official added. Indira Road KC, City Club and Brothers Union have already refused to play the relegation league, and appealed to the board for a waiver. "The board still believes three teams will play the league, scheduled for October 4, and the board will try to convince them to play the relegation league. "If they don't accept, the board will go for tough action against them," Ahmed said quoting the board's decision. The Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis (CCDM) will sit with representatives of the three clubs Monday. If three teams do not play the relegation league, they face being relegated to the first division, according to the bylaws. The meeting also approved the draft papers for leasing the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium for 29 years from the National Sports Council. bdnew
