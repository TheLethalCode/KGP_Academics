 Hamid Shalizi KABUL, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban insurgents have kidnapped four staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) southwest of the Afghan capital Kabul, but will release them soon, a Taliban spokesman said on Thursday. The Taliban have kidnapped dozens of Afghans and foreigners in recent months as part of their campaign to create an atmosphere of insecurity and undermine the government and its Western backers. The Taliban admitted it seized the two Afghan and two foreign ICRC staff members, but said it was unaware of their identity at the time. "Our mujahideen detained the Red Cross workers in Wardak province without knowing they were ICRC staff," said a Taliban spokesman who declined to be named. "We have nothing against the Red Cross and we are going to release them soon." A spokeswoman for the ICRC in Kabul said four staff had travelled to Wardak, southwest of Kabul, on Wednesday, but had not returned. "The information I have is that four of our colleagues, two expatriates and two Afghan nationals, were coming back from Wardak to Kabul yesterday but they couldn't make it," said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named. "We have lost contact with our staff since yesterday, there might have been complications on the way," she said. In Geneva, spokesman Marcal Izard said that the humanitarian agency was "very concerned" and was trying to find out more. Asked whether the ICRC suspected the four had been kidnapped, he told Reuters Television: "We cannot confirm at the moment what has really happened. We have to find out more details before we can comment further on that." Taliban rebels kidnapped two German engineers in Wardak in July and killed one of them after he suffered a heart attack. The other German is still being held. In August the ICRC helped facilitate talks between the Taliban and South Korean officials that led to the release of 21 Korean hostages after more than a month of captivity. Two other Koreans were killed. The Swiss-based neutral organisation deploys 60 expatriates and some 1,300 Afghan nationals in Afghanistan, one of its biggest operations worldwide. Its officials visit several thousand detainees in Afghanistan each year to ensure that they are being treated humanely in accordance with international law.
