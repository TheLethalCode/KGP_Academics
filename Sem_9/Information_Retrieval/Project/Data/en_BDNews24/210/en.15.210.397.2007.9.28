<TITLE> AL-BNP joint campaign if ground is common: Zillur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman has said his party could wage a campaign with the BNP if there was a common ground. "There should be harmony in goals, values and ideals among the two parties for launching a joint movement," Zillur told reporters Friday. He made the remarks in a reaction to BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain's comment on the same issue a few days earlier. "It is not possible to go for a joint movement if there is no consensus," he said, after visiting party chief Sheikh Hasina's husband Dr Wazed Miah at his Dhanmondi home on the occasion of Hasina's 61st birthday. Commenting on the latest list of 80 corruption suspects carried by some dailies, Zillur said: "I don't know the charges against them, but a few names I know are supposed to be honest." Demanding Hasina's release before Eid-ul-fitr, Zillur said: "This house would have been lively had she been here. Unfortunately she has now been detained on false charges." The makeshift party head also called upon the government to lift the emergency at the earliest. On BNP chief Khaleda Zia'a arrest, he said, "The Awami League is against any illegal arrest. We don't know anything about the reasons of Khaleda's arrest and we're not interested to know either." bdnews24.c
