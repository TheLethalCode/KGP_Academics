 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The curtain comes down Sunday on the opportunity to legalise untaxed money. The National Board of Revenue provided the legalising opportunity for four months in two phases to Sept 30. Although Saturday was a weekly holiday, the NBR asked Bangladesh Bank to keep all branches of commercial banks and clearing houses open for the owners of undeclared income, letting them avail themselves of the opportunity. NBR chairman Badiur Rahman who visited all tax zones in Dhaka to see for himself the legalising process said: "The total amount of legalised income will be published Sunday afternoon." Visits to some tax zones revealed that not many people had legalised undeclared income Saturday, a day before the deadline. Only four persons reported to the large taxpayers' unit (LTU) to legalise undeclared income Saturday, with the government receiving about Tk 50 lakh in tax. Parvez Iqbal, NBR official in charge of LTU, told reporters: "Until Saturday, 118 people have legalised Tk 125 crore through the unit. The government received about Tk 40 crore in tax." He said that there were 1,000 members in the LTU. Officials said that about 20 people legalised undeclared income in the Dhaka tax zone-1 Saturday. The number would be 35 to 40 on other days. An official for the tax zone-1, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "We are yet to get information on Saturday's proceedings. A total of 1,297 people legalised about Tk 264.35 crore in the zone until Thursday and the government got Tk 50.98 crore in tax." According to the NBR, 22,475 people legalised Tk 3,214 crore in undeclared income until Thursday after the opportunity was announced. The government received Tk 544 crore in tax on the amount. In the first phase, the NBR rolled out an opportunity for two months to legalise undeclared income with an additional 5 percent tax along with the fixed tax. The tax administration authority on July 31 extended the deadline by another two months to Sept 30. bdnews
