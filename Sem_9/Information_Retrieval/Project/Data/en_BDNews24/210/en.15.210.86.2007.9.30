<TITLE> China Communist elder issues bold call for democracy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In a bold jab before a key meeting of China's Communists, a 90-year-old former secretary to Mao Zedong has urged the Party to embrace democracy, saying that only political freedom can end instability and corruption. Li Rui issued his demand for citizens' rights and legal shackles on Party power in a Beijing magazine, China Across the Ages (Yanhuang Chunqiu), just over two weeks before President Hu Jintao opens the 17th Party Congress, which is set to give him five more years in power. Cautious Hu has signalled only modest political reforms under strict one-party limits. But in a sign that liberal reformers may feel emboldened to press Hu for bigger steps, Li argued that tinkering was far from enough. In the October edition of the outspoken magazine, Li said his country could be dragged back into past decades of chaos unless long-delayed democraticisation soon catches up with three decades of market reforms, ending the Party's "privileged status." "I believe that reforming our Party is the crux that will decide the success or failure of all of China's reforms," wrote Li, who joined the Communists in 1937 and served as revolutionary founder Mao's biographer and secretary in the 1950s and later as a senior official under economic reformer Deng Xiaoping. "Our Party must lead the way in exemplary enforcement of the Constitution and guaranteeing that the people enjoy their civic rights of freedom of expression, freedom of news, freedom of publication and freedom of association." Li's challenge to decades of one-party control is the boldest yet of a series of strikingly candid calls for democratic liberalisation from older Party intellectuals this year. He is an influentual voice among liberal reformers who were marginalised after the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests, but does not seem to have much sway over those now in office. But the open publication of Li's call on the sensitive -- and overall strictly controlled -- eve of the Congress suggests that Hu has not been able to still calls for political relaxation even from within the Party. Before the last Party congress in 2002, Li issued a similar manifesto for reform that stirred controversy and resulted in the closure of a newspaper that reprinted it. Earlier this year, China Across the Ages published an essay that lamented Soviet socialism as an abject failure and urged China's Communists to follow the Nordic "democratic socialist" model of respecting both social equality and political liberty. Magazines and the Internet have also aired intellectuals' calls for freedom of expression and confronting the Party's shrouded past of violent political purges. Li recalled those purges in his essay, and argued that only empowered citizens could lastingly end cycles of mayhem and the corruption he said was rotting the foundations of Party rule. Spurning the vagueness that clouds discussion of political reform within China, Li called for citizens to be taught and encouraged to defend their democratic rights, for legislation to protect a free news media from censorship, and for strict constitutional yokes on the long unfettered Communist Party. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has said it will be a long time before his country is ready to directly elect even low-ranking officials, arguing that swift reform would be a recipe for chaos. China has nothing to fear from full-fledged democracy, Li wrote. "It is well understood that democracy is a good thing that will not stir chaos and will only promote social stability.
