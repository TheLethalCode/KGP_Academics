 KHARTOUM, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed men attacked an African Union base in southern Darfur killing at least seven soldiers and injuring eight others, army and rebel sources said on Sunday. Sudan's army and Darfur rebel movements blamed each other for the attack on the Haskanita base, the worst on the AU's struggling 7,000-strong force in the three years since it deployed. AU spokesman Noureddine Mezni confirmed the attack and said the mission would issue a statement soon. "It is the heaviest casualties which we have have ever witnessed since the inception of this mission," he said, without giving details. "There is a feeling of shock," he added. An army spokesman said: "Some of the rebels attacked the AU in Haskanita. They killed seven and eight were injured." But the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) commander in the region, Abdel Aziz el-Nur Ashr, told Reuters they had moved their troops out of Haskanita four days earlier for other operations and blamed the government. "There was an aggression from Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) from three directions on Haskanita and that attack was from the SAF," Ashr said. "We don't have troops there," he added.
