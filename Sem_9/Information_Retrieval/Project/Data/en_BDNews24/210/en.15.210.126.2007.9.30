 Chittagong, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Sunday denied that the Election Commission had used the registration issue to dictate political parties. "The discussions have only started. Talks have so far been held with three parties. It is not yet time for any quarter to comment that [the EC] is intervening in the organisational matters of the political parties," Huda said. The CEC made the remarks to reporters after a views-exchange meeting on voter registration with photographs at Chittagong Theatre Institute (TIC) in the morning. Former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan said at a seminar Saturday the EC risked running into controversy if it tried to control the organisational matters of political parties. Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon the same day criticised the EC's draft proposal on political activity and the upcoming general election. "The draft proposal says speaking against the EC will be considered contempt of court," Menon said. "We don't know of any such law in other countries. Registration of political parties should not just mean control of those parties," the Left leader said. The CEC said registration of the political parties would be done only after discussion, adding that the conditions they had set for registration were merely proposals. A final decision on the conditions would be made on the basis of the views of the political parties after discussion with them, Huda said. "Any big difference of opinion on registration will be removed through discussion." Drawn to the question raised by a quarter about the acceptability of the Election Commission, he said, "It's not fair to make such tough comment about us so soon." Pressed to comment on Akbar Ali Khan's remarks, the CEC said: "Who is he to call us controversial? He himself is controversial." On whether the EC would refuse to register religion-based parties, Huda said the issues were not under their jurisdiction. "We were not in the Election Commission after 1975 when such [religion-based] politics started. Different political parties had launched movement and taken part in elections forging alliance with them." "This is a political problem and it has to be resolved politically. The Election Commission has nothing to do with it." He reiterated in the meeting that the EC would hold elections by 2008 and that there would be no exception. The CEC said elections to five city corporations except Chittagong City Corporation would be held in January next year. Chittagong City Corporation polls would not be held as its tenure has not expired. According to the latest voter list, he said, there were 7.25 crore voters in the country. Huda said making a voter list with photographs in only 18 months was a difficult task with limited manpower. The CEC said there were flaws in the previous voter list. He said earlier one person could be enlisted as voter at several places. Unlike in the past no new voter list would be prepared every five years deploying thousands of employees. From now every year at a specified time the voter list would be updated, he added. He said the EC was thinking of not sending extra ballot papers to the polling centres on election day to check false voting. Deputy commissioner Ashraf Shamim presided over the meeting also attended by general officer command (GOC) of the 24 Infantry Division Abdul Mubin and acting mayor Manzur Alam. Divisional commissioner Hossain Jamil, deputy inspector general of police of Chittagong range Amir Uddin and police commissioner Moinur Rahman Chowdhury spoke. Later, the CEC met officials at Chittagong Election Commission office. He is scheduled to return to Dhaka in the afternoon. He will visit Tangail on Monday. The meeting was told that the enumerators would distribute forms door to door from October 22 in Chittagong City Corporation area. The work of taking photographs would start on November 5. The voter listing in sadar upazilas of three hills districts would also start the same day. Outside Chittagong City Corporation, voter enrolment in the upazilas of Chittagong district except Raozan and Sitakunda, other upazilas in Cox's Bazar and three hills district would start in December 2007 and would continue through to May 2008. bdnews
