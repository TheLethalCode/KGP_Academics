 Dhaka, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com)  Students clashed Wednesday over subscription to newspapers in Alauddin Hall of Sir Salimullah Medical College in the city. Witnesses said hall authorities had decided to subscribe to the daily Naya Diganta instead of daily Prothom Alo, prompting a clash between some students of the 32nd batch and some pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Chhatra Shibir activists of the 33rd batch Tuesday night. Police took the situation under control at around 2am Wednesday. The general students of Alauddin Hall gave a memorandum to the principal, demanding a ban on iftar parties. They also demand expulsion of the students in whose rooms knives, sticks, hockey sticks and cricket stumps were found. The students asked for cancellation of the studentship of Humayun Kabir Himu, who they said had instigated the incident. The Shibir activists also handed a memorandum to the principal. The principal convened an emergency meeting Wednesday and formed a seven-member committee to investigate the incident asking it to report in 15 days. Duty officer of Kotwali Police Station Fakhrul Alam said, "The police are still there. One of our officers also remained on the spot." "The committee will investigate the matter. Those who are guilty will be punished. We want a peaceful end to the matter," principal M Abdullah told bdnews24.com. Some students alleged Shibir men brought to the hall some outsiders in the evening apparently for a showdown with their rivals. bdnews
