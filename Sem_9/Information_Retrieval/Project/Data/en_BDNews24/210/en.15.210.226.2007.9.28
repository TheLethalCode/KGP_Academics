 LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European share indexes were down by midday on Friday, putting them on track for a near 4-percent loss this quarter, as a decline in financial stocks offset gains in mining shares as commodity prices rallied. Tight credit conditions took their toll on banking stocks as short-term interest rates stuck near six-year highs, while a dip in crude oil futures weighed on oil stocks. Troubled British mortgage lender Northern Rock fell almost 6 percent after reports that the bank had borrowed a further 5 billion pounds ($10.12 billion) from the Bank of England. The biggest loser of the day was British sugar and sweetner maker Tate & Lyle Plc, which shed nearly 30 percent in its largest daily fall in 24 years, after cautioning on its outlook. By 1119 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,546.10 points. The FTSEurofirst index is little changed on the week, but is on track for its first quarterly loss since the second quarter of last year. Investors are now preparing for guidance on the impact of the turmoil in the credit markets on the broader economy when both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank hold their policy-setting meetings next week. "The markets are in convalescent mode. They feel the central banks are on the case and trying to ensure that what we've had is, as far as possible, limited to being a financial crisis and doesn't ramify anything for the economy," said Andrew Bell, European strategist at Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management. "Equities have had a decent bounce and there is no terribly good reason to chase them in the short term. The next events will be the BoE and the ECB next week," he said. Euro overnight lending rates fixed near 6-year highs on Friday, while credit spreads widened again, weighing on the banking sector, which has borne the brunt of the logjam in financial markets. HSBC fell nearly 1 percent, while Societe Generale shed 1.3 percent and Deutsche Bank lost 0.5 percent. Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.8 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 eased 0.4 percent. Meanwhile, one of the first big European casualties of the credit crunch, German lender IKB, reiterated its full-year loss could reach almost $1 billion. IKB shares were roughly unchanged. Among gainers was EADS, which rose over 3 percent after analysts revised ratings following news that its core business, Airbus, was selling A380 superjumbo planes to British Airways. Mining shares also rallied as a rise in precious metals prices lifted Lonmin, up nearly 3 percent. Anglo American was up 0.2 percent, while copper miner Antofagasta fell almost 4 percent after UBS downgraded its rating on the stock to "sell" from "neutral". US stock futures were down around 0.3 percent ahead of a flurry of economic data later. Releases on Friday include a key monthly reading of core consumer inflation as well as the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- a gauge of business activity in the auto-intensive Midwest -- as well as consumer sentiment. A further softening in price pressures coupled with any evidence of weakness in the manufacturing sector would reinforce the market's view that the US Federal Reserve might opt to cut interest rates again next mon
