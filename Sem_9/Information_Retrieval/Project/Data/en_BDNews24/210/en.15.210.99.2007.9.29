<TITLE> Williams offered Academy or Bangladesh A team coach's job </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Saturday offered Shaun Williams to be head coach of the BCB-grameenphone Cricket Academy team or the Bangladesh A team following his unwillingness to continue as game development manager. Williams was made interim coach of the national side during the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka and the inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September after Dav Whatmore had quit. "We had a meeting with Williams Saturday and he was given two options to be head coach of the Academy team or the Bangladesh A team as he wanted to settle the issue," said member secretary of the game development committee Ishtiaq Ahmed. Ahmed said that Williams sought some time to decide. If the Australian accepts the offer to guide the Academy side, the BCB will certainly be relieved of finding an academy coach as the side has remained coach less following the exit of Australian coach Alister D Winter, who quit six months before his contract expired. "I have taken some time to decide the proposal and hope to inform the board before going to Australia on vacation on October 4," Shaun Williams told bdnews24.com Saturday. "I don't want to comment as the board has not offered me any such thing," said Williams when asked whether he had expressed his desire to be the national team coach. bdn
