<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Monday stressed open politics in the three requirements he outlined for the right election atmosphere. "A congenial political atmosphere will be created if the state of emergency is withdrawn, open politics introduced and two leaders are freed. It will also make the path to democracy easy," Delwar told reporters at his Mohakhali home. He referred to former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her arch political foe Awami League chief and ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasinaboth detained in special jail in the parliament complex. He said he was satisfied with the High Court's ruling on the GATCO case against Khaleda. "The granting of bail by the High Court in the GATCO corruption case did justice to Khaleda Zia The people of this country want a verdict from the apex court." He hoped that Khaleda would be released from jail. On calls to hold a council by the BNP's reformist faction, Delwar said, "There is no stream or sub-stream in the BNP. The BNP's leaders and activists are unified under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." Without naming expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, he said, "He is talking about the council, but he isn't a member of the BNP. He cannot talk about the BNP." "Most BNP lawmakers and central leaders comply with the leadership of Khaleda Zia. Some leaders remain inactive because of a special situation. All of them will be active once open politics resumes." On the statement of British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury that "the future election of Bangladesh will not depend on any person," Delwar declined to make a comment. He however said, "The British high commissioner is a diplomat. I leave it to diplomatic norms as to how much he is allowed to comment on our politics." "I was not allowed to meet the chairperson to make a decision about [electoral reforms talks with] the Election Commission. We cannot decide without having talks with her." He expressed hope that jail authorities would allow him to immediately meet the chairperson. bdnews24.com
