 ROTTERDAM, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- PSV Eindhoven have been thrown out of this season's Dutch Cup by the national FA for fielding an ineligible player in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Heerenveen's reserves. Defender Manuel da Costa was suspended for the match after receiving two yellow cards in last season's competition but played against Young Heerenveen in the second round clash. "This is so embarrassing -- we can never justify this inexcusable mistake", PSV general manager Jan Reker said on the club's official Web site (www.psv.nl) which confirmed the FA's punishment. Da Costa, who was booked against Go Ahead Eagles and NAC Breda, was chosen to start against Heerenveen reserves. PSV, who have been disqualified from the Cup in accordance with Dutch Football Association (KNVB) regulations, were informed of the sanction on Thursday morning. "This is an inexcusable blunder," added Reker. "I have immediately taken the decision to alter our administrative affairs procedures. We will have a thorough investigation and, believe me, you haven't heard the last of that." Reker said he felt sorry the the club's players, coaching staff, fans and sponsors after goals by Jonathan Reis, Kenneth Perez and Danny Koevermans had sealed a 3-0 victory. "We always compete for silverware, so I really, really regret not being able to win the Dutch Cup this season," he added
