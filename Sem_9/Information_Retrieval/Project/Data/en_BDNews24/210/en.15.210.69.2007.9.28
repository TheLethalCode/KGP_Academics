<TITLE> Bush to meet son of slain Lebanon ex-PM Hariri </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush will hold talks at the White House on Thursday with the son and political heir of slain former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, the White House said on Friday. Bush's meeting with Saad al-Hariri, head of the Lebanese parliament's anti-Syrian majority, comes amid heightened political tensions in Lebanon following the car-bomb assassination last week of Christian lawmaker Antoine Ghanem. Ghanem was the seventh anti-Syrian figure killed in Lebanon since the 2005 murder of Rafik al-Hariri, whose death and that of others the Western-backed governing coalition blames on Syria. Damascus has consistently denied such accusations. The Bush administration, pressing a campaign of diplomatic isolation against Syria, has repeatedly accused it of trying to destabilize Lebanon's elected government. Damascus, which withdrew its forces from Lebanon in 2005 after a 29-year military presence, has rejected the allegations.
