 LONDON, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - BBC radio stations 1, 2, 3 and 4 celebrated their 40th anniversary on Sunday by broadcasting a series of special programmes as some of the corporation's former disc jockeys made a nostalgic return to the airwaves. The BBC launched Radios 1 and 2 on September 30, 1967 as a replacement for the Light Programme, while the Third Programme became Radio 3 and the Home Service was renamed Radio 4. Sunday's celebrations for Radio 1 included the outspoken Chris Moyles, who has called himself the saviour of the station, co-hosting the breakfast show with Tony Blackburn, who launched Radio 1 in 1967. A two-hour documentary "Keeping it Peel" pays tribute to the veteran broadcaster, who championed new music trends like punk, before his death three years ago. Radio 1 has enjoyed a renaissance since managers dropped many older presenters in the 1990s. "Radio 1 is still seen as the best radio station in the world," former disc jockey Bruno Brookes told BBC News 24. "It's a brand that isn't going to go away - it's got a great future." Radio 2 broadcast Kenny Everett's first show for the station while DJs Smashie and Nicey -- the comic creation of Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse -- will host an edition of Pick of the Pops playing hits from 40 years ago. The show is a tribute to DJ Alan "Fluff" Freeman who originally presented the show. On Radio 4 comedian Matthew Lucas and actor Stephen Fry will host a spoof edition of "This is Your Life" telling the history of the station, with contributions from broadcasters John Humphrys, Sue Lawley, Jonathan Dimbleby and Barry Cryer
