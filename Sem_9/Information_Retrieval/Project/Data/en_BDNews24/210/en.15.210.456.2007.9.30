<TITLE> Smuggled money won't come back easy: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Saturday said it was a tough ask to bring back money smuggled out of the country. "It is a tough task," Azizul told reporters at the Zia International Airport on arrival from a World Trade Organisation meeting on Aid for Trade in Manila in the Philippines. Azizul's remarks coincided with reports that the highest level of the government had been discussing the issue. Media have reported that the Anticorruption Commission has sought Britain's help to recover the money deposited or invested in that country by corrupt Bangladeshis. The adviser cited the example of the Philippines that had been trying for years to bring back millions of dollars smuggled out of the country by former strongman Ferdinand Marcos. "Every country and its banks have their own laws, rules and secrecy," Azizul said, "Those countries and banks will not easily give us the money deposited in their banks." He said it was a time-consuming matter as well. The finance adviser however said the government had written to the World Bank for help and the Bangladesh Bank had also written to the Malaysian government. On the Aid for Trade meeting, the adviser said Bangladesh had sought specific help from the donors, who he said had not been living up to their own aid commitment. In the 2005 WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, the donors had agreed to give the LDCs 0.7 percent of their GDP in aid for trade, he pointed out. "We've liberalised our economy to a great deal, but [the donors] did not assist us as they had pledged," Azizul told reporters. bd
