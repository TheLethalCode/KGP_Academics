 UNITED NATIONS, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Major powers condemned the use of force by Myanmar's military rulers against pro-democracy demonstrators on Wednesday and the West called urgent consultations in the UN Security Council. The United States and the 27-member European Union asked the council to consider sanctions and demanded that the junta in the former Burma open a dialogue with jailed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and ethnic minorities. China and Russia, which have friendly relations with the Myanmar authorities, has so far blocked any UN Security Council resolution on the topic. "We condemn all violence against peaceful demonstrators and remind the country's leaders of their personal responsibilities (for) their actions," a joint statement said after the 27 EU foreign ministers met US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. "We call on the Security Council to discuss this situation urgently and to consider further steps including sanctions." Foreign ministers of the Group of Eight industrial nations, meeting separately, agreed on a similar formula but without a call for sanctions, in deference to Russia. Participants said Rice and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov clashed over the sanctions issue. Rice later told reporters: "What is happening in Myanmar is outrageous and the regime needs to stop using violence and get to a dialogue so we can have national reconciliation." The Security Council began meeting behind closed doors at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) to consult on the growing clashes between security forces and demonstrators, including Buddhist monks. The UN special envoy for Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, was to brief the 15-nation Security Council. Hospital sources in Myanmar said at least three people, including two monks, were shot dead as security forces fired warning shots and used tear gas and baton charges to try to quell the biggest anti-junta protests in two decades. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that, in response to the deteriorating situation, he was dispatching Gambari urgently to the region. He called on Myanmar's leadership to cooperate fully with the mission, but it was not clear whether Gambari would even be admitted to the reclusive country. The EU-US statement called on China, India and members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to use their influence to press the Myanmar government to open a dialogue with opponents. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said it was "unfortunate" that Asian nations had not so far spoken out against the crackdown but the Western powers would use meetings at the United Nations to urge them to do so. In the first critical comment by an Asian leader, Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont urged the military rulers in Myanmar to avoid violence. "I'm trying my best to convince the Burmese: 'Don't use the harsh measures'," he told the Asia Society in New York. The European Union and the United States already have targeted asset freezes and visa bans on key members of the Myanmar leadership. Ferrero-Waldner said those measures could be expanded to more officials involved in repression. Asked what further sanctions the West was considering, she said: "Maybe some ban on logging, for instance, because there it seems a lot of money is being made." The London-based environmental group Global Witness estimates that 1.5 million tonnes of timber worth $350 million were shipped illegally from Myanmar into China in 2005. The Security Council has been divided about action against Myanmar. In January, China and Russia vetoed a resolution calling for Myanmar to stop persecuting minority and opposition groups and take concrete steps toward democracy. But French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said his talks with Chinese representatives showed there was "an evolution in China's position" of concern. The crisis has been a major theme of the General Assembly's annual gathering of world leaders, which opened on Tuesday. US President George W Bush, in his speech to the assembly, announced new sanctions against the jun
