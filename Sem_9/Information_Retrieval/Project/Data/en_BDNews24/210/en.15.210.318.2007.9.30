<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, India, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rain forced the abandonment of the opening one-dayer between India and Australia after Michael Clarke hit a career-best 130 for the visitors on Saturday. India, replying to Australia's 307 for seven, were nine for one in 2.4 overs when showers halted the day-night game. Although the rain stopped, a wet outfield meant the match was called off after a three-hour wait. Left-arm seamer Mitchell Johnson trapped Sachin Tendulkar leg before for a duck in the second over before the weather intervened. "It was good to score a hundred but disappointing it was a bit of a waste," Clarke told reporters. Australia were playing their first one-dayer since claiming an unprecedented World Cup hat-trick in the Caribbean in April. Adam Gilchrist, the stand-in captain with Ricky Ponting absent due to a hamstring strain, said his players were ready to go back out despite the conditions. "I was happy to take the guys out to field in those conditions," said Gilchrist. "But the umpires and the match referee felt the field was unfit for play." Dhoni said: "I can only say there's a fine line between being brave and foolish." TEST DEBUT Clarke, who hit a hundred on his test debut at the same ground in 2004, put on 144 for the fifth wicket with Brad Haddin (69) and 73 for the sixth with James Hopes (37). The 26-year-old Clarke recovered from a painful blow to his right hand from left-arm paceman Rudra Pratap Singh early on to hit 10 fours and three sixes, helping Australia recover from 90 for four after Gilchrist had opted to bat. "I'm hoping it is just a bruise," Clarke said. "I will have a scan after I have a bit of ice tonight." Clarke was run out off the last ball of the innings, leaving Australia with high hopes of avenging their recent semi-final defeat in the Twenty20 World Cup. Fast bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth struck three quick blows, removing Brad Hodge (0), Matthew Hayden (34) and Andrew Symonds (7) in successive overs. Sreesanth finished with three for 55 while left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan took two for 64 but the Indian bowlers struggled against Clarke and Haddin, who cracked 87 runs in the last 10 overs. The second game in the seven-match series is in Kochi on Tuesda
