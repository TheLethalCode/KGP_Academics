<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African all-rounder Shaun Pollock has been dropped for the first time in his career and will not play in the first test against Pakistan which begins on Monday. "I am surprised and disappointed at not being considered for the first test," Pollock told a news conference on Friday. The former South African captain, 34, is his country's most experienced test player with 416 wickets in 107 tests and has scored 3781 runs. "It is first time I have been dropped apart from fitness issues so it is disappointing because I know what I can still do and what my job is," he said. "But obviously no individual is bigger than South African cricket or the team and it is a decision of the captain and coach that I have to respect. "Coach Mickey (Arthur) told me yesterday that they wanted to go into the first test with a different side and I won't be part of it. "Mickey still feels I have a right to play especially in South Africa where pitches are more conducive. Personally I don't think my job on the flat subcontinent pitches is over. "If the opportunity arises they might play me in the second test. I will take it on a day-to-day basis." Pollock ruled out that he would consider retiring from tests as a result of being dropped. "I will just have to make sure I perform up to standard and it is up to the selectors to take me for tours ahead," he said
