 LONDON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The English FA charged Chelsea on Thursday with failing to control their players during their 2-0 Premier League defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. The FA said in a statement the charges related to the conduct of the players towards referee Mike Dean following the red card shown to midfielder John Obi Mikel after 32 minutes for his lunge on United defender Patrice Evra. In the statement the FA also named Chelsea's assistant coach Steve Clarke and charged him with "using abusive and/or insulting words towards the match officials after the end of the match at Old Trafford." Chelsea and Clarke have until Oct. 12 to respond to the charges. Referee Dean reported the club after at least four players surrounded him when he sent off Mikel for the clumsy tackle on the Frenchman. On Tuesday, Mikel lost an appeal against the sending off, and did not play in Wednesday's 4-0 League Cup victory at Championship (second division) side Hull City. He will be suspended for two more matches
