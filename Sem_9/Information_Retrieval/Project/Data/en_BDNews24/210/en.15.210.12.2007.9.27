 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government Thursday announced a crackdown on inflated public transport prices and ticket touting ahead of the Eid-ul Fitr. Transport companies face legal action and may have their route permits revoked if found to have broken the law, communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman told reporters after an inter-ministry meeting. "The government will arrange special rail, bus and river transport to assist passengers ahead of Eid," he said The secretary said 210 BRTC buses will be operating across the country the night before Eid, with additional ferry services also hitting the routes. "BRTC buses currently serving urban routes will be redirected to long-distance routes during the upcoming holiday," Mahbubur said. "A monitoring system will be in place and mobile courts will also be operating to ensure inflated prices cannot be charged on the passengers." "We will install 30 special mobile courts in bus terminals, rail stations and river route terminals for Eid." "These will be manned by magistrates and officials of the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority," said Mahbubur. The secretary said alternative arrangements had been made to check touting of train tickets. "Law-enforcing agencies will be deployed in railway stations with only four tickets allowed per family. Only one family member may collect these tickets," said the secretary. "If a family needs additional tickets it may apply for a maximum of eight to the relevant authorities." Mahbubur added that steps had been taken this year to inform passengers about the special arrangements. "Official ticket prices, for all transport systems, will be prominently displayed with departure times and seat availability also clearly visible," said the secretary. bdnews2
