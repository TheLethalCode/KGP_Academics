<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah Friday said he expected more 'reformists' on the new list of corruption suspects in what he said was an apparent government policy shift. "I expected to see names of some more reformists on the new list of corruption suspects. But a look at the list gives me the impression that the government has changed its policy towards the suspects," he said to reporters at his Mohakhali home. Hannan referred to a list of 80 more graft suspects carried by some dailies. He said he was heartbroken to know that the Anticorruption Commission had sued Tarique Rahman's wife and mother-in-law. He said he was surprised not to see breakaway faction of BNP reformists' leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's name on the list. "Bangladesh government's local government ministry had been rated as the most corrupt ministry for five consecutive years by the [Transparency International, Bangladesh]. "Mannan Bhuiyan being the local government minister through that period cannot shirk the responsibility associated. But he managed to stay unscathed because of his rubbing shoulder with a special clique." To a question, he said, "BNP will definitely take proper steps against those who will eventually be prosecuted by the legal courts for crimes committed." He, however, called upon the government not to unduly harass people. bdne
