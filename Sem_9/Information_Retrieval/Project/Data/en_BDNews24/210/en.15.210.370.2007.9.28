<TITLE> Iraq's Sunnis, Shia sign up in Qaeda battleground </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TUWAITHA, Iraq, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Sunni Arab men, and a smattering of Shia, have begun signing up for local tribal police units in areas southeast of Baghdad where pitched battles were fought with al Qaeda only weeks ago. In one rural area not far from the Tuwaitha nuclear plant, idle after Saddam Hussein's atomic energy programme was shut down following the 1991 Gulf War, about 30 young Iraqi men queued patiently in the ruins of a bombed-out watchtower. The tower stands at an odd angle in a field next to a narrow road along the Tigris River. US soldiers in humvees bounced along the road, over one repaired section where they said a bomb detonated by al Qaeda in Iraq militants left a 15-foot crater. Further on, date palms stand next to a gutted power station, their trunks blackened by the explosion and fire. "I'm not afraid. I'm wanted by al Qaeda anyway," Mahmoud Jablawi, a Sunni Arab sheikh in the town of Tuwaitha, said when asked about the dangers of working with the US military, which organised a visit to the area on Thursday for Reuters. Apologising for his limp handshake -- he said he was shot in the arm in a gunbattle with al Qaeda three weeks ago -- Jablawi said two of his brothers had been killed in the past two weeks. "We don't want to live in an Islamic country the way the Taliban live," he said of al Qaeda's strict version of Islam. In Tuwaitha, 256 young men have joined a "concerned citizens" group, one of the latest examples of tribal police units based on the "Awakening" model established in western Anbar, once the most dangerous province in Iraq. "Almost every one of these guys fought side by side with me against al Qaeda a week ago," said US army captain Brian Gilbert as he signed up the latest group in Tuwaitha. T-SHIRTS, CAPS Lieutenant-Colonel John Kolasheski said about 700 people had signed up for such groups across his religiously mixed area of command southeast of Baghdad, which includes pockets of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia as well as al Qaeda. Kolasheski's men have been busy distributing T-shirts, with "CC" in large letters on the back, and baseball caps in the colours of the Iraqi flag to identify them. The US military rejects criticism that such groups -- who carry their own weapons -- are no more than sectarian militias being used to solve local problems and who could just as easily turn their arms against US and Iraqi forces in the future. "We could shut it down tomorrow," Kolasheski said when asked what the US response would be if that happened. US President George W. Bush has praised the use of tribal police in Anbar for reducing violence there, and it is now being mirrored elsewhere, especially around Baghdad. More weapons caches are being found as US troops build trust with local units. Among weapons destroyed in Tuwaitha on Thursday during a visit by Reuters was an armour-piercing "explosively formed penetrator" -- a squat black canister about a foot in diameter with a concave top lined with rifle bullets. The US military accuses Iran of supplying Shi'ite militias in Iraq with EFPs and other deadly roadside bombs. Potential recruits have their information recorded in a US biometric database that also checks personal data. Anyone who has a criminal record or has fought against US or Iraqi forces is weeded out, US commanders say. Sheikhs sign a security contract with the US military and are paid what Kolasheski described as a "stipend" that amounts to about 70 percent of a policeman's salary per man. "CITIZENS" CHECKPOINTS The "concerned citizens" units receive basic police training and are then organised to set up checkpoints. White concrete barriers -- emblazoned with "Checkpoint Manned by Concerned Citizens" in black Arabic and bright red English -- are springing up on roads across Tuwaitha and Karguiliya to the north. In Karguiliya, US army captain Troy Thomas said Sunni Arabs and Shia man checkpoints his unit helped set up. "This project is the last card you play for the life of Iraq," said Karguiliya Sheikh Qais Abbas Mohammed. One local Sunni Arab leader who fought in the Iran-Iraq war watched over the young Tuwaitha men as they lined up to register in the rubble of the watchtower. "Al Qaeda got greedy and wanted to form their own country. Iran also got greedy and wants Iraq to be part of Iran," he said through an interpreter, declining to give his real name. Local Sunni leaders complain that, until now, few US soldiers bothered to consult them. "There was a missing link," said the Sunni leader watching the recruits. Kolasheski more or less agreed. "They kind of got left out of the political process. This is a different approach."
