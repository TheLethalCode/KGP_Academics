<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah Sunday said the interim bail to Khaleda Zia in the GATCO corruption case was an initial victory in the legal fight to getting justice. However, leaders of BNP's pro-reform faction AHM Miasmal Kari and Ashraf Hossain said it was a matter of law and refused to comment further. Khaleda and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested at their Shahid Mainul Road home in Dhaka Cantonment on Sept 3 for their alleged links to the case. "It is the expectation of the leaders and workers that the verdict of the court will be implemented since Khaleda Zia is innocent. [She] will be released and return among the followers," Hannan, the BNP chairperson's adviser, told bdnews24.com. He thanked the main counsel in the case barrister Rafique-ul Huq. He said, "The chief adviser lately has realised that immediate election is required. We want an elected government through a free and fair election." BNP chairperson's adviser AHM Mofazzal Karim after meeting breakaway BNP leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home said, "We hope the government will lift ban on indoor politics." "If it is withdrawn we will get the opportunity to discuss with the party leaders and workers about holding the party council." bdnew
