 KIEV, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's pro-Western opposition claimed victory on Monday in an election widely seen as key to ending divisions that have stalled market reform and exacerbated tensions between a nationalist west and Russian-speaking east. With just over 60 percent of votes in Sunday's parliamentary poll counted, groups linked to President Viktor Yushchenko, swept to power in 2004 "Orange Revolution" protests, appeared strongly placed but far from certain victory. A close result would again mean long talks on forming a coalition government. Yushchenko's rival, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, dismissed the "orange" declaration of victory as groundless. He said his party would be declared the winner when votes from the industrial, pro-Russian eastern region were counted. Bitter rivalry between Yushchenko and Yanukovich, holding the two key positions of power, have delayed economic reforms over the last year. Relations with former Soviet imperial masters in Moscow have, however, improved since a rough patch in 2005. Exit polls and partial results indicated the bloc of former premier Yulia Tymoshenko, part of the Orange alliance, had done better than expected and might secure a governing majority in alliance with Our Ukraine, the party supporting Yushchenko. bdnews24.com/lq/1847hrs The Orange alliance, riven since the 2004 Revolution by mistrust between Tymoshenko and the president, was formally patched up last week when the two embraced on television. In a statement issued as the count proceeded, Yanukovich said: "Orange supporters have made premature conclusions and are striving to divide the country and its people even further." Exit polls and forcasts, he said, showed his own Regions Party in first place. The official count showed "orange" groups nudging an outright majority with a 33 percent score for Tymoshenko's bloc and 15 percent for Our Ukraine. The prime minister's Regions Party stood at nearly 31 percent, with a further five for its Communist allies. SLOW COUNT IN THE EAST But officials said the count was proceeding slowly in eastern Ukraine, where Yanukovich's party traditionally scores well. A top Tymoshenko ally said the prime minister's team was conspiring to cheat in its eastern strongholds. "We will challenge the results in areas where there will be an attempt at vote-rigging," Oleksander Turchinov told reporters. A presidential aide also expressed concern at the count. Rigging prompted the 2004 "Orange Revolution" protests that overwhelmed Kiev for weeks in the aftermath of a presidential poll, initially won by Yanukovich. The supreme court annulled the vote and ordered a new poll won by Yushchenko. The surprise success of a minor centrist party could add further uncertainty. The centrist bloc of former parliament speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn unexpectedly cleared the 3-percent threshold to win seats in the chamber. Bloc members said on Sunday evening they could work with either camp. Two exit polls put Yanukovich's Regions Party in the lead, but behind the combined tally of Tymoshenko's bloc and Our Ukraine. The exit polls, if borne out in the count, would give the pro-Western forces a wafer-thin majority of about 230 seats in the 450-seat assembly, according to the authors of the polls. Late on Sunday, a beaming Tymoshenko said her bloc and its allies would win enough seats to build a coalition on their own. "In a matter of weeks we will hold our first government news conference," she said. She said a victory for the orange camp would move Ukraine closer to the European Union, but stressed that relations with Russia were of prime importance. The prime minister, unsmiling and defiant, said the results gave his party the green light "to form a n
