 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  LDP (B Chowdhury) secretary general retired major Abdul Mannan Sunday said LDP and Gano Forum started working on a common charter of demands for submission to the Election Commission for electoral reforms. Former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain went to Mannan's Gulshan home to discuss the issue. Mannan and Gano Forum leader Abdur Rouf briefed reporters while Badruddoza and Dr Kamal were thrashing out the details. Gano Forum leader Mostafa Mohsin Montu, LDP leaders Giasuddin A Chowdhury, Nurul Amin Bepari and Mahi B Chowdhury were present. "We have had long ties with Gano Forum. Personal relationship between Dr Badruddoza Chowdhury and Dr Kamal Hossain is very good. The two leaders are now discussing future plans," Mannan said. Asked whether an alliance would be forged like in the past, he said: "The context of forming the grand alliance was different. Then the four-party alliance government was trying to impose a farcical election on people. The grand alliance was formed to resist it. "But after January 11 the situation has completely changed. The nation is now looking forward to election and is worried about the election. The next election cannot be like the previous ones and it will not be so. "We are working on a common charter of demands for a fair election. If the Election Commission does not accept our demands we will give programmes." Rouf said, "We have been working since the ban on indoor politics was lifted. Maybe we will work together in future as we did in the past. However, our future course has not yet been finalised." "The government has placed a [election] roadmap before us. We are re-evaluating everything keeping the roadmap in mind." Asked whether the name of their party was LDP or Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. Mahi said, "I would say it is Bikalpadhara." Mannan said, "Bikalpadhara was never abolished." bdnews
