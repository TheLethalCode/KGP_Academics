 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com) - Poor implementation of copyrights laws in Bangladesh helps unscrupulous businessmen exploit the huge market for music, films and computer software. This is happening even though copyrights laws are on the books, with the last amendment made in 2005. However, according to MA Shah Mahmudul Hasan, the registrar of copyrights, there is no record of anyone being jailed for pirating or using illegally copied software. According to current regulations, anyone involved in manufacturing pirated software could receive up to five years in jail plus a Tk 5 lakh fine. There are even provisions to punish the users of pirated software. "Even a sub-inspector of police can seize goods and arrest anyone involved in piracy under existing copyrights laws," Hasan told bdnews24.com. "Implementation of the law is the main problem, although the fact that no-one knows about these laws is also critical," Hasan said. A team of 12 government employees issues licences, monitors and enforces the regulations under the registrar of copyrights. "None of the officials has any relevant training," a copyrights examiner, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com. The government amended the Copyrights Act 2000 in May 2005 in an attempt to stem piracy in the entertainment industry as well as in computer software and pharmaceutical products. Bangladesh told a World Trade Organisation meeting last year that the amended law would be translated into English to assist international understanding. However, the registrar of copyrights is yet to finalise the translation since the meeting, which took place over two years ago. "Translation of the amended laws into English has been completed, although it has not been sent to the Law Ministry for vetting yet," Hasan said. The government has devoted little attention to this issue given the ongoing international pressure to tighten up a system that currently gives virtual free reign to illegal manufacturers and users. The US has gone as far as to say it would consider suspending trading links and investment in a country which violates copyrights laws. The World Trade Organisation's Secretariat Report last year noted that work was under way to bring Bangladesh's intellectual property rights laws in line with organisation's TRIPS (trade related intellectual property rights) Agreement. The report also said Bangladesh will benefit from an extended time limit in view of its status as a developing economy up to July 2013 before having to fully implement the agreement. The government told the WTO that considering the extension it intends to examine a range of issues relating to patents, trademarks and copyrights protection. A mobile court is scheduled to start a crackdown on pirated CD's, VCD's and DVD's in the near future said the Registrar of Copyrights. "We also advertised the problems created by piracy in the media recently," he added. Hasan said the US had contacted his office recently offering to train government officials on issues relating to piracy. Hasan claimed that the situation would improve significantly in the next six months, with the owners of intellectual property rights and production companies coming forward to fight the problem. "However, we rarely receive complaints regarding piracy in Bangladesh," Hasan said. Industry insiders complain that the government's response has been derisory in terms of law enforcement and publicising legal action as deterrence. Some Bangladeshi music producers have therefore taken it upon themselves to enforce the law calling it "a matter of life and death" for their businesses. Nazmul Haq, CEO of production company G-Series, said: "We have been left with no choice but to raid shops and manufacturers who have almost sent our businesses to the graveyard." bd
