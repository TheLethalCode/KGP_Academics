 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - Eminent citizens Saturday shrugged off the fears of damage to Bangladesh archeological antiques if sent to Paris for display. The concern of mishandling came to a head after the High Court put a freeze on the shipment of antiques for display at Guimet Museum in France. Speaking at a press conference at the Liberation War Museum auditorium in Segun Bagicha, Liberation War Trustee Board member Tariq Ali said the fears were unfounded. He read out a written statement to the press conference. The speakers said the exhibits should be put on display to present the history and heritage of the country to the world community. However, if there was a lack of transparency in the agreement between the two countries on the exhibition, the issue could be reviewed, they felt. A writ petition was filed with the High Court that issued a two-month stay order on sending the archeological antiques to Guimet Museum. The writ petition alleged violations of the law in sending the antiques to France, incomplete evaluation of the items and lack of a proper agreement between the two countries. But the statement read out at the press conference said: "There was no instance of archeological antiques disappearing after such exhibitions. Earlier, the national treasures of India and Cambodia were also displayed there." Prof Anisuzzaman, who joined the press conference, said Bangladesh would not lose anything by taking part in such an exhibition, but rather its image would be brightened. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal said all should know the list of the archeological treasures in the event of being taken for the exhibition. Human-rights activist Dr Hamida Hossain, actor Aly Zaker, educationist Parveen Hasan and convenor of Paribesh Banchao Andolon Abu Naser Khan were present at the press conference. bdnew
