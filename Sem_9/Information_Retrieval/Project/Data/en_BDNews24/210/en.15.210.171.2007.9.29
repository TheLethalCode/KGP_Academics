 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com) Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, speaking to an audience of global leaders in New York, has sought to promote his administration's credentials saying elected democratic governments in Bangladesh have often failed. Speaking at the World Leaders' Forum Friday Fakhruddin said that his government is doing its best to "purge the malady of corruption" in Bangladesh. "Our democratically elected governments during the past 15 years failed to promote good governance and protect citizens' rights," said the chief adviser in his statement to world leaders at Columbia University. Fakhruddin thanked the international community "for the full support and understanding" which he said his government has received in trying to restore democracy in Bangladesh. "Our caretaker administration is doing the best we can," said Fakhruddin. "This is by no means an easy task." The economics of corruption was simple, he said. "In Bangladesh, the 'winner takes all' system of politics implies that winning an election brings nearly absolute power in a given district." "A system so fundamentally corroded from within requires drastic remedies." The problem in Bangladesh, said Fakhruddin, was that the "very custodians of public trust, have long breached it" to maximise their own interests at the cost of national interest. The first step to eradicating corruption was to create strong disincentives by making it immensely costly for allpoliticians, bureaucrats and businessmen alike. "The future of 140 million Bangladeshis will largely depend on our efforts to bring our nation firmly on the path of democracy," said the head of the caretaker government. "Our window of opportunity is very small," said the chief adviser before reiterating his pledge once more to hold elections before the end of 2008. "We are determined to re-institute the checks and balances of a functioning democracy." b
