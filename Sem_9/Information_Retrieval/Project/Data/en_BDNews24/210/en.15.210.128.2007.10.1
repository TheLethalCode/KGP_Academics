 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Four former secretaries Monday testified before the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) investigators in the GATCO corruption case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia. They are former secretary to Prime Minister's Office AHM Nurul Islam, former secretary to IMED Manik Lal Samaddar, former information secretary Mirza Tasadduk Hossain Baig and former energy secretary Nazrul Islam. Nurul Islam was first to reach at the ACC headquarters at 9:40am and he left 11:50am. He refused to comment on his testimony. Manik Lal Samaddar reached the ACC at 10:34am. Mirza Tasadduk followed him. "We were the assisting officers in that incident. But nothing can be said at this stage for the sake of investigation," Samaddar told reporters while leaving at 12:50pm. He said 'no' to a question on whether he felt guilty for the incident. Emerging from the ACC office at 1:40pm, Mirza Tasadduk said to reporters, "I told the investigators what they wanted to know." On question of guilt, he said, " No sense of guilt. What guilt?" Nazrul Islam went in at 12:15pm. Former cabinet secretary and incumbent Public Service Commission chairman Dr Sa'adat Hossain and former joint secretary to the cabinet division ATKM Ismail testified before the ACC Sunday. ACC investigators questioned five members of the former cabinet committee on purchase on Sep 25. The members were former local government minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former industries minister Matiur Rahman Nizami, former agriculture minister M K Anwar and former information minister M Shamsul Islam. On Sept 2, ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the GATCO graft case against 13 persons including Khaleda and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco. The summoned officials were members of the cabinet purchase committee that had played important role in 2003 in awarding GATCO a container handling contract for Kamalapur ICD and Chittagong port. According to case details, though the cabinet purchase committee had rejected the work order of GATCO on charges of lack of skills and experience, the committee finally approved the contract as Khaleda intervened in GATCO's favour. The case alleged that the deal forced the government to count some Tk 1,000 crore in losses. bdnews24
