 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnew24.com) -- The High Court Sunday stayed the schedule of elections to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry for three weeks from notification. Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Md Farid Ahmed heard a writ petition submitted by five people, including Annisul Huq, former president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The five brought their complaint to court after they were excluded from the list of voters for FBCCI elections, slated for Nov 22. Following the verdict, Huq told reporters: "They (FBCCI) wanted to drop us from the list but they can't do that. Now the final hearing on the writ petition will decide the matter." The court asked FBCCI's election arbitration board to explain why their Sept 25 decision to exclude the five from the final voter list should not be declared illegal. Also excluded from the list are: Faisal Samad, Abdus Salam, ABM Shamsuddin and Ferdous Parvez Bivon. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq and Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud defended the complainants. Ajmalul Hossain QC represented FBCCI. bdnews24
