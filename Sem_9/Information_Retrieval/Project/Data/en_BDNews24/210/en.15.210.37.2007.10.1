<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chairman of the national coordination committee (NCC) on serious crimes MA Matin Sunday said the latest list of 80 corruption suspects published in newspapers was correct. "I think the names published in different newspapers as being on the latest list of corruption suspects are correct." Matin, also communications adviser, told journalists after a review meeting on the development projects of Bangladesh Railway at the Rail Bhaban that the list would be officially announced once the chief adviser returned home. He said the latest 80 corruption suspects were added to the earlier published lists of 142 suspects. Matin said lists of as many as 222 corruption suspects have been published and there would be no further list. He said chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed's approval was required for publication of such list, which was why the list could not be published formally. The chief adviser is in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly annual debates. Matin said there was no possibility of any name being dropped from the list of 80. The adviser said the NCC would not publish any further list as it wanted to complete the whole process including investigation into the charges by December. However, he clarified, it did not mean that nobody would indulge in corruption later and none would be tried. If there was any corruption suspect outside the lists and if there was any allegation against anybody, the ACC and the NCC would look into the allegations. The adviser presented an overall picture of the anticorruption drive conducted so far by the ACC and the NCC. bdnews24.
