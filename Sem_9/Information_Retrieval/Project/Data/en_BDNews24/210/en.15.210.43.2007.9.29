 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein said Friday the government wanted to separate business from politics. "We want to ensure that nobody uses politics as a device to do business. This is an integral part of this government's policy," the adviser told reporters at an Iftar party organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries. Mainul made it clear that the government was taking steps against those who have specific charges. "No one is unnecessarily harassed," he added. The adviser said politics and business are mixed up in the country, which would not bring any good to the country. "Using politics as a means of business is not practised anywhere in the world. The government wants to keep politicians and businessmen in their right places," he said. "Politics and business cannot go together. The government is determined to implement this policy. We are working for free and fair elections in a corruption-free environment." Mir Nasir Hossain, president of the country's apex trade body, told reporters that the businesses had subscribed to the government's anti-corruption drive. "We do not side with the corrupt. But the government's initiative to bring back confidence among the business community would be hampered if any one is harassed without specific charges," he added. Industry adviser Geetiara Safia Chowdhury, among others, was also present. bdnews24.com/m
