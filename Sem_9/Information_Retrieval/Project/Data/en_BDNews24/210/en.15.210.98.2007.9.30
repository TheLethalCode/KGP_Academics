<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, backed by RAB officers, seized illegal VoIP equipment worth over Tk 5 crore from a company of KDS Group in the port city of Chittagong Friday. Major Shamsuzzoha, who was part of the team dispatched from Dhaka, told bdnews24.com that the busted equipment appeared to be the largest haul in the port city. He said the company had set up a VSAT tucked away from easy public view to run the VoIP services from a secret room of Dominox Technology, a sister concern of KDS Group, a conglomerate mainly dealing in garments. "It will take time to determine how long the VoIP services were running and how much the operations had cost the government in lost revenue," he said. A BTRC team has been working there to collect data from the factory in Bayezid Bostami. Major Anisuzzaman of Chittagong RAB-7 said: "Officials from BTRC, RAB and an intelligence agency came from Dhaka for the raid." bdn
