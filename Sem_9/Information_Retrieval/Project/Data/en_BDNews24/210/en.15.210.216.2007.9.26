 BRUSSELS, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union competitiveness ministers are failing to live up to their job description and need to assume a stronger role, the bloc's top business lobby said in a rare burst of criticism of national governments. The EU's Competitiveness Council comprises industry, research, space and tourism ministers from the governments of the 27 member countries. It seeks to put in place business-friendly policies such as cutting red tape, boosting research and strengthening the internal market to help the EU compete with the United States and Asia. "Important results have been achieved since its inception, but its profile and coordination role has not met expectations," BusinessEurope said in an open letter to EU president Portugal posted on its website. Improving competitiveness is a core EU policy that goes under the name of the Lisbon Strategy dating back to 2000. Its initial aim was to make the bloc the world's most competitive economy by 2010, a target now widely seen as unattainable. BusinessEurope said it wanted the Competitiveness Council to play a strong role in issues such as energy and climate change policy and its impact on business. The employers group has previously said it is concerned that the EU's plans to lead the world in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and developing renewable energy could hurt the competitiveness of European companies. The Portuguese presidency should take decisive action to reinvigorate the Competitiveness Council, BusinessEurope said. The council was created in June 2002 by merging three previous ministerial groupings that covered the internal market, industry and research. It meets five or six times a year -- its next meeting is due to take place on Friday -- and critics say it is overshadowed by the higher-powered Ecofin meetings of finance ministers who are mainly interested in keeping a tight lid on spending. "BusinessEurope would like to see a Competitiveness Council that assumes leadership with respect to other Council formations," the lobby group said. A Council source said the Competitiveness Council is overshadowed by Ecofin because the latter was designated as the lead ministerial body for implementing the Lisbon Strate
