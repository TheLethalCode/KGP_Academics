 PRISTINA, Serbia, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United Nations police in Kosovo are investigating the possible involvement of the province's own police force in a bomb blast last week that killed two people, a spokesman for the Kosovo police said. Veton Elshani said UN police had seized seven police vehicles from a station in the southern town of Urosevac for examination, after witnesses reported seeing police vehicles at the scene before the blast in the early hours of Sept. 24.
