 BLACKPOOL, England, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's opposition Conservatives put environment and family centre stage on Sunday as they geared up for what may be an imminent general election. The Conservatives, pummelled by months of bad headlines and sliding poll ratings, are under intense pressure to raise their game as Prime Minister Gordon Brown considers whether to opt for a snap election. Conservative leader David Cameron, speaking as the party began its annual conference in the northwestern seaside resort of Blackpool, said he was confident his party could win. "I've always said we should have an early election. We are ready for it ... We have a very clear and compelling message to people, which is we've got to have real change in this country," Cameron said in an interview with the BBC. Brown's strong start since taking over from Tony Blair in June has tempted him to sweep his usual caution aside and to consider calling a snap general election in October or November, two-and-a-half years before an election must be called. Political analysts say he could announce an election soon after parliament returns from its summer break on October 8. An opinion poll in The Observer newspaper on Sunday gave Brown's Labour Party a seven-point lead over the Conservatives, down from an 11-point lead in a poll on Saturday, but enough to give Brown a comfortable parliamentary majority. Bookmaker William Hill stopped taking bets on a 2007 general election because punters had put so much money on it. Cameron announced plans to fight global warming by putting a tax on flights, instead of on individual passengers. He proposed a tax break for first-time home buyers and an extra allowance for poor families but threatened to cut off benefits to unemployed people who turned down a job offer. All money raised in new taxes to protect the environment would be used for tax cuts for families, he said. FIGHTING BACK Cameron is fighting back after a tough few months in which some party donors and members questioned his leadership. His attempts to end a run of three successive general election defeats by driving the party towards the centre and giving it a pro-environment makeover have met resistance from right-wingers. Forced to speed up their policy-setting process by the threat of an early election, Cameron made his most specific pledges so far, stressing traditional Conservative values such as personal responsibility and building strong families by giving tax benefits to married couples. Although Cameron denied a "lurch to the right", analysts say he is seeking to shore up support among Conservatives anxious that he has abandoned the party's traditional policies.
