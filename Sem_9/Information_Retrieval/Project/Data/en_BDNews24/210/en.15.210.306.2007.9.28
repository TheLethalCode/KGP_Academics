 Yangon, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Here are the latest developments in the pro-democracy protests in Myanmar on Friday. HEADLINES Soldiers and police seal off central Yangon behind barbed-wire barricades in anticipation of fresh protests against 45 years of military rule and deepening economic hardship. Loudspeaker trucks tour the city warning people not to protect those fleeing arrest. Activists say they expect people to try to protest outside the sealed off area, but that it would be almost impossible for them to coalesce into the size of demonstrations which prompted a government crackdown The generals appeared to have cut public Internet access to prevent more videos, photographs and information getting out about their violent crackdown on the protests. Nine people were killed in the protests in Yangon on Thursday, state television says. Australian Ambassador Bob Davis says the real toll could be far higher. The government crackdown fuels "revulsion" and sparks demonstrations at Myanmar embassies across the region. Some protesters are detained in Canberra and an axe seized after a group of around 100 clashes with police while trying to charge the embassy there. Japan will decide whether to suspend humanitarian aid after investigating the killing of a Japanese photographer during the protests. The government says it was not clear if the shooting was done on purpose or at close range, as some Japanese media reported. The military junta has agreed to receive United Nations envoy Ibrahim Gambari to discuss the crisis in the country. U.S. President George W. Bush meets Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and asks Beijing to help bring a peaceful transition to democracy. QUOTES "At noon, I go home. After that it's a bad time," said a 49-year-old Yangon taxi driver, glancing nervously at a passing military truck. "They tied the monks to the street lamp posts with ropes, just like people do to horses or dogs," said Bangkok-based Soe Aung, spokesman for National Council of the Union of Burma, a group of exiled politicians, referring to a crackdown earlier in the month in the town of Pokoku. "These monks are armed with nothing but the Buddha's word of love and peacefulness," protesters shouted outside the Myanmar embassy in Canberra. "Several multiples of the 10 acknowledged by the authorities," Australian Ambassador Bob Davis tells Australian Broadcasting Corporation when asked for an unofficial estimate of the number of those killed on Thursday. "They are going to delay the message, but they' re not going to stop it. This time there will be more pictures and they will come out," said British journalist Dominic Faulder on the regime's attempts to prevent information about the crackdown getting out.
