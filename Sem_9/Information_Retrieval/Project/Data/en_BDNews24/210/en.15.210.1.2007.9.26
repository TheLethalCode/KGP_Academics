 BANGKOK, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean Jang Mi-ran broke her own world record to win two gold medals in the women's over 75kg class at the world weightlifting championships on Wednesday. Jang, the 2004 Olympic silver medallist, snatched 138kg to win the silver medal and lifted 181kg for the clean and jerk gold to set a new mark of 319kg for the total. The 23-year-old improved her own world record, set in May last year in Wonju, by one kg to claim her third consecutive world title. China's Mu Shuangshuang was the overall silver medallist for the third year running. She matched Jang's 319-kg total but lost out because of her heavier bodyweight. Mu equalled her own world record lift in the snatch with 139kg. Mu's gold medal was China's 21st of the championships, which are being held in Chiang Mai, Thailand
