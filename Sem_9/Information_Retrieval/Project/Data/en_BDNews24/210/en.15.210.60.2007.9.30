 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) will hold a practice match for the national team before taking on Tajikistan in the World Cup pre-qualifier. "After undergoing 20 days' fitness training in Cox's Bazar, it needs to bring combination in the squad and we are planning to hold a practice match before the World Cup pre-qualifier in Dhaka," said BFF acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu Sunday.
