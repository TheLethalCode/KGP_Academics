 YANGON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troops cleared the streets of central Yangon on Thursday, telling protesters they had 10 minutes to go home or be shot, as the Myanmar junta intensified its two-day crackdown on the largest uprising in 20 years. At least five people, including a Japanese photographer, were killed in Myanmar's main city on Thursday when soldiers and police fired on crowds protesting against military rule. Crowds scattered as 200 soldiers marched slowly through the streets, rifles at their sides and loudspeakers blaring out warnings -- ominous reminders of 1988, when an estimated 3,000 people were killed in the crushing of nationwide demonstrations. Riot police walking from Sule Pagoda, end-point of more than a week of monk-led marches against military rule and economic hardship, clattered their rattan shields with wooden batons. "It's a terrifying noise," one witness said. The troops acted shortly after 1,000 chanting protesters hurled stones and water bottles at them, prompting a police charge in which shots were fired and one man fell. It was not known if he was alive or dead, or had been hit by bullets or smoke bombs fired by police. On Wednesday Buddhist monks said five of their brethren were killed when security forces tried to try to disperse huge protest crowds. Apart from the odd terrified pedestrian scurrying for cover, the streets emptied. The protesters retreated to areas just north of the central district, where they played "cat and mouse" with the soldiers and occasional shots were fired, witnesses said. The generals, who have ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, for the past two decades, sent in the troops despite desperate international calls for restraint. Even as military trucks disgorged soldiers, China -- the closest the isolated junta has to a friend -- was issuing a rare statement urging all parties to "maintain restraint and appropriately handle the problems that have arisen". "As a neighbour, China is extremely concerned about the situation in Myanmar," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said. BLOODSHED INEVITABLE Security forces had set up barbed-wire barricades at major junctions in central Yangon in the early morning and bloodshed had appeared inevitable as monks on Burmese-language foreign radio stations urged their comrades not to surrender. "We would like to call on the student monks to keep on struggling peacefully," one protest leader said on the BBC service. "Five monks have sacrificed their lives for our religion." State-run newspapers said one person was killed. Barricades sealed off the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda, the country's holiest shrine and starting point for the past week's protests. The only people visible were a woman selling fruit and German tourists trying to see the sights, a witness said. The junta also raided Yangon monasteries from which monks had marched and drawn large numbers of people into what became a head-on collision between the moral authority of the monks and a military machine in power for 45 years. The raids were likely to anger Myanmar's 56 million people, suffering declining living conditions worsened by huge fuel price rises last month which set off the first, small protests. "Doors of the monasteries were broken, things were ransacked and taken away," a witness said. "It's like a living hell seeing the monasteries raided and the monks treated cruelly." People living near Yangon monasteries, the revered moral centre of the devoutly Buddhist nation but one which the military sees as its main threat, reported that at least 500 monks had been taken away in army trucks. Several monasteries in the northeast were also hit and monks carted off. "Only two or three sick monks were left behind," a person living near the Ngwe Kyaryan monastery said. CHINA SAYS "NO" TO SANCTIONS The international outrage at Wednesday's use of warning shots, tear gas and baton charges against monks and unarmed civilians was loud by any standards. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called it a "tragedy" and urged the generals to allow a UN envoy to visit and meet detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. "The regime has reacted brutally to people who were simply protesting peacefully," Rice said during the UN General Assembly in New York. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would dispatch special envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Southeast Asia in hope the generals would let him in. UN sources said Gambari was heading to Singapore to try to get a visa. However, in a sign of rifts within the international community at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, China ruled out sanctions or an official condemnation of the use of for
