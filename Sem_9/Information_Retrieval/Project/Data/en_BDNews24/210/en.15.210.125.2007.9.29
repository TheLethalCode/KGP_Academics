<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The 14-party alliance led by the Awami League will take a pragmatic approach to reform issues in any talks with the Election Commission, senior leaders said Saturday. The 14 party alliance's 31-points will form the basis of our discussions with the Election Commission, they said. Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon and Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed spoke to reporters following a meeting between representatives of the two parties at acting AL president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. "The 14-party grouping has a uniform plan for reforms. Demand for reforms do not come from the party alone but reflect the public's broader expectations," Menon said. Menon said: "We want illegal election financing to be stopped." The Workers' Party leader criticised the EC's draft proposal on political activity and the upcoming general election. Menon said: "The draft proposal says speaking against the EC will be considered contempt of court." "We don't know of any such law in other countries. Registration of political parties should not just mean control of those parties," he added. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said his party had not decided when to join the EC for discussions. Tofail said: "We have decided that those whose politics are banned by the constitution and those who were involved with militancy or fundamentalism should be barred from politics in the future." The AL presidium member added that the registration process for political parties should be made easier. "No political party will be able to survive after being registered," he said. "A pragmatic decision will be taken to make talks with the EC successful so that fair and neutral elections can be held," he added. The meeting also discussed the Awami League's reform draft proposal, drawn up by central working committee member Abdul Latif Siddiqui. bdnews24.
