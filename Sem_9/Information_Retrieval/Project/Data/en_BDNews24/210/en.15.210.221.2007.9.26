 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Wednesday filed a case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman, his wife Zobaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu on charges of concealing information on assets. ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda filed the case with Kafrul Police Station at 2:28pm. The three face charges of illegally earning Tk 4.82 crore and suppressing information on having illegally acquired assets worth Tk 4.23 crore. Tarique, accused of being behind many financial deals when his mother was the prime minister in 2001-2006, has been in jail since March 7 on charges of extortion. He submitted a wealth statement to the corruption watchdog through jail authorities on June 10 claiming to have assets worth Tk 1.37 crore. The ACC sent him a notice to submit wealth statement on May 30. On July 25, Huda, the deputy director, submitted a report to the ACC after carrying an investigation into the wealth account of Tarique. He told reporters after pressing the case Wednesday that he had found more information of wealth including fixed deposit of Tk 35 lakh in different banks in the name of his wife. Asked whether Tarique's wife and mother-in-law would be arrested, Huda said, "I filed the case. Later an investigation officer would be appointed. They will be arrested on the proof of the charges after the investigation." On March 7, joint forces arrested Tarique in his Shahid Mainul Road home in Dhaka Cantonment. He has since been detained in Dhaka Central Jail. His mother Khaleda and brother Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3. bdnews24.
