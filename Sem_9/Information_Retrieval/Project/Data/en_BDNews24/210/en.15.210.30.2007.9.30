<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)The family and relatives of Tamal Kumar Das, the young man killed in beatings during voter registration in Sitakunda Saturday, have expressed grief and shock at his premature and inexplicable death. The 28-year-old shop-owner was injured in a brawl during the voter listing at Mohalonga village school. He died of his injuries later in the day. The death of Tamal has become talk of the village. Residents of Mohalonga have been heavy-hearted since the body was taken to his home village midnight and cremated Sunday morning. On a visit to the village, some 55 kilometres north of Chittagong city, the bdnews24.com correspondent found Tamal's family grief-stricken. There were no words of solace for Tamal's young widow. The two were married just four months back. The young man's father, 52-year-old Montu Kumar Das, told bdnews24.com: "Tamal is gone. But what shall I tell his innocent wife who lost her husband at the prime of life?" Tamal died at Sitakunda Health Complex at about 5.30pm Saturday, hours after he was fatally wounded as security forces tried to restore order by beating the crowd with batons during voter registration in Mohalonga village. Witnesses said a former policeman, Nurul Absar Ali, came to the school at about 1:30pm to be photographed for the voter list, and when he tried to jump the queue of voters, "on-duty army men" tried to stop him. Four young men, including Nurul Absar's son Ramzan, allegedly stabbed a Sgt Bashir, witnesses said. The sergeant was later taken to the Chittagong Combined Military Hospital. The security forces used batons to bring the situation under control. Tamal, who was present to register for voting, was among those injured. Back at his home Sunday, Montu Das could not say how or why his son had died. He could say nothing but beat his chest and weep. Tamal's young widow was also lost for words, her eyes swollen from crying. Tamal's mother Shanti Rani Das in a choked voice told bdnews24.com that her son had no enmity with anybody. She said former police man Nurul Absar's son Khokan was not Tamal's friend and her son was not involved in the brawl. "I seek justice from nobody but God." Shanti Rani said: "Tamal was only ever busy with his shop in Chittagong city. He had no time to pick quarrel with anybody." Tamal ran a fax-phone shop, 'Bhai Bhai Telecom', in the Port Colony area in Chittagong city. bdnews24.co
