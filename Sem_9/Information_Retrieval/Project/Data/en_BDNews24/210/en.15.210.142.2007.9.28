 NEW YORK, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world's major powers tried to narrow their differences on tougher sanctions against Iran on Friday, seeking to keep up pressure on Tehran to curb its nuclear program. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice chaired a meeting with her counterparts from Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, plus European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who has been holding talks on their behalf with Iran. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters just before the meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that they would seek a joint position "to show the unity of the international community" and demonstrate their determination to seek a diplomatic solution with Iran. The United States, France and Britain want the UN Security Council to adopt a third sanctions resolution soon to punish Iran for defying world demands that it suspend uranium enrichment, which the West suspects is aimed at making a bomb. Russia and China say Tehran should be given more time to cooperate with the U.N. atomic watchdog to clear up questions about its past nuclear activities and they oppose an early move to tighten economic sanctions. Germany, Iran's biggest European trade partner, has been sitting on the fence, insisting that further sanctions must be within the U.N. framework and conditional on avoiding the use of military force against the Islamic Republic, diplomats say. "We can't exclude sanctions in the longer term in the quest for a diplomatic and political solution. It depends on Iran itself," Steinmeier said. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant statements at the U.N. General Assembly this week that the Iranian nuclear issue is "closed" and Tehran will ignore the Security Council appear to have had little effect on the debate. To try to force the pace of sanctions, Rice scheduled separate back-to-back meetings, first of all six foreign ministers, then with just the three Europeans. "The main topic of conversation is two-pronged: one, what are the elements of a resolution and two, the timing," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters. "Looking at the comments from (Russian) Foreign Minister (Sergei) Lavrov, you still have agreement on the basic strategy, and that is to use the Security Council to pressure Iran to change their behavior," he said. Diplomats said the purpose of holding separate meetings was that if Moscow and Beijing blocked progress on a sanctions resolution, Washington would press the Europeans to take their own measures to restrict trade credits, investment and financial flows with Iran. Lavrov made clear Moscow is in no hurry for further U.N. sanctions, saying the priority was to support Iran's negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency. "The Security Council track was engaged to support the negotiating track," he told reporters on Thursday evening. Many European officials are hesitant about acting outside the UN framework, arguing that the unity of the international community so far has surprised and shaken Iranian leaders, and that any split would be easy for Tehran to exploit. "I believe that what impresses Iran the most is the unity of the six. Iran's strategy is to split the six but it hasn't succeeded so far," Steinmeier said. European investment in Iran is already falling dramatically -- British Foreign Secretary David Miliband cited a 40 percent fall in the first half of this year. Solana, who has held long-running talks offering economic and security incentives if Iran halts its most sensitive nuclear work, wants another chance to persuade chief Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani to accept a temporary freeze on enrichme
