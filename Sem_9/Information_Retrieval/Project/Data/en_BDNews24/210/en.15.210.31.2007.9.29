 Satkhira, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)Eleven fishermen were rescued alive from the sea Friday as they clung to a plastic container for eight days near the Sundarbans' Satkhira range. Ratan Majhi, one of the rescued men, told bdnews24.com that their trawler sank in stormy weather on Sep 19. "We survived for eight days by holding on to a plastic container which we kept in the trawler," Ratan said. Ratan added that he feared two of his shipmates from Padma and Kalmegha villages had drowned. Ramzan Nagar Union Parishad chairman Alamgir Haider told reporters that local fishermen had brought the rescued men to the Union Council office Thursday night.
