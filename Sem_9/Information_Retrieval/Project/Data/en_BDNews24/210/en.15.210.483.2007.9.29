 SHANGHAI, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier Wen Jiabao, facing calls from foreign leaders for Beijing to exert pressure on Myanmar's government, said China would work with the international community to help resolve the issue peacefully. "China's government will keep working with the international community to actively promote an appropriate solution to the Mynanmar problem," Wen told U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a Chinese foreign ministry statement said on Saturday. Wen told Brown by telephone on Friday night that China was paying close attention to the situation in Myanmar and hoped all sides would exercise restraint, to reach a peaceful solution and achieve "democracy and development", the ministry said. It was not clear whether the premier's reference to democracy meant Beijing was urging Myanmar's military government to compromise with protestors. Wen's comments largely echoed remarks by a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman on Thursday. The foreign ministry statement on Saturday did not elaborate on China's intentions towards Myanmar, but said Wen and Brown also exchanged opinions on bilateral relations and other issues of concern. US President George W. Bush met Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Thursday and urged China to "help bring a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma", the White House said. China is one of Myanmar's few allies and is believed to have considerable influence with the ruling junta.
