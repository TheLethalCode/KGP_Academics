 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com)  Former finance adviser Akbar Ali Khan Thursday criticised the caretaker administration for the ongoing steps to control the market. He said many governments in many countries, including the United States in 1970s, had tried to control the market in the same way Bangladesh is trying now, but they had all utterly failed. "We're trying to implement a failed theory to control the market," Khan, an economist and a former finance secretary, told at the launch of Bangladesh Economic Outlook, carried out by Unnayan Samannaya, a private research organisation, at Jatiya Press Club. He also said the private sector was the main driving force of Bangladesh's economy, without involving which economy could not run smoothly. Khan focused on the downtrend of the economy and soaring inflation that has inflicted the poor the most. Dr Mahbub Hossain, executive director of BRAC, also spoke at the function chaired by Unnayan Samannaya chairman Prof Atiur Rahman. "The way the government is trying to control the market is not a wise decision," Khan remarked. "The government doesn't need to invent any new theory. Economy runs on some particular economic indicators." The former finance adviser said he could see a 'bad signal' in the economy. "I am concerned with the inflationary pressure," he said, adding inflation was affecting the poor in the country where some 40 percent people still live below the poverty line. Khan suggested the government import adequate food and supply it to the marginal segment of population at subsidised price. He said he was yet to see signs of stagnation in the economy, but the prospect of economic growth had already suffered a dent. Khan noted that it was a matter of concern that import of capital machinery and raw materials had recently declined. The floods have added additional woes to the economy, the former adviser said. Mahbub Hossain said rising inflation could be checked by appreciating the taka against the US dollar. Atiur Rahman said his organisation would try to publish the Bangladesh Economic Outlook once every three months. bd
