 KATHMANDU, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's increasingly isolated King Gyanendra has sparked criticism by seeking the blessings of a child some believe to be a living goddess in an ancient ritual considered crucial to preserve the monarch's power. Gyanendra's visit to the temple of the child "goddess" Kumari late on Sunday, the final day of a rain god festival, came a few hours after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala had taken the king's place at the festival. The king drove in his black limousine to the centuries-old temple in the capital, offered gold coins to the "goddess" and received auspicious red vermilion paste on his forehead and a marigold garland, witnesses said.

The "living goddess" is considered an incarnation of Taleju, the power goddess, and is worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists alike. The standing of the ancient monarchy hit dramatic new lows after Gyanendra took absolute power in 2005. Weeks of violent street protests last year forced him to restore democracy but he has since failed to regain widespread public acceptance. More than 13,000 were killed in the decade-long conflict between government and Maoists which wrecked the already fragile national economy, dependent on aid and tourism and among the world's poorest.
