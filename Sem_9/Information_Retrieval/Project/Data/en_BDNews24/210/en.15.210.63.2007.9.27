 MILAN, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan's patchy form continued when they lost 2-1 at Palermo while Inter Milan went level at the top of Serie A with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring another brace in a 3-0 win over Sampdoria on Wednesday. Roma, without the injured Francesco Totti, drew 2-2 at Fiorentina to stay in first place but conceded a goal with 10 minutes to go when Matteo Ferrari fouled Christian Vieri and Adrian Mutu converted the penalty with a cheeky chip. Juventus crushed Reggina 4-0 while former AC Milan striker Marco Borriello scored a hat-trick in promoted Genoa's 3-2 win at home to Udinese. Milan looked on track to end a run of three 1-1 league draws after Clarence Seedorf flicked the ball home following Kaka's clever pass in the 10th minute. The European champions continued to dominate but Aimo Diana equalised from close range after Amauri chested the ball down and squared for his team mate amid protests from Milan that he had used an arm and that Diana was offside. Palermo's Fabrizio Miccoli then grabbed the winner when he blasted home a free kick in stoppage time to condemn Milan to their first defeat of the campaign. Milan's reserve goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac, playing instead of the injured Dida, could have done better with Miccoli's effort. "Milan deserved to win. This defeat hurts because we didn't deserve it and there were some decisions that went against us," Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti told SKY TV. "It is difficult to play better than we did." SCRAPPY EQUALISER Inter produced their best display of the season to recover from last weekend's 2-2 draw at Livorno and last week's 1-0 defeat by Fenerbahce in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic, who also scored a double at Livorno, drove in two excellent efforts from the edge of the box either side of halftime with Luis Figo adding the third. Inter joined Roma on 11 points after Luciano Spalletti's side conceded late in Florence having looked set to stay clear at the top. Roma, who won their first three games before drawing with Juve last weekend, took the lead thanks to a superb chip from Mancini but then let Fiorentina defender Alessandro Gamberini grab a scrappy equaliser. Ludovic Giuly restored their advantage before the break only for Ferrari to give away a penalty with an ill-judged slide on Vieri leaving Mutu to coolly convert the spot kick. Fiorentina's Marco Donadel was sent off for two bookings with five minutes left. Juve romped to victory over hapless Reggina in the second half thanks to close range goals from Nicola Legrottaglie and Hasan Salihamidzic before long runs and finishes from David Trezeguet and Raffaele Palladino
