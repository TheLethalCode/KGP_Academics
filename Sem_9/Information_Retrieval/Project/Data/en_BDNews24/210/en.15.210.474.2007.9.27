 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  Businessmen and industrialists have not shown much interest in legalising their undeclared income although the deadline for using the government-declared opportunity ends Sept 30. The National Board of Revenue chairman, Badiur Rahman, is clearly frustrated. "Though it was thought that many would avail themselves of the opportunity, it hasn't been so in reality." NBR officials believe the rate of legalising undeclared money has slowed down because of what they said was the government's going soft on businesspeople. On June 4, in the first phase, opportunity was given for two months to legalise undeclared income by paying 5 percent fine with the government-fixed tax. On July 31, the deadline was extended on the same terms by another two months to Sept 30. Those with undeclared money or assets think that the government's soft stance towards the businessmen will continue and they will not face much trouble in future for not legalising undeclared income. The NBR chief is far from happy about the amount of money legalised in the last four months after the government announced the facility. "We thought that a large number of people would use the opportunity to legalise undeclared money. But despite extending the deadline by two months, the response has not been hugely positive," he told bdnews24.com. "Many [big businessmen] had claimed that if the government gave them the opportunity, they were ready to pay up to 50 percent in tax. But now they are untraceable." According to the NBR statistics, until Thursday, 22,475 people have legalised Tk 3,214 crore in undeclared income. The government has received Tk 544 crore in revenue from it. In the first phase, for two months there was a long queue to legalise undeclared income. At the time the government got Tk 50 crore in revenues from undeclared income in the first one and a half months and in the next 15 days, Tk 250 crore was deposited to the national exchequer. But when the deadline was extended by two more months, response was limited. A high NBR official, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com Wednesday, "We thought a huge amount of undeclared money would be legalised as the deadline was approaching, but now we see it did not happen. Rather as the deadline is nearing, the rate is coming down. The matter has surprised us." The NBR chief said: "The government is taking different steps to restore trust among businessmen. The NBR is also following the same policy. However, owners of illegal money will not in any way be spared." He said the NBR officers would conduct drives throughout the country in search of illegal money or wealth after Sept 30. Owners of illegal money would have to face strong action and fines as per the income tax law. Rahman said, "An economist estimated the amount of undeclared money to be about Tk 200,000 crore. If he is right, we would be happy if Tk 50,000 crore were legalised." NBR member Ali Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "First we targeted to get more than Tk 1,000 crore in tax on undeclared money. Later, the target was reset at Tk 700 crore. But now there is doubt about reaching that target as well." At a view-exchange meeting on Sept 5, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed pledged measures necessary to restore business confidence. The finance ministry later asked the central bank to extend cooperation to organisations of the businessmen who have arrested or fugitive. The Bangladesh Bank Monday directed the banks to do so. The Anticorruption Commission also announced that no more lists of corruption suspects would be published after September. bdnews24.
