 MANILA, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A corruption scandal dogging Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo claimed its first casualty on Monday, when one of her allies resigned following claims he offered bribes to secure a contract for a Chinese firm. The move by Benjamin Abalos, who stepped down as head of the election commission (Comelec), was widely interpreted as an attempt to protect Arroyo. He had faced impeachment, a process which could have brought more details of the scandal to light and potentially damaged the president. "Abalos saved the queen," said Teodoro Casino, an opposition member of the house of representatives. But in an effort to clear his name, Abalos could still implicate others after a humiliating appearance at a senate inquiry last week. During the hearings, Romulo Neri, the former head of an economic planning agency, said Abalos had offered him $4.4 million during a round of golf to approve a $330 million telecoms deal with Chinese firm ZTE Corp . Abalos, who worked as a janitor and golf caddie to pay for law school, denies the allegations and vowed to fight them. "The fight's not over yet," he told a crowd of supporters at his home, who shouted "no, no" when he announced the resignation. "I will prove them wrong. I will clear my family's name and restore my dignity." The bribery scandal has been an irritant for Arroyo since July and threatens to split her government, but the president was not directly implicated during the senate inquiry. Neri told the inquiry that Arroyo had told him not to accept the 200 million peso bribe. But he refused to divulge other conversations he had with the president about the deal, provoking media speculation that Arroyo was lining Abalos up as a "sacrificial lamb" to limit the fall-out from the scandal. Had Abalos stayed on, the impeachment trial would not have allowed government officials to invoke executive privilege and withhold information as they had during the senate inquiry. "Arroyo has escaped another potential crisis by sacrificing Abalos," Earl Parreno, a political analyst of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms (IPER), told Reuters. "It was a masterstroke to calm the turbulent waters." But the resignation could embolden the opposition to further pursue Arroyo over the scandal, Parreno said. The case could get messy for Arroyo if the speaker of the house of representatives and an important coalition partner, Jose de Venecia Jr, threatens to leave the government over the scandal. The alleged shenanigans came to light when the speaker's son, Jose "Joey" de Venecia III, cried foul when ZTE Corp was chosen in April above his own, cheaper offer to supply a broadband network to government agencies. Joey de Venecia told the senate inquiry last week that Abalos had offered him $10 million to withdraw his bid for the contract. Abalos, who plans to file libel suits against his accusers, denied brokering the deal with ZTE Corp, but said at the inquiry that he had travelled to China to play golf with company executiv
