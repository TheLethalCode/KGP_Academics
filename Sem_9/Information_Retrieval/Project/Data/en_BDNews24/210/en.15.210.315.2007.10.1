 LOS ANGELES, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The stars of two of the most infamous celebrity sex videos to surface on the Internet may be headed for holy matrimony. Onetime 'Baywatch' beauty Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon, a former boyfriend of Paris Hilton, applied for and were granted a marriage license in Las Vegas on Saturday, the syndicated TV show 'Access Hollywood' has reported. Representatives for Anderson and Salomon were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. Earlier this month, Anderson, 40, said on the talk show hosted by comedian Ellen DeGeneres that she was engaged, but declined to identify her fiancee, other than to say he was a poker player, according to 'Access Hollywood.' It would be the third marriage for Anderson, who gained international stardom playing buxom lifeguard CJ Parker on the TV show 'Baywatch.' Anderson and her first husband, Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee, with whom she appeared in a widely circulated sex video, divorced in 1998 after three years of marriage and two children. She and her second husband, Kid Rock, divorced last year after four months of marriage. Las Vegas police this month cited Rock for suspicion of battery after a scuffle between him and Lee at the MTV Video Music Awards show. Salomon was briefly married in 2002 to actress Shannen Doherty of the TV hit 'Beverly Hills, 90210,' but their union was annulled. He later dated Hilton in a relationship memorialized in an infamous "night-vision" sex tape that also gained wide Internet exposure before it was distributed as a porn film titled 'One Night in Paris.
