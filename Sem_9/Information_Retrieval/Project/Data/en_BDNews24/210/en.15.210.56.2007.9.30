<TITLE> Khaleda gets bail, GATCO case stayed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday granted bail to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in the GATCO corruption case. The court also halted the proceedings of the case under the emergency powers rules against Khaleda Zia and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco. An HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman in the ruling, however, said the investigation of the case would continue. The court did not grant bail to Coco and informed his lawyer that his bail petition would be considered later. A lawyer for the detained former prime minister Thursday filed a writ appeal with the High Court challenging the legality of the GATCO case that was brought under the emergency powers rules to stop Khaleda receiving bail. The court also asked the Anticorruption Commission and the government to explain in six weeks why the inclusion of the case under emergency powers rules was not illegal. A senior law officer of the government, speaking on condition of anonymity, told journalists that the government would appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court. After the verdict, Khaleda and Coco's main counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq told journalists, "A writ petition was filed challenging the FIR in GATCO case. The court has stayed the proceedings of the case. It granted Khaleda Zia interim bail." He also said the incident of the case had taken place before the state of emergency had come in force. He pointed out that cases could be filed under the law for the crimes committed during the state of emergency. Barrister Huq said, "I am a lawyer. I stood for Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib's daughter Sheikh Hasina. I had personal relations with Ziaur Rahman. From a sense of duty I have stood for his wife and son. "The government has said it will allow legal assistance to the two leaders. I am providing that assistance. The government would be able to tell the world that the two leaders had been provided legal assistance." Asked whether Khaleda would be able to come out of the jail following the verdict. barrister Huq said there was no technical problem. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed he refused to comment on the High Court order. Anticorruption commission deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 against 13 persons including Khaleda and Coco. Chowdhury alleged that the government had been forced to count Tk 10,000 crore in losses because the work of handling container at Kamalapur Inland Container Depot and Chittagong Port was awarded to inefficient and inexperienced bidder GATCO at the intervention of Coco and Khaleda. Khaleda and Coco were arrested on the charges on Sept 3 and the case was included in the emergency powers rules on Sept 18. They filed two separate writ petitions in the High Court challenging its legality on Sept 27. In hearing of the two writ petitions, barrister Huq argued that the Anticorruption Commission secretary did not have the authority to include the case under the emergency powers rules since the alleged incidents took place between March 1 and December 31, 2006. No counsel for the government or the ACC took part in the Sunday's hearing on the two writ appeals. bdnews24
