 TEHRAN, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fuel tanker collided with a bus in southeastern Iran setting the two vehicles on fire and killing 14 people, ISNA news agency reported on Saturday. Fifteen people were injured in the incident on Friday evening in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, which borders Pakistan, it added. "Because the tanker was carrying fuel the two vehicles caught fire and because of its intensity, 12 passengers along with the two drivers ... were killed," ISNA said. Statistics show that one person dies every 20 minutes on Iran's roads, one of the highest road accident rates in the world. The frequent crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poor quality roads and inadequate police supervision.
