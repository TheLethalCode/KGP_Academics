 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)Afghan police continued search for Nurul Islam, the BRAC official abducted in Afghanistan 20 days ago, an official in Dhaka said Thursday. "Rescue efforts are on. We are in constant communication with the Afghan government. Afghan police are trying hard to rescue the kidnapped Bangladeshi citizen. We hope the search will see a success soon," M Anwarul Haq, director of public affairs and communication, told bdnews24.com. Haq further said: "I spoke to Nurul Islam's wife Anwara Parveen in the morning. She sounded quite optimistic about her husband's freedom." "My husband went to work in Afghanistan to help the Afghan people achieve development and also brighten the image of our country there. That's why I believe that nobody will harm him," said Parveen, quoted by Haq. BRAC programme officer Jalal U Ahmed went to the Afghan capital, Kabul, to monitor the rescue efforts. BRAC official Nurul Islam was kidnapped from his office in Afghanistan on Sept 8. The armed kidnappers looted 30,000 in Afghanis during the abduction. Afghanistan launched a special rescue operation in this connection on Sept 9. Three suspects have been arrested. In a TV broadcast Monday, however, Taliban officials said they were not responsible for the kidnapping of Nurul Islam. bdnews24
