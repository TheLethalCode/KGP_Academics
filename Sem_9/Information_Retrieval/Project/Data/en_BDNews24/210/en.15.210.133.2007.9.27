 Adrian Bathgate WELLINGTON, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Telecom Corporation of New Zealand will be split into three separate operating units but can spin off its phone network later, the government ruled Wednesday, sending Telecom shares up 4 percent. The government ordered Telecom last year to open its phone network to competitors and split into wholesale, retail and network divisions to speed up the introduction of cheap, fast internet services and greater competition in telecommunications. Telecom had said the proposal was unworkable and instead proposed a plan to spin off its fixed line phone network, valued at NZ$2 billion (US$1.49 billion), into a separate company. The market welcomed the certainty around the final decision and the fact the government did not completely close to the door to the former state-monopoly's counter-proposal, said Grant Williamson of brokerage Hamilton Hindin Greene. "The market's been waiting for this for quite some time, now its come out people think its time to move in and buy the stock again," Williamson said. Telecom chief operating officer technology Mark Ratcliffe said the reforms were demanding, and reiterated the company's previous estimates that complying would cost it NZ$200 million in capital costs over four years, and NZ$40 million per year in operating expenses. "With respect to the demands they will place on our people the determination requirements are challenging but workable," Ratcliffe said in a statement. Shares in Telecom, New Zealand's largest listed company, gradually gained during the day to reach a peak of NZ$4.49, up 4 percent in its biggest one-day rise say May last year. The broader market was up 1 percent. MARCH DEADLINE Communications Minister David Cunliffe said Telecom would be split in line with the government's original plan, to take effect by March 31 2008, and it had 20 working days to draft a separation plan. However, Cunliffe also said that Telecom retained the option to pursue a structural separation at a later date, and Hamilton Hindin Greene's Williamson said the market welcomed the possibility that there could be an asset sale at some point in the future. Telecom had previously said the government reforms were unworkable and would result in a network funding shortfall of NZ$1 billion that could prevent the government from fulfilling pledges on high-speed broadband access. But at its fourth quarter result on Aug 3 Telecom said it had made progress in its discussion with the government on how to implement the reforms. Telecom dominates the fixed line phone market, from which it gets around three-quarters of its income, competing with the local subsidiary of Australia's Telstra. It new chief executive Paul Reynolds from Britain's BT Group, is due to start within the next few weeks, and analysts say his job will be to guide the company through the regulatory changes while protecting earnings.
