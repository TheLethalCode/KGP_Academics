 BANGKOK, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand has prepared a plan to evacuate Thais from Myanmar if violence erupts there, putting three Air Force cargo planes on standby to fly them home, officials said on Thursday. They said security forces along the Thai-Myanmar border had been told to prepare for a possible influx of refugees fleeing army suppression as happened after 3,000 people were killed in 1988 as Myanmar troops put down an uprising.

Thai Defence Minister Boonrawd Somtas cancelled his two-day trip to meet Myanmar generals on Thursday due to the unrest. "We haven't talked to the Burmese military leaders since the protest started, but we hope everything will improve soon," Thai Supreme Commander General Boonsrang Niumpradit said. But more bloodshed seemed inevitable as monks on Burmese-language foreign radio stations urged the clergy not to yield. "We would like to call on the student monks to keep on struggling peacefully," one said on the Burmese-language service of the BBC. "Five monks have sacrificed their lives for our religion." Chumporn Polrak, governor of the northern Thai border province of Tak, said security forces were braced for the influx of refugees.
