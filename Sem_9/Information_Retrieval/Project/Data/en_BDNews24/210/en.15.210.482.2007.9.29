 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday said he saw no reason the main parties could not work together on 'issue-based movements'. "Despite having no similarities in policies or ideals, issue-based movements can be launched with any party, including the Awami League," he said. "However, no decision can be taken until the ban on politics is lifted," Delwar told reporters in his NAM flat near the Sangsad Bhaban. Delwar echoed recent comments from acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman, who said a united movement with the BNP could be launched if common grounds could be found in policy and ideals. "Every party has its own manifesto. However, in the past united movements were launched despite differences in policy," said Delwar. The secretary general went on to give the examples of the Awami League's alliance with the Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami. Although Delwar said no talks were taking place during the state of emergency he hinted that he was maintaining some kind of informal links with leaders of different political parties. "The BNP will go for united movements with other political parties in the future in the interest of the public," he said. The BNP leader also reiterated his demand to have the BNP's Naya Paltan office reopened. Reporters asked for Delwar's opinion on Dr Kamal Hossain and Prof AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury's recent calls for national unity. "Anybody can make a call for national unity in the name of democracy. What remains to be seen is how much people respond to that call," he said. Delwar declined to comment on the list of 80 graft suspects published in newspapers Friday. However, Delwar disowned BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah's statement on the issue. "That is not our statement," he said. bdnew
