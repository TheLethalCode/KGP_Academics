<TITLE> GM commits nearly $30 bln for health-care trust </TITLE>

 DETROIT, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - General Motors Corp. will shift responsibility for health-care liabilities for its retired union workers to a new trust fund in 2010 and put $24.1 billion into that fund by the start of next year, the United Auto Workers said on Friday. The UAW said the total GM commitment to the fund was now nearly $30 billion. That will take more than $50 billion of liability for retiree health care off GM's books. The details of the health-care trust, seen as the centerpiece of a new four-year labor contract between the UAW and GM reached this week, were contained in a union publication for its 73,000 members working at GM. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said on Friday that he hopes to have the GM agreement ratified by the automaker's workers by Oct. 10. The union's local unit leaders had unanimously approved the tentative four-year contract earlier on Friday. The approval followed a meeting in Detroit where the local leaders were given details of the proposed agreement. GM and the UAW reached a deal early on Wednesday, ending a two-day national strike by GM's UAW-represented workers. The deal needs to be ratified by a majority of the 73,000 workers. "I think everyone should approve it," said Terry Frederick of UAW Local 14 in Toledo, Ohio, as he left the meeting. According to the contract, highlights of which were made available to Reuters, GM will provide $24.1 billion in January to the new UAW-aligned health-care trust, known as a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA. Also, GM has agreed to a "total moratorium on outsourcing" and committed to product investment in 16 union-represented plants, according to the document. The automaker has the option to close three more US plants, however. Gettelfinger said the proposed contract would allow GM to hire new workers for "noncore" work at lower wages and make way for about 3,000 temporary workers to be made permanent. The union will now focus on negotiations with Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC, starting next week, he added. The UAW had extended its previous contract with both Ford and Chrysler to focus on bargaining with GM. The UAW and GM had so far not provided any details on the deal, except to confirm that the automaker would be shifting more than $50 billion of obligations for retiree health care to VEBA -- a breakthrough expected to allow Detroit automakers to cut in half the labor-cost gap with their Japanese rivals. The contract also includes a $3,000 signing bonus and a new round of buyout offers for GM workers, according to UAW local unit leaders. GM has lost about $12.3 billion in the past two years and has seen its US market share drop to about 24 percent in 2006 from about 46 percent in 1978. It has long claimed that it needed cuts in health-care costs and other areas to compete. The union has said it expects GM's UAW employment in the United States to be nearly unchanged four years from now, depending on GM's production volumes. The new VEBA, must receive court approval, and GM said the US Securities and Exchange Commission would conduct a review of its accounting treatment as well. bd
