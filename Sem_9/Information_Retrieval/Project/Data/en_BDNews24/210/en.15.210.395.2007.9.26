<TITLE> Bangladesh holds steady on CPI </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's position has remained steady in terms of integrity as it ranked 162 among 180 countries in the corruption perceptions index (CPI) 2007, Transparency International said Wednesday. Bangladesh scored 2.0 points, the same as it did in 2006, on a scale of 10 points. Countries with a score below 3 are described by TI as being "highly corrupt". Bangladesh, which was ranked No. 3 in 2006, finished seventh from bottom for 2007, the Bangladesh chapter of the international watchdog said in a statement. In terms of score, the index gives a rolling two-year average. Included in the 2007 index is data collected until the end of July 2007. "Which means that CPI 2007 was relatively more influenced by data from 2006," said TIB. The index also draws on data from expert and business surveys. According to the statement, the "sense of insecurity and uncertainty" among the business community in the wake of the post-1/11 anticorruption drive is likely to have affected the score. The statement also said that it is too early for the institutional reform measures initiated by the caretaker government to have had an impact on Bangladesh's CPI score for this year. Bangladesh has nevertheless remained steady with a score of 2.0, showing improved performance compared with nine countries that had earlier scored better. "Scores are more important than the rank. It means the position of Bangladesh remains the same as before," said TIB chairman Prof Muzaffer Ahmad at the National Press Club Wednesday after the release of the CPI 2007 report. "While most low-scoring countries continued a downward trend and even many high-ranking countries also received lower scores in 2007, Bangladesh was successful in resisting this," the statement said. The country's rank at 162 on CPI is also shared by Cambodia, Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The Berlin-based international anticorruption watchdog released the CPI 2007 report Wednesday across the world. The index ranks countries in terms of perceived degree of prevalence of political and administrative corruption. Denmark, Finland and New Zealand are the least corrupt countries, which jointly top the list with CPI scores of 9.4 points each, with 10 being the least corrupt. Somalia and Myanmar have emerged as the most corrupt nations, as they come bottom of the list, with Iraq and Haiti just above. Singapore topped the list of the least corrupt among the Asian countries, scoring 9.3 alongside Sweden. bdnews24.
