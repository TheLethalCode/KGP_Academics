 MOSCOW, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's security service has arrested two senior Audit Chamber officials and a regional official from Vladivostok on suspicion of bribery, the public accounts watchdog said on Thursday. The Audit Chamber's chief inspector Sergei Klimantov and Sergei Dubovitsky, first deputy mayor of the region's capital, were suspected of extorting a bribe from a commercial company. "In the course of the operation, Klimantov and Dubovitsky were seized right at the moment when they were receiving an illegal cash payment of $120,000 (85,000 euros)," Audit Chamber spokesman Alan Uzhegov said. Uzhegov did not say when the arrests took place. He said the two officials were suspected of taking the bribe for omitting from a report legal violations by the commercial company. In a separate case, head of the chamber's legal department, Parina Farniyeva, was arrested on suspicion of being involved in another criminal case involving a 1 million euro bribe. Analysts say bribery, which hurts the country's investment climate, is likely to become a major theme in parliamentary and presidential elections due to take place in the next six months. Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, appointed by President Vladimir Putin last week, has suggested that a special state agency should be created to fight bribery in Russia.
