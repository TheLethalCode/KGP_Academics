 KARACHI, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Shahid Afridi has pulled out of the upcoming Test series against South Africa, the country's selectors said on Thursday. Chief selector, Salahuddin Ahmed said Afridi has asked to be released for the two Tests, the first of which begins in Karachi on Monday, and his request had been accepted. "He will not be considered for the Tests," said Ahmed. "But he is available for the five One-day internationals that follow." Afridi did not want to be involved in the Tests because of the holy month of Ramadhan, during which he wanted to fast. "I am looking forward to the one-day series that starts after Ramadhan," he said. "But right now I need a rest, especially after the disappointment of losing the final of the Twenty20 World Cup to India." Afridi retired from Test cricket last year, saying he wanted to concentrate on the one-day game, but he was coaxed back to join the Test side. "I am sorry that we couldn't win the Twenty20 World Cup. I feel if I had scored a few runs we could have crossed that line," said Afridi, who has played in 26 tests and 240 one-dayers. Pakistan lost to India by five runs in Johannesburg on Monday in a thrilling climax to the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup
