<TEXT>
 Dhaka, September 30 (bdnews24.com)The recent ban on the use of mobile phones while driving will be strictly enforced, BRTA chairman ABM Shahjahan said Sunday. "Drivers caught using hydraulic car horns will be fined and the horns seized," the head of the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority told bdnews24.com, adding that the use of seatbelts will also be better monitored. Government gazettes recently published in these connections now call for their stern enforcement in an ongoing government drive to curb traffic rule violations, Shahjahan said. Deputy commissioners at the district level have been alerted to implement the government directives stringently, he added. A BRTA official also said the relevant ordinance will soon be amended to prevent dark smoke emissions from automobiles, sound pollution and overspeeding while BRTA rules and regulations are to be streamlined for their better enforcement. BRTA director Humayun Rashid Khalifa told bdnews24.com that fixed fines and punitive measures are being incorporated into the BRTA ordinance for various traffic related offences. A committee headed by the BRTA chairman has been formed to conduct the BRTA ordinance amendments. Its draft will be submitted to the ministry soon. bdne
