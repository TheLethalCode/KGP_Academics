 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court did not extend a freeze on the trial-court proceedings of the MiG-29 graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A seven-member full bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, decided not to extend the chamber judge's suspension order on the case. Deputy attorney general Abdur Rouf Miah told bdnews24.com that the SC order cleared the way for the case to proceed in the trial court. But Hasina may again file an appeal with the Appellate Division when the case proceedings restart, according to Sunday's court order. Earlier, the SC chamber judge put a freeze on the Hasina case, based on an appeal, which came after the High Court on Sept 6 rejected Hasina's petition to quash the case. According to case details, eight MiG-29 fighter planes were purchased on Feb 9, 1999 for Bangladesh Air Force during the Hasina administration in line with a technical assistance deal signed between Bangladesh and Russia. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official of the now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the case on Dec 11, 2001 with Tejgaon Police Station accusing five people including Hasina after the BNP-led four-party alliance came to power. Hasina appealed to the HC, seeking the quashing of the case. The HC stayed proceedings of the case the same year. The case had remained on hold since 2001. On May 28, the interim government revived the case, appealing to the HC seeking hearing on Hasina's appeal for quashing the case. bdnews24
