 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)A total of Tk 3,775 crore undeclared money has been legalised over the last four months, with the government receiving Tk 687 crore in tax on the amount, the National Board of Revenue said Sunday. The NBR provided the legalising facility for four months in two phases to Sept 30. On the last day (Sunday) of the special facility 6,658 people legalised Tk 130 crore in previously untaxed income, with the government earning Tk 92 crore tax. The NBR will accept pay-orders received on Monday, which were sent on Sunday to their specific tax zones but did not arrive for some reason. NBR official Moshtak Ahmed told bdnews24.com Sunday: "A huge number of people [10,410] stepped up to legalise their income over the last two days." NBR chairman Badiur Rahman is not happy though. According to an economist, the amount of illegal property held by people is worth more than Tk 200,000 crore, Rahman said. "If that's true, the amount of recently legalised income is infinitesimal." "Only a few bigwigs turned up. Those who legalised their money were mostly middle income people," the NBR chief said. "A huge amount of money is yet to be declared," he added. He suspects the money might be used for the upcoming national elections. The government on June 4 announced the opportunity to legalise undeclared income by paying an extra 5 percent over the fixed income tax. In the first phase, the facility was offered for two months. On July 31, however, the opportunity was extended by a further two months to Sept 30. The highest response was received in the Khulna tax zone, where 22,794 people have legalised Tk 369 crore, with the government receiving about Tk 61 crore in tax. bdnews24.com/a
