 NEW DELHI, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia will stage this year's elite Champions Trophy tournament after it was moved out of Pakistan over security concerns, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) said. The tournament is to be staged in Kuala Lumpur from Nov. 29 to Dec. 9, the FIH said on its Web site. Malaysia edged out India after both had been chosen as alternate venues. Australia and South Korea refused to play in Lahore over security concerns and the FIH decided to shift the event. "We are happy that the Malaysia Hockey Confederation was able to accept the responsibility to host this important event," FIH president Els van Breda Vriesman said. The field is to be expanded by two teams with original participants Australia, Germany, Korea, Netherlands, Pakistan and Spain to be joined by Britain and Malaysia. "This is a fair and just outcome taking all factors into account and ensures the top teams in the world will be able to utilise the tournament as part of their preparations for the Beijing Olympic Games," Vriesman said
