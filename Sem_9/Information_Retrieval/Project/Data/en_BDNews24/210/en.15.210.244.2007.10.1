 SANAA, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least eight Yemeni soldiers were killed in a volcanic eruption on an island off the country's Red Sea Coast, the government said on Monday. The volcano erupted late on Sunday, spewing lava hundreds of metres into the air. Officials said earlier nine soldiers were missing. "At least eight are regarded as dead now," a government official told Reuters. The eruption occurred on Jabal al-Tair, an island about 80 miles (130 km) from Yemen. Yemen has had a military base on the island since its 1996 conflict with Eritrea over the nearby islands of Hanish and Jabal Zuqar.

The NATO fleet was sailing north towards the Suez Canal at the time of the eruption, the Canadian navy said in a statement.

In an e-mail from Toronto, he said the entire two-mile-long (three-km-long) island was aglow with lava and pouring into the sea.
