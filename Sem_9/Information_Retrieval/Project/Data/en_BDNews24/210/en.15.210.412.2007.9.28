 SYDNEY, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand named opening batsman Michael Papps in their squad for the two-test tour of South Africa in November. Papps replaces Jamie How at the top of the order and will open the batting with Craig Cumming. "The selectors were looking to form a quality opening partnership," coach John Bracewell said in a statement on the New Zealand Cricket web site (www.blackcaps.co.nz). "Craig Cumming is the incumbent and is acknowledged as a quality player of pace, while Papps is being rewarded after an excellent domestic season." Daniel Vettori will captain the side with former skipper Stephen Fleming named as a specialist batsman along with Ross Taylor, who should make his test debut against South Africa. Fast bowler Kyle Mills was included after recovering from injury but James Franklin was omitted from the squad as he recovers from a knee injury. South Africa and New Zealand will play two tests, the first in Johannesburg starting on Nov. 8 and the second at Centurion Park on Nov. 16. New Zealand squad - Daniel Vettori (captain), Craig Cumming, Michael Papps, Stephen Fleming, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Peter Fulton, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Shane Bond, Mark Gillespie, Jeetan Patel, Michael Mason, Chris Martin
