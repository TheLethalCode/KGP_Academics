 LONDON, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Margaret Thatcher has joined calls for Prime Minister Gordon Brown to hold a referendum on the European Union reform treaty, the Sun newspaper reported on Saturday. Labour Party and opposition politicians, trade unions that help finance Labour and several newspapers have lobbied Brown to hold a vote but the he has shown no sign of conceding. "This treaty matters, Prime Minister, so be bold and let the British people have the final say," the former Conservative leader told the Sun. "Yet again the British people are being told that the changes in the treaty are not important, that they are technical, and that in any case we have either blocked or gained opt-outs in all the worst cases. "Well we've heard it all before only to see more and more power grabbed by Brussels. "This treaty is a blue-print for a European Constitution in all but name -- a Constitution which has already been rejected." Opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum if wins power. EU leaders agreed in June on a blueprint for the treaty to overhaul the enlarged 27-nation bloc's creaking institutions, replacing a more ambitious constitution that was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005. They hope to agree the final text of the treaty at a summit on Oct 18 and 19. Brown has said he will ensure all London's demands are met and insists the document marks no fundamental change to how Britain is run. Brown upset some Labour supporters by inviting Thatcher -- hated by left-wingers who blame her policies for throwing thousands out of work in the 1980s -- to his Downing Street residence earlier this month.
