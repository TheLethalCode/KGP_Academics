 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Sunday filed three cases against daily Janakantha editor Atiqullah Khan Masud and five employees of city developer Rajuk on charges of approving a building design illegally and concealing documents. Sub-inspector Manik Miah of Motijheel Police Station said ACC deputy assistant director Mahmud Hasan filed the three cases. In one of the cases, Rajuk official SM Asaduzzaman, Globe Constructions managing director Masud and Rajuk staffer Md Akram Hossain have been accused. The case alleged that Masud on June 26, 1990 submitted designs for one nine-storey and one six-storey building on Hoseiny Dalan Road for Rajuk approval. Asaduzzaman had sent an approval for the design to Globe Constructions without informing the Building Construction Committee in a clear case of corruption, it was alleged. In a July 3 probe, the ACC asked the Rajuk secretary to send in the file for review, but it went missing. Investigators found that Akram Hossain had hidden it. It was found that the design was not approved by the Building Construction Committee. In another case, Rajuk official Fouzi Mohammad Bin, Masud and Rajuk's former building inspector Sohrab Miah were accused. According to case details, Masud on Sept 9, 1999 sought approval for a 15-storey building on Outer Circular Road in Khilgaon. Fouzi Mohammad Bin unlawfully approved the design bypassing the proper committee and Sohrab Miah had concealed the file. The other case that accuses Rajuk officials ATM Kamaruzzaman, Masud and Sohrab Miah alleged that the design of a 15-storey building in Segun Bagicha was approved before the application for the construction of the building was made and fees deposited. Masud applied for building approval on April 11, 2000. On review of Rajuk's bank accounts it was found that Masud on behalf of Globe Constructions had deposited Tk 56,000 with Agrani Bank Rajuk Bhaban branch in two instalments for approval of the design, it was alleged. Of the amount, Tk 24,000 was deposited on April 11, 2000 and Tk 32,000 on July 10. But the approval copy Kamaruzzaman received for the construction of the building was approved on May 27, 1998. Masud is now in jail, facing charges of providing false information and concealing assets in his wealth statement to the ACC. He was arrested in Janakantha office at Eskaton on March 7. bdnews24.
