 Dr Mahfuzul Haque writes for bdnews24.com Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Against the backdrop of the Tenth Conference of Parties to Climate Change Convention (COP-13) in December 2007 in Bali, the on-going UNGA has very correctly chosen "global warming" as its thrust theme for discussion among the world leaders this year. I am hopeful the leaders would agree on a more binding agreement, during a post 1997 Kyoto Protocol period starting from 2012. Bangladesh delegation could seize the on-going debate at UNGA as an opportunity to raise its demand for simplification of immigration procedures of sparsely populated developed countries like Canada or Australia to accommodate the would be "environmental refugees" of the low-lying developing countries like Bangladesh and many island nations, victims of sea level rise. Bangladesh has already developed an "Adaptation Plan" and a portfolio of projects to address the adaptation needs to climate change. We can benefit from the "Adaptation Fund" set up by the Climate Change Secretariat to run some adaptation projects in the country. The demand for a per-capita based financial mechanism sounds well justified because of the very size of the population likely to be affected and displaced by climatic change. With a series of floods devastating many countries of Asia and Africa and drought in Australia, our delegation along with the representatives from LDCs and SIDS can aptly raise the demand for a more binding emission target at the COP-13 in Bali in December. With the post-Kyoto scenario in mind, we are to demand for a stricter global target to curb greenhouse gas emission by the parties of the Convention. Invoking Article 4.8 (b) and (d) of the Convention, the Bangladesh delegation should raise its demand for a preferential treatment being a country with low-lying coastal areas and with areas prone to natural disasters. Our demand for "new and additional fund" from the developed countries to meet our specific needs and concerns in accordance with the provision of "common but differentiated responsibilities" should continue.
