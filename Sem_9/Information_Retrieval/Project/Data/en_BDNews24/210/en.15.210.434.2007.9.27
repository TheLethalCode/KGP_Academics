<TITLE> UK banks may face big hit from deposit insurance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Profits at British banks could be hit hard in the next five years if the industry is forced to fund a scheme to safeguard deposits in the wake of the crisis at Northern Rock, analysts said on Thursday. A deposit insurance scheme built on a similar model to the United States could cost UK banks almost 3 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) a year for several years, equivalent to about 8 percent of retail banking profits, analysts at investment bank UBS said. The safety of UK bank deposits came to prominence after a funding crisis at Northern Rock two weeks ago prompted the first run on a big British bank for 140 years, which only halted when Britain's government promised to guarantee customers' savings. The current industry-backed scheme only guarantees individual deposits up to 31,700 pounds ($64,150) and is essentially financed after the event, unlike a deposit guarantee in the United States. As a result, politicians and regulators have come under pressure to review the current model. The government has said it could guarantee deposits up to 100,000 pounds and the Financial Services Authority said it was already reviewing the model, but neither has said how any plan would be funded. "We have no doubt that the banks will push back. However, we doubt the government is keen to have direct taxpayer support for the banks as a default outcome and we also note that UK retail banking is a highly profitable undertaking," Alastair Ryan, analyst at UBS, said in a research note. Ryan estimated that UK retail deposits stand at near 1,000 billion pounds, which would require a pot of 14 billion pounds given growth forecasts and a fund similar in size to the 1.25 percent used in the United States. He said it would be reasonable to assume a fund would be built over five years and that one-third of the costs are passed through to consumers. This would see banks contributing about 2.3 billion pounds in 2008, rising to 2.9 billion in 2012. The major banks such as HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds TSB would have to pay the most, based on their higher market shares, but there could be a greater impact on smaller banks that are more reliant on the UK market, Ryan said. UBS estimated the cost could equal 4-6 percent of annual earnings at HBOS and Lloyds but more than 10 percent at small banks.
