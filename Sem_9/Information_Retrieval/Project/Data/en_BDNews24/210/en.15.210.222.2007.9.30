 KHARTOUM, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed men attacked an African Union base in southern Darfur killing at least seven soldiers and injuring eight others in the worst attack on the African troops since they deployed in western Sudan in 2004. The latest violence to threaten Darfur's fragile peace process came as a group of international "elders" was due in Sudan on Sunday to put their hand to resolving the conflict in Darfur and growing tensions in the country's south. The AU base in Haskanita, southern Darfur, came under heavy attack on Saturday evening by unidentified militias, an AU statement said. "It is the heaviest casualties which we have have ever witnessed since the inception of this mission" in 2004, said AU spokesman Noureddine Mezni. "There is a feeling of shock." The AU did not give details of casualties but a Sudanese army spokesman said seven soldiers were killed, eight injured and up to 40 are missing. Rebels and the army blamed each other for the attack. An army spokesman said: "Some of the rebels attacked the AU in Haskanita." But the rebel Justice and Equality Movement commander in the region, Abdel Aziz el-Nur Ashr, told Reuters JEM had moved its troops out of Haskanita four days earlier. "There was an aggression from Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) from three directions on Haskanita and that attack was from the SAF," Ashr said of Saturday's violence. "We don't have troops there." Haskanita, in the far southeast of Darfur, has seen government bombardment and heavy fighting between the army, militias and rebels. An alliance between JEM and the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) Unity faction have become the largest military threat to Khartoum in recent months. But there is also a volatile mix of bandits, tribal clashes and militia splinter groups threatening any attempt to achieve peace and stability in western Sudan. ELDERS The Haskanita attack occurred as a group created by former South African President Nelson Mandela and women and children's rights advocate Graca Machel launched its first mission. South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former US President Jimmy Carter, Machel, and peace mediation veteran Lakhdar Brahimi, accompanied by British businessman Richard Branson, were due on Sunday in Sudan for the start of a trip that will take them to Darfur and the southern capital Juba. "This is not just a quick trip for The Elders  we want the suffering to end  and we hope to contribute to that," Tutu said ahead of the trip. International experts estimate some 200,000 people have died in Darfur with 2.5 million driven from their homes. Mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003 accusing central government of neglect. Washington calls the conflict genocide, a term Khartoum rejects and European governments are reluctant to use. Bashir puts the death toll at 9,000. The ongoing violence is likely to cast a shadow over UN-AU mediated peace talks due to start on Oct. 27 in Libya. A joint UN-AU peacekeeping force with 26,000 police and soldiers is due to deploy next year to absorb the AU's 7,000 peacekeepers who, lacking equipment and experience, have struggled to defend even themselves against attack. Mediators have called for a ceasefire ahead of talks. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said he would abide by a truce when negotiations start but JEM leader Khalil Ibrahim said he would not stop fighting until a peace deal is reached. SLA founder Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur, popular among Darfur's largest Fur tribe, poses another obstacle to talks. He refuses to attend until a competent UN peacekeeping force is deployed to protect his people and militias are disarmed. Khartoum rejected a UN force and does not want non-African infantry for the joint UN-AU compromise mission. And despite many agreements and UN Security Council resolutions Khartoum has not disarmed the militias, known locally as Janjaweed, mobilised in 2003 to quell the revolt.
