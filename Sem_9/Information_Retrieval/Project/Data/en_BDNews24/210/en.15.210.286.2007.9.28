 KOLKATA, India, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's main communist party begins a meeting of top leaders on Friday to plan its strategy in a stand-off with the government over a controversial nuclear energy pact with the United States. The communists, who shore up Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition government, have opposed the landmark agreement and threatened to end their support, triggering the country's worst political crisis in more than three years. Although leaders on both sides have privately talked about a possible compromise, there has been no indication yet that one is imminent ahead of a crucial Oct. 5 meeting of a joint panel formed to resolve the crisis. "We will be discussing the nuclear issue and the government's policy, the whole political situation in the country and then announce the outcome," Prakash Karat, chief of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), told Reuters ahead of the four-day meeting. The nuclear pact, first agreed in principle in 2005, aims to help India meet its soaring energy needs by giving it access to US fuel and reactors even though New Delhi has tested nuclear weapons and not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. While the two governments and supporters of the deal have called it historic, saying it symbolises the growing strategic friendship between India and the United States, the communists have rejected it. They say the deal compromises India's sovereignty and seeks to influence New Delhi's independent foreign policy. The left parties and the government formed a panel last month to resolve the row and it has met twice so far but made little progress. RIFT AMONG COMMUNISTS The communist deliberations in their eastern stronghold of Kolkata assumes added importance as New Delhi faces an informal end-October deadline to push the next steps needed to clinch the deal, something the left parties have warned against. Failure by the two sides to find a way out could force general elections being called early next year instead of early 2009 when they are due, some government leaders have said, as Singh's coalition is unwilling to dump the nuclear deal. While that has not deterred communist leaders in New Delhi from pushing the crisis to the brink, their counterparts in West Bengal state, of which Kolkata is the capital, are not seen keen to face early elections. State leaders have in recent days voiced their support for American investment as well as the need for US help to build a nuclear power plant in the province. These differences are expected to come to the fore at the Kolkata conference and the CPI(M) top brass would try to put a lid on the rift and forge a united front, analysts said. "We anticipate a huge debate on the reports of a growing rift, especially with the West Bengal government's recent overdrive to woo American investors," said economist Abhirup Sarkar of Kolkata's Indian Statistical Institute. "They will definitely buy more time, because early polls will definitely hurt the left more and especially in West Bengal, where the communists are desperate to consolidate their position among traditional supporters," he said.
