 BOGOTA, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Colombia striker Leider Preciado has been given a six-match ban for an offensive celebration after scoring his 100th goal for Santa Fe. The Colombian league's disciplinary committee also fined Preciado 2.17 million pesos ($1,075.93) after he grabbed his genitals in a gesture aimed at the team's own fans during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Real Cartagena. "It has come to the knowledge of this committee that Leider Preciado made obscene gestures at the public during the Santa Fe-Real Cartagena match," said a statement of the league's Web site (http://www.dimayor.com.co). The decision completed an unhappy week for Preciado after he arrived late for practice on Tuesday and was ordered to train separately. Preciado, who played and scored in the 1998 World Cup, has apologised for the celebration which he said was in the heat of the moment after the team were barracked by the supporters. Santa Fe are 15th in the 18-team Colombian championship with nine points from 10 games
