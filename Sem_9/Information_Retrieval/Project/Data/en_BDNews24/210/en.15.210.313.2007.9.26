 DETROIT, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp reached a tentative contract on Wednesday, ending a national strike by 73,000 workers with a groundbreaking deal that includes a health-care trust fund. News of the deal sent the automaker's shares up more than 6 percent in early trading. The agreement allows GM to shift more than $50 billion of retiree health-care liabilities to an independent union-aligned trust -- considered a key requirement in closing the labor-cost gap between US automakers and their foreign competitors. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, speaking at a news conference at the union's Detroit headquarters, said production at GM facilities would resume on Wednesday, two days after the first national UAW strike at GM since 1970. Gettelfinger said the union expected to meet on Thursday or Friday with local unit presidents to go over details of the four-year agreement to allow for local ratification meetings over the weekend. Ratification requires a majority vote of UAW members. "We feel very confident it will be ratified," Gettelfinger said. GM shares rose 6.1 percent to $36.53 early on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ford Motor Co shares rose 4 percent to $8.74. GM said the national agreement "paves the way for GM to significantly improve its manufacturing competitiveness" and maintain a strong production presence in the United States. "There's no question this was one of the most complex and difficult bargaining sessions in the history of the GM-UAW relationship," GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement. Gettelfinger led the UAW out on strike Monday, saying that the top U.S. automaker had not met the union's demands for guarantees of job security. "I think our retirees will be exceptionally pleased with this contract and for our active membership, there will be some changes, but overall they will be very, very pleased with the outcome of this negotiation and the job security that is associated with this," Gettelfinger said. One person briefed on the deal said it was expected to include lower-tier wages and benefits for new hires, as well as lower-tier compensation for noncore production workers, according to a story in the Detroit Free Press. "While the devil will be in the detail, our first reaction is that GM captured a much broader set of concessions than we previously anticipated," JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note. JOBS AND HEALTH CARE Struggling GM posted a combined loss of $12.3 billion over the past two years and has seen its U.S. market share drop to about 24 percent 2006 from about 46 percent in 1978. It needs cuts in health-care costs and other areas to compete. Gettelfinger said he expected GM's UAW employment in the United States to be about unchanged four years from now, depending on GM's production volumes. "I think that number will be pretty much the same, if not higher," Gettelfinger said. Neither GM, nor the UAW officials elaborated on the details of the health-care trust. However, Gettelfinger told reporters the union expected the trust to provide steady funding for 80 years, based on cash flow and solvency projections. The new UAW-aligned trust, known as a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, must receive court approval, and GM said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would conduct a review of its accounting treatment as well. A GM spokeswoman said the automaker would not provide details of the agreement until it was presented to UAW members. Wall Street analysts have said establishing a VEBA could cut GM's annual costs by $3 billion in exchange for a one-off payment expected to top $30 billion. Gettelfinger said a decision on the next bargaining target for a new contract -- either Ford or Chrysler LLC -- could be made on Thursday. "We are not going to spend a lot of time waiting here, we feel very comfortable with this agreement and we are going to move on," Gettelfinger said. If the deal with GM is ratified, that could raise the pressure on the other two U.S. automakers to come to a deal with the UAW quickly on similar terms. Talks between GM and the UAW dragged on for 10 weeks and passed the Sept. 14 deadline when the old contract expired. This deal was reached at 3:05 a.m. EDT (0705 GMT), announced less than an hour later by the UAW and was filtered quickly to local units. Skilled tradespeople were expected to report early on Wednesday to ready plants for reopening later. "We pulled the pickets just after 4 (a.m.) and we are getting ready to go," said Chris "Tiny" Sherwood, president of UAW Local 652 in Lansing, Michigan. Sherwood said the union was also close to completing a Local UAW deal with GM. "Now we need to make some quality cars and take back market share from those foreign auto makers," UAW Local 22 President George McGregor sa
