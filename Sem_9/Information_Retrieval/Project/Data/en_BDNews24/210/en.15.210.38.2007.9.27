 BANGKOK, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's junta said on Thursday it was showing restraint in dealing with the biggest uprising against military rule in nearly 20 years, a diplomat said. Yangon-based diplomats called to a meeting with a deputy foreign minister in Myanmar's new capital, Naypyidaw, were told "'the government was committed to showing restraint in its response to the provocations', as he called them", the diplomat said. At least 5 people were killed, including a Japanese photographer, in Yangon on Thursday as the junta intensified its two-day crackdown by raiding monasteries and ordering protesters off the streets or risk being be shot. The minister blamed the protests, which began in mid-August with sporadic civilian marches against shock increases in fuel prices, on "internal and external destructive elements", the diplomat said. International outrage at Wednesday's use of warning shots, tear gas and baton charges against monks and unarmed civilians has fuelled calls for tougher sanctions against the former Burma, ruled by the military since 1962. Monks said five of their ranks were killed on Wednesday. "He said they were clearly being misunderstood and that's why they were holding this meeting."
