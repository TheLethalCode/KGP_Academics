<TITLE> Argentine first lady still tops presidential polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina's first lady, Sen. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, is still the undisputed front-runner ahead of an Oct. 28 presidential election, according to six polls published on Sunday. Five surveys published by the newspaper Pagina 12 showed her with voter support of 45 percent or more, while another poll gave her 39.8 percent of votes. This last one, conducted by Poliarquia consultants for La Nacion newspaper, put the share of undecided voters at a hefty 22.7 percent. To win the October contest, Fernandez would need at least 45 percent of votes, or more than 40 percent with a 10 percentage point lead over her nearest rival. Sunday's polls put former congresswoman Elisa Carrio in second place with a maximum of 14.9 percent of votes. Considering the number of undecided voters and those who plan to spoil their ballots or not vote, "at least one-third (of voters) could ultimately opt for Cristina Kirchner, which means she could reach 50 percent," Fabian Perechodnik of Poliarquia told La Nacion, one of Argentina's leading dailies. Fernandez's popularity is linked to that of her husband, center-left President Nestor Kirchner, who is credited with the robust economic growth that followed a 2001-2002 crisis. She also benefits from a highly fragmented political opposition. "This is terribly boring; it's a triumph by default. The opposition is divided and has no personality," Heriberto Muraro of Telesurvey public opinion group told Pagina 12. "In contrast, Cristina is like Coca-Cola, a product that's clear to everyone," he was quoted as saying. The economy, which is on track to grow by more than 8 percent for the fifth straight year, is the key issue for Argentines, who are tired of boom-and-bust cycles. "Cristina Fernandez has 46 percent and that's without projecting the undecided vote. She tends to reach 52 percent," said Roberto Bacman of the Center of Public Opinion Studies told Pagina 12. "The economy continues to be people's main electoral concern. If it continues positively, and if prices and inflation stay within (reasonable) bounds, those percentages won't change," the paper quoted Bacman as saying. Official inflation runs at nearly 9 percent in the last 12 months, although analysts, opposition leaders and consumer groups believe the government is under-reporting price rises. Opposition candidates have also questioned the credibility of polls ahead of the presidential election, pointing out surprising results in recent provincial contests.
