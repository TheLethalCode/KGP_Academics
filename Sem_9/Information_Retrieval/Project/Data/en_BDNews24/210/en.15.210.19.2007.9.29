<TITLE> French PM says no alternative to economic reforms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STRASBOURG, France, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois Fillon pledged on Saturday to press ahead with economic reforms, telling party workers there was no alternative for tackling the country's under-performing economy. "Reforms are not the work of one clan or party but they result from a diagnosis of our country's situation which leaves little room for debate," Fillon said in a speech to ruling Gaullist UMP party activists in eastern France. "I tell you that (President) Nicolas Sarkozy and I will reform, reform and reform again," he said. Fillon was speaking three days after unveiling a 2008 budget based on tax breaks and ambitious economic growth assumptions, but few spending cuts. The discussion over the budget has stirred divisions between President Nicolas Sarkozy's office and Fillon over how to convince the public of the need for potentially painful reform. Sarkozy has argued the government needs extra time to push through reforms that will bring a "growth shock" to help the economy and improve government finances. Fillon has preferred shock tactics, warning of bankruptcy and saying that the public finances were in a "critical state" in an apparent effort to win over workers and union leaders who have often derailed previous attempts at reforms. Newspapers say Sarkozy is eager to put a more positive spin on state finances before important local elections next year. Fillon sought to dispel any talk of divisions with Sarkozy while appearing to stake out some freedom of manoeuvre for himself as a leading figure among France's ruling conservatives. "Whether people like it or not, there is only one strategy, one policy and one dynamic which are the ones chosen by the president," Fillon said, adding, "Nothing and no-one will divert me from my loyalty and friendship". However he presented himself as leader of a conservative political majority in terms which implied some independence. "A majority based on two principles: loyalty and freedom." France has told the European Commission it will balance the budget in 2012, two years later than originally promised. The government foresees a deficit of 41.7 billion euros, or 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, a modest improvement from the expected shortfall of 2.4 percent of GDP this year. But meeting this forecast depends on growth of between 2.0 percent and 2.5 percent this year and next -- a target that critics say could be hard to achieve due to the strong euro.
