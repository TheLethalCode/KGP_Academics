<TEXT>
 BOSTON, MS, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe is lagging behind Asian economic powers China and India in the race to snap up trade and investment deals in resource-rich Africa, Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade said. Addressing students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government in Boston late on Thursday, Wade also complained of excessive delays and red tape in investment projects offered by Western investors and institutions like the World Bank. Chinese and Middle Eastern companies could often do the job quicker, he said, while referring to trade and investment offensives in Africa by China and India, which are hungry for raw materials to feed their fast-growing economies. "You know, Europe, which is an old civilisation, can't keep up with the pace of either China or India on the trade front," the octogenarian Senegalese leader said. Traditionally a staunch ally of the West, former French colony Senegal has been awarding lucrative investment contracts to Middle Eastern, Asian and even African firms -- often at the expense of its traditional trade partner France. In June, Dubai port operator DP World won a contract worth at least 400 million euros ($566 million) to operate and develop container port facilities in the Senegalese capital Dakar, beating a French competitor. Senegal granted a mobile and fixed-line telephone operating licence to Sudan Telecommunications Co. (Sudatel). Sudatel became Senegal's third mobile operator in an award which ended the fixed-line and Internet monopoly of Sonatel, whose major shareholder is France Telecom . Observers expressed surprise over the choice of Sudatel, given Western condemnation of Sudan over the conflict in Darfur, where some 200,000 people have been killed since 2003 in political and ethnic bloodshed. Wade was blunt about what he called "too much bureacracy" in the development of projects by institutions like the World Bank. "Once I was building a highway, and the World Bank was ready to participate, but it was going to take time. I sent a delegation to China and in the 16 following days China decided to build the highway," he said. But while many African governments praise Beijing for its "no strings attached" approach to international aid and trade for developing countries, Western officials says China cuts corners by ditching safeguards against corruption and abuses. Wade made clear he welcomed fast delivery of projects, and offered the Dakar port development contract as an example. "We launched an international tender, a French company said it would build the port by 2020. Dubai said it would start in 2008 and finish in 2012," he said. Wade, who is hosting an Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit in Dakar next year and has launched an ambitious public works programme to showcase it, said he believed in a broad array of relations for his country. "I am playing a very open game," he told his audien
