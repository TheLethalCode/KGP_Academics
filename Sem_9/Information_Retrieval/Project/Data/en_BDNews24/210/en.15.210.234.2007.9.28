 LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African Allan Donald has turned down an offer to be England's full-time bowling coach, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Friday. The 40-year-old told the Board he did not want to accept the job for family reasons. Donald was employed initially on a five-week contract in May and stayed on to coach the England side during the Twenty20 World Cup tournament, which ended earlier this week. "After 11 years on the road I feel the commitment I would have to make to touring would be too great," he told the ECB. David Collier, ECB chief executive, said in a statement that the board fully understood the reasons for his decision. Donald, one of the finest fast bowlers in the world during a distinguished 10-year international career, was credited with the improved bowling performance of England's test attack over the past year
