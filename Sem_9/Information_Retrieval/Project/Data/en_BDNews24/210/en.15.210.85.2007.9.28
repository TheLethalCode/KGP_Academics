<TITLE> Kenya's Kibaki falls behind opposition: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga moved ahead of incumbent Mwai Kibaki for the first time in an opinion poll released on Friday, after weeks of media coverage for his Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). "You will find these results dramatic. The president now trails the leading opposition candidate, with 38 percent for Kibaki and 47 percent for Raila," a spokesman for The Steadman Group, which released the figures, said. However, the group also issued a disclaimer warning the number of undecided voters made up a significant percentage and made the election, widely expected in December, hard to call. In March this year, Kibaki was on 51 percent to Odinga's 17. It is only the second time the president has not been leading in opinion polls. In 2005 after he lost a constitutional referendum he came behind opposition candidate Kalonzo Musyoka. The Steadman Group, which took the unusual step of issuing a disclaimer which it said should be published alongside the poll, said the number of undecided voters sampled this time were fewer than in the past but still "constitute a significant percentage, especially in a close election." The election has dominated local media coverage for months. But in recent weeks Odinga's ODM has accounted for nearly two-thirds of media coverage for key parties, compared to its nearest rival, Kibaki's election vehicle, the Party of National Unity, with 26 percent, the figures said. Support for Odinga has grown despite the split in his party, when Musyoka broke off to form ODM-K. "Belief that to beat an incumbent in Africa you need all opposition parties to unite behind a single candidate, well, the story of ODM and ODM-K suggests this is not the case," Steadman analyst Tom Wolf said. Once the leading opposition candidate, Musyoka now holds 8 percent support, the poll said. Friday's results followed the official announcement of candidates by all three major parties. "Once the opposition became a clearly identifiable alternative, all those voters who were dissatisfied with the government for one reason or another had somewhere to put their opposition," Wolf said. Broken down by religious affiliation, Odinga led among all groupings, with Muslims giving him strongest backing at 60 percent. Some Muslim leaders accuse the government of targeting Muslims under the guise of counter-terrorism. Elections in east Africa's biggest economy have never passed without bloodshed. An ambush on a political rally by men armed with bows and arrows this month has raised fears that this time will be no differe
