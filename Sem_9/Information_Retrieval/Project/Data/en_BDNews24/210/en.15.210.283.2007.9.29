 MUMBAI, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former India all-rounder Ravi Shastri has accepted the post of chairman of the country's national cricket academy, the Indian board said on Saturday. The 45-year-old, who is a commentator with a leading sports broadcaster, was offered the position on Friday and wanted some time to decide.
