 MOSCOW, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday sanctions against Myanmar were premature but said he was sorry about civilian deaths in a crackdown on anti-government protesters in Yangon, local media reported. "We regret the deaths and assume that violence will stop," it quoted Putin as saying in his Black Sea residence of Bocharov Ruchei after talks with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. "As far as sanctions are concerned, this is a topic to be especially considered in the United Nations," Putin added. "It is premature to speak about this now." Western nations have urged sanctions against Myanmar after at least nine people were killed earlier this week in a crackdown on the country's largest protests in 20 years. China, the main backer of Myanmar's military government and a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, has flatly ruled out backing any sanctions. Russia's initial reaction to the crackdown was similar to the Chinese, but Putin's remarks allowed more flexibility. According to RIA-Novosti news agency the Russian leader said experts had to work out first whether the events in Myanmar carried any threat to neighbours. "At first experts should make their conclusions," he said, adding the foreign ministry should use these conclusions to decide on sanctions. In the past few years, Russia, like China a veto-wielding U.S. Security Council member, has shown growing interest in energy cooperation with Myanmar. In May, it signed a deal to build a nuclear research centre for Myanmar, which will include a 10 megawatt nuclear reactor with low enriched uranium.
