 WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it was "very troubled" by the harsh crackdown against protesters in Myanmar and pressed China to use its influence to get the military junta to change its repressive policies. The Bush administration was responding to word from hospital and monastery sources that two monks and a civilian had been killed, as Myanmar security forces tried to quell the biggest protests in 20 years. "If these stories are accurate, the US is very troubled that the regime would treat the Burmese people this way," White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said as President George W Bush pressed his foreign policy agenda in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. "We call on the junta to proceed in a peaceful transition to democracy," Johndroe added. Myanmar was formerly known as Burma.

The United States has been pushing for years for Myanmar to free Nobel laureate and pro-democracy politician Aung San Suu Kyi and has led a campaign of isolation until the junta allows political reform, including her release. Bush used his annual General Assembly speech on Tuesday to announce new US sanctions against the Myanmar government and urged the United Nations and other countries to keep up pressure on the country's military rulers. Seething crowds of Buddhist monks and civilians filled the streets of Myanmar's main city on Wednesday, defying warning shots, tear gas and baton charges, In Washington, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said reports indicated the government of Myanmar had reacted with "typical brutality." "As I have said before to the regime in Burma, we are watching you. To the people of Burma, we stand with you," McConnell said on the Senate floor. Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential candidate, said Bush's new sanctions were "a step in the right direction, but it will not solve the problem, and it is not enoug
