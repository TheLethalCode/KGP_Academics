<TITLE> Corrupt businessmen will be fined: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday said businessmen found guilty of corruption would be fined but they could do business without any fear of arrest or harassment. Mainul said none on the new latest list of 80 corruption suspects to be officially released would be arrested now. Measures would be taken after proper investigation into the charges against the suspects, he added. "As far as I know, the Anticorruption Corruption will not publish any more lists of graft suspects. This is their latest roll of 80, which they are yet to release officially," the adviser said. Pressed to comment on army chief General Moeen U Ahmed's statement that the army will go back to the barracks whenever the government would want it to, he said, "Well, that's what our constitution also says. "When we'll be able to hand over responsibilities to an elected government, the army will have none of the things to attend to they have to mind now. They'll surely go back to their barracks then." bdne
