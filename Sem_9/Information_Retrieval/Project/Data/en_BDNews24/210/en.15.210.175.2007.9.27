 NEW DELHI, Thu Sep 27, (bbdnews24.com/Reuters) - India called for political reform in Myanmar on Wednesday following Western appeals for it to try to persuade its neighbour's ruling generals to talk to their opponents staging huge street protests. Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee's call for reform was the first high level comment by India -- seen as having significant influence because of its close ties with Myanmar -- since the latest protests erupted in the isolated state.

India shares a 1,645-km border on its east with Myanmar and relations between the neighbours go back centuries to the time Buddhism was born in the subcontinent and spread across the region. Although New Delhi initially supported Nobel laureate Aung Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, it changed its strategy in the early 1990s to court the military regime in what is seen as an effort to counter rival China. It has invested in developing ports, building roads and railways and is also competing with Beijing for Myanmar's oil and gas reserves. The two countries have also exchanged several high-level visits in recent yea
