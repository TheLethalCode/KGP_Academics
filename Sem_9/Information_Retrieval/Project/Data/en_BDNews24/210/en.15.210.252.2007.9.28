 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  The United States will accept applications for the 2009 Diversity Visa Lottery from Oct 3 to Dec 2, 2007, the US embassy in Dhaka said in a statement Thursday. Applicants may access the electronic DV entry form at www.dvlottery.state.gov during the registration period. "Paper entries will not be accepted. Applicants are strongly encouraged not to wait until the last week of the registration period to enter," the statement said. Heavy demand may result in website delays and no entries will be accepted after noon EST on December 2, 2007, it said. The American Centre will organise an informational programme on DV at the Public Library auditorium at 10:30am Saturday. The programme is designed to provide potential applicants with information on how to avoid "dishonest agents and brokers" while applying for DV to the US.
