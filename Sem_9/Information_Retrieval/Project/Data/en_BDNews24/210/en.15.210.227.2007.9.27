<TITLE> Selection committee not to interfere with Nayeemuddin's work: BFF acting secretary </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu said the newly formed selection committee would not interfere with the functioning of the coach. "To help the coach, the selection committee was formed. Selectors will give their observations to the coach, who will take the decision about the squad," Malu said when asked why the committee was formed if the coach takes the decision. It is so far the first in world's football to form a selection committee, though it is not unfamiliar in the cricket world. In the world football, the coach is considered a key person to pick up the team members. The BFF, however, did not make the job descriptions of the selection committee, which is comprised of five members -- BFF acting secretary, former footballers Jahirul Islam, Basir Ahmed, BFF COO Col (retd) Obaidullah and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) training director Faruqul Islam. The BFF had earlier formed a national team management committee, headed by Kazi Salahuddin, which only selected the team manager and team leader and provided support to the booters at the camp offering necessary essential things, but the committee was dissolved following the resignation of its chairman, who said the BFF president interfered with their work. The five-member selection committee had a meeting with Nayeemuddin Thursday at the BFF House and assured the coach of not interfering with his work. "They told me that I would be able to work freely," said Nayeemuddin emerging from the meeting. After undergoing a 20-day physical training on the sandy beach in Cox's Bazar, the national footballers leave here for BKSP on Friday to prepare for World Cup pre-qualifier against Tajikistan on October 8. Besides, the booters are gearing up for Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar in November and SAFF Championship in December in Sri Lanka and Maldives.
