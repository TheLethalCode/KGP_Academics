 YANGON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's generals appeared to have cut public Internet access on Friday to prevent more videos, photographs and information about their crackdown on the biggest protests against military rule in nearly 20 years getting out. Internet cafes were closed and the help desk at the main Internet service provider did not answer its telephones to explain why there was no access. Citizen reporters have been at the forefront in informing the world of the protests against 45 years of military rule and declining living standards in the former Burma. They have even used the social networking site Facebook or hidden news in e-greetings cards and networks of reporters for dissident news organisations have used the Internet to get stories and pictures out.
