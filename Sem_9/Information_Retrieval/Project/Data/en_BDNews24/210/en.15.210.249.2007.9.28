 KARACHI, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria hopes to carry his English county form for Essex into next week's series against South Africa and reach a career milestone of 200 test wickets. Kaneria, who has taken 198 wickets in 46 tests for his country, told Reuters that the home series with South Africa would also help him stake a claim for a permanent spot in the one-day team. The 26-year-old took 109 wickets for Essex in all competitions and has been offered a full contract for 2008. The first match of a two-test series begins in Karachi on Monday. "I learned a lot bowling for Essex, particularly in the one-day competitions," said Kaneria, who has taken 15 wickets in 18 one-day matches. "I can do the same for my country and I am a better bowler now. My ambition remains to translate my test success into one-dayers." Kaneria was picked for Pakistan's World Cup squad but dropped for the Twenty20 World Cup by the national selectors
