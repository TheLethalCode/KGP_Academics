<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)  The 14-party alliance led by the Awami League will take a pragmatic approach to reform issues in any talks with the Election Commission, senior leaders said Saturday. Several Awami League leaders sat with the Workers' Party leaders led by Rashed Khan Menon at acting AL president Zillur Rahman's home in Gulshan. "The 14-party has a uniform plan for reforms. Demand for the reforms is not the demand of the party alone. It reflects people's broader expectations." "We want that the show of election financing must be stopped," Menon said. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed, who attended the meeting, said the AL did not take any decision on whether to join dialogue with the Election Commission. But the Awami League allies decided to join the EC talks." bdn
