 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign films, music and software are being pirated in Bangladesh at unprecedented levels which has drawn fire from both the World Trade Organisation and the United States Government. The United States Trade Representative recently included Bangladesh in its 'Watch List' for 2007 for what it terms intellectual property rights violations. The WTO echoed the concerns in its Trade Policy Review last year. However, despite the warning bells, domestic regulators and monitoring bodies have been slow to respond to the threat. The US report singled out Bangladeshi optical disc plants for their involvement in foreign music and movie piracy. They asked the government to address the issue immediately. There are currently five optical disc plants operating in Bangladesh with one other that has recently gone out of business, according to industry sources. The US 'Watch List' or Special 301 Report for 2007 claims some of these plants are owned by Pakistani nationals who relocated their businesses to Bangladesh following a government crackdown over last two years in their home country. "All of these plants are involved in large-scale piracy operations, and at least four of the six are engaged in production of pirate international music, software, and US movies," said the report. These plants are relatively efficient, with one plant capable of producing 40-50 thousand discs a day in all formats. Industry insiders say these pirated products are largely aimed at the domestic market although some end up in India and Europe. The report added: "Relatively small shipments of 900 to 1,000 discs are apparently being smuggled out of the country via parcel shipments using the main post office in Dhaka." It added, however, that the industry has few details regarding the content and exact quantities of pirate exports. According to industry experts, up to 85 percent of domestically produced music, films and software are pirated with virtually 100 percent of foreign productions illegally copied. The US report estimates that that there are as many as 60 recordable CD (CD-R) duplicating factories operating in Bangladesh. "They range from sophisticated European standalone duplicators to PC workstation duplicators," said the report. The report also estimates that Bangladesh imports approximately one million blank CD-Rs from China and Taiwan per month. The price of a blank CD-R is $0.10. The report added that there is some illegal importation of optical discs, possibly from Malaysia. Sayful Islam, project coordinator of World Com Ltd, an optical disc plant, told bdnews24.com that he estimated around 40 lakh blank CDs are imported in the country every month. In February 2006 domestic record industry representatives met officials from the National Board of Revenue, the Commissioner of Customs as well as customs officials at Zia International Airport and from the US. "The members of customs at the meeting indicated limitations in the detection process of pirated products and shortage of equipment to detect pirated products," the report said. The WTO's trade policy review last year said: "With respect to optical disc plants and piracy, the government indicated that it took note of the concerns expressed in the report regarding optical disc manufacture in Bangladesh and would place the matter under investigation." bd
