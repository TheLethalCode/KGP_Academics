 LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The United States said it was deeply troubled by reports monks had been shot dead in a crackdown on Myanmar democracy protests and Britain warned military rulers the age of impunity was over. The UN Security Council called emergency consultations on Myanmar after a day in which crowds of Buddhist monks and civilians defied warning shots, teargas and baton charges meant to quell Yangon's biggest anti-junta protests in 20 years. Russia, which has a veto on the Security Council, appeared however to take a different approach to Western powers, saying it viewed developments as Myanmar's internal affair.

Singapore also urged restraint.

"We call upon all parties to avoid provocative actions and to work towards reconciliation and a peaceful resolution of the situation," Singapore's Foreign Ministry said. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said he would ask the European Union to hold an urgent meeting on Myanmar to seek ways to "halt the violence" as the junta cracks down on protests against decades of military rule.
