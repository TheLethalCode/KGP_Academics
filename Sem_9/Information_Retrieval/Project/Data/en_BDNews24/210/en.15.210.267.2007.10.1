 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday halted the proceedings of three graft cases against former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman, former law minister Moudud Ahmed and former communications minister barrister Nazmul Huda and his wife. The court simultaneously asked the Anticorruption Commission to explain within six weeks why the three graft cases will not be cancelled. A two-member HC bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury handed down the ruling. The same judges Sunday awarded bail to Khaleda Zia, detained in jail since Sept 3 in the GATCO scam case. The court had also halted the proceedings of the case under emergency powers rules. On Sept 26, ACC deputy director Jahurul Huda filed a case with Kafrul Police Station against Tarique, his wife and mother-in-law on charges of concealing information on assets valued at Tk 4.23 crore and acquiring illegal assets worth Tk 4.82 crore. A writ petition was filed challenging the legality of the case on the grounds that in response to the ACC notice served on May 29 Tarique submitted his wealth statement on June 10 through jail authorities. Based on the wealth statement submitted by Tarique, the case has been filed illegally because according to the constitution, no citizen can be compelled to testify against himself, their counsel barrister Rafique-Ul Haque said during hearing. He further argued that the case did not have any legal standing as it had been based on information supplied by the accused. The joint forces arrested Tarique on March 7. Moudud case ACC deputy assistant director M Shariful Haque Siddiqui filed a graft case against Moudud with Gulshan Police Station on Sept 16, charging him with concealing wealth information about his illegally acquired property worth Tk 4 crore. On Sept 23, the government included the case for trial under the emergency powers rules. Moudud was arrested by the joint forces on April 12 at his home. Huda case ACC assistant director Talebur Rahman filed a case against Nazmul Huda and his wife Sigma Huda with Dhanmandi Police Station on July 11. Huda was detained on February 5 and Sigma in July. Three separate writ petitions were filed challenging the legality of the three cases on Sept 27. bdnewsd24.c
