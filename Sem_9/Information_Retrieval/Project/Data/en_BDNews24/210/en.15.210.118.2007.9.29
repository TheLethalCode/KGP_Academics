 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) plans to hold 2nd B. League on January 15 next year. "We had a meeting with club representatives, who told us that they would be ready to take part in the second edition of professional football league on any date and in any situation ," said Abdur Rahim, chairman of professional football league after a meeting at the BFF House Saturday. Rahim said they plan to hold the second professional football league on January 15 next, just five and a half months later after completion of the first-ever professional football league on August 1. Rahim, also a BFF vice president, said that they had sought suggestions from the clubs so that the league committee could properly implement its rules and regulations, which were hardly carried out in the last edition. Except the representatives from Khulna Abahani and Chittagong Abahani, remaining nine clubs' representatives were present in the meeting and laid down some preconditions before holding the second edition league. Mustaqur Rahman, additional secretary of Mohammedan Sporting Club and coordinator of the professional football clubs, said that they had some bitter experiences they gained in the last professional football league and sought cooperation from the committee to solve the problems. He said they asked the BFF to hold a preparatory tournament and senior division football league before starting the B. League so that the professional clubs could take proper preparation and inject new blood from the senior division football league. The demand also included finding out a sponsor for the B. League so that the clubs got financial support to form their squads. Mustaq also said they wanted to see each club following the players' monthly salaries that would lessen the clubs' pressure in making all payments at a time. The BFF highups gave assurance to the clubs that they are near having a good sponsor for the B. League and also sought the cooperation from the clubs.
