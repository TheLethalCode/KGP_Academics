 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Here are key findings on climate change from a February 2 report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which groups 2,500 researchers from more than 130 nations. EVIDENCE OF HUMAN CAUSES "Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (human) greenhouse gas concentrations," it says. The IPCC says "very likely" means at least a 90-percent probability. "The level of confidence that humans are causing global warming has increased a lot," report author Peter Stott said. TEMPERATURE INCREASES It is very likely that extremes such as heat waves and heavy rains will become more frequent. "For the first time we have a best estimate of what we can achieve if we keep emissions levels lower," said report chair Susan Solomon. The report does not include possible warming from methane, a potent greenhouse gas, escaping from melting permafrost. Warming is expected to be greatest over land and at high northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. SEA LEVEL RISES The report cites six models with core projections of sea level rises ranging from 7.2 to 23.6 inches this century. That is a narrower and lower band than the 3.5 to 34.6 inch gain forecast in 2001. If the Greenland ice sheet melts proportionally to the temperature increases, then sea levels would rise by up to 31.6 inches this century. Some models show an ice-free Arctic in summer by 2100, meaning that sea ice floating in the water disappears, but not ice resting on Greenland. If the Greenland ice sheet melted completely, that would lead to a 23.1-foot (7-metre) sea level increase. CHANGING OCEAN CURRENTS The report predicts a gradual slowdown this century in ocean currents such as the one that carries warm water to northwest Europe. "It's very unlikely there will be an abrupt breakdown in ocean currents in the 21st century," said Jurgen Willebrand, the report's author with special expertise in ocean effects. HURRICANES The report says it is "more likely than not" that a trend of increasing intense tropical cyclones and hurricanes has a human cause. It predicts such tropical cyclones will become more intense in the future. "There may not be an increase in number, there may be a redistribution to more intense events -- which is what has been observed in the Atlantic since 1970," Stott said.
