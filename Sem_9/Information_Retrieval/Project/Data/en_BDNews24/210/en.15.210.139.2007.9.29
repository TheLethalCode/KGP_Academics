 NEW DELHI, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A trekking team of four Russians and four Indians has been stuck in a high mountainous area in north India for the past 24 hours due to heavy snowfall, a top district official said on Saturday. Four porters are also with the team which was attempting to trek through the Gangotri glacier to the Hindu pilgrimage town of Badrinath in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. "It's a very risky trek. We have been trying to rescue them but the situation is grim. They don't even have rations," Meenakshi Sundaram, the top administrator of Uttarkashi district from where the trek began, told Reuters by telephone. He said Indian Air Force helicopters have not been able to fly due to the heavy snowfall but a rescue team was able to spot the trekkers. He said the area where the trekkers are trapped is at an altitude of 18,000-21,000 feet (5,486-6,401 metres). "The Russians have a satellite phone through which we have been able to establish contact. A rescue team is expected to return in the evening when we will get more information," he added. Uttarakhand is a popular hill state visited by many domestic and foreign trekkers each year.
