 CANBERRA, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters opposed to the military junta in Myanmar clashed with police in Australia on Friday when they tried to charge the Myanmar embassy in the capital, Canberra. About 100 protesters chanting slogans in support of democracy burned flags and staged a sit-down protest on the street outside the embassy after they were forced back by riot police with batons and dogs. "Free Burma. Pray for Burma," the group shouted. "These monks are armed with nothing but the Buddha's word of love and peacefulness." Some demonstrators were detained by police, who also removed an axe from the area. Police later said the weapon had not been confiscated, but taken away for safety. Police moved on the protesters, who were backed by several lawmakers, after they attempted to deliver petitions in support Myanmar's monks to the heavily-fenced embassy, where more police waited inside. "They kill our people, so we cannot stay at home," protest organiser Soe Lwin told authorities. Carrying red flags and banners of Myanmar's pro-democracy heroine Aung San Suu Kyi, the protesters moved on to the Chinese Embassy to call for more action from Beijing on reining-in the violent crackdown ordered by Myanmar's military rulers.
