 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  Development experts Thursday asked the government to go for immediate import to offset a 10 lakh tons rice shortfall after the recent flooding damaged some one million acres of cropland. "The people had already been suffering from price hikes when the flooding happened," said Dr KM Nabiul Islam, senior research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). "The food market must be kept stable by importing [grains] under public-private arrangements and cross-border trading," Nabiul told a roundtable discussion on flood loss management at the BIDS office in Dhaka. Agriculture adviser CS Karim also spoke at the discussion titled, "Flood Loss Management: Mitigation and Adaptation Policy". The BIDS orgainsed it to mark its golden jubilee. Participants suggested improving community involvement in flood management projects and having a more efficient flood forecasting and warning system. They called for more understandable flood warning messages, rather than the academic language that currently prevails. The meeting also called for increased regional cooperation in exchanging scientific data to ease the impact of flooding. The roundtable stressed better preparation rather than prevention, which they said simply pushed the floodwaters from one area to another. The BIDS programme follows a flood season that has seen many communities displaced and resulted in the deaths of over 1000 people in Bangladesh. Referring to a BIDS estimate, Nabiul said: "The damage to rice crops indicates that there might be a shortfall of 8-10 lakh tons against the production target." "Government food stocks were about 7 lakh tons but ongoing relief operations and OMS could reduce that to 5 lakh tons." "We should not ignore losses of food grains as there is a global shortfall. Crop losses were lower in the July-August flood," said Nabiul. "The most serious issue is that the second round of flooding damaged the replanted Aman crop. This cannot be recovered, even if farmers try to replant again." "Prior to the Boro harvest, which is the biggest crop, adequate amounts of food grain should be imported to keep the market stable." Agriculture adviser CS Karim stressed advance forecasting to minimise agricultural losses and said his ministry was now delivering fertilisers to dealers around the country. "We are distributing fertiliser at two times the dealers' requirement," said Karim. bdne
