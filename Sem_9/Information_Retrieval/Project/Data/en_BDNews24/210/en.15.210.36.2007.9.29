 WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration is concerned that UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari was moved quickly from Yangon to Myanmar's remote capital on Saturday, and urged the country's rulers to allow him access to everyone with whom he wishes to meet. "We have concerns that Mr. Gambari was swiftly moved from Rangoon to the new capital in the interior, far from population centers and the people of Burma," White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in a statement. "We urge the junta to allow him access to all those he wishes to meet with, including religious leaders as well as Aung San Suu Kyi," he said. Suu Kyi, the former Burma's opposition leader, has been detained for nearly 12 of the last 18 years. Gambari flew into Myanmar on Saturday carrying worldwide hopes he can persuade its ruling generals to use negotiations instead of guns to end mass protests against 45 years of military rule. Gambari arrived in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, and was flown directly to the generals' new capital, Naypyidaw, 240 miles (386 km) to the north.
