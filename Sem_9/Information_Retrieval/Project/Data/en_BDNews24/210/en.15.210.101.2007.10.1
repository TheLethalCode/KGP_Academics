<TEXT>
 Tangail, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday said the state of emergency should remain in force through to general elections for a sound law and order for fair voting. "The law and order must be kept normal for the next parliament election to be free and fair. And to keep it normal it is necessary to continue with the state of emergency," Huda said. He made the remarks at a meeting on the voter list and national ID cards project at Tangail Shilpakala Academy auditorium. He singled out a flawed voter list as the main problem in the forestalled Jan 22 elections. "Political parties built a movement against it and 30 people were killed. We want to hold the election with a correct voter list. We want to break free from the culture of vandalism and arson." On the participation of the army in preparing the voter list, Huda said: "When someone mentions the army, it is as if they're talking about the Pakistan army." "In an independent Bangladesh, the army is working with the administration and with people to make the voter list. I see no problem in it. Whatever the politicians are saying, the people are attaching importance to the voter list." The CEC said work on the list was progressing faster than expected with 10 percent of the work already completed by September. "This time the voters on the list will number seven or eight crore. Eighteen months are not too long for the job. If the list had been made in five or six months it would have been controversial," he said. "If we can complete the work of voter listing by the deadline it will be a milestone in the history of Bangladesh." The work of making the voter list with photographs will start in Tangail Municipality and Sadar upazila simultaneously, officials said. Some 30 assistant registration officers, 234 supervisors, 1,149 data collectors, 384 data entry operators and 20 proof readers have been appointed for the task at 124 registration centres in the district. bdnews24.c
