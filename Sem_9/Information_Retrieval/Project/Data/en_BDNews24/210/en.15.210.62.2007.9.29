 DAMASCUS, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria said on Saturday Israel wanted to create excuses for war by spreading false reports that an Israeli air raid targeted a site linked to weapons of mass destruction. Syrian Deputy President Farouq al-Shara said his country did not want war "in the distant or near future". "They (Israel) are making up things to justify an aggression in the future. They are playing on public opinion to mislead it," he said, describing the reports as fabrications. Damascus says Israel launched the air raid on Sept. 6, bombing an empty area after air defence systems confronted the aircraft. Some U.S. officials have linked the raid to apparent Israeli suspicions of secret nuclear cooperation between Damascus and North Korea. Israel has said nothing about the reported air raid, which Shara said caused no casualties. Damascus and North Korea have denied any nuclear cooperation.
