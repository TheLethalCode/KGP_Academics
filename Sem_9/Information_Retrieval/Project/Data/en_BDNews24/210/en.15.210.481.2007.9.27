 LONDON, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian John Allwood smashed 40 watermelons with his head in just one minute. Using only one hand, Germany's Thomas Vogel unfastened 56 bras in 60 seconds. When it comes to the world's weirdest achievers, nothing beats the ultimate accolade -- a place in Guinness World Records for demonstrating bizarre skills. Nothing is too wacky.

The top prize for survival has to go to American park ranger Roy C Sullivan -- he was struck by lightning seven times. Each strike took its toll -- he lost eyebrows and a toe nail as well as suffering singed hair and chest burns.
