 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  A lawyer for Khaleda Zia Thursday filed a writ appeal with the High Court challenging the legality of the GATCO graft case that was brought under the emergency powers rules to scuttle bail to the detained former prime minister. An HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman had earlier given permission for the appeal following a petition by Khaleda's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Haque. As Khaleda is in jail, advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas filed the writ petition through power of attorney. In the same case, another writ appeal was filed with the HC on behalf of Khaleda's son Arafat Rahman Coco. Both Khaleda and her son were arrested on Sept 3. In a graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission, a separate writ appeal was filed with the same court on behalf of Tarique Rahman, elder of Khaleda's two sons. Twin writ petitions were lodged with the High Court challenging the cases against former minister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda. Former law minister Moudud Ahmed filed a separate writ appeal with the same court. bdnew
