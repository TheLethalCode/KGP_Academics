 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  A lawyer for Khaleda Zia Thursday filed a writ appeal with the High Court challenging the legality of the GATCO graft case that was brought under the emergency powers rules to scuttle bail to the detained former prime minister. An HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman had earlier given permission for the appeal following a petition by Khaleda's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq. As Khaleda is in jail, advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas filed the writ petition through power of attorney. In the same case, another writ appeal was filed with the HC on behalf of Khaleda's son Arafat Rahman Coco. Both Khaleda and her son were arrested on Sept 3. In a graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission, a separate writ appeal was filed with the same court on behalf of Tarique Rahman, elder of Khaleda's two sons. Twin writ petitions were lodged with the High Court challenging the cases against former minister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda. Former law minister Moudud Ahmed filed a separate writ appeal with the same court. The HC would hear the five writ petitions Sunday. The petitions appealed for a freeze on the proceedings of corruption cases. They appealed to the court to issue a rule on the government to explain why the proceedings of the cases and their approval under the emergency powers rules were not unlawful. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq took permission for filing the writ petition for Khaleda and barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan for filing a petition for Coco with the power of attorney of his lawyer advocate Ahmed Azam Khan. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed a corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 against 13 including Khaleda and Coco. The case alleged that the government counted Tk 10,000 crore in losses after the former prime minister intervened to award "inefficient and inexperienced" business firm GATCO a contract to handle containers at Kamalapur Inland Container Depot and Chittagong port. The case was taken under the cover of the emergency powers rules on Sept 18. Khaleda and Coco filed separate writ petitions in the High Court challenging its legality. "I have got permission to file writ petitions for Khaleda Zia, Moudud Ahmed, Nazmul Huda and Sigma Huda. I have sought rule, suspension of cases and bails in these writ petitions. The hearings on the writ petitions will be held Sunday," barrister Huq said to reporters. He said the emergency powers rules were applicable to incidents having taken place after January 11, but the GATCO case had taken place before the emergency rules were in force. Which means the emergency powers rules would not be applicable in the case. Barrister Huq also said the ACC secretary did not have the power to approve the case under emergency powers rules. Besides, the ACC rules were not followed and no investigation was carried out in filing the case. With the same High Court bench, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan field a writ petition challenging the legality of a corruption case filed by the ACC against Coco. On Sept 26, ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda filed a corruption case with Kafrul Police Station against Tarique Rahman, his wife Zubaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu, charging them with earning wealth worth Tk 4.81 crore beyond known income and giving false information. Tarique in his writ petition said the ACC in a May 29 notice asked him to give a statement of his wealth, which he submitted. The case had been based on the statement which Tarique said he had given in response to the notice. He pointed out that according to the constitution nobody could be compelled to testify against himself. The case was illegal as it had been filed on the information provided by Tarique. The joint forces arrested Tarique on March 7. ACC deputy assistant director Md Shariful Haque Siddiqui filed a corruption case with Gulshan Police Station on Sept 16 against former law minister Moudud Ahmed. The case alleged that Moudud had concealed information about Tk 4.40 crore assets he had beyond his declared income. The government brought the case under emergency powers rules on Sept 23, prompting Moudud to file a writ petition challenging its legality with the same bench through his lawyer Amir Hossain. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq will present his case during hearing on the petition. Joint forces arrested Moudud on April 12. Besides former communications minister Nazmul Huda and his wife advocate Sigma Huda also filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the ACC cases against them. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq will move the case. ACC assistant director Talebur Rahman field a corruption case with Dhanmondi Police Station on July 11 against the Huda couple. The case alleged that the wealth statement they had given to the ACC was not correct. The description of the source of their wealth was also not satisfactory. Nazmul Huda was arrested in February and Sigma in July. A special court on August 27 in the Khoborer Antorale corruption case sentenced Nazmul Huda to seven years in jail and Sigma to three years. Their lawyer Ashanur Rahman told bdnews24.com that they filed an appeal in the High Court against the verdict Thursday. bdnew
