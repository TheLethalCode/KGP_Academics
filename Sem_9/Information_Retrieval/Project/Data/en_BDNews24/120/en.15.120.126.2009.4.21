 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Mike Kelleher has an unenviable job. As the director of the White House Office of Correspondence he faces a daunting task every day of sifting through tens of thousands of letters, emails and faxes that are addressed to the president from his citizens. Obviously, President Obamaor for that matter any of his predecessorshave or had the time and energy to go through all these letters and messages. So how does a person get to decide what the president should read and how the letters are selected? The New York Times on Monday provided some tantalizing details about the process involving this arduous task. Of the tens of thousands of letters and messages that arrive at the White House every day, a few hundred are culled and end up each weekday afternoon on a round wooden table in the office of Kelleher. He chooses 10 letters, which are slipped into a purple folder and put in the daily briefing book that is delivered to the president's White House residence. Designed to offer a sampling of what Americans are thinking, the letters are read by the president, and he sometimes answers them by hand, in black ink on azure paper. "We pick messages that are compelling, things people say that, when you read it, you get a chill," Kelleher, 47, told The Times. "I send him letters that are uncomfortable messages." The ritual offers Obama a way to move beyond the White House bubble, and occasionally leads to moments when his composure cracks, advisers said. "I remember once he was particularly quiet," said David Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, "and I asked him what he was thinking about, and he said, 'These letters just tear you up.' It was after getting a poignant letter from a struggling family." Some letters begin "I didn't vote for you"; others end "May God bless." One missive came in the form of baseboard molding, covered with $2.70 in stamps and a scrawl urging the president to "Fix housing 1st!" Kelleher said the president had used the letters to ask policy questions of government agencies, and Axelrod recalled a letter circulated among staff members from a woman in Arizona, who was in danger of losing her home because her husband had lost his job. The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said his boss "believes it's easy in Washington to forget there are real people with real challenges being affected by the debate." Emanuel added that he had seen the president turn to policy advisers in meetings and say, "No, no, no. I want to read you a letter that I got. I want you to understand." Cynthia Arnold of Pennsylvania wrote the president to tell him what had happened as she started watching his inauguration on television. Her son, Matthew Arnold, 23, an army sergeant whose unit might be deployed to the Middle East, called her from Texas, to ask for her help filling out paperwork. "He was calling to ask me who should make his funeral arrangements in the event of his death, his father or me," Mrs. Arnold wrote. Using enlarged type to make sure the president would "be able to read it," she urged him to "please make our troops one of your priorities." A few weeks after she mailed the letter, Mrs. Arnold received a handwritten note from the president. "I will do everything in my power to make troops like Matthew my priority," Obama wrote. "Please tell him 'thank you for your service' from his commander in chief!" Mrs. Arnold said she was so overwhelmed that the president had called her son by his first name that she "just burst into tears." She is storing the letter in a safe deposit box until she can have it framed. Kelleher, who has three daughters, later told Mrs. Arnold that the letter had caught his attention because he is a parent. A graduate of Illinois State University, Kelleher served in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone in the mid-1980s. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Illinois in 2000, which was when he first crossed paths with Obama, who also was running for Congress. In 2006, Kelleher became the director of outreach in Obama's Senate office in Chicago. Kelleher's office has a red box for what he calls "life-and-death constituent case work." "So someone says, 'I'm despondent and I want to commit suicide,' or 'I have a life-threatening illness and I need help here,' " Kelleher said. "We immediately respond to those." Threats are reported to the Secret Service. On Inauguration Day, Michael Powers of Tennessee, wrote to Obama, telling him he had lost his father, a three-pack-a-day smoker, to lung cancer in 1979. "Enclosed is a picture of my father, and I have carried it for almost 30 years now," wrote Powers, 54. Seeing images of Obama with his daughters had made him miss his father "more than I think I ever have." "If you always want to be there for your girls," Powers urged, "then stop smoking NOW!" About a month later, Powers received a reply. After thanking him for "the wonderful letter, and the good advice," the president wrote, "I am returning the picture, since it must be important to you, but I will remember your dad's memo
