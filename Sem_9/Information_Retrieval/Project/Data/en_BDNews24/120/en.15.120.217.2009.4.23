<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka residents are reeling under power outages, which they say has reached "one hour on, one hour off" proportions, while weathermen predicted Wednesday that the searing heat wave sweeping the nation would not let up for another day or two. With rise in temperatures, outages become even more frequent as higher use of electric fans, air conditioners and water pumps in the overpopulated capital puts a greater load on the national grid. Residents in many areas of the city are saying an hour of power is now followed by an hour of 'load shedding' throughout the day. In some places, power is being out for 15 to 16 hours a day, they say. Syeda Mahbuba, who lives in Uttara, said she and her neighbours are experiencing around 12 hours of outages a day. "One hour on and one hour off", is how she described it. Shahabuddin Ahmed, of Tajmahal Road in Muhammadpur, said: "Load shedding continues late into the night." Countrywide, demand is outstripping supply by about 1000MW a day. The Power Development Board control room said maximum power generation was determined to be around 3690MW on Wednesday, falling 1194MW short of demand. A 1215MW shortage was recorded on Tuesday across the country, with maximum output estimated at 3590MW. The PDB said a 597MW power unit has been out of order, while another 628MW of production shortfall was due to gas scarcity. Scorching months Meanwhile, the met office has said the soaring temperatures that have been sweeping the country since Saturday are likely to continue through Thursday and beyond. "April and May are usually the most scorching months in Bangladesh," said meteorologist Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma. The heat wave was still sweeping over parts of Khulna and Rajshahi divisions as well as the capital on Wednesday, though the mercury fell below 40 degrees Celsius, according to the weather office. The highest recorded temperature Wednesday was in Jessore at 38.6 degrees. The day before Jessore reached 41.4 degrees, which was also the season's highest. The met office recorded a maximum 36.7 degrees in Dhaka on Wednesday. "Temperatures will come down with rain," said Sharma. bdne
