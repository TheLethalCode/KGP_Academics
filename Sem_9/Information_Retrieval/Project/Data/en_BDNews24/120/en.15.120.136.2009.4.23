 GUWAHATI, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of millions of Indians from insurgency-hit states to the IT hub of Bangalore began voting on Thursday in the second round of a month-long election that could throw up a weak coalition amid an economic slump. Hundreds of thousands of police guarded some 200 million people eligible to vote after Maoist rebel violence marred the mostly peaceful first phase of polls last week, killing police and election officials. The ruling Congress party-led coalition appears to lead against an alliance headed by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, but both may need the support of a host of smaller regional parties to win office. Analysts say such a government is unlikely to be stable or be able to bridge a yawning fiscal deficit and push financial reforms, including slashing subsidies and privatisation at a time of a severe economic downturn. There are also investor worries over the rise of a group of smaller parties, known as the "Third Front", who are often seen as opportunist and an unknown quantity in government. Thursday's poll will see Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cast his vote in Guwahati, the principal city of the northeastern state of Assam which was hit by a string of bomb attacks by separatists in the run up to the election. Long queues of voters braved the rains in Guwahati to vote with many voters going straight to the polling stations from their morning walk. "I'm very happy because I voted for the first time. I feel privileged," said Sobha Mahanta, a 20-year-old college student trying to steady her umbrella in the rains. The second round of polling, the biggest of the five phases, also covers the IT centre of Bangalore and some states where Maoist rebels are strong. Maoists killed five election officials in a landmine blast in Chhattisgarh during the last round of voting. Eleven police were also killed across the central and eastern "red belt". The rebels blasted a railway station and chopped down trees to block roads in the eastern state of Jharkhand early on Thursday. They briefly seized a train on Wednesday in a show of strength before allowing the passengers to go unharmed. The outcome of the election will be known on May 16. India's elections are notoriously hard to predict and polls have been wrong in the past. Exit polls are banned for the election. An array of castes, religions and ethnicities add up to the 714 million people eligible to vote in the world's largest democratic exercise, where ancient ties still play a large role at the ballot box. There are no major national issues in this election, but the centre-left Congress party is wooing voters with populist measures such as food subsidies while the BJP accuses its main rival of poor governance and being weak on security
