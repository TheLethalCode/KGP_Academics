 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com) - Striker Jahid Hasan Emily and winger Jahid Hossain's hopes of returning for the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers have almost ended with both players still nursing injuries. "We are likely to miss the services of Emily and Jahid though both of them recovered from most of their injuries, but they are still unfit to play game and we have now to plan without them," said Bangladesh's Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido on Wednesday. Bangladesh have been drawn in Group A along with Cambodia, Myanmar and Macao. The qualifiers start on April 26. Emily sustained a hamstring injury before the start of the camp while Jahid received a heel pain during the training session at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Meanwhile, Emily, recovering from the muscle cramp, returned to practice, but again started to feel pain in his thigh on his first full training and he along with Jahid and striker Mohammad Robin missed the lone warm-up fixture against Nepal Police. However, there is a little hope with striker Robin, who has been recovering from his left-muscle injury. Midfielders Mamunul Islam and Arman Aziz, defenders Mohammad Sujan and Wali Faisal also got injured during the warm-up match, but all of them are now fit. Despite uncertainty over key players Emily and Jahid, Dido set his sights to finish top in the four-team meet. bdnews
