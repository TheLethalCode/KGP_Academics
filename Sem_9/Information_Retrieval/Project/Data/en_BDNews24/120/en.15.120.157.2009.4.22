<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com) A parliamentary watchdog has strongly recommended privatisation to breathe life back into Mongla port, one of only two sea ports in the country, located in southwest Bangladesh. "We have recommended drafting a port privatisation policy fto revive the economy of the whole Khulna region," chairman of the standing committee on the shipping ministry, Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. The committee at a meeting also asked the ministry to aim for unloading 40 percent of imported grain through the now virtually inoperative Mongla port, in line with a previous government directive. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin, also a member of the committee, was in agreement with the proposal for privatisation, said Chowdhury. The ministry, in line with the committee's recommendation, will task a joint secretary of shipping to draft the privatisation guidelines, he said. "Mongla port is now almost dead. Barely any ships come to port there," said the committee chairman. "Privatisation would certainly attract ships if certain conditions were met." Chowdhury said his committee members would visit the port soon. This parliamentary committee has recommended moves before now to revive Mongla port, which was historically dependent on export of jute and jute products. As Bangladesh's jute industry declined, the port beset with corruption and trade unionism also gradually lost business due to costly and lengthy unloading. The parliamentary standing committee of the last parliament made several recommendations to reactivate the port, but they were not implemented. Committee members Mohammad Shah Alam, Md Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, Begum Habibun Nahar, Shamsul Haq Chowdhury, Md Nazrul Islam, Golam Kibria Tipu and Mostofa Kamal Pasha attended Wednesday's meeting.
