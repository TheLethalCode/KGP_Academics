 Dhaka , Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)No foreign NGO will be allowed to operate in Bangladesh if future without first registering locally, said social welfare minister Enamul Haq Mostafa Shaheed on Wednesday. The minister also said the government was in a dilemma over the activities of "some Middle East-based NGOs" in Bangladesh, "Many of them were able to establish themselves here in the aftermath of Cyclone Sidr. The government doesn't want to aggravate them but is trying to bring them under proper regulation," he told reporters at the secretariat. "We will not allow any foreign-registered NGOs to operate in the country. They'll only be allowed to operate after registering here," said the minister. Last month, law enforcers unearthed a massive haul of weapons, ammo and bomb-making equipment at a madrasa in Bhola which was being run by a UK-based NGO called Green Crescent. The government said it would take immediate steps to bring all NGOs under stricter registration, regulation and review. Saheed said Wednesday the government was making rapid progress in forming the proposed social security council, a single body to register, monitor and regulate NGOs. He said some 175,000 NGOs were registered across the country under the the social welfare ministry, women and children affairs ministry, Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, social services directorate and NGO Bureau. "Some 25 percent of those registered under the social welfare ministry have been barred from their operations and their registration might be cancelled altogether," said the minister. Other active NGOs will have to register afresh under the proposed social security council, he said "We have already sent letters to the women and children affairs ministry, Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, social services directorate and NGO Bureau," he said. "We have also asked them for information on the funding and activities of NGOs for review," said the minister. "If any anomalies are found regarding any NGOs, we will take stringent action against them and all others will only be able to operate after fresh registration" he said. The proposed council will be approved before the next budget, said Shaheed. The minister said the proposal had been sent to the prime minister and would go on to the cabinet for approval before passage by parliament. bdne
