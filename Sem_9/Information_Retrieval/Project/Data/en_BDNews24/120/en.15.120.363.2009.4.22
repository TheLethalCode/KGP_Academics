 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)A BDR member alleged torture in RAB custody as a court ordered him and 26 of his fellow border guards into remand on Wednesday for grilling by CID investigators in connection with the Peelkhana mutiny case. CID officers produced 27 BDR men at the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate court requesting 10 days to interrogate them. The court granted five days. During hearing of the remand prayer, sepoy Harunur Hashid Mia told magistrate Atiq Bin Qader that Rapid Action Battalion had earlier held him without remand or charge. "RAB members detained me for seven days and tortured me with electric shock," said the sepoy. "I want don't to die. Please don't put me on fresh remand. Let me live," he pleaded in court. Harun also claimed to be suffering from jaundice and in need of medical treatment. But the judge replied, "Your eyes look normal. There is no symptom of jaundice." The jawan burst into tears at the comments, before being taken into remand with the other border guards. List of fugitives goes to 'rebel hunters' Meanwhile, BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com Wednesday that the border force had sent a list of names with photos of over 100 fugitive border guards to police and law-enforcing agencies that have been involved with Operation Rebel Hunt since the Feb 25-26 mutiny. A good number of BDR members fled their Dhaka headquarters in the wake of the armed uprising by rebel border guards. Thousands reported back to work in line with a government directive issued early March, while others were arrested up and down the country. Earlier this month, authorities said some 800-1100 BDR members were still absconding. Investigating agencies later revised the number to around 200. "Many reported to police stations and BDR camps around the country soon after government announced a reward of Tk 50,000 for information leading to capture of the fugitive BDR men," Gen Moinul told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "Around 100 are now still fugitive. We have sent the list of names and photos to police stations, Rebel Hunt members and others concerned," he added. bdnews
