 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia responded Thursday to the government's notice to vacate her Dhaka Cantonment residence with a legal notice of her own. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokan sent the notice through courier service and registered post giving the government five days to withdraw its notice to vacate. The directorate of military lands and cantonments served the notice on Khaleda on Apr 20, asking the opposition leader to leave the Moinul Road mansion within 15 days. The cabinet earlier in the month made the decision to cancel the lease on the place given to Khaleda after the 1981 murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. The cabinet decision came after days of clamour triggered by prime minister Shiekh Hasina's statement in parliament last week that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bdne
