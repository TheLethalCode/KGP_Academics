<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka MPs have dubbed Dhaka City Corporation a "hotbed of corruption", blasting the mayor for a breakdown in civic amenities. They say Dhaka residents receive no facilities in return for their taxes. "Just tell us what we need to do on our part, but take steps now to get rid of corruption," Rashed Khan Menon, MP for Dhaka-10, told mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka during a meeting Wednesday on citywide issues. "This corruption cannot be removed by the Anticorruption Commission. An effective plan has to be adopted by the city corporation," he said. Khoka called the meeting, inviting state minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak, state minister for law Quamrul Islam, and Dhaka MPs Menon, Fazle Noor Taposh, Mizanur Rahman Khan Dipu, Habibur Rahman Mollah, Asaduzzaman Kamal, Ilyas Mollah, Aslamul Haque, Shahida Tarek Dipti, Jahanara Begum and Ashrafunnesa Mosharraf. Taposh, MP for Dhaka-12, slammed the mayor for failing to adopt any masterplan for the city's mushrooming growth during his seven years in office. He called on Khoka to announce a plan with a timeframe. He also called on the lawmakers present to give advice on removing corruption. The MPs said, as elected representatives, they had to answer to the people, but no results came from informing the DCC of the people's issues. Mosquitoes were one of the biggest problems in the city, they said, but DCC had failed to control them. The meeting also highlighted unplanned road digging for exacerbating traffic jams and water logging. The MPs pointed too to streets without lights, open garbage tips spreading stench and disease and mismanagement of city parks. Khoka said budget allocation for Dhaka City Corporation was very low in comparison to capital cities of other countries. "Faced with many adversities, the DCC is still working" said the mayor. He urged lawmakers and ministers to take necessary steps for increasing the DCC budget. "Besides, there needs to be coordinated efforts between different offices and divisions to face the many problems," said Khoka. He called on the MPs to maintain this coordination. The Dhaka MPs requested the mayor to hold such a meeting every two or three months and assured him of raising the DCC's limitations and financial problems with the concerned ministries. bd
