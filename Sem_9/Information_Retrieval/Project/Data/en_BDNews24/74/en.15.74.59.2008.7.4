 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnew24.com)  Both of them were police constables who lost their jobs over allegations of blackmail; now they appear to have turned to mugging for a living. Rezaul Sahrif (30) and Shafiqul Alam (31) were arrested Thursday night on charges of theft while posing as Detective Branch police. Shahbagh police officer-in-charge Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com Friday: "The two were working at the Rajarbag Police Lines as constables. They were sacked in February on charges of blackmail." Police arrested them in front of the High Court on Thursday while they were engaged in theft while identifying themselves as DB personnel. Shahbagh police assistant sub-inspector Hamidur Rahman said that a person named Nishikanta Das filed a case with Shahbagh police Thursday night against the two ex-policemen on charges of mugging. Das alleged that as he was walking on the footpath in front of the High Court Thursday night, Rezaul and Shafiqul identified themselves as DB police officers and asked him to go with them to their office. Das began accompanying them, but after going a little distance the two took away a mobile phone set and Tk 900 in the name of a body search. Das became suspicious and raised a hue and cry. Hearing his shouts, a traffic policeman on duty in front of the High Court apprehended the two ex-policemen and handed them over to Shahbag Police Station. The two 'cops-turned-muggers' are now in detention. bdnew
