<TITLE> More British than Bangladeshi: survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Most expatriate Bangladeshis in the UK forget their Bangladeshi identity easily and claim to feel more British than white people, according to the latest citizens' survey by the UK government. "Eighty-eight percent of the people of Bangladeshi origin in the UK felt strongly that they belonged to Britain. This compares with 84 percent of white people," the British High Commission in Dhaka said in a statement Monday. The UK Department for Communities and Local Government carried out the survey between April 2007 and March 2008. The 2007-08 household survey was designed to sample people's attitude on core elements of citizenship. It included a representative sample of just below 10,000 individuals, and an ethnic minority sample of just below 5,000 people. "Seventy-eight percent of the people of Bangladeshi origin in the UK felt strongly that they belonged to their local communities, compared with 75 percent of the white people." "Fifty percent of the people of Bangladeshi origin in the UK believed they could influence decisions that affected their local areas, compared with 37 percent of white people," the statement said quoting the survey. Acting British high commissioner to Bangladesh Duncan Norman said: "We are proud of Britain's thriving multicultural society, where people are respected regardless of ethnic or religious background." "In many ways, these survey findings are a positive reinforcement of what we already knew: that Britons of Bangladeshi origin do not see a contradiction or conflict between these identities," he said. Bangladeshis are making valuable contributions to all aspects of British lifesomething that deserved greater attention and celebration, he said.
