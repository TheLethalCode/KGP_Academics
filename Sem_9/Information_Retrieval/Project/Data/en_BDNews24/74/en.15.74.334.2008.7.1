<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)Business leaders said Tuesday hikes in the prices of fuels, especially diesel, would hurt industries. They warned that the prices of essentials would register another spiral and demanded the government reverse the increase in diesel price. Acting president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Shahidul Islam told bdnews24.com Tuesday that the government should not have, in any way, raised diesel prices by Tk 15 per litre. The government decision will have a big negative impact on the industries, including the garments sector, he warned. "The economy will also face a big loss." "We found after calculations that a Tk 15 increase in per litre of diesel will increase the costs of making a dozen clothes by Tk 0.70," Shahidul said. It means a yearly Tk 500 crore increase in costs would have to be incurred, he claimed. "With it will be added other costs including increased transportation spending." The BGMEA official also said most factories were being operated by diesel-run generators, due to the power crisis. "In such a situation, it would be tough for industries to survive in the competitive world market." Shahidul said BGMEA would hold a press conference on Wednesday to voice its concern. Moulvibazar Businessmen's Association general secretary Golam Maula said that the increase in fuel prices would drive up the prices of essential commodities, including rice, lentil and edible oil. The costs of transporting commodities from Dinajpur or any border area or from Chittagong port will rise by Tk 1 more per kilogramme, the businessman claimed. "As a result, prices of essentials will increase too." bdnews
