 RIYADH Thu Jul 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's top religious official warned on Thursday Saudis and foreigners living in the kingdom to not hide information about militants in the world's largest oil exporter.

Militants allied to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda began a campaign to destabilize the U.S.-allied government in 2003 but the violence was brought to an end by security forces in a counter-insurgency campaign that won plaudits in the West. The last major attack was a failed attempt to storm the world's largest oil processing plant at Abqaiq in February 2006. Since then the government says it has arrested hundreds of suspects, but analysts say they doubt many were hardcore militants reestablishing al Qaeda.
