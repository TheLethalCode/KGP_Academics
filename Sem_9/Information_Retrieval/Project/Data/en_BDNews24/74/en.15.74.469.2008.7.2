 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Wednesday doubted the national polls set for December. "It is not possible to say for sure whether or not the election will be held. Everything in the country is going through a phase of uncertainty," the AL leader told a Jubo League meeting at the AL headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue ahead of its countrywide organisational tour. Ashraful said the AL would try to reach a consensus with the government on the state of emergency and a schedule for the national polls, during the dialogue set for Thursday. "The Awami League wants a meaningful dialogue. We want to reach a consensus on every issue through the talks," Ashraful said. The AL leader came down hard on its old political rival BNP. Pointing an accusing finger at the BNP, Ashraful said: "They (BNP) tried to trap us in a conspiracy with a call for unity. Now they say we have connived with the government." bdnews
