 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) - The 10th Standard Chartered School Chess Tournament gets underway in the city Tuesday with a slogan of 'stand out bright, make your move right.' Some 200 participants, including 16 from India and two from Nepal, from more than 50 schools will take part in the 'regional meet,' divided into three groups -- KG to Class V (boys), Class VI-X (boys) and Girls' category. "The participation of Indian boys and girls has been a common phenomenon, but for the first time, Nepalese contestants are participating in the nine-day tournament," Bangladesh Chess Federation general secretary Jamilur Rahman said at a press conference at the National Sports Council conference room. "We are involved with the chess federation for last 10 years through sponsoring the school chess tournament and hope it will help the nation to build future leaders through playing chess," said Sarwat Ahmed, senior manager of corporate affairs, Standard Chartered Bank. Ahmed said the tournament has already been a popular meet among the school- going children and we hope our efforts would continue in future in this field. Ahmed said that Shamima Akhter Liza, 2005 national women's champion, Sharmin Sultana Shirin, 2007 national women's runners-up, Minhaz Uddin Ahmed Sagar, national junior champion, came out at the national stage through playing the school chess tournament. The Bank would provide awards worth Tk 6 lakh and 1.66 lakh and prizes would be distributed among the winners, said Sujauddin, chairman of the tournament committee. In another development, Sujauddin blamed Brac Bank for not helping them despite communicating with them several times. In quest of developing country's sports, the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) had requested Brac Bank to come forward to help the chess federation. The BOA also made the same request to other local banks which are already involved with different disciplines. "They (Brac Bank) did not phone back despite making promise and they should let us know if they have any problem," said Sujauddin.
