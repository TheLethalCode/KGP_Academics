 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Sunday said he had doubts about the success of ongoing dialogue with the government. "It is right that the dialogue has taken place. But it cannot be said for sure that it was a successful one," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home. "We will have to press ahead with our own strength instead of depending on others," he said after exchanging greetings with activists of the AL wing Jubo Mohila League on its sixth founding anniversary. On why the AL leader thought that the dialogue was not successful, he said: "The dialogue was not successful on agendas as we thought of." On whether there were any differences of opinion with the government, Zillur said: "They were not that much. We talked about the emergency powers rules. The government did not want to withdraw them." "But they became a bit cornered before our arguments," he said. Asked if this party would share the posts of mayor and chairman with its allies in the 14-party combine in the polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities, the acting AL chief said: "The procedure of nomination is underway. The (nominations for) seats will be divided with the 14-party alliance, if necessary." Earlier, Zillur told the Jubo Mohila League members: "Our struggle is yet to finish. You have to work properly for the freedom of the leader (AL president Sheikh Hasina)." He urged the government to lift the state of emergency. "We are going to join the polls to city corporations and municipalities amid the state of emergency. But we will not take part in the national elections under the emergency anyway." Jubo Mohila League had earlier placed wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Dhanmondi. bdnew
