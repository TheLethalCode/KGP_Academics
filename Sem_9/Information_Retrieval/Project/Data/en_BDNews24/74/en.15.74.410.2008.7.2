 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)The deadline for free birth registrations ended on Wednesday. People will have to pay for registrations from now, the government birth and death registration project director, AKM Saiful Islam Chowdhury, told a meeting co-organised by Unicef and Management and Resource Development Initiative at La Vinci Hotel. Until the end of March, Chowdhury said, 5.87 crore people or 39.13 percent of the population took birth registration certificates. "This is not a satisfactory figure at all." The government charges Tk 5 for every year counted from the third year after birth in municipal and Union Parishad areas. A 42-year old, for example, will have to pay Tk 200 in fees for birth registration. For residents of city corporation and cantonment board areas, the annual fee has beet set at Tk 10, he said. Birth certificates in Bangla in municipal and Union Parishad areas will cost Tk 20, which is Tk 50 for English. Residents of city corporation and cantonment areas will have to pay Tk 40 for Bangla and Tk 100 for English certificates. Asked if the government was likely to extend the deadline for free birth registration, the project director said there was no plan to waive fees any further, but it might go for fixing a one-off payment instead of annual fees. Arifa S Sharmin, a Unicef communications official, said birth certificates were a requirement for accomplishing a number of important activities including passport issuance, marriage registration, school enrolment, land registration and bank account opening. The Unicef official gave detailed information about the ongoing birth registration campaign and said that 4,868 local government institutions were carrying out the activities countrywide. Christine Jaulmes, chief of information and communications of Unicef's Bangladesh office, called for increased awareness building around birth registration. The old birth and death registration-related legislation was amended in 2004, making it mandatory that birth registration of a baby within 45 days of his/her birth be done. The government has set a target to register all the remaining citizens by December under a universal birth registration programme. bdnews
