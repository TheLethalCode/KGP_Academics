<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim is still suffering from brain haemorrhage but his health condition is "clinically stable", an official with LabAid Specialised Hospital said Saturday. AKM Mahbubul Hoque, head of the hospital's medical services, told reporters that different tests had confirmed that Nasim's brain haemorrhage continued. "Mohammad Nasim isn't out of danger yet," Hoque said. Nasim will be kept under intensive care for some more days. The former home minister was admitted to the hospital on June 24 after he suffered a stroke in Kashimpur jail in Gazipur. The stroke paralysed the left side of his body and triggered brain haemorrhage. Joint forces arrested Nasim on Feb 4 last year on charges of corruption. A Dhaka court has recently convicted the former minister of amassing illegal wealth and sentenced him to 13 years in jail. bdnews
