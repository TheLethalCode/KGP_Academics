 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)The religious affairs ministry has cancelled licences of 11 hajj agencies on charges of irregularities and corruption, a senior official said Sunday. The ministry confiscated "security deposits" of 51 more agencies and suspended their licences for two years. "Seven others face a warning," religious affairs secretary Mohammad Ataur Rahman said at a press conference at the ministry. None of the 69 hajj agencies will be allowed to send pilgrims this year, he said. The action was taken against the agencies on the basis of allegations from hajj pilgrims and a report by the hajj management administrative team. The ministry served notices on 85 agencies on the basis of allegations and punished 69 in line with the recommendations of an Anticorruption Commission taskforce. The ministry heard the arguments of the agencies and forwarded the matter for review to the taskforce-22 of the National Coordination Committee that deals with serious crimes. The taskforce held separate hearings and recommended punishment to the 69 agencies. In addition to the agencies facing punishment, 232 agencies received government permission to deal with hajj pilgrims this year. The number is higher than last year. The government also extended the time for depositing hajj money to July 13. The secretary said the government this year would send one guide for every 50 pilgrims sent under government management. bdnew
