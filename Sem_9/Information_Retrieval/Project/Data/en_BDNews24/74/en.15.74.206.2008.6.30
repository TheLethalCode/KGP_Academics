 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)The government is to import one million tonne of fertiliser from Russia, Belarus and Morocco by January next year. The MOP, TSP and DAP fertiliser, when procured, will ensure a smooth supply during the next aman (starting in July this year) and the boro season next year. Belarus has already agreed to export 2.5 lakh tonnes of MOP fertiliser to Bangladesh. The remaining 7.5 lakh tonnes will come from Russia and Morocco. "We will procure 10 lakh tonnes of MOP, DAP and TSP fertiliser from Russia, Morocco and Belarus by January next year," agriculture adviser CS Karim told bdnews24.com after a joint meeting on the procurement at the foreign ministry. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, Russian ambassador Gennady P Trotsenko and Moroccan ambassador Mohammed Houroro attended the meeting. Karim said Belarus had already promised to export 2.5 lakh tonnes of MOP to Bangladesh. The agriculture adviser said that he, at the latest FAO conference in Rome, had requested some countries to export fertiliser to Bangladesh. "Some countries responded positively. Today's meeting is a part of the process," the adviser added. To facilitate the import of the fertiliser, Dhaka would appoint an honorary consul general in Belarus as Bangladesh has no mission in Minsk, Iftekhar told bdnews24.com. "The ambassadors responded positively," he added. Bangladesh is dependent on import of fertiliser. Of the country's total urea demand for 28.5 lakh tonnes, 15-17 lakh tonnes are produced here. Bangladesh is almost totally dependent on DAP, MOP, TSP and other fertiliser. "We produced 17.6 million tons of boro paddy in the current season. We have set the target at 13 million tonnes of aman for the coming season," Karim said. He said that the procurement move was aimed at ensuring smooth supply of fertiliser to the farmers in the coming aman and boro seasons. "We will initiate separate moves to procure urea fertiliser from other countries as well," he said. bdn
