 ANKARA, Wed Jul 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Turkish general called for calm on Wednesday after two prominent retired generals were detained in a widening police investigation into a suspected coup plot against the government. "Turkey is passing through difficult days. We all have to be acting with more common sense, more carefully and more responsibly," land forces commander General Ilker Basbug, who is the second most powerful Turkish army official, told reporters. Police detained 21 people on Tuesday as part of a nationwide investigation into Ergenekon, a shadowy, ultra-nationalist and hardline secularist group suspected of planning bombings and assassinations calculated to trigger a military takeover. Turkish financial markets fell further on Wednesday on concerns over prolonged tensions in a country all too familiar with military interventions. The high-profile detentions come as the governing AK Party fights for its survival in court. The chief prosecutor of the Court of Appeals is seeking the closure of the AK Party on charges of Islamist activities. The party denies the charges. The detentions of retired first army chief General Hursit Tolon and retired gendarmerie forces General Sener Eruygur inside their army residences sent shockwaves in a country where the military has an almost untouchable status. The military said the raids were within the law. Other prominent figures detained included an editor of newspaper Cumhuriyet, politicians and the chairman of the Ankara Chamber of Commerce -- all known critics of the ruling AK Party. "The raids yesterday were reminiscent of previous coups and are not acceptable," Rifat Hisarciklioglu, the powerful chairman of the Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodities Exchanges, said in a speech at the Ankara Chamber of Commerce. The fresh detentions revived a debate in Turkey over whether the allegations of a coup against the AK Party held water or were used to suppress government opponents, some dailies said. TENSIONS RISE Turkey, while predominantly Muslim, has a secular constitution, and the military considers itself the ultimate guardian of the republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. It remains at odds with the AK Party over the role of religion in public life, an issue which has polarised Turkey for decades. Turkey has had four military coups in the last 50 years. The most recent was a 1997 'soft coup', when the generals edged from power a government it considered Islamist using public and behind-the-scenes pressure. "I'm watching these events unfold with great concern given Turkey's history of military interventions. There is clearly a fight between two power groups and no one is yet willing to back down," said a senior EU diplomat, who declined to be named. Turkish media questioned the timing of the raids as they came shortly before the Constitutional Court began hearing a case in which the AK Party is charged with trying to establish an Islamic state and could be closed, a move that might lead to an early parliamentary election. The prosecutor also wants Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and other top figures banned from party politics for five years. The AK Party, which won a sweeping re-election last year, will present its defence in court on Thursday. Opposition parties have called for prosecutors to urgently present their indictments in the Ergenekon case, saying some prominent figures have been held in jail for almost a year. "The investigation has been going on for too long and we expect it to be completed as soon as possible," said Hisarciklioglu, a close ally of Erdogan. More than 40 people, including retired army officers, lawyers and politicians have been arrested over the past year for suspected links to Ergenekon, which is named after a valley in Turkish nationalist mythology. The Ergenekon scandal has shone a spotlight on Turkey's "deep state", code for ultra-nationalists in the security forces and state bureaucracy who are ready to bend the law or act against the government in pursuit of their political aims. The military, which has repeatedly criticised the government and considers itself the guardian of Turkey's secular system, has denied any links to the group
