 DUBAI, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe have agreed to skip next year's World Twenty20 in England to avert demands that the African nation be suspended because of Robert Mugabe's government, the International Cricket Council said. "Zimbabwe cricket has ... taken note that the British government is likely to refuse to grant visas for the Zimbabwe cricket team to take part in the ICC World Twenty20 2009," the ICC said in statement issued after its annual meeting in Dubai. "Therefore, the Zimbabwe delegation has decided to recommend to its board that the team should withdraw from that event." The ICC executive board met for a third day on Friday to resolve the deadlock over Zimbabwe, which has lurched from one crisis to another in the last few years, on and off the pitch. England has led the calls to suspend Zimbabwe following last week's widely-criticised presidential election run-off in which Mugabe retained power unopposed. The England and Wales Cricket Board has backed strong action after Britain, a former colonial power in Zimbabwe, called for a suspension of cricket ties with the country. VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION Britain has long been critical of Mugabe and has accused him of trying to steal an election and using violence and intimidation to silence his political opponents. South Africa has already suspended all bilateral programmes with its neighbour, but the influential Indian cricket board (BCCI) is opposed to the suspension of their Zimbabwean counterparts. Zimbabwe is expected to remain as one of the ICC's 10 full members, a status given to test-playing nations. "The Zimbabwe delegation has agreed to take this decision in the greater interest of world cricket and the ICC," the statement said. "This recommendation should be viewed as a one-off and will not be taken as a precedent." Outgoing ICC president Ray Mali has recommended that a sub-committee be set up to advise the ICC executive board on all matters relating to Zimbabwean cricket, including its return to full participation in the international game
