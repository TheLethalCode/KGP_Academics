 LONDON, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks slipped back towards this week's five-month low on Friday as oil prices near record highs kept inflation concerns alive a day after the European Central Bank raised interest rates. The euro failed to benefit much from the ECB's quarter point rate hike on Thursday and the region's government bonds rose as President Jean-Claude Trichet said he had no bias on monetary policy, dousing speculation about aggressive rate hikes this year. A less hawkish tone from Trichet, followed by US job data which came in line with expectations, provided only short-term solace for equity investors. "We cannot get any big relief as long as the overall stagflation fears hang over the market, and the oil price is a major factor in this. There will be a wave of downward pressure on equities after any recovery," Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at UniCredit in Munich, Germany. "The big question on equity markets is: how far will the derating go, and when will valuations find a bottom as we consider inflationary pressures not seen in two and a half decades?" The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.4 percent while MSCI main world equity index was down 0.1 percent, having hit its lowest since January on Thursday. EMERGING FALLOUT Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 2 basis points while emerging stocks fell 0.4 percent. Analysts say emerging markets, especially in Asia, will be more severely hit by the rising energy costs. "The monumental energy price increases will be a 'game-changer' for Asia, in our view," said Stephen Jen, head of global currency research at Morgan Stanley. "While there is some scope for remedial policy action to 'amortize' this shock, Asia ex-Japan currencies will likely weaken against the dollar and assets should underperform in the period ahead." The dollar was steady on the day, keeping gains against the euro made after U.S. payrolls data and Trichet's comments. The euro hit a one-week low of $1.5675. The September Bund future rose 30 ticks. U.S. light crude stood at $145.56 a barrel, within 30 cents of Thursday's record high, with investors bracing a rise to $150 in the coming sessions. Gold rose to $934.45 an ounce
