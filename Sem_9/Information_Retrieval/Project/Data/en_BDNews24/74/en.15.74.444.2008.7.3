<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) The government has taken into account the Awami League's calls for an end to the state of emergency ahead of national polls, said commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Thursday. A final decision on the state of emergencywhether or not to lift itwill be taken later through negotiation and an assessment of the situation, the adviser said at a press conference attended by the AL leaders after a government dialogue. AL leaders raised a number of demands at the meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, including cancellation of all cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. They also demanded release of other detained leaders of the party. The immediate lifting of the state of emergency, holding the national elections ahead of upazila polls, constituting a non-party commission to try war criminals, and reversing the decision of hiking fuel prices were also among AL's demands. The adviser said local government polls would be held by October as the AL was "not against it". "The Awami League has no argument over the upazila polls, questioned the polls schedule. Holding locals polls will be completed by October to keep it beyond dispute." Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam hoped that a free, fair and peaceful election would be held through participation of all political parties. Earlier on Wednesday, Ashraful voiced doubt over the national polls in December. "It was impossible to say for sure if the national election would be held or not," he said at a Jubo League at the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. The dialogue continued for two and a half hours from 11am. On the AL's demand for a halt to what it said was an arrest spree and for the release of party leaders arrested during the four-party alliance rule, the adviser said the matter would be reviewed. The AL leaders Thursday asked the government to ensure participation of teachers in the polls. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed assured the AL delegation of ensuring administrative neutrality during the polls, Zillur said. He said the government would have more talks with the AL. "We said all problems could be solved through talks. Many things are still left to discuss. We will prepare for the polls after discussion on all issues," Ashraful said. "A fair election is not possible under emergency rule. We will reach a consensus on the matter too," he said. The AL leader said the AL would support the proposed women's development policy. But if the AL is voted to power, it will implement the women development policy drafted in 1997." Ashraful ducked a question if the AL would "legalise" the activities of the caretaker government. On the allegation that the AL connived with the government to go to power, the AL leader said: "The Awami League didn't connive with anybody. We want to see a successful dialogue and election through participation of all." The chief adviser led the government delegation to dialogue. AL leaders had talks with partners from the 14-party alliance in the lead-up to Thursday's dialogue to discuss the top-of-mind issues and draw up working agenda. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman, presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser were on the AL team. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman were also present. On April 13, the Awami League sat with the same five advisers, during the government's pre-dialogue round of talks, where the party pressed its demand to send Hasina abroad for treatment. The party threatened to boycott the dialogue if the AL chief was not released. The government granted a temporary release order for Hasina on June 11, for eight weeks to seek medical treatment overseas. Four advisers met her on her return home from special jail that night, and the chief adviser also spoke with her by phone during her meeting with the advisers. The party subsequently accepted the government's invitation to dialogue, submitting a list of nine party delegates that would attend. bdnews24.com/sum/ahd-
