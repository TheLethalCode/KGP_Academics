<TEXT>
 KARACHI, July 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's unorthodox spinner Ajantha Mendis took six wickets to lead his team to a 100-run victory over India in the Asia Cup final at National Stadium on Sunday. Mendis took 6-13 to bowl out India for 173 in 39.3 overs in reply to Sri Lanka's 273 which revolved around a majestic 125 from experienced opener Sanath Jayasuriya who made 125 from 114 balls. Sri Lanka won the cup for a record-equalling fourth time, matching India's achievement. Mendis got rid of Virender Sehwag for 60 and Yuvraj Singh for a duck in his first over. He saw off Suresh Raina (16) and Rohit Sharma (3) to finish with four for eight in his first four overs. In his second spell, Mendis struck twice in his second over, dismissing Irfan Pathan and RP Singh off successive balls. Mendis, 23, came on to bowl when India were sitting pretty on 76 for one; by the time he had finished they were 97 for five. Sehwag produced a flurry of boundaries on the fast outfield even though his partner, Gautam Gambhir, went for only six runs, caught at point by Dilshan off Chaminda Vaas at the total of 36. Sehwag raced to his fifty from 26 balls with 10 fours before he was outfoxed by Mendis who got him stumped on his second ball, deceiving him with a small leg break. Yuvraj faced just two balls before he missed one that skidded on to the stumps. Raina, frustrated by Mendis, tried to pull him and was bowled while Sharma was caught in front by one that spun in. Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni batted steadily for 49 from 74 balls to hold up one end as he and Robin Uthappa (20) put on 38 for the sixth wicket before Muttiah Muralitharan trapped the latter leg before at 135. Mendis then returned to take two wickets at the total of 154 to leave eight wickets down. Mendis finished with 17 wickets in five matches in the tournamen
