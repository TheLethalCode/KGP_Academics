<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Thursday dismissed writ appeals challenging the legality of cancelling the appointment of 835 police sub-inspectors and sergeants during the BNP-Jamaat alliance government. A High Court bench of justices Md Abdur Rashid and Md Ashfaqul Islam Thursday dismissed the appeal. It delivered the verdict after a final, simultaneous hearing of 19 separate writ petitions filed by police sub-inspectors and sergeants, including SI Enamul Haq, Humayun Kabir and Sultana Parveen. The writ appeals also challenged a circular for fresh appointments. The verdict said the cancellation of the appointments of the SIs and sergeants was legal. A counsel for the writ petitioners, barrister Mahbubudddin Khokan, told reporters that they would appeal against the High Court verdict. The HC dismissed the writ petitions saying the appointments were made through irregularity and on political consideration. The BNP-Jamaat alliance government finalised the appointments of the SIs and sergeants in November 2006 after completing all processes. The government on Feb 10 last year cancelled the appointments of 835 SIs and sergeants on charges of being appointed through bribery and on political considerations. Later, on Feb 22, the Police Headquarters issued a notice for recruitment to the vacant posts. Following the filing of 19 writ petitions, the HC on July 19 and July 27 last year asked the government to explain why cancellation of the appointments and issuance of a fresh circular for recruitment would not be declared illegal. Senior advocate Abdur Rab Chowdhury, barrister Abdur Razzak, barrister Moinul Islam Chowdhury and barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan represented the writ petitioners. Additional attorney general Mansur Habib represented the state. bdnew
