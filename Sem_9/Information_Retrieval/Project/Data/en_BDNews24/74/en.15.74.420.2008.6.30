 BERLIN, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of German fans hoping for a night of celebration headed home instead with an early hangover after watching their team deservedly beaten 1-0 by Spain in the Euro 2008 final on Sunday. More than 600,000 fans crowded into the centre of Berlin near the Brandenburg Gate to watch the match on giant TV screens.

About an hour after the end of the match, thousands of dejected fans, many with the German flag wrapped around their shoulders, walked slowly and quietly down Kurfuerstendamm, one of West Berlin's main streets. Some supporters let off fireworks, blew whistles and chanted "Deutschland" but the mood was subdued with only isolated cars driving past with horns honking and flags flying from open windows and roofs.
