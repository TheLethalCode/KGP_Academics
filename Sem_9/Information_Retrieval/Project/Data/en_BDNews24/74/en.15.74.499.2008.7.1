 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Tue Jul 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Botswana called at an African Union summit on Tuesday for President Robert Mugabe to be barred from regional meetings because of his widely condemned re-election. It was the toughest public statement from one of Zimbabwe's neighbors since Mugabe was sworn in on Sunday following a one-candidate election condemned by monitors as violent and unfair. Botswana's statement came as a two-day summit in Egypt debates a resolution calling for a unity government in Zimbabwe. "In our considered view, it therefore follows that the representatives of the current government in Zimbabwe should be excluded from attending SADC (Southern African Development Community) and African Union meetings," a text of summit remarks by Vice President Mompati Merafhe said. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has also called for Mugabe, 84, to be suspended from the African Union after an election which extended the veteran leader's 28-year rule. The Botswana statement underlined the deep rifts both within Africa as a whole and among Zimbabwe's neighbors. Regional power South Africa, the designated mediator in Zimbabwe, has resisted open condemnation of Mugabe. The AU summit in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh has been dominated by a deepening political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe, whose once prosperous economy is racked by the world's highest rate of hyper-inflation. Mugabe was addressing the final session of the two-day summit, senior delegates said. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the poll because of the violence, which he said had killed 86 of his supporters in the Movement for Democratic Change. Summit delegates said earlier the leaders were divided between those who wanted a strong statement about Zimbabwe and others who were reluctant to publicly censure Mugabe. The divisions looked likely to produce a resolution weaker than wanted by some nations after the election provoked unprecedented African criticism and widespread international condemnation. Senior delegates taking part in a closed-door session said the resolution being debated would pledge AU support for talks between Mugabe and Tsvangirai. It was submitted by a security troika of the AU, comprising Tanzania, Swaziland and Angola, which had called for the vote to be postponed. Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma, a member of the West and East African group most critical of Mugabe told BBC radio earlier: "The people of Zimbabwe have been denied their democratic rights. We should, in no uncertain terms, condemn what has happened." Koroma said the southern African group must engage Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who withdrew from the ballot because of attacks on his supporters, in talks leading to a transitional government and fresh elections. But prospects the summit would give major new momentum to moves to end the crisis seemed to be receding even before its scheduled end on Tuesday. Mugabe's spokesman rejected ideas being floated for a Kenyan-style power-sharing deal and MDC Secretary-Tendai Biti, who was jailed for two weeks before the vote, said there was no chance of negotiations after Mugabe ignored a flood of appeals to call off the election
