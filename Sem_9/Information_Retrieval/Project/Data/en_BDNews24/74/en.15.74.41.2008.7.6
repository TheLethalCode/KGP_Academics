<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed a committee to investigate and put a stop to continuing roadworks despite a ban during the current monsoon season, and to reclaim illegally blocked canals to prevent further water logging in Dhaka city, an adviser said Sunday. LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal presided over a meeting at the local government division Sunday, where the committee was convened, with local government secretary Sheikh Khurshid Alam, Dhaka WASA and City Corporation representatives. Iqbal told reporters after the meeting that despite government efforts Dhaka WASA and City Corporation have been carrying out detrimental cutting and digging work on different roads in the city during the heavy rains, perhaps due to delays in work orders. "But an order has been issued to stop it." "As WASA is directly under the ministry, they have been directed to put a stop to such works and they have already stopped," said the local government adviser. But the committee has been formed to look into why the city corporation is continuing with its road works in July after the expiry of a specified deadline, he said. "The committee will investigate and take action." The ministry is also going to take action so that water logging may be further prevented during heavy rains, Iqbal said. "Emphasis has been given on recovery and restoration illegally blocked canals." "There is pressure from donor agencies also to rehabilitate slum dwellers who have built their homes in these areas, during the reclamation of these canals," said the adviser "But no response has come from the agencies. The slum dwellers will have to be evictedif donor assistance is available, the slum dwellers would be rehabilitated later." Sheikh Khurshid Alam said all due road works by Dhaka WASA have already been completed, and Dhaka City Corporation has said it would undertake no more cutting or digging work during the current monsoon season. "Roads which have been dug up by different agencies will be repaired. Activities to that end are going on." The meeting was also told that 13 canals in Dhaka city have already been reclaimed, which are currently being renovated. bdnew
