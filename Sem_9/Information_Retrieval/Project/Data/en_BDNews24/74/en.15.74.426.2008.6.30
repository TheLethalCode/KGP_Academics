<TEXT>
 Karachi, June 30 (bdnews24.com) Muttiah Muralitharan claimed five scalps to take Sri Lanka to the Asia Cup final with a convincing 158-run win over Bangladesh in the third Super Fours match in Karachi Monday. Bangladesh had never seemed to offer any challenge and eventfully folded at 174 in 38.3 overs after Sri Lanka racked up a massive 332 for eight riding on two centuries from openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara. The maestro spinner came in the 20th over with Bangladesh's scoreboard reading 103 for three, but the things changed and he returned five for 31 in his 10-over spell. Ajantha Mendis chipped in with two for 29 after pacers Chaminda Vaas (1/21) and Thilan Mirando (1/36) rattled the Bangladesh top order. Roqibul Hasan was Bangladesh's highest scorer with 52 off 63 balls followed by opener Nazimuddin's 47 off 59 balls. Captain Mohammad Ashraful was the third Bangladesh batsman, who crossed the double digits to make a 15-ball 14. Earlier, two centuries from Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara powered Sri Lanka to an impressive total. Jayasuriya slammed his second fasted hundred facing just 55 balls after his first quick century off 48 balls against Pakistan in 1996, and this could not come at a better time than on his 39th birthday. The left-handed opener started in style lashing Mashrafee Bin Mortaza's opening delivery past point for four, but he gave a maiden over to Shahadat Hossain with Bangladesh conceding only 20 runs in the first five overs. The thing changed after that, with Jayasuriya dusting off his pull shots and also driving over the infield with immense power, and he, along with Kumar Sangakkara, put on 201 runs in 27.5 overs before being separated. Jayasuriya reached fifty off just 33 deliveries smashing Mashrafee for six and four in a row, and then he went on to tear the Bangladesh attack with his pull, cut and drive shots taking just another 22 balls to complete his 26th ODI hundred, world's sixth quickest century. The stylish opener, dropped on 100 by keeper Mushfiqur Rahim off Abdur Razzak, finally struck 130 off 88 balls that studded 16 fours and six sixes before being caught by Tamim Iqbal off Alok Kapali. Sangakkara's century, his third in the tournament, was overshadowed by Jayasuriya's scintillating one as he was a bit slow when Jayasuriya ravaged the Bangladesh bowlers. Left-handed Sangakkara came out of his shell after Jayasuriya's departure and completed his 10th ODI hundred in style before being dismissed by Razzak. His 121 off 128 balls innings were studded with 16 fours and one six. Sangakkara, however, was a bit lucky to have found his century as Kapali dropped him on 51. Except these two centuries, there was nothing mentionable in the Sri Lankan innings and though at one stage, it seemed they would rack up around 400, it was not possible for the Sri Lankan middle and tail to assault the Bangladesh bowlers as the openers. One-down Jayawardene was the third highest scorer with 20 off 22 balls followed by Nuwan Kulasekara's 18 and Thilan Mirando's 10. Kapali and Farhad Reza grabbed two wickets each for 40 and 51 while Shahadat Hossain, Razzak and Mashrafee chipped in with one wicket each. bdn
