 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Mon Jun 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived on Monday at an African Union summit where he will confront his critics after winning a one-candidate election condemned by monitors as unfair and violent. Mugabe, 84, flew to Egypt overnight soon after being sworn in for a new term, extending his unbroken rule since independence from Britain in 1980. He was seen entering the summit conference hall in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh with the leaders of Egypt, Tanzania -- the AU chairman -- and Uganda. His decision to go ahead with the election after the withdrawal of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai provoked unprecedented African criticism of the former liberation hero. Tsvangirai withdrew because of violence in which he said nearly 90 of his followers were killed. Monitors from both Zimbabwe's neighbors in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Pan-African parliament said the vote was undermined by violence and did not reflect the will of the people. Indications ahead of the summit suggested the leaders will reject strong Western calls for hefty new sanctions on Zimbabwe and press instead for talks between Mugabe and Tsvangirai. Some of the leaders favor a power-sharing deal modeled on the one the ended a bloody post-election crisis in Kenya earlier this year in which 1,500 people died. Zimbabwe's crisis has ruined a once prosperous country, saddling it with the world's worst rate of hyper-inflation and sending millions of refugees into neighboring countries. Tsvangirai called on the leaders not to recognise Mugabe's re-election. "We want them (the AU) to say the 27 (June) election is illegitimate," he told Dutch public television. "We want them to say the 29th March election reflected the will of the people and that it should be the basis for negotiating this transition." Tsvangirai won the first round of elections on March 29 but fell short of the majority needed for outright victory
