<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday set July 15 for verdict in a graft case against former president HM Ershad involving purchase of electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment. Judge Md Golam Mortuza of the Dhaka Divisional Special Judge's Court set the fresh date for the verdict in the case. Judge Md Golam Mortuza of the Dhaka Divisional Special Judge's Court had earlier set Wednesday (July 2) as the verdict date in the case. Earlier, at 11:40 am, the judge settled down in his court and informed both prosecution and defence that he had not quite finished with writing the verdict due to exigencies of service and hence the new date for delivering the same. Meantime, prosecution lawyer Nurul Islam Talukdar told bdnews24.com, "This is the second time that the verdict date has been shifted in this case." On June 18, the previous hearing date also, the verdict wasn't delivered as the former president Ershad wasn't present in the court. The now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the case on Feb 29, 1992, pressing charges on Oct 27 the same year. According to the case details, the national transmission authorities were ordered to purchase an ENG set at Tk 2.93 crore in 1989, while Ershad was in the office. Ershad is accused of abusing his power to misappropriate money from the state coffers to purchase the equipment for his own office, even though all broadcasting facilities were available at his secretariat. The trial was concluded with closing arguments on June 8. The former president faced numerous cases after he was deposed in 1990. In 2006, he was acquitted in four graft cases following his announcement of joining the BNP-led four-party alliance. He was also acquitted in a corruption case and a gold smuggling case earlier this year. bdnew
