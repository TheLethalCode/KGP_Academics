 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Monday decided to hold the season curtain-raiser Federation Cup in two phases -- qualifying and final round, starting from July 31 at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Eleven teams from professional football league will play directly in the finals where five teams from the knockout qualifying round will join the 16-team final round. "It will take much time to complete the tournament ahead of the B. League if we hold the tournament with 21 or 22 teams, so we have decided to split the tournament into two phases -- qualifying round and final round," said BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi Monday. Sixteen teams, split into four groups, will play the round-robin league matches and the top team of each group will qualify for the semifinals, said Salam, who is also chairman of the B. League. Ten teams -- Victoria Sporting Club, Sunrise Sporting Club, Jatrabari Krira Chakra, Dhaka Wanderers Club, Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy, Bangladesh Air Force, Bangladesh Police, Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan, Diganta Prasari of Rajshahi -- confirmed their participation Sunday, the last day of enrolling the names. Apart from this teams, Bangladesh Customs Krira Parisad had also shown their interest in playing the Federation Cup, but the tournament committee was yet to decide about the Customs, said Salam. The former national striker said that they had a plan to provide accommodation and food to those teams outside Dhaka.
