 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Saturday ruled out the possibility of prices of essentials coming down, but said the government had taken steps in the new budget to stop prices rising further. "It's not possible for the government alone to keep the commodity prices at tolerable level. Cooperation of all including government and businessmen is necessary," the adviser told a seminar on "commodity prices and poverty reduction", organised by Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Bangladesh Economic Association at the DCCI auditorium. The businessmen have to keep in mind their social responsibility instead of focusing on profit alone, the adviser said. "We should not expect a fall in market prices as the prices of commodities including food, fertiliser and fuel are increasing on the international market." Import duty on almost all types of foods has been waived in the 2008-09 budget, said Mirza Aziz. "The government has taken different steps, including creation of work for 100 days for rural poor people." "As the prices of fuel and fertiliser rose on the world market we had no alternative to increasing the prices of the two commodities," Mirza Aziz said. "Even after the price hike, the government will have to give Tk 40 in subsidy on a litre of diesel. It will have to count the subsidy of Tk 50 on a kg of urea fertiliser." "If the fuel prices were not increased, the government would have to give Tk 17,000 crore in subsidy. Even after the rise in energy prices, the government will have to count Tk 10,000 crore in subsidy in the current fiscal year," Mirza Aziz. Explaining high rice prices despite the harvest of bumper boro crops, the adviser said: "In the past years, the farmers had sold 40 percent of their boro produce. This time, they are not selling even 20 percent." Deputy commerce secretary Bikash Chandra Saha said: "In a market monitoring, the ministry found that some NGOs and financial organisations gave funds to farmersthe reason they are not selling their rice." The finance adviser said: "The farmer's capacity to stock rice has increased. The stock capacity increased as adequate agricultural loans were provided during the last boro season. The producers have benefited from it, not the consumers." Bangladesh Economic Association president Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad presided over the seminar, where FBCCI vice-president Abu Alam Chowdhury and DCCI president Hossain Khaled were also present. bdnews
