 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt Tue Jul 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An African Union summit on Tuesday tried to overcome divisions on how to deal with the re-election of President Robert Mugabe in a poll condemned around the world. Summit sources said the leaders were divided between those who wanted a strong statement about Zimbabwe and others who were reluctant to publicly censure the veteran leader, who extended his 28-year rule in a one-candidate election last Friday. Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma, a member of the West and East African group most critical of Mugabe told BBC radio: "The people of Zimbabwe have been denied their democratic rights. We should, in no uncertain terms, condemn what has happened." Koroma said the southern African group must engage Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who withdrew from the ballot because of attacks on his supporters, in talks leading to a transitional government and fresh elections. But Mugabe spokesman George Charamba rejected the idea of the Kenya-style power-sharing solution floated by several summit leaders to end a crisis that has saddled Zimbabwe with the world's worst hyper-inflation and strained neighboring states with millions of refugees. "Kenya is Kenya. Zimbabwe is Zimbabwe. We have our own history of evolving dialogue and resolving political impasses the Zimbabwean way. The Zimbabwean way, not the Kenyan way. Not at all," Charamba said. Mugabe threatened before the summit to confront his critics and suggested he would point back at leaders who themselves were in power undemocratically. The AU traditionally favors consensus and analysts said the divisions might be overcome with a statement that called for negotiations but stopped short of condemning the election or refusing to recognize Mugabe, 84. "They will dodge the bullet. They won't expressly recognize him but they won't kick him out of the session," a senior delegate told Reuters. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who defeated Mugabe in the first round in March, withdrew from the poll after saying government-backed violence had killed nearly 90 supporters. He has called on the summit not to recognize the election. "DEAL CLOSE" A South African newspaper on Friday said President Thabo Mbeki, the designated regional negotiator in Zimbabwe was close to brokering a deal that would have Mugabe and Tsvangirai negotiate a unity government. The issue of who would lead such a government remains a possibly insuperable stumbling block, although both sides say they are ready for talks. "The plan involves getting Mugabe and Tsvangirai to work together to implement agreements between ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change made in January. These include a new constitution and other reforms," Business Day said. Mbeki spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga refused to comment on the report. "We've been in talks with both parties. I can't talk about the specific details." Mugabe was sworn in for a new five-year term on Sunday after election authorities announced he had won more than 85 percent of the vote in an election which three African monitoring groups said was unfair. Tsvangirai left the Dutch embassy in Harare on Tuesday after taking refuge for more than a week, the Dutch government said. Tesco, one of Britain's biggest supermarket chains, said it would stop buying produce from Zimbabwe to support pressure for an end to its escalating political crisis. African leaders, deeply reluctant to criticize each other publicly, have previously appeared over-awed by Mugabe's status as a hero of the anti-colonial struggle. But the conduct of the election provoked unprecedented criticism from within Africa. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who is part of a power-sharing government with President Mwai Kibaki that ended a bloody post-election crisis earlier this year, urged the AU to suspend Mugabe until he allowed free elections. The summit is unlikely to back a U.S. push at the United Nations for sanctions against Mugabe, including an arms embargo. So far only Western powers have imposed financial and travel sanctions against the Zimbabwean leader and his top officials. China, which has long opposed U.N. sanctions, said on Tuesday Zimbabwe must solve its own problems and showed no eagerness to endorse the U.S. moves. Together with Russia and South Africa it has diluted Security Council criticism of the election
