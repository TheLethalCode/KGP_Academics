 Dhaka, July 07 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia will welcome Bangladeshi workers again, said an adviser Monday. Malaysia banned Bangladeshi workers from working there, effective from Dec 31 last year. "Bangladeshi workers were welcome in Malaysia," Malaysian minister for home and immigration Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Syed Jaafar Albar told foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in Kuala Lumpur, according to a foreign ministry statement. The foreign adviser is now in Malaysia to attend the ministerial conference on the developing-8 group, popularly known as D-8. Iftekhar discussed labour issues at a meeting with the Malaysian minister. "Malaysia is about to initiate a series of development projects and if we can develop the requisite skills there are vast potentials for our labour force in this country," Iftekhar told the media in an emailed message from Kuala Lumpur. "Of course, there are some problems and many of our workers have been subject to harassment by many quarters." "I have discussed this with Malaysian Ministers and we are resolved to address these issues together to settle," he said. There are over 4.45 lakh Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is in Kuala Lumpur to attend the summit of D-8, grouping of the eight biggest Muslim countries in the world. Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey are the members of the D-8 established in 1997. bdn
