 Dhaka, July 02 (bdnews24.com)--Environment ministers of SAARC countries meet Thursday for the first time to find ways of fixing up development and adaptation strategies as climate change threatens the socio-economic fabric of the region. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will inaugurate the first "SAARC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change" at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. SAARC secretary-general Sheel Kant Sharma will also be present at the conference. The meeting will adopt a resolution on SAARC strategies to ensure sustain climate resilient development. Experts from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka met for two days and finalised the draft of the Dhaka declaration. The declaration will be announced Thursday at the hotel. Experts from Bangladesh at the technical meetings proposed creating a new fund styled "Climate Change Fund" for adaptation projects in the SAARC countries. The proposal was opposed by the Indian representatives who proposed using fund from the SAARC Development Fund. "The Bangladesh proposal for creating a new fund has not been accepted," an official with the Department of Environment attending the meeting told bdnews24.com. The 14th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in New Delhi (April 3-4, 2007) expressed "deep concern" over the impact of climate change. As a follow-up action, Bangladesh proposed hosting SAARC's first climate change conference in Dhaka. All member countries accepted the proposal. bdn
