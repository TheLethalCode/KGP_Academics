 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) Popular TV actress Suborna Mustafa has wedded director Badrul Anam Soud. "Only those close to the families of the bride and the bridegroom were present at the wedding," entertainment magazine Anandadhara assistant editor Arif Khan told bdnews24.com Monday. Arif acted as a 'wedding witness' in line with Muslim marriage traditions. The news put to rest speculation about Suborna's second marriage, which went on for weeks. The ceremony played out in a low-key fashion at the Uttara home of Suborna's mother, starting at 11am Monday. The denmohor (bride money) of Suborna-Soud marriage is Tk 10 lakh, Arif said. Some workers of production house Krishnachura also attended the ceremony. Repeated attempts to contact the bride and the bridegroom by phone failed as neither of them answered the calls. During a visit Monday, the bdnews24.com correspondent found the Krishnachura office in Uttara closed. The shooting of daily TV soap Doll's House was off for the day as its director Badrul Anam Soud and actress Suborna were absent. Co-director of Doll's House Afsana Mimi was also not available for comment. Another actress of Doll's House, Bijori Barkatullah, told bdnews24.com by phone: "You will get to know everything tomorrow." Suborna has recently sent a letter of divorce to her husband Humayun Faridi, also a popular actor. Earlier both had told bdnews24.com that they were living apart. bdnews24.
