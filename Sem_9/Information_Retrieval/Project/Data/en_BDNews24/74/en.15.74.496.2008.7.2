 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  The fuel price hike will not hurt aman farming but is likely to weigh on boro output in the next season, said agriculture adviser CS Karim Wednesday. Speaking to reporters in his agriculture ministry office, the adviser said the government would try to cushion farmers against the impact of the increase in fuel and fertiliser prices through assistance. Fuel prices will not affect the production of aman (wet season rice), largely because of rain, Karim said. "The target will be achieved if there is no shortage of seeds." The target of boro production this season was 1.75 crore tonnes but the production exceeded the target by 10 lakh tonnes. Aman output is expected to reach 1.3 crore tonnes for this season, the adviser said. Karim said the production cost of per kilogramme of boro paddy was Tk 13 and the government set the price at Tk 18 per kg to benefit farmers. Production costs of paddy will rise by Tk 1 per kg in the next boro season in the wake of the fuel and fertiliser price hikes, Karim said. The government allocated Tk 540 crore to safeguard farmers from the impact of price hike. "If necessary, the amount of subsidies will be increased further." The agriculture adviser says irrigation pumps are usually owned by middlemen and "the money may end up in their hands". "Farmers will be affected if they charge higher. The matter will be strictly monitored." Karim said the authorities asked the Water Development Board to take steps to stop saline water entering coastal areas. bdnew
