 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has filed a new case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia, son Tarique Rahman, and five others on charges of embezzlement from the Zia Orphanage Trust. "The commission approved the graft case against seven people, including Khaleda Zia and her elder son Tarique Rahman, on charges of embezzling Tk 2.10 core from the Zia Orphanage Trust," ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal told bdnews24.com earlier. Others accused in the case include former BNP lawmakers Kazi Salimul Haque, Syed Ahmed, Gias Uddin Ahmed, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Mominur Rahman. According to case details, a foreign organisation in 1992 donated Zia Orphanage Trust a Tk 4.66 crore grant, which was deposited with a bank and swelled to Tk 5.3 crore eventually, thanks to interest rates. Later, the fund was allocated for the Trust branches in Bogra and Bagerhat. In a probe, the ACC found that a large part of the money was not spent for the welfare of orphans and was splurged for other purposes. The then prime minister Khaleda Zia's office allocated the fund. Khaleda was quizzed about the alleged fund embezzlement at special jail, the probe details said. The Trust's chairman Tarique Rahman and member Arafat Rahman Coco were also interrogated. bdnews24
