<TITLE> Zambian President Mwanawasa has died: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, July 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa died in a Paris hospital on Thursday after suffering a stroke earlier this week, South Africa's Talk Radio 702 reported, quoting a Zambian High Commission spokesman. Officials in Lusaka had no immediate comment. Mwanawasa, 59, was rushed to hospital on Sunday in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh after suffering a stroke just before an African Union summit. He was later transferred to Paris for treatment. "He passed on this morning," Malone Zaza, identified as the high commission spokesman, told the radio. Mwanawasa chaired the Southern African Development Community, which has been mediating between President Robert Mugabe and the opposition to try to end a political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe. The Zambian leader is a favourite of the International Monetary Fund and other Western donors, who extended billions of dollars in debt relief after he cracked down on government spending and launched an anti-graft drive. He suffered a mild stroke in 2006 but said before being re-elected that year that he was fit to stand for office.
