 Dhaka, Jun 30 (bdnews24.com)Indices on the country's twin bourses ended mixed Monday, amid investors' continued disappointment from the previous day over the market regulator's moves to bar mutual funds from declaring stock dividends. Share prices gained during the first half of trade, but fell in the midday sessions on increased selling, an official of brokerage house IDLC Securities said.
