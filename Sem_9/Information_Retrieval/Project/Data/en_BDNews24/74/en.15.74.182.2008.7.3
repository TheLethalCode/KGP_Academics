 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) - Before the start of the football season, it seems that the Bangladesh Football Federation is getting more attention from sponsors and is likely to strike a deal with mobile phone operator AKTEL. "We are looking for partners, and some companies, more or less, are showing interest. AKTEL is one of them with whom we had our second meeting," said BFF president Kazi Salahuddin at a media briefing at the BFF House Thursday. "We put forward our whole programme to them and they responded positively. We think it will take another two to three meetings to finalise everything," said the BFF boss, who, however, declined to reveal their demands saying, "It is too early to disclose it." "Football is a very popular game, and we are very much interest to be involved in it. We are looking forward on how to collaborate with the Bangladesh Football Federation," said Jefri Ahmed Tambi, CEO and managing director of AKTEL. Bidyut Kumar Basu, chief commercial officer of AKTEL, said that it was an initial discussion with the Bangladesh Football Federation and that they were hoping to be a partner in football. "AKTEL will feel proud if it is involved in the new-look football federation," said Basu. Meanwhile, the Prime Bank Limited was all set to sponsor the B. League and the National Football League at a cost of Tk 1.25 crore.
