 MUMBAI Tue Jul 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares tumbled 3.7 percent to a 15-month closing low on Tuesday, taking their losses to more than 10 percent in just three days, as investors were rattled by record oil prices, rising inflation and political uncertainty. No. 2 mobile operator Reliance Communications fell 10.5 percent to a 15-month closing low, hit by concerns talks for a multi-billion dollar deal with South Africa's MTN Group may fail due to a family feud. Reliance Infrastructure, which is part on the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group along with Reliance Communications, fell 10.5 percent, after an 11.5 percent drop on Monday. "We have reached a situation where people have lost faith. I am hearing some funds are facing redemption pressures," Ambarish Baliga, vice president at Karvy Stock Broking, said. The benchmark 30-share index fell 499.92 points to 12,961.68 points, trading below 13,000 for the first time since April 2007, with all but one stock falling. The index, which dropped 18 percent in June, its biggest monthly fall since May 1992, is down 36.1 percent this year. "Redemption pressure is seen in India emerging funds run by FIIs," said K.K. Mital, CEO of Escorts Mutual Fund, referring to foreign institutional investors. Foreign funds have sold a net $6.6 billion of Indian stocks this year, including $2.6 billion in June. "Retail investors, who typically refrain from selling at a loss, are jumping into the fray trying to cut losses. It is a kind of panic out there," Mital said. Fund managers at SBI Mutual Fund and Birla Sunlife Mutual Fund said they were not facing redemption pressures. Domestic funds had bought a net 72.13 billion rupees ($1.7 billion) between January 1- June 26, data from fund tracker ICRA Online showed. Financial stocks slumped on concerns the central bank would tighten policy further to rein in inflation, which hit 11.4 percent in mid-June, which would hit demand for loans. No. 2 bank ICICI Bank fell 6.4 percent to 589.50 rupees, its lowest close in 23 months, and largest bank State Bank fell 7.8 percent to 1,024.65 rupees, its lowest close in nearly 14 months. In the broader market, 2,273 losers led 405 gainers on volume of 274 million shares, as political worries intensified after leftist allies threatened to withdraw support from the ruling coalition if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh forged ahead with a U.S. nuclear deal. Auto stocks fell on concerns high oil prices and rising interest rates would hit demand. Top truck maker Tata Motors fell 4.2 percent to 408.45 rupees, its lowest in more than three years, and leading car maker Maruti Suzuki dropped 8 percent to 568 rupees, its lowest close in 2 1/2 years. Oil, India's biggest import, was trading at $142 a barrel, bolstered by continuing tensions between Israel and Iran. State-run power utility NTPC was the only stock in the main index to rise, putting on 1 percent to 153.20 rupees after it signed a $2.3 billion loan agreement with Power Finance Corp on Monday. The 50-share NSE index or Nifty fell 3.6 percent to 3,896.75 points, its lowest close since April 2007. Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-share index fell 0.55 percent to 12,2221.53 and Colombo's All share index dropped 0.73 percent to 2,493.96. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Cambridge Solutions shares ended 5 percent up at 59.90 rupees on reports British outsourcing firm Xchanging was in early-stage talks for a deal. The British firm confirmed in a statement it had held discussions with Cambridge. Sejal Architectural Glass Ltd ended its first day of trade at 81.50 rupees, below the issue price of 115 rupees. New Delhi Television Ltd rose 0.4 pct to 379.90 rupees after its board approved separating the entertainment business from its main news business and listing it separately.
