<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh ended their Asia Cup campaign by conceding an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat to Pakistan in the last Super Fours match at Karachi Friday. Pakistan faced no trouble reaching the target of 116 for no loss in just 19.4 overs, after Bangladesh faced ruin with a paltry 115 all out in 38.2 overs. Salman Butt smashed nine boundaries to score 56 off 62 balls, while Nasir Jamshed played a 56-ball 52 that featured two sixes and five fours. There was a sense of deja vu as the Bangladesh batsmen threw away their wickets to fold with the lowest total batting first in the tournament, 168 less than the next highest. On a pitch offering sideways movement and extra bounce, pacer Abdur Rauf ripped through the Bangladesh top order felling three wickets, with medium pacer Iftikhar Anjum bowling an astonishing six maidens to return two for 20, putting the hosts on course for a consolation victory. Bangladesh got into trouble, after opting to bat first, with Nazimuddin (3 off 6 balls) giving Shoaib Malik a catch at cover, while attempting to pull Rauf. Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Ashraful attempted to rescue Bangladesh's game, putting on 41, but Ashraful (14 off 18 balls) ended by throwing away his wicket, triggering a mini collapse in the top order. Bangladesh slipped to 49 for four from 47 for two as the side's highest scorer Tamim Iqbal (26 off 41 balls) was Rauf's third victim, and Roqibul Hasan hooked his first ball off Sohail Tanvir to hole out at short fine leg. Wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim and Alok Kapali together took their side to 73. But Kapali (17 off 27 balls), who showed early promise hitting four fours, was caught at first slip by Younis Khan off an Anjum extra bounce. Mushfiqur Rahim was run out for 15 off 37 balls, setting off another collapse that saw Bangladesh lost their last three wickets for 14 runs. Spinner Saeed Ajmal grabbed two wickets for 19 while Shoaib Malik and Sohail took one wicket apiece. b
