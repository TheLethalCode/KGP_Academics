 VIENNA, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was unsure whether he had played his last game for Germany in Sunday's 1-0 defeat by Spain in the Euro 2008 final. The 38-year-old was shaky in the 3-2 semi-final win over Turkey but recovered his poise to make some superb saves against the Spanish. "That's my last Euro match," he told reporters before dodging questions about the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. "I don't want to talk about anything else. I have to digest this disappointment first. You can imagine if I make any other decisions I'll tell the coach and the other players first." Lehmann was the hero in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final win over Argentina on penalties but then conceded two late goals in the semi-final to tournament winners Italy. The keeper, who has agreed a move to VfB Stuttgart, also tasted disappointment in the 2006 Champions League final when his Arsenal side lost to Barcelona and he was sent off early on. "The problem is when you lose something like this the 'if' word is the word of the losers. Perhaps all my life I'll be saying 'If I only I had done something differently'," he added. Lehmann criticised Italian referee Roberto Rosetti, especially for not dismissing Spain midfielder David Silva. "I was quite disappointed with the referee," he said. "He didn't give a red card to the Spanish player who head-butted our player and he gave a free kick against us in the last two minutes in the Spanish penalty area and even the Spanish players were surprised that it was considered a foul." Germany coach Joachim Loew, who refused to blame the referee, said he did not know what the future held for Lehmann. "I didn't speak with him about that. I said 'congratulations you did very well'," he said
