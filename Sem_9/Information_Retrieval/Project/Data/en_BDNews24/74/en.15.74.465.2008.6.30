The company, one of the largest battery manufacturers in the SAARC region, are offering 24-hour service and electronic billing in stations under their 'Quikfill' logo. Rahimafrooz Group chairman, Afroz Rahim unveiled the Quickfill brand at the Spectra Convention Centre in Gulshan Monday. Four refuelling stationsin Tongi, Tejgaon, Biswaroad and Manikganjhave initially been opened under the Quickfill logo. The group will set up 11 more stations across the country within one year, he said. The company chairman said the new service was aimed at easing the frustrations of CNG users. Power-cuts would not interrupt services at the stations because of backup power supply, Rahim said, adding that frequent power-outages often caused consumers immense waits in front CNG stations. The electronic billing system would save consumers' time too, he said. The group will also offer services to others in setting up CNG stations under a Quikfill Franchise scheme. It will also set up more CNG conversion centres for altering automobiles to run on CNG instead of petrol, and offer an Innovative Customer Services programme soon, Rahim said.
