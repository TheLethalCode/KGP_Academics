<TITLE> G8 breathes life into Japan's rugged north island </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOYAKO, Japan, Mon Jul 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In choosing a venue for this year's G8 summit, then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sought to show off Japan's rugged natural beauty, famous cuisine and legendary hospitality. The country's northern island of Hokkaido, with its dramatic Alpine scenery, volcanic lakes and reputation for excellent seafood and fresh vegetables, fit the bill. The three-day summit that started on Monday is the biggest thing to happen to Hokkaido since Sapporo hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972, and the area could use the help. In 2000, the region around the summit site was smothered in ashes following the eruption of snow-capped Mount Usu, forcing 15,000 residents to flee their homes. Apart from volcanic eruptions and the occasional earthquake and tsunami, the area, about 760 km north of Tokyo, has also fallen victim to tough economic times. A local dairy company was hit by a tainted milk scandal in 2000, hurting the overall business mood, while a confectioner came under fire last year for mislabelling expiry dates on cookies popular with tourists. The luxury hotel where the leaders are meeting has also had a rocky history. The Windsor Hotel opened in 1993 but had to shut down four years later after it -- along with many other businesses in the area -- suffered from the bursting of Japan's "bubble economy" of soaring asset prices. Reopened in 2002, the hotel has since regained fame and a jump in bookings on publicity ahead of the summit, despite pricey room rates -- ranging from around 45,000 yen ($420) to 1.3 million yen ($12,170) a night for the "Grand Presidential Suite". UNDEVELOPED JAPAN Japan has pushed greater awareness of climate change as an overarching theme of this year's summit, and the natural environment of Hokkaido is an appropriate backdrop for that goal. In contrast to the rest of heavily populated Japan, Hokkaido is striking for its expanses of ancient undeveloped forest enjoyed by nature enthusiasts and the island's famous brown bears. Hokkaido accounts for about one-fifth of Japan's land mass but only about 6 million live there out of a total population of 127 million people. For the region's residents, their simple rural lifestyles immortalised in the long-running television series "Kita no kuni kara" (From The North Country), the summit is a lot of fuss with no clear outcome. "I hope that something is achieved. The air is clean around Toyako, but I bet temperatures are rising with all the people around," said Yuriko Kosaka, 66, a retired nursery school head living in nearby town of Iwanai
