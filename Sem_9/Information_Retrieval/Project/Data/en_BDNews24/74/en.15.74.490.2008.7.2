 MADRID, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla said goodbye to Brazil full back Daniel Alves on Tuesday ahead of the 25-year-old completing his transfer to Primera Liga rivals Barcelona. "He is one of the most important players in Sevilla's recent history, and maybe even in the entire history of the club," Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido told a news conference shared with the player. Alves was a key figure in helping Sevilla to win two UEFA Cups, a King's Cup, a European Super Cup and a Spanish Super Cup in his five-and-a-half seasons with the Andalucians. Spanish media have reported that he will move on a four-year contract for a fee of around 29.5 million euros, rising to 36 million euros depending on appearances and results. The right back was due in Barcelona on Tuesday to take a medical before completing the transfer, Barca said on their Web site (www.fcbarcelona.com)
