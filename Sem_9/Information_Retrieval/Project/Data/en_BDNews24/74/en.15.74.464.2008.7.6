 BAGHDAD, Sun Jul 6, (bdvnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb killed six civilians and wounded 14 other people in the Shaab district of northern Baghdad on Sunday, police said. One woman was among the dead while three policemen were wounded in the attack, which targeted a police patrol. The bombing comes at what has otherwise been a relative lull in violence in the Iraqi capital. Violence in Iraq has dropped to four-year lows, which US officials credit to a surge in US troops last year, a rebellion by Sunni Arab tribal leaders against al Qaeda and a ceasefire by anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Numbers from the Health Ministry showed 448 civilians were killed in June in Iraq, from 505 May. The May figure was down from 968 civilian deaths in April, a month when fighting spiraled between Shi'ite militias and security forces
