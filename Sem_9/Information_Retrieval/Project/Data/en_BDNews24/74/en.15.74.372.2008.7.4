 Narsingdi, July 4 (bdnews24.com)Five women of one family and their driver were killed when a train hit their car at Baribari rail crossing near Ghorashal station on the Dhaka-Chittagong rail route Friday. Quazi Asadullah, Bangladesh Railway's additional director general (operations), told bdnews24.com that the dead were identified as Rokeya Begum (45), wife of Haji Rezaul Ahmed of Madhya Kamargaon in Munshiganj, their daughter Eti (12), Samorthon Begum (40), Jiria Begum (60) Saleha Begum (50) and driver Yunus (30). He said a seventh accident victim Asma Begum (15) survived. Ghorashal police outpost in-charge, Abul Bashar said that the Dhaka bound Mohanagar Express hit the car at around 1pm as there was no gate at the unauthorised, unguarded rail crossing. He said that the car's passengers were travelling to the house of Rokeya Begum's elder daughter. The police officer said that Rokeya, her two sisters-in-law and driver Yunus died on the spot. Eti and Asma were admitted to Palash Health Complex, where Eti died. Asma has been transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Police recovered the bodies and sent them to Narsingdi Sadar Hospital for autopsy. Railway divisional traffic officer for Dhaka, Syed Abdul Mukit told bdnews24.com: "It was not an authorised level crossing. The Narsingdi district council made the rail gate without the approval of the railway authorities." He said since the rail gate was not approved by the authorities, there was no gate keeper to control traffic while the trains crossed. A case has been filed in this connection. bdnews24.com/co
