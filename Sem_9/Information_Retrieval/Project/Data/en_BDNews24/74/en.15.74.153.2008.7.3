 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)--Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has stressed the need for industrialised nations to provide climate adaptation funds for developing countries, the worst victims of climate change, "without any conditions". Inaugurating the first ever 'SAARC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change' in Dhaka, he also called on richer nations to transfer better technology so that developing countries can progress toward climate resiliency. "The industrialised economies must provide adaptation funds and facilitate technology transfer without any conditionality," Fakhruddin said. He added that developed nations, the polluters, had an unshakeable responsibility to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the cause of global warming, within the stipulated time frames. The SAARC climate conference is being held in response to a proposal by Dhaka, as it is feared that a huge portion of Bangladesh's landmass will be inundated owing to rising sea levels caused by global warming. The meeting is expected to adopt a common declaration on action for confronting climate change that will in one way or another affect the entire SAARC region, comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The whole of the Maldives island chain also faces inundation by rising sea levels. "SAARC countries should speak with one voice to ensure that developed countries commit new and additional resources to support our adaptation efforts," Fakhruddin said. The chief adviser announced that Bangladesh was trying to establish an international climate adaption centre to share knowledge and best practices. "The developed countries must make unilateral and unconditional commitment to reduce their emission levels. This is a must to save us from the perils of climate change," he said. Fakhruddin said climate change would cost millions of poor people their livelihoods and intensify the havoc of floods, droughts and salinity. "It will unleash the gravest tragedy in human history, far graver than the 'Black Death' or the atrocities of World War II." "We cannot, and must not, sit idle and let this happen," he said. Echoing the chief adviser, SAARC Secretary-General Sheel Kant Sharma told the meeting: "SAARC believes that the way forward must include, among others, binding greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments by developed countries with effective timeframes." Presided over by the chief adviser's special assistant for environment Devasish Roy, the inauguration was also addressed by foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. bdne
