<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad said Saturday the election would prove his party still retained its dignity as it did in the past. The objective of the Jatiya Party was to go to power in the next election, the former president said. But it would, however, not be the kind of power witnessed in the past 17 years that he termed was tainted by looting. "Political leaders stuffed their pockets with state money, created anarchy, boycotted parliament and engaged in killings," Ershad alleged. Ershad's remarks came at a meeting of Jatiya Party representatives of greater Rajshahi at the Rajshahi Zila Parishad auditorium. The former president further said honest politicians had been blemished by the activities of some. "They have no dominance now." "If my party assumes power, it will make those who filled their own pockets through looting and building houses abroad account for their misdeeds," Ershad said. The former military dictator pledged efforts to bring back laundered money from abroad. Resenting a lack of gas supply through pipeline to Rajshahi, Ershad said: "If my party goes to power, it will supply gas to the northern region, set up mills and factories and create scope for employment on a large scale." Ershad backed the government on holding local government and upazila elections before national polls. The JP chairman hoped his party would win the majority of seats in upazila elections. bdnews
