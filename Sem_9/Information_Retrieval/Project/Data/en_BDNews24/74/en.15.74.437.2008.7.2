 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin Wednesday said that they were looking for European coaches for the national and the youth teams. "We are looking for European coaches for the national and the youth teams and I requested AFC general secretary Dato Paul Moni to find out some European coaches for the BFF," Salahuddin told reporters on his return after attending the AFC audit committee meeting in Malaysia. The football star said that the federation would appoint the coaches if they could afford to pay them. The BFF boss had also requested Paul Moni to find a technical director for the BFF and Moni suggested that he (Salahuddin) rope in Englishman Richard Benz. "Moni will inform me whether Benz is available and interested for Bangladesh," said the BFF boss. Salahuddin also said that the newly recruited BFF employees would be sent to Malaysia for professional training and the AFC would train them at its own coast. AFC vice president Monilal Fernando is scheduled to arrive in Bangladesh on July 16 to see the development of the astro-turf to be laid adjacent to the BFF house, known as 'Balur Math,' under the supervision of the AFC.
