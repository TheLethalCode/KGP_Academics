<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  National cricket captain Mohammad Ashraful expressed mixed feelings over Bangladesh's performance in the 2008 Asia Cup, after the team's return from Pakistan on Sunday. "We performed both well and badly in the tournament," Ashraful told reporters on the Tigers' arrival at Zia International Airport. "We played better in the first four matches and, except the last match against Pakistan, you can't say that our batting performance was a bad one," said the national team captain. Bangladesh were bundled out by Pakistan for just 115 runs, on a batting-friendly pitch in Karachi. It was the tournament's lowest total for a team choosing to bat first. "It was a pretty good batting wicket and it was disappointing for us to be all out for just 115 runsand I want to say that we played very bad that day," said the top-order batsman, who played an 18-ball 14 in the match. Bangladesh had racked up an impressive 283 against India, earlier in the tournament, riding on a swashbuckling century from middle order batsman Alok Kapali. They also scored their second highest total of 300/8 against United Arab Emirates in the tournament opener, with Ashraful striking a scintillating 109 off 124 balls. Coach Jamie Siddons, speaking alongside the team captain, emphasised the need for consistent play. "It is very important to play consistently instead of winning one or two games in a year, and the team did achieve even play except for the last game," the Australian coach told reporters at the airport. "We basically improved our batting in the tournament, with Rokibul Hasan scoring in every match and Alok Kapali came back with a fine century," said Siddons. Evaluating his own performance, Ashraful said he had a fine start, striking a century against UAE, but failed to keep the momentum during the latter stages of the tournament. bd
