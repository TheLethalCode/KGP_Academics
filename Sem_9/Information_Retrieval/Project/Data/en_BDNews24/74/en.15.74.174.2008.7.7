A suicide car bomber rammed two diplomatic vehicles entering the Indian Embassy in Kabul, killing 41 people and wounding 141, Afghan authorities said. "We condemn this needless act of violence, and offer our sincere condolences to those injured and especially to those families who lost loved ones," White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. "Extremists continue to show their disregard for all human life and their willingness to kill fellow Muslims as well as others," he said. "The United States stands with the people of Afghanistan and India, as we face this common enemy." President George W Bush is in Japan attending the G8 summit
