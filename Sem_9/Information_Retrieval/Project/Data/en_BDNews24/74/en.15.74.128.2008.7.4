 LONDON, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer sauntered into the men's singles final at Wimbledon on Friday with a 6-3 7-6 6-4 defeat of outclassed Russian Marat Safin. The Swiss world number one is now just one step away from a sixth consecutive Wimbledon title which would surpass the five in a row achieved by Bjorn Borg from 1976-80. Federer came to Wimbledon with questions being asked about his dominance of the sport but after winning all 18 sets he has contested here this year he appears in a class of his own, especially on the All England Club lawns. Should Rafael Nadal beat seasoned German Rainer Schuettler later on Friday, Federer will face the Spaniard for the third consecutive year in the final hoping for revenge for his recent thrashing in the French Open final. "People can say what they like," Federer said in reference to the doubters before the tournament. "I was a bit surprised how intense it was. Don't write me off too quickly though because this is my part of the season now Wimbledon, Olympics and the U.S. Open. "It's a beautiful feeling, I've got the opportunity to win the title again." BEATEN MAN From the moment former world number one Safin, appearing in his first Wimbledon semi-final at the age of 28, surrendered his opening service game he lumbered around Centre Court with the world-weary expression of a beaten man. With defeat looming at 4-5 in the third set Safin's patience snapped and he smashed his racket into a courtside chair, although it was one of the few moments of true aggression he managed during a disappointing, one-sided affair. Those hoping for a repetition of Safin's amazing victory over Federer in the semi-final of the 2005 Australian Open were disappointed. Once Federer achieved the early break he spent the rest of the match in cruise control. Despite saving two break points at 1-2 and twice serving to stay in the second set, the majestic Swiss was totally unflustered. Safin's only hope was to edge the second set tiebreak but instead of the fight he had displayed in his previous rounds he merely produced a string of careless errors. Federer served an ace to clinch a two-set lead and cruised through the third set before moving through the gears to break Safin's final service game, clinching victory with a rolled backhand low over the net
