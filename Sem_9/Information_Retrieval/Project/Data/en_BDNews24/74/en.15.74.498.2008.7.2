<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)  Former AL minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim's lawyers Wednesday petitioned a Dhaka court for granting bail to their client detained in an extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. After hearing both prosecution and defence sides, the court set July 13 for an order on the bail petition. Special sessions judge Md Ashraf Hossain set July 13 to give his decision on the matter. Also, the court was scheduled to pass an order on exempting former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from court appearance Wednesday. No order was passed. Simultaneously, the date for recording the complainant Azam J Chowdhury's testimony was also fixed. The court said it would pass an order on the matter on July 13. Advocate Sahara Khatun represented the Awami League president in court. Advocates Sahara Khatun and Syed Rezaur Rahman represented Selim during the hearing. The lawyers said their client was ill and needed proper medical treatment. Selim would comply with all the conditions if granted bail, they added. Besides, they pleaded that Selim had no involvement in the case which had been filed to serve "some political purpose". Prosecution lawyer Syed Shamim Ahsan opposed the bail prayer. On June 15, metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque sent the case to the special judge's court-5. The High Court on Feb 6 cancelled the extortion case, filed by Azam J Chowdhury, declaring illegal the inclusion of the case under emergency powers rules. The Appellate Division has since overruled the High Court order cancelling the case, allowing it to proceed in trial court. The case alleges the accused extorted around Tk 3 crore from the businessman in return for awarding a deal on a power plant project during Hasina's term as prime minister. The AL chief was arrested at her Dhanmondi home on July 16, and was shown arrested in the case that was included under EPR the same day. Hasina has already been exempted from personal appearances in four separate graft cases against her, as she seeks medical treatment overseas. The government on June 11 issued a temporary release order for the AL president allowing her to go abroad. She went to the US the next day. bdnews24
