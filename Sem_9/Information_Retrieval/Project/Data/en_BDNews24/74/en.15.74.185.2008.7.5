 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)Liberal Democratic Party president retired Col Oli Ahmed said Saturday that government dialogue in districts with local representatives was part of "political agenda". Oli alleged that the promises made by advisers did not match their deeds. "Although this government has many achievements, they have lost people's confidence. They have failed to contain the prices of commodities." Speaking as the chief guest at a LDP meeting at Magura Press Club, Oli urged the government to hold elections soon and transfer power to elected representatives. The LDP chief also advised holding upazila and Jatiya Sangsad elections on the same day to cut government spending. "BNP came to power with a one-third majority and engaged in corruption and plundering. Khaleda Zia and her family members are in jail because they were surrounded by sycophants and corrupt people," Oli alleged. District LDP president Md Altaf Hossain presided over the meeting. bdnews2
