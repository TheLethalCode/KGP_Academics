 KABUL, Wed Jul 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A helicopter belonging to US-led coalition troops was shot down by small-arms fire south of the Afghan capital on Wednesday, but there were no serious injuries to those on board, the US military said. The pilots landed the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter safely and evacuated all personnel before it caught fire in the Kharwar district of Logar province, where Taliban militants are known to be active.

International troops rely heavily on aircraft to transport troops and supplies around the rugged mountainous country. Elsewhere, a suicide car bomber hit a convoy of NATO forces on Wednesday, wounding two Canadian soldiers, three policemen and two civilians on a road near the southern town of Spin Boldak which lies on the border with Pakistan, said border police commander Abdul Razaq. Afghanistan has seen a rise in violence this year, despite the increased presence of foreign troops, now numbering more than 70,000. The austere Islamist Taliban have vowed to step up their campaign of guerrilla, suicide and roadside bomb attacks this year to undermine Afghan support for the government in Kabul and pressure foreign troops into pulling out
