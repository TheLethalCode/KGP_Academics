<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will ask the government in the July 3 dialogue to hold national polls ahead of upazila polls, a party leader said Monday. After an AL meeting with Workers Party, acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that the party in talks with the government would make a number of demands, including withdrawal of the state of emergency. The party will also demand that the redrawing of parliament constituencies be postponed for the next polls. On the nomination of candidates for the polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities, the AL leader said: "We believe the non-communal forces should take part in the polls in a group." Workers Party general secretary Bimal Biswas, who attended the meeting, said the emergency rule should not exist for long. He also opposed the upazila polls ahead of national polls. He accused the caretaker government of trying to establish a controlled democratic system in the country. The dialogue between the government and the AL has been timed to coincide with the deadline for the submission of nomination papers for the elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities. In an early announcement, the AL backed the polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities despite its demand to hold national polls ahead of local government polls. Asked if the AL would accept upazila polls the way it had accepted the city and municipal polls, Ashraful said: "These polls will work as a test-case for us. It does not mean all polls will be a test case for us." AL presidium members Tofail Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, Motia Chowdhury and Ataur Rahman Kaiser were present at the meeting. AL will hold meetings with Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu), Samyabadi Dal, Ganotantri Party on Tuesday, with National Awami Party, Gano Azadi League and Communist Kendra on Wednesday. WP president Rashed Khan Menon led the delegation to the meeting with the AL. bdn
