<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Biplobi Workers Party of Bangladesh, a faction of WPB, have demanded the publication of a white paper on the past 18 months of rule by the present caretaker government. The demand was made in a proposal adopted at a meeting of the party's central committee Friday. The proposal said a white paper was needed to make the government's moral stand clear as corruption has continued to spread during this government. It said there was no chance for the real representatives of people to be elected in the election as there was no possibility of a free and fair election. No honest people would be able to be elected in the local government polls either, the proposal said. The party demanded a change of the present electoral system to ensure the polls would be free of the influence of black money. bdnew
