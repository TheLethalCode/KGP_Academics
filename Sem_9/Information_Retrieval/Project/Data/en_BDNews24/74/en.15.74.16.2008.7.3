<TITLE> Four-party alliance will boycott local polls: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Thursday that the four-party alliance would not join the upcoming local government elections. "The four-party alliance has decided not to participate in the local government polls as the government did not accept its five-point demands," the secretary general of the divided party told reporters in his NAM flat. The five-point demands include the release of all political detainees including Khaleda Zia and Motiur Rahman Nizami, sending Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco abroad for better medical treatment and scrapping the local government polls schedule, holding national elections ahead of all polls. "If anybody defies the boycott decision and takes part in the election, he will face action," Delwar said after breaking a token hunger strike by Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal leaders and workers. "Holding elections is a blueprint of the government," Delwar alleged. On the government's dialogue with the Awami League, the BNP leader said: "The caretaker government has taken over in liaison with the Awami League." "If the government wants to hold dialogue with us, it will have to release chairperson Khaleda Zia. We want freedom for Khaleda Zia and Motiur Rahman Nizami to make dialogue meaningful." "Apart from that, we have other demands. We can sit with the government if our demands are met," he said. The BNP leader expressed concern over the hike in fuel prices. "The hike will increase people's sufferings. Rising food prices have already put them in trouble." "The increase in fuel prices will leave an adverse impact on the economy." bdnew
