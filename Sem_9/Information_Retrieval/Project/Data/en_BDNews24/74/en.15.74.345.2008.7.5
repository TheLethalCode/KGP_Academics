 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League wants a successful dialogue and an acceptable election, joined by all political parties, a party leader said Saturday. "We want to cooperate with the government and the Election Commission for a proper election with neither compromise nor liaison," AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed told a meeting of Jubo League's Dhaka district representatives. Tofail urged the government to lift the state of emergency. "A free, fair and acceptable election is not possible amid the state of emergency." To the policymakers of the government, Tofail said: "You should not do anything that compels the politicians to confront you." Tofail underscored the need to lift the emergency rule to pave the way for all political parties to take part in the elections. "If the emergency is lifted all parties will join in." All parties, including his, opposed local government polls prior to parliamentary elections. On the government dialogue with the political parties, Tofail said: "If the government works according to its wishes even after holding talks with the political parties, why should we go to dialogue?" Among others, Dhaka district Jubo League president Shafiul Alam, AL organising secretary Abdul Mannan and office secretary advocate Abdul Mannan also spoke. bdnews
