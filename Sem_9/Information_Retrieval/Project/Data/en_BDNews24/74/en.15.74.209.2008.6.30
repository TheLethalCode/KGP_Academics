 SRINAGAR, Mon Jun 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Muslim protesters angry at transfer of land to a Hindu shrine trust in Kashmir rioted with police and shut down the region for the eighth day on Monday, even after authorities said the decision would be revoked. In some of the biggest protests since a separatist revolt broke out in 1989, Kashmiris protested the transfer of about 100 acres to a Hindu trust to erect temporary shelters for thousands of Hindu pilgrims annually trekking to a mountain shrine. They said the move was a conspiracy to change the demography of mainly Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state. A week of protests, in which four people were shot dead by police, led the state government to say the land move would be revoked. But protesters say they would not stop until they saw the written order. "I appeal to people to continue peaceful protests till government revokes the order," Kashmir's senior hard line separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani said before leading a protest in downtown Srinagar. Shops, businesses, schools and government offices remained closed across the Kashmir valley, police said. Ghulam Nabi Azad, the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, has not given a timeframe for revoking the decision. But Hindus in Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir where Hindus are in a majority, protested the government's "back down" and carried out a strike. PAKISTAN PROTEST Nearly 300 people including political activists, lawyers and students, staged a demonstration in Muzaffarabad, the main city in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, to express solidarity with the Muslim protesters in Indian Kashmir. "Down with India", "India quit Kashmir," protesters shouted near the U.N. military observer's office. India and Pakistan, who have fought wars over Kashmir, claim the region in full but rule in parts. A key partner in Kashmir's ruling coalition, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), withdrew its support on weekend over the land transfer. More than 43,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in nearly two decades of insurgency, officials say. Human rights groups put the toll at about 60,000 dead or missing. During the pilgrimage, thousands of devout Hindus from across India walk and ride ponies to the cave, situated at an altitude of 3,800 metres, to pray by an ice stalagmite they believe is a symbol of Hindu god Lord Shiva
