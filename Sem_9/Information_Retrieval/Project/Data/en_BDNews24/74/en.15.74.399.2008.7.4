<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  The medical treatment sought by Sheikh Hasina in the US may not be complete by the time her eight-week release period is over, her personal physician Prof Syed Modasser Ali said Friday. US doctors treating the former prime minister are quite sure that she is at risk of permanent hearing loss in her right ear, Prof Modasser said, briefing the press at Mujibunnesa Eye Hospital in Dhanmondi. "Doctors have implanted a hearing aid in her right ear, which needs to be kept under observation," the doctor said. The Awami League president is soon due to fly from Canada to London. "It will also become clearer after being on a plane if her hearing aid is working properly," he added. Modasser also said doctors feared the damage to her left eye due to glaucoma was serious but they could not measure the extent of damage. "The doctors fear serious damage to her left eye. But the problem with her right eye could be healed," ophthalmologist Modasser said. He blamed her eye and ear damage on the failure of timely treatment. "These ailments have also led to problems with her heart," the doctor said. Hasina can be healthy, with a good quality of life, if she continues with the type of treatment she is now receiving, he added. "I have been in contact with Sheikh Hasina and her doctors regularly. Examination of her health may not be complete until the end of August, so her treatment will not be over within the eight-week period," her physician said. Hasina may be able to come back home by the end of August, if she is not diagnosed with any other major problem, he told the press briefing. Prof Modasser added that American doctors had so far not found any other complaints other than those identified by her Bangladeshi doctors. Hasina reached Toronto on June 26. Her special assistant Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com by telephone on that day that her ear was in a worse condition than previously thought when she had her ear examined in Orlando, Florida. The hearing aid implanted in her right ear was removed after it became inoperative. "She may need ear surgery and to remain under observation," the personal assistant had said. Hasina left Dhaka on June 12 for the US after the government granted the detained former prime minister a temporary release order for eight weeks on medical grounds. bdnews
