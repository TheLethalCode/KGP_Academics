<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The condition of Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim worsened as the area of haemorrhage, which caused his original stroke, spread further, said a spokesman for LabAid Specialised Hospital Sunday. AKM Mahbubul Hoque, head of the hospital's medical services, told reporters that a magnetic resonance imaging test had confirmed "internal bleeding". Explaining the cause of further bleeding, Hoque said "psychological pressure might cause further bleeding". Asked if there is a chance of full recovery for the former home minister, the Hoque said: "The paralysed part of the patient's body hardly returns to normal, but Mohammad Nasim has been receiving the treatment of international standards." The former minister was admitted to the hospital on June 24 after he suffered a stroke in Kashimpur jail in Gazipur. The stroke paralysed the left side of his body. Joint forces arrested Nasim on Feb 4 last year on charges of corruption. A Dhaka court has convicted the former minister of amassing illegal wealth and sentenced him to 13 years in jail. Nasim's relatives had earlier appealed to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed seeking permission to send Nasim to abroad for better medical treatment overseas. bdnews
