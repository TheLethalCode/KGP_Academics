 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has taken punitive action against its 28 staffers on charges of corruption, misbehaviour and breaches of discipline, an official said Monday. Two deputy directors, one deputy assistant director and six assistant directors are among those who have faced action, said ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal in a news briefing. Cases and "departmental" cases have been filed against five people, departmental cases against six and fresh probes opened into allegations against three. One official was warned of future action and eight have been put on close watch, Iqbal said. The commission's internal anticorruption committee decided to take fresh moves after allegations were not proved beyond doubt, he said. The commission has decided to sue two officials named Nizamuddin and Abdur Rahman, Iqbal said. "Cases may be field against them any moment." The ACC has decided to put its staff on round-the-clock observation. "If anybody is accused he will not be spared." bdnew
