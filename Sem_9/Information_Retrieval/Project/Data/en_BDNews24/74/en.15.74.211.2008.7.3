<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  Inflation is the main source of anxiety for finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. It poses the biggest challenge to the economy, the adviser said Thursday. Mirza Aziz referred to the International Monetary Fund that had also expressed concern over inflation in Bangladesh. IMF called for the government to follow a contractionary monetary policy. In the new budget, the inflation rate has been fixed at 9 percent on an average, below the double-digit rate that continued through much of the last fiscal year. Asked whether it would be possible to keep inflation at 9 percent in fiscal 2008-09, the adviser said: "Much depends on the international market situation. We will continue our efforts." Apparently after an IMF prescription, the central bank in the middle of last year took to the contractionary policy and faced wide criticism. Trade bodies including the FBCCI and economists severely criticised the central bank's monetary policy. Bangladesh Bank later backtracked. "Inflation cannot be controlled by local or internal measures." "India increased the rate of interests on bank loans three times in the last few months, but could not control inflation," Mirza Aziz told reporters after a meeting with a visiting IMF delegation at the finance ministry Thursday. IMF adviser for the Asia and Pacific Department Thomas R Rumbaugh led the five-member mission visiting Bangladesh from July 2 to July 15. "The meeting discussed the overall economic situation of the country. The IMF delegation expressed satisfaction over our present economic situation, except inflation. "They expressed concern over inflation and also discussed the target of revenue collections in the new fiscal year." Mirza Aziz said: "The IMF delegation has advised contractionary monetary policy to control inflation. But I differed with them and said inflation cannot be controlled through any internal measure or steps." "Inflation now depends on the international market situation. If the prices of fuel, food, commodities and fertiliser increase in the world market, in a country like ours, inflation cannot be controlled." "I have told the IMF delegation we cannot adopt such a monetary policy for now that can hamper production. They said the loan outflow into the private sector has increased. Its impact is being felt on inflation," the adviser said. "IMF told us to take necessary steps to make the share market buoyant. In this regard, I have told them that we are trying to infuse dynamism into the share market," said Mirza Aziz. The adviser said the IMF delegation praised the new budget for being investment and business-friendly. "IMF has also lauded social security measures in the budget." bdnews
