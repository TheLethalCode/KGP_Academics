 WASHINGTON, Thu Jul 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Bank President Robert Zoellick on Wednesday urged swift action from Group of Eight industrial nations and major oil producers to address a worsening global food and energy crisis pushing more of the world's people into poverty and destabilizing economies. "We are entering a danger zone," Zoellick wrote in a July 1 letter to Japan's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who is chairing the G8 summit next week in Hokkaido. "What we are witnessing is not a natural disaster -- a silent tsunami or a perfect storm. It is a man-made catastrophe and as such must be fixed by people," he said in the letter, which was copied to leaders of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Britain and the United Nations. For the first time since 1973, Zoellick said countries were being hit by a combination of record oil and food prices, threatening more countries with rising poverty and social instability. Food riots have already occurred in some 30 countries and unrest over high fuel prices is spreading. Ahead of the G8 summit in Japan on July 7-9, Zoellick said $10 billion will be needed for emergency food aid and to help countries deal with the double impact of rising food and fuel prices. The combined effects of rising food and fuel prices in 41 countries -- such those imposed by India and China on rice, or by Argentina, Kazakhstan and Russia on wheat -- have contributed to rising prices and food shortages. "These numbers translate into broken lives and stunted potential," Zoellick said. World Bank assessments in another 50 countries estimate that about $3.5 billion will be needed for social programs that target the poor and to distribute seeds and fertilizers to farmers to help boost farm production, he said
