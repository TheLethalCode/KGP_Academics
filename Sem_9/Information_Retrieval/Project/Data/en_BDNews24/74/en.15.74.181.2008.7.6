 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet altered the new truth commission law on Sunday, a government spokesman said. In an alteration to the text of the Voluntary Disclosure Ordinance 2008, the words 'armed forces' have been replaced with 'defence force', the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said after a cabinet meeting. According to the ordinance, approved on May 25, army officers with the minimum rank of major general can become members of the commission. Munaim did not specify what other, if any, changes were made to the ordinance at Sunday's cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The new law is designed to create a Truth and Accountability Commission with scope for leniency to individuals, including businessmen, making voluntary disclosures of graft. It is meant to help eradicate corruption and further economic development at the same time. The commission will have the power to confiscate property earned by illegal means by those found guilty. Munaim said the commission's task will be to conduct investigations into confessions of corrupt practices. If they are found true, individuals will have to hand over ill-gotten gains to the commission. If an individual fails to hand over their illegal assets to the commission by a given deadline, they will face five years in jail. Those accused of giving false statements to the commission will be fined and may also have to serve jail time in addition to the fine. Anyone accused in cases related to arms, narcotics, rape, or human trafficking will be barred from availing themselves of the truth commission's 'leniency'. The Truth and Accountability Commission will send a list of people who confess to crimes to the Election Commission. Munaim also said the government extended the time for unqualified teachers of registered non-government primary schools to take qualification tests to Dec 31. The decision was taken as tests could not be held due to a court order, the press secretary said. The teachers will continue receiving government grants. Munaim said the cabinet also approved the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) Ordinance 1990 (amendment), transforming DESA into the Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited or DPDC. The DPDC started operating on July 1. The press secretary said the advisers also discussed the industrial companies in Bhawal National Park, with the cabinet sending a proposal on the matter to the environment ministry for further review. bdnews24.co
