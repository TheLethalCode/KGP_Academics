<TITLE> Germany need more quality to get back on title trail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany performed as well as anyone could have hoped by reaching the Euro 2008 final but until coach Joachim Loew finds a little more quality they are unlikely to win their first major title since 1996. Germany's 1-0 defeat by Spain in Sunday's final in Vienna was frustrating in many ways. Loew's side were comprehensively outplayed by a much more skilful team, as those traditional German virtues the players talked about throughout the tournament proved insufficient to bring them a fourth European crown. They kept running, kept trying, kept hoping but their poorer technique was ruthlessly exposed by superior opponents. "We know what we can do and what our strengths are and we'll keep working on improving," Loew told reporters after the final. "The team did a great job all in all but unfortunately we lost. We just have to accept it." Loew, of course, must do more than just accept it as he looks ahead to the start of the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. One of the most pressing questions concerns 38-year-old goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, who has yet to make a decision on his international future. Lehmann played well in the final but made several clear mistakes in previous games and it must now be time to trust in a new generation of keepers typified by Rene Adler, the brilliant 23-year-old who did not get a game here. DEFENSIVE OPTIONS In defence, it is also time Loew had a look at alternatives to Per Mertesacker and Christoph Metzelder at centre-back, who were shown up in the final by Spain's quicker, more alert lone striker Fernando Torres, scorer of the only goal. At the age of 31, captain Michael Ballack still has more to offerhe was outstanding in the quarter-final win over Portugal and scored a great free-kick against Austriabut he needs more creativity around him. Torsten Frings, Simon Rolfes and Thomas Hitzlsperger were all tried in the centre of midfield but none of them had much of an impact going forward. There were good performances from Lukas Podolski, who successfully reinvented himself as a left midfielder and still managed to score three goals, and Bastian Schweinsteiger on the other flank. Miroslav Klose also improved as the tournament went on but fellow striker Mario Gomez had a nightmare of a tournament and will have to show great character to recapture his form. Loew's regret might be not including two skilful young players in his final squad for the tournament. Marko Marin, a tricky winger, and Patrick Helmes, a gifted striker, failed to make the cut when the squad was trimmed to 23. Instead, old favourites Kevin Kuranyi and David Odonkor were taken along, neither of whom contributed much. Loew can call on talented players but he must have the confidence to use them if Germany are to challenge again at the next World Cup
