<TITLE> HC grants bail to Khoka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday granted bail to Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka and stayed the proceedings of a graft case against him, filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The bail order will remain effective until July 16. Khoka appealed to the HC bench of Sharif Uddin Chaklader and Imdadul Haque shortly after a trial court issued an arrest warrant against him. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque had earlier issued the arrest order. The court had approved the warrant after accepting a chargesheet submitted by the ACC against Khoka, his wife and children. The court set July 10 to submit reports on the arrest. The ACC charged the mayor on July 1, for earnings beyond his known income and concealing wealth-related information. A lawyer for Khoka's wife, Ismat Ara, asked the court Monday for a reinvestigation into the case claiming that the ACC's chargesheet was faulty and incomplete. The court rejected the plea, but ordered a halt to the charges against Ismat Ara due to a stay order by the High Court. Defence lawyers also asked for Khoka's daughter Sarika Sadek and son Israk Hossain to be exempted of charges. ACC assistant director Md Shamsul Alam filed the case with Ramna Police Station on April 2 against Khoka, his wife and children. bdnews24.com/at
