 JERUSALEM, Wed Jul 2(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Palestinian rammed a bulldozer into an Israeli commuter bus, cars and pedestrians on one of Jerusalem's busiest streets on Wednesday, killing at least three people and wounding dozens, emergency services said. Police said the driver of the bulldozer was shot dead by police and a soldier who climbed onto the vehicle. Television footage after the attack showed the highway construction vehicle being pursued by several men, at least one of them in civilian clothes and pointing a pistol. Some of them then crowded into the cab, where a struggle appeared to ensue. "A bulldozer driven by an Arab went on a rampage on Jaffa Road, hitting pedestrians, buses and cars," police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said. The Zaka emergency service said at least three people were killed by the bulldozer and more than 20 people injured. It identified the driver as a Palestinian resident of Arab East Jerusalem. It was the first Arab attack in Jewish west Jerusalem since a gunman killed eight students in a religious school in March. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, nearly two weeks into a ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas Islamist group in the Gaza Strip. Emergency vehicles rushed to Jaffa Road after the mid-day attack, where a commuter bus, its side slashed by the bulldozer, stood on its side. Jerusalem's light railway is being built along the route
