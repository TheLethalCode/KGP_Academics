 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday the government had taken steps to face key challenges in the fiscal 2008-09 budget. "There are two main challenges before the government to implement the budget. One is the target to increase revenue collections and the other is the government's step to implement the budget pledges," the adviser told reporters at Bangabhaban after President Iajuddin Ahmed approved the budget. Mirza Aziz said implementation of the budget would be possible as less duty would attract investors and create more jobs. "Some changes have been brought to the proposed budget." Expenditure increased slightly as allowances for destitute and war-wounded freedom fighters were raised. Community schoolteachers will earn more thanks to 20 percent dearness allowances, the adviser said. Besides, the tax-free income limit was hiked to Tk 1.65 lakh from Tk 1.5 lakh. bd
