 Dhaka, July 2 (bdnews24.com)Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi says foreign investors are showing increased interest in the country's capital market. The capital market needs more institutional investors as they bring in "stability", said Siddiqi in his speech as the chief guest Tuesday at the launch of the country's fourth asset management company, LR Global Bangladesh. LR Global Bangladesh is a subsidiary of US-based investment firm LR Global, focusing on developing markets. The company plans to launch a mutual fund worth Tk 100 crore this year. Founded in 1997 by LR Global Partners and the Rockefeller family, LR Global has $449 million assets under management and runs offices in New York, Hong Kong, Hanoi and Phnom Penh. "The launch of LR Global Bangladesh is a testimony to foreign fund managers' renewed interest in Bangladesh capital market," Siddiqi said. On the market's current situation, Siddiqi said it was overpriced mainly due to a "demand and supply mismatch". "We don't want to see investors take positions on stocks based on rumours without considering the underlying fundamentals. A large number of new investors lack experience," he said. The SEC and the stock exchanges, he said, are running awareness programmes to educate investors. Bangladesh Enterprise Institute president Farooq Sobhan attended the ceremony as the guest of honour. Principal of LR Global William L Asmundson, LR Global Bangladesh chairman Don LaGuardia and director Saiful Islam also spoke. From a modest initial investment, Don LaGuirdia said, LR Global has grown to almost $450 million, relying heavily on a network of in-country partners and contacts to help identify special opportunities in Central and Southeast Asian and African markets. "Of which, Bangladesh is amongst the most promising." Asmundson, former president and CEO of Rockefeller Company, said the company was enthusiastic about the long-term prospects of Bangladesh economy and both its equity and fixed income markets. Highlighting the substantial spending on power generation and other infrastructure projects to attract investments, the LR Global chief said the country's capital needs are greater than can be "funded locally". "Therefore, it is essential that a hospitable environment for foreign direct investments and remittances by Bangladesh citizens living abroad be maintained," he added. bdn
