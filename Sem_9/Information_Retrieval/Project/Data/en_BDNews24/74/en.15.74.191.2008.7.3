<TITLE> Medvedev vows new tone to policy after Putin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Wed Jul 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday his presidency would have a different tone from his predecessor and mentor Vladimir Putin's and hinted the Kremlin might consider easing its complete dominance over domestic politics. "The aims of Russia's development are not changing -- we want to create a developed country with a good, strong economy," Medvedev said in an interview with media outlets from Group of Eight countries before a G8 summit in Japan next week. "As to nuances, accents, then they of course change," he said in the interview, a transcript of which was published on the Kremlin's Internet site www.kremlin.ru. "The accents of internal and external policies will of course change." Investors in Russia's booming economy are watching for clues as to how Medvedev will mould his presidency and how he will work with Putin, 55, who has retained significant influence as prime minister. Medvedev said he favored more political competition, a hint the Kremlin may consider easing its dominance over the political system established under Putin, a former KGB spy. Market reformers, including former electricity boss Anatoly Chubais, have called for more political competition, saying the country will fall into Soviet-style stagnation without it. But Medvedev, a 42-year-old former corporate lawyer, said any competition must be "reasonable" and warned that turning Russia into a parliamentary democracy -- and so weakening presidential powers -- would be dangerous. "I consider that the creation of a parliamentary democracy on the territory of the Russian Federation would mean the death of Russia as a country," he said. "Russia for decades, perhaps for centuries, must remain a presidential republic to preserve a united state." RELATIONS WITH PUTIN That comment contrasted with past remarks by Putin, who has said the influence of parliament will grow. Putin controls the United Russia party, which has a majority in parliament. Medvedev was asked several times about his relations with Putin, who is still highly popular after presiding over the longest Russian economic boom for a generation. He brushed aside concerns that Kremlin intrigues could sour his relations with Putin, with whom he said he spoke sometimes several times a day and sometimes not at all. Once a university law lecturer, he said he had no illusions about the challenges facing him and that a Kremlin chief needed to work 24 hours a day. Medvedev, who has never before held elected office, said his years at the top levels of the Kremlin had prepared him for the job. He served as Kremlin chief-of-staff, first deputy prime minister and board chairman of state controlled gas giant Gazprom before his election in March as president. "There are people who you can consult with, Vladimir Putin among them; he is an experienced person, a very popular politician," Medvedev said. "But at the end of the day you still have to take the decision yourself. And if you are mistaken then you and only you are responsible.
