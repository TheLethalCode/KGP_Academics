 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday exempted BNP leader Tarique Rahman from personal appearance in the trial of a bribery case. Judge Shahed Nooruddin of the Special Court-3 set up in the Sangsad Bhaban area relieved Tarique of court appearance in the case that charges him with taking a bribe for a cover up involving the murder of Basundhara Group director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. The court set July 10 for proceedings to resume on charge framing in the case. Tarique was brought in an ambulance to the special court premises at about 12.30pm from the prison ward of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Hospital. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's eldest son was not taken out of the ambulance or produced in the courtroom due to his ailing condition. Tarique signed the plea for the exemption in the presence of both prosecution and defence lawyers. The application for exemption was submitted on June 25, the same day Tarique's younger brother Arafat Rahman Coco was exempted from personal appearance in the same court in the Gatco corruption case. As Sunday's proceedings started, Tarique's lawyers barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah, advocate Sanaullah Miah and advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder argued for Tarique's exemption from personal appearance during the trial on medical grounds. State counsel Syed Shamim Ahsan Habib told the court: "We have no objection to it. However, the application must contain the signature of the accused." Tarique's lawyer Sanaullah Miah argued: "The special court has earlier exempted accused persons from personal appearance without requiring their signature." But the state counsels pressed their case, saying the application would not be acceptable without the signature of the accused. The judge sent two lawyers each from the state and defence teams, asking them to bring Tarique's signature. They proceeded to the ambulance stationed outside the court premises where Tarique had remained, and returned his signature to the court. Two others accused in the case, former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar and Basundhara Group official Abu Sufian, were both present in court. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case on May 6 against eight persons, including Tarique and former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, on charges of covering up the alleged involvement of Safiat Sobhan Sanbir, son of Basundhara Group chairman Shah Alam, in the murder of Sabbir. Sabbir was killed on July 4, 2006; a murder case was filed with Gulshan Police Station on July 7. bdnews24.com/pc
