 KARACHI, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India qualified for the Asia Cup final after overhauling a victory target of 309 with six wickets to spare against Sri Lanka on Thursday. Half centuries from Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina and M.S. Dhoni took India, who made 310 for four in 46.5 overs, to victory and put hosts Pakistan out of contention. India now meet Sri Lanka again in the final on Sunday. "I think the pitches in this tournament have been very flat and there is nothing in it for the bowlers. Still while chasing a big total you need a good start which we have been getting," said India skipper Dhoni. India built on a rapid 92-run opening stand between Gambhir (68) and Virender Sehwag (42) in only 12 overs as they replied to Sri Lanka's 308 for eight. Even after Sehwag, who hit six fours and one six, and Gambhir were dismissed, Dhoni (67) and Suresh Raina (54) featured in a third wicket stand of 99 from 92 balls to maintain a winning pace. Raina escaped on 11 when substitute Jehan Mubarak put down a straight chance in the covers off Dilhara Fernando but thereafter batted with assurance in the company of Dhoni. Sri Lanka struck in the 36th over when Raina was run out by Sanath Jayasuriya and two overs later Dhoni was bowled by Muttiah Muralitharan. Yuvraj Singh was greeted with two bouncers by Thilan Mirando, one of which hit his helmet and went for a four, but he settled down to hit three fours and one six in his 36, sharing an unbroken stand of 57 with Rohit Sharma to secure victory. Earlier, Chamara Kapugedera, Mahela Jayawardene and Chamara Silva scored half centuries for Sri Lanka. "I think in a way with Pakistan eliminated from the final, it is good for India and Sri Lanka because Pakistan can be a very dangerous side in front of its home crowd," said Sri Lanka's skipper Jayawardene
