 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue Thursday sued former deputy minister Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu and ex-lawmaker MAH Selim on charges of dodging tax. Senior special judge Md Azizul Haque ordered jail warrants against the accused people, now behind bars, taking the cases into cognisance. Assistant tax commissioner Md Hafiz Al Asad filed the case against Dulu for submitting a flawed affidavit to the NBR, in which he allegedly concealed information about his income of Tk 3.04 crore earned from 2001-2002 to 2005-06 tax years. Another assistant tax commissioner, Md Maniruzzaman, filed a case against Selim, widely known as Silver Selim. Selim allegedly dodged Tk 9.37 crore in tax on the income of Tk 37.50 crore. bdnew
