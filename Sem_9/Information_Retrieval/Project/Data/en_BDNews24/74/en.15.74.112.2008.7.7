 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed left Dhaka Monday morning for Kuala Lumpur to for a D-8 summit to be held there. The 'Developing-8' is a grouping of 8 Islamic countries formed in 1997, comprising Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. Md Nurul Islam, security chief at Zia International Airport, told bdnews24.com Monday: "A Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight took off from ZIA at 10.45am for Kuala Lumpur with the chief adviser." Syed Fahim Munaim, the press secretary to the CA who's part of the CA's entourage said earlier that the chief adviser would be leading a 21-member Bangladesh delegation to the summit in the Malaysian capital. The press secretary told bdnews24.com that Fakhruddin would hold separate sideline meetings with the prime ministers of Pakistan and Malaysia and the president of Iran. The chief adviser is expected to deliver a speech at the summit on Tuesday (July 8), and return home the same night after the close of the summit. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury had already reached Kuala Lumpur and met with his Malaysian counterpart DR Rais Yatim, the press secretary said. This year's D-8 summit theme is 'Meeting Challenges through Innovative Cooperation', Munaim said. A 10-year D-8 roadmap based on economic cooperation may be made public as a summit declaration, he added. A government statement issued Sunday said three proposals forwarded by Bangladesh have been included in the draft D-8 declaration, embodying protection of migrant workers' rights, recognising climate change as a major threat to development and establishing a 'food bank' by alliance members. The declaration will be made public towards the close of the summit on July 8. bdnews24.co
