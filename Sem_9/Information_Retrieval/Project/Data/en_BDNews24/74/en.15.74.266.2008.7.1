 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Tue Jul 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An African summit divided over how to react to the widely condemned re-election of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, on Tuesday discussed a proposal for a national unity government, senior delegates said. The African summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh has been dominated by a deepening political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe, whose once prosperous economy is racked by the world's highest rate of hyper-inflation. Mugabe, who was addressing the final session of the meeting, attended the summit after being sworn in on Sunday following a one-candidate election that African monitors said was plagued by violence against the opposition and was not free and fair. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the poll because of the violence, which he said had killed 86 of his supporters in the Movement for Democratic Change. Summit delegates said earlier the leaders were divided between those who wanted a strong statement about Zimbabwe and others who were reluctant to publicly censure the veteran leader, who extended his 28-year rule in Friday's vote. The divisions looked likely to produce a resolution weaker than wanted by some nations after the election provoked unprecedented African criticism and widespread international condemnation. Senior delegates taking part in a closed-door session said the resolution being debated would pledge AU support for talks between Mugabe and Tsvangirai. It was submitted by a security troika of the AU, comprising Tanzania, Swaziland and Angola, which had called for the vote to be postponed. Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma, a member of the West and East African group most critical of Mugabe told BBC radio earlier: "The people of Zimbabwe have been denied their democratic rights. We should, in no uncertain terms, condemn what has happened." Koroma said the southern African group must engage Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who withdrew from the ballot because of attacks on his supporters, in talks leading to a transitional government and fresh elections. NO NEW MOMENTUM But prospects the summit would give major new momentum to moves to end the crisis seemed to be receding even before its scheduled end on Tuesday. Mugabe's spokesman rejected ideas being floated for a Kenyan-style power-sharing deal and MDC Secretary-Tendai Biti, who was jailed for two weeks before the vote, said there was no chance of negotiations after Mugabe ignored a flood of appeals to call off the election. Mugabe spokesman George Charamba told reporters: "Kenya is Kenya. Zimbabwe is Zimbabwe. We have our own history of evolving dialogue and resolving political impasses the Zimbabwean way. The Zimbabwean way, not the Kenyan way. Not at all." Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change dismissed a South African press report that regional mediator President Thabo Mbeki was close to brokering a unity government deal. Biti said the MDC had pursued dialogue before Friday's vote, but Mugabe's decision to go ahead "totally and completely exterminated any prospects of a negotiated settlement." He said there were no talks with Mugabe's ZANU-PF. Mugabe threatened before the summit to confront his critics and suggested he would point back at leaders who themselves were in power undemocratically. In a mark of the depth of divisions, Charamba accused Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga -- who has called for Mugabe to be expelled from the AU -- of having bloodstained hands from the crisis in his country, in which 1,500 people died. "Odinga's hands drip with blood, raw African blood. And that blood is not going to be cleansed by any amount of abuse of Zimbabwe. Not at all," he told reporters. Odinga joined a power-sharing government with President Mwai Kibaki under an AU-backed deal to end the Kenya crisis. Tsvangirai had called on the summit not to recognize the election. The MDC wants the summit to appoint an expanded mediating team in Zimbabwe and a permanent envoy to replace Mbeki. The South African leader has been mediating since last year but failed and is accused of being soft on Mugabe. Mugabe was sworn in for a new five-year term on Sunday after election authorities announced he had won more than 85 percent of a vote which three African monitoring groups said was unfair. Tsvangirai left the Dutch embassy in Harare on Tuesday after taking refuge for more than a week, the Dutch government said. The summit is unlikely to back a US push at the United Nations for sanctions against Mugabe, including an arms embargo. So far only Western powers have imposed financial and travel sanctions against the Zimbabwean leader and his top officials. China, which has long opposed UN sanctions, said on Tuesday Zimbabwe must solve its own problems and showed no eagerness to endorse the U.S. moves. The United Nations said Africa's credibility was at stake over Zimbabwe. UN Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro told reporters at the summit, the AU must get its act together. Charamba attacked Western nations who say Mugabe is an illegitimate leader. "They can go and hang. They can go to hang a million times. They have no claim on Zimbabwean politics.
