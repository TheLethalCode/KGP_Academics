Zheng, 24, made a dramatic improvement in the second set which reached 5-5, after an exchange of breaks in mid-set and the Chinese leading 40-30 on her serve when there was a second rain delay lasting 82 minutes. The set went into a tiebreak after Serena saved a break point in the 12th game. Serena set up match point with an ace then took it when Zheng double faulted.
