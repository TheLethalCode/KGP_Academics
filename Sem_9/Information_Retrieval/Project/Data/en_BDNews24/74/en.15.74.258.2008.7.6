 TOYAKO, Japan, Sun Jul 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush pledged on Sunday that Japan's concerns about North Korean abductions of its citizens would not be ignored even as Washington moved to ease sanctions against the communist country. Bush has begun easing restrictions on Pyongyang after it offered details of its nuclear weapons program, but the US leader made a pointed effort to show his support for Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda by mentioning the abduction issue first at a joint news conference. "I am aware that people want to make sure that the abduction issue is not ignored and that there are suspicions about whether or not the North Koreans will be fully forthcoming," said Bush, who arrived on Sunday for a G8 summit July 7-9. "The United States will not abandon you on this issue," he said, noting that the nuclear negotiations were a multi-step process and that there must be "action for action." The dispute over the fate of several individuals abducted to help train spies in Japan's language and culture is an emotional topic for many Japanese, as well as a major obstacle to establishing diplomatic ties between the two wary neighbors. After North Korea handed over the nuclear details last month, Bush began a 45-day process to remove Pyongyang from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. The decision sparked cries of outrage and anguish from the abductees' relatives, who fear chances of resolving the dispute are dimming, as well as charges by some Japanese media that the US-Japan alliance would suffer. Washington has been keen to reassure its closest Asian ally at every opportunity that it has not been abandoned
