 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked her party to work for victory in the national elections, according to an aide. "People know well who are responsible for the country's current situation. All have to work together to ensure the victory of the party so that the country don't face such situation in future," Hasina told AL leaders and activists based in Canada Saturday before leaving for London. "The country has plunged into a crisis because of nepotism, corruption and plundering of a group of people," Hasina was quoted by her personal assistant Hasan Mahmud as saying. Hasina went to the US on June 12 to seek better medical treatment after the government had allowed her temporary release. She went to Canada on June 26 to see her daughter. The former prime minister said: "When we were in power, we were concerned about nothing else but the interest of the country." "I don't fear anybody except Allah. I'm willing to accept any challenge for the countrymen." The AL chief asked people to be tough on corruption: "It will not be right to indulge in corruption as it is the enemy of the country and its people." Daughter Saima Wazed Putul, her husband and their children and local AL leaders and activists saw Hasina off at Toronto airport. Hasina is going to London to meet with her sister Sheikh Rehana. bdne
