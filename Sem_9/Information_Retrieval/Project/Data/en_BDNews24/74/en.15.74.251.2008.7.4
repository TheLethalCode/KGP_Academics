 TEHRAN (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will later on Friday give a response to a nuclear incentives offer made by six world powers last month, the country's chief nuclear negotiator was quoted as telling the European Union's top diplomat. State radio said Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, talked with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana by telephone. "The Islamic Republic of Iran's response to the letter by the foreign ministers of the six countries ... will be given today," Saeed was quoted as telling Solana. The offer of trade and other incentives proposed by the six -- the United States, China, Russia, Germany, Britain and France -- was presented to Iran by Solana on June 14 in a bid to resolve a long-running row over Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
