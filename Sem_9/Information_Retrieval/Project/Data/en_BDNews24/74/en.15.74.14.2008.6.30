<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)A court hearing on charge-framing in the Gatco graft case started Monday with a prosecution lawyer presenting the charges against the 16 accused, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia, in their presence. After Mosharraf Hossain Kajal, the prosecution lawyer, read out the charges against the accused for 45 minutes, judge Shahed Noor Uddin set July 9 for the next hearing considering a defence petition. According to the allegations, during the past regime, the then prime minister, her son and cabinet ministers awarded a container-handling deal to an "inexperienced" contractor, Global Agro Trade Company, by bending rules. Earlier, Khaleda was brought to the court at 10:15am from special jail. Fifteen other accused including former cabinet ministers were also produced in the court. An ailing Motiur Rahman Nizami was ambulance-carried from hospital. Arafat Rahman Coco, son of Khaleda, has been exempted from personal appearance in court. As the proceedings started, advocate Kajal started reading out the charges with explanations. Khaleda's lawyer Abdur Rezzaque Khan objected to the charges saying it looked like Kajal was reading out a chargesheet. Khaleda's lawyers Joynal Abedin, Sanaullah Mia, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon said a writ petition filed with the High Court in line with the Gatco case figured on the cause list Monday. The lawyers urged the court to defer the chargeframing in the case by another couple of weeks. Nizami's lawyer Abdur Razzaque said to the court: "Since a writ petition awaits a High Court hearing, the special court might as well defer the hearing on charge-framing." The judge then deferred the hearing to July 9. Khaleda spoke to her lawyers Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Rizvi Ahmed, Sanaullah Mia, Ahmed Azam and others after the court session ended. After the proceedings, the public prosecutor acting for the Anticorruption Commission told bdnews24.com: "As part of charge-framing proceedings, we read out the 22 charges against the accused along with the FIR filed in the case." Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Md Azizul Haque on May 28 transferred Gatco-case files to the Special Judge's Court-3 for trial. The ACC filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station. The ACC pressed charges on May 13 against some 25 people. Seven people accused in the case are on the run. bdnews24
