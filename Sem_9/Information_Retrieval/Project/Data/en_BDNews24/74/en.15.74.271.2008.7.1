 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) - In its quest to take other sports disciplines forward, the National Sports Council (NSC) has recently demanded 15 percent of US$ 56.88 million of the media marketing rights' deal from the Bangladesh Cricket Board. The country's sports governing body plans to spend the money for other disciplines, which lag behind due to lack of sponsorships, said an NSC official. The country's affluent federation, however, is seemingly against it. "It is still not clear to us what the legal basis of this demand is," said BCB spokesman Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby. "The BCB gives gate-money levy to the NSC for each tournament along with 15 percent VAT to the government. Besides, the board also pays over Tk three crore as income tax," Bobby questioned, "How will the BCB run its activities if it has to pay more money." NSC secretary Akbar Hossain, did not feel their demand irrational, and said, "We have some more disciplines that are hardly conducted due to lack of sponsorship, and we have demanded it in order to spend that money for those disciplines." Hossain said that NSC chairman, army chief, general Moeen U Ahmed, supported the proposal. Bobby said that the board would reply, after examining the basis of the NSC demand. He added that the BCB was facing a deficit this fiscal and would face another big blow if it had to give 15 percent of the marketing deal to the NSC.
