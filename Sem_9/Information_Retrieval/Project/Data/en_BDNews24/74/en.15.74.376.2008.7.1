 LONDON, Tue Jul 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The second half of 2008 got off to a brutal start for equity investors on Tuesday as worries about the banking sector battered European stocks while inflation fears increased with oil over $142 a barrel. Wall Street also looked set for a poor start. A sell-off in banks hit European shares with the FTSEurofirst 300 index down 1.9 percent Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) shed 5 percent amid market talk of a profit warning. Deutsche declined to comment. UBS (UBSN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) traded 6.4 percent lower as Merrill Lynch removed the stock from its "Europe 1 List". "It's a combination of profit warning talk at Deutsche, rumors late yesterday of writedowns at UBS -- now trading below the rights price -- and the Lehman rumors in the United States," said a trader in London. Lehman Brothers (LEH.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) shares fell sharply on Monday on speculation that the investment bank could be bought for $15 a share, a price well below current market levels. Lehman declined to comment. It was a poor start to the second half after the battering during the first six months of the year. The U.S. S&P 500 index, for example, ended the first half of the year down nearly 13 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 lost 20 percent and Japan's Nikkei was down 18 percent. "There are no reasons to own shares at the moment," said asset manager Stefan de Schutter at Alpha Trading in Frankfurt. "Oil is still very high and the banking crisis is continuing." Earlier, on Tuesday the Nikkei dipped just 0.1 percent, but set its longest losing streak in nearly four years. RISING TENSION Tension between the United States and Iran pushed oil to near record levels, adding to overall anxiety about slowing economic growth and rising prices. New York crude oil was up $2.18 a barrel at $142.17. It hit a record high above $143 on Monday before falling back at the close. In a war of words between the Iranian and U.S. military, Iran's Revolutionary Guard said Tehran would impose controls on shipping in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz if it were attacked. The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said the United States and its allies would not allow Iran to hamper shipping in the Gulf. Roughly 40 percent of the world's traded oil moves through the strait. "The market has been worried about the tensions involving Iran and that remains a supportive factor for the oil price," said David Moore, a commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. Oil, which is up around 47 percent so far this year, has added to overall fears on financial markets that inflation is about to rise substantially just as developed economies are slowing. DOLLAR WEAK, BONDS MIXED The dollar eased a half of a percent against the yen to 105.50 yen, a factor in the Nikkei's slide because of the effect on importers. It was also weaker against the euro at $1.5755. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Monday that the euro was 30 percent overvalued and that interest rate increases would have a limited effect on inflation as they would make no difference to the crude price. Yields on two-year euro zone government bonds were down 3 basis points at 4.581 percent while the 10-year Bund was yielding 4.611 percent, around 2 basis points less than in late Monday trade
