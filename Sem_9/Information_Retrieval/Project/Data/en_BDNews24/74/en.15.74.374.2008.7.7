 LONDON, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks held just above last week's five-month low on Monday as a fall in oil prices from the recent record high did little to calm concerns about rising inflation and slowing growth. Investors kept an eye on a three-day meeting of leaders of the Group of Eight rich countries in northern Japan to see if they can send a message strong enough to reverse the surge in oil prices and the dollar's long-term slide. Mounting expectations the European Central Bank will refrain from another interest rate hike after last week's well-flagged quarter point move to 4.25 percent also undermined the euro, which fell to a one-week low versus the dollar. Banks were the major underperformers in Europe, highlighting persistent concerns over their health almost a year into the credit crisis. Wall Street was set for a weaker start after the Dow index fell more than 20 percent last week from its peaks, signaling the start of a bear market. "The credit crisis is being worked through but isn't over," said Andrew Bell, head of research at Rensburg Sheppards. "And you've got an economic downturn which is being given an extra twist from the (high) oil price, so there are earnings downgrades on the way and it's much easier to come up with a negative story on equities in the near term than a positive one." MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS was steady on the day, holding not far off last week's five-month low. The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.2 percent, having spent much of an early session straying in and out of positive territory. The index is still down more than 20 percent this year. US stock futures were down 0.1 percent. The September Bund future rose 40 ticks, pushing the yield lower as investors scaled back bets on aggressive euro zone interest rate hikes. DOLLAR UP AS G8 MEETS The dollar .DXY rose 0.4 percent versus a basket of major currencies, extending last Friday's gains after last week's key US employment data was not as bad as some had feared. "If at all, comments from the G8 should be a bit dollar supportive as the focus of the market is very much on energy prices and the impact on inflation," Michael Klawitter, FX strategist, Dresdner Kleinwort, Frankfurt. "A stable dollar would be one of the preconditions to stabilize the oil price (and) there is some expectation that the statement ... should hint at least at some general agreement that the dollar should not be allowed to weaken further." US light crude fell 1.7 percent to $142.81 a barrel, having surged past $145 last week to record highs. Gold fell to $920.60 an ounce, pressured by a stronger dollar. Emerging sovereign spreads were steady while emerging stocks .MSCIEF rose 0.7 percent
