<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain Sunday alleged that the government was conspiring to 'exile' former prime minister Khaleda Zia from Bangladesh. The BNP leader made the allegation at a token hunger strike by the party's front organisation Jatiyatabadi Tanti Dal. "The government is still pursuing the minus-two theory. It has sent Sheikh Hasina abroad. Now it is conspiring to send our leader abroad on different conditions," Delwar said. "Khaleda Zia has said she will not go abroad," Delwar claimed. Delwar criticised the holding of local government election by the caretaker government ahead of national polls. "The government is holding the election unconstitutionally. Its aim is to build up a power base." Delwar demanded immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency and holding parliament election first. The BNP secretary general nominated by the party chairperson repeated demand for the release of Khaleda and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and sending Khaleda's sons abroad for better medical treatment. "We want to sit in the dialogue with the aim of holding parliament elections first. However, our leader has to be released first." "The government doesn't care for the opinion of political parties and is pressing ahead with their blueprint." Branding Jatiya party chairman HM Ershad as an "agent of government", Delwar said: "He (Ershad) said he wants an election amid the state of emergency. No sane person can make such demand." Delwar alleged that the trial of political leaders, including Khaleda in special courts under emergency powers rules, was a farce. bdnew
