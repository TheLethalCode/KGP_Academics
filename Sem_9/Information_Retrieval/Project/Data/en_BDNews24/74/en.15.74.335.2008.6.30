 NEW YORK, Mon Jun 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rebuilding at the World Trade Center site will take longer and cost more than previously projected, a report from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is set to say on Monday, a source familiar with the contents said. The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday that rebuilding of the Trade Center won't be completed until the middle of the next decade and will cost up to $3 billion more than planned, citing people familiar with the matter. The paper reported that The Freedom Tower, an office tower controlled by the Port Authority and under construction, had been targeted for completion by the end of 2011. Now, the tower is likely to be delayed a year, the paper said. The paper said major components of the project will be delayed one to three years and will cost $1 billion to $3 billion more than the current estimate of $15 billion, citing people familiar with the project. The source who spoke to Reuters said the report won't detail dates or specific costs, but will note that some of the Trade Center project dates will be moving back and that there will be some cost overruns. The Port Authority is responsible for building the largest projects at Trade Center site, where nearly 3,000 people died in the September 11, 2001 attacks. The projects the Port Authority is building are: One World Trade Center, the Freedom Tower, and The World Trade Center Transportation Hub, according to the authority's Web site
