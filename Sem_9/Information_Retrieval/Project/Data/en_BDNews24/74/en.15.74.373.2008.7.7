<TITLE> Obama, McCain set to duel over economy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PHOENIX, Mon Jul 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The presidential candidates will duel over the economy this week, with Republican Sen. John McCain touting proposals he says will stimulate job growth and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama discussing economic security for families. McCain, an Arizona senator who has wrapped up his party's nomination, will embark on a tour of Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin -- all toss-up states in the November election to win the White House. The Arizona senator spent last week on a swing through Latin America highlighting his support for free trade, prompting some observers to question why he went abroad at a time when employers cut US workers from their payrolls for a sixth straight month and gasoline prices continued to sting. "John McCain is undertaking a new and focused effort to highlight the job growth that would result from his economic plan," spokesman Tucker Bounds said of the senator's plans. Obama, a Democratic senator from Illinois, kicks off his week in North Carolina, where he will discuss economic security. McCain is expected to offer detailed plans outlining how he would balance the federal budget this week but otherwise will promote existing policy proposals rather than propose sweeping changes, an aide said. Taxes are a key dividing point between the two candidates. McCain accuses Obama of wanting to raise taxes across the board, while the Illinois senator accuses his rival of wanting to provide a cushion for wealthy people and big corporations. "John McCain's tax cut proposals are focused on growing jobs, which is in sharp contrast to Barack Obama, who quite simply burdens small business growth with tax increases (that) will slow our economy," Bounds said. Obama's campaign accused McCain of misrepresenting the Democrat's plans and offered a stinging description of the Arizona senator's economic ideas. "John McCain has essentially no ideas to get the economy going and create jobs in the short run, and (he) has ideas about the long run economy that are rooted in a failed economic philosophy," Jason Furman, Obama's economic policy director, told a conference call with reporters on Sunday. He said McCain's take on the Illinois senator's tax plans was off base. "He is mischaracterizing Sen. Obama's plan, which is very simple. If you make below $250,000, none of your taxes go up, and in fact, most likely you're going to end up getting a tax cut," Furman said. The two candidates disagree on other areas connected to the economy, including trade and health care reform. Both propose spurring job growth through programs to increase US use of solar, wind and other renewable energy sources
