 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-21 Hockey team leave here for India Monday morning by road to take part in the Sixth Junior Asia Cup with the hope of retaining their previous place of sixth. "Our main objective will be retaining our previous sixth place, but we will also try to finish fifth in the eight-team meet," coach Noor Islam told bdnews24.com Sunday. Islam said that the preparation of the team was not up to mark as he had got the all players together for only three days because of interruption of rain at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. The meet is scheduled for July 11-18 in Hyderabad. Eight teams, split into two groups, will take part in the meet. Bangladesh are pitted in Group B along against Pakistan, Oman and South Korea. "I had earlier seen that the youth sides of Pakistan, India, Korea and China were very strong compared to our junior teams and it is tough to upset them," Islam said, "I can hope that we are capable of beating Oman and Singapore." Group A comprises hosts India, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. Bangladesh will play their first match against South Korea on July 11, the second match against Oman on July 13 and the third match against Pakistan on July 14. Team: Mehrab Hossain Kiran, Manwar Hossain, Shamsul Alam Sujon, Moshiur Rahman, Irfanul Haque, Rimon Kumar Ghosh, Abdus Sajjad John, Moshiur Rahman Biplob, Labu Nahid, Asaduzzaman Chandan, Sheikh Mohammad Nannu, Hasan Jubair, Iqbal Nadir, Krishna Kumar, Russell Mahmud Jimmy and Tapash Barman.
