 MADRID, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Spanish media have proclaimed Rafael Nadal the best player in the world after his epic final victory over Roger Federer at Wimbledon. The 22-year-old became the first Spaniard to take the men's single crown since Manolo Santana's 1966 achievement, eventually overpowering his Swiss rival 6-4 6-4 6-7 6-7 9-7 after a punishing four hours and 48 minutes on Sunday. "It doesn't matter what the ATP say, Rafa you are the number one," the front page of sports daily Marca said on Monday. "'Rocky' Nadal beat Federer in the match of the century." Sports daily AS chanted: "Long live King Nadal!"

He has never come across such a mercurial player, who combines silky tennis with a personality of stone," they wrote. "Rafa Nadal is his name. Yesterday, he was champion of Wimbledon. Tomorrow, he is morally the world number one." Writing in sports daily AS, Santana drew a parallel between Nadal's achievement and the Spanish football team's Euro 2008 victory last week, their first title win since taking the European championship in 1964. "At last! Football ended their 44 year jinx. After 42 years I have a successor at Wimbledon," he wrote. "It was a special day for him but especially for me, because I didn't expect to see the day when a Spaniard would lift the trophy at the greatest tennis tournament in the world." By bringing an end to Federer's five-year reign as Wimbledon champion, daily Sport predicted Nadal was changing the balance of power in the world of men's tennis. "The era of Federer could have started its decline," they wrote. "But now, for us, opens the era of Rafa.
