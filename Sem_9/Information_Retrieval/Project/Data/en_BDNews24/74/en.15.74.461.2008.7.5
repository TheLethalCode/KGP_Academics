<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)Progressive Democratic Party chairman Ferdaus Ahmed Quarishi said Saturday the acceptability of elections would not depend on one party's participation or boycott. In a news briefing at the party's central office in Segun Bagicha, Quarishi said: "Elections will be acceptable if the participation of voters is satisfactory." "People are not divided along two party lines as in the past. The so-called two big parties cannot foil an election now, even if they want to," Quarishi said. The main parties have for months been opposing local government elections to be held before the parliament election, the PDP chief alleged. "The Awami League has changed its decision and is now taking part in the election. Although BNP is still speaking of boycotting and resisting the election, leaders are filing nominations, ignoring their party decision." Quarishi called for completion of the trial of those arrested during the state of emergency. "Trial of those against whom serious allegations have been raised after the 1/11 must be completed before the election." "If there is no scope for a change in leadership and the old faces return to leadership using black money and muscle power, the spirits of the 1/11 changeover would not be upheld," Quarishi said. PDP secretary general Noor Mohammad Khan, party leaders retired Lt Col HMA Gaffar, additional secretary general Golam Sarwar Milon, retired major Reazul Islam and retired major Parvez Kabir were present. bdnew
