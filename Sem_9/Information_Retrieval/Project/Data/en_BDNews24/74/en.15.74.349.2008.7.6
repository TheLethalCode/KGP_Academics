<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Sun Jul 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia has issued an international alert for a missing private eye after he made, and abruptly retracted, allegations about the deputy prime minister's links to a high-profile murder case, police said on Sunday. The detective, Balasubramaniam Perumal, disappeared along with his wife and three children on Friday after retracting an allegation that Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak had sexual relations with the murder victim. The Mongolian woman, Altantuya Shaariibu, 28, was shot in the head twice before her body was blown up with C4 explosives in October 2006. One of Najib's top aides and two state bodyguards are on trial for the murder. "Police in the country have been put on alert to find him and we have informed Interpol ... as well as police in neighbouring countries," National Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) chief Bakri Zinin told a news conference on Sunday. "We are soliciting the public's help to find Balasubramaniam, because even the person (his nephew) who filed the missing report is not giving his full cooperation," Bakri said. "I give a guarantee of his safety, if he comes to meet us, and he is free to bring a lawyer." Najib has repeatedly denied he ever had a sexual relationship with the Mongolian, or had conspired to cover up her murder, allegations made on Thursday by Balasubramaniam, who was working for Abdul Razak at the time of the killing. The detective's bombshell was the latest twist in the high-stakes political melodrama -- featuring allegations of sex, murder, lies and sodomy -- that has gripped the nation since a March 8 general election handed a resurgent opposition led by former deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim unprecedented gains. POLITICAL PATRONAGE Najib and Anwar are competing to become Malaysia's next prime minister with control over a political patronage system that dominates the economy. Both are battling accusations that could ruin their political careers. A 23-year-old aide has accused Anwar of sodomy, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Anwar rejected the allegation made a week ago and said it was part of a top-level conspiracy to keep him from running for parliament and stymie his drive to woo defectors from the ruling coalition. CID chief Bakri told the Sunday news conference his office has taken statements from 18 witnesses, including medical doctors who examined the accuser, but have yet to summon Anwar. "It's very delicate. Give us time. We have to find the truth first." Anwar said on Thursday the sodomy allegations surfaced because leading government figures feared he would use the detective's statements in the Altantuya case in his drive to lead the opposition to power for the first time in Malaysia. He had previously said the sodomy case emerged to stop him from running for parliament in a by-election, a necessary first step toward becoming premier. The three-party opposition alliance made historic gains in the election, winning five of 13 state governments and coming within 30 seats of taking control of the 222-member parliament. The alliance was holding a rally at a football stadium outside Kuala Lumpur on Sunday to protest against rising food and fuel prices. Police had refused to give the rally organisers the permit required for it by law, but were noticeably absent at the event, scheduled to climax when Anwar addresses a crowd expected to grow to nearly 50,000 by nightfall. "We are happy we don't see a heavy presence of the security apparatus, which is a normal scene in our gatherings," said Hatta Ramli, the spokesman for the protest. "We're used to having helicopters hovering above us all the time.
