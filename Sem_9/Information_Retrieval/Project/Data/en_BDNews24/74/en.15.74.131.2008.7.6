 LONDON, Sun Jul 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A unique collection of British royalty memorabilia amassed over half a century by a household family servant sparked an international bidding frenzy on Saturday that doubled its value when it went under the hammer. The private collection including pictures, cards, notes, cups and outfits built up by William Tallon, affectionately known as "Backstairs Billy" for his final role as Steward and Page of the Backstairs, fetched 450,000 pounds ($892,800). The auction lasted more than 10 hours and took nearly double the pre-sale estimates. Auctioneers Reeman Dansie of Colchester in southeastern England said bidders had flown in from around the world, particularly Canada and the United States. Among the treasure trove of 700 items was a note from the Queen Mother, known for enjoying a tipple, instructing Tallon to pack "two small bottles of Dubonnet and gin ... in case it is needed." Expected to fetch up to 300 pounds. it eventually went to a phone bidder for 16,000 pounds. Top-priced item was a portrait of the Queen Mother by Sir James Gunn, dated November 1945, which went for 30,000 pounds -- five times its top pre-sale estimate. Also among the collection were several notes from Princess Diana to Tallon. One, dated June 28, 1982 after the birth of her first son, Prince William, went for 5,000 pounds. "We are not sure at the moment what has hit us, except a very strong pair of lungs! - Both parents are making little sense, we just seem to spend most of our time gazing at this tiny person!," she wrote. Tallon joined the royal household in 1951 at the age of 15, becoming a close confidant to its members and a special favorite of the Queen Mother over the following years. Throughout his royal service he squirreled away every note and gift he was given by the royal family. Privy to many royal secrets, he steadfastly refused to reveal his inside knowledge. Tallon retired after the death of the Queen Mother and himself died last November aged 72
