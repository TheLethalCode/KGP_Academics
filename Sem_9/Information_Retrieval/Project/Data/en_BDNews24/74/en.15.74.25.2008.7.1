<TITLE> BCB to get two new faces </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) - Former national cricketer Shakil Kashem and organiser Golam Mohammad Alamgir are all set to become new members of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, according to an NSC official Tuesday. Alamgir is the chairman of the Mohammedan Sporting Club cricket committee. National Sports Council secretary Akbar Hossain confirmed the move to reporters at his office Tuesday. The NSC appointed a 10-member ad-hoc committee in July last year, but Shakil and Alamgir are coming following resignations of retired Lt Col MA Latif and the arrest of Salim Bhuiyan in a graft case. Latif, also a former national cricket team manager, resigned last month for personal reasons while Salim has been in jail since January. Latif and Salim were the chairmen of at least five standing committees together and in their absence, the undersized ad-hoc committee suffers from immense pressure of work. Following which, the BCB asked the NSC for two more people. The NSC initially told the BCB to prepare for an election, but later, it changed its mind and chose Shakil and Alamgir.
