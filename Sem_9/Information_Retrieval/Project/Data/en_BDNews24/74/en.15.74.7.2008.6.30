 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jelena Jankovic's fourth-round defeat at Wimbledon on Monday ensured the second week began with yet another shock, completing the cull of the top three women's seeds. The Serb's wait for a first grand slam final appearance goes on after an error-strewn 6-3 6-2 defeat by Tamarine Tanasugarn, who at 31 was the oldest woman to reach this year's last 16 and now the first Thai quarter-finalist at a grand slam. Jankovic, who needed running repairs on her left knee, showed only fleeting glimpses of her normal tenacious game as she was toppled by the world number 60. Her demise means it is the first time since seedings were introduced in 1927 that the top three women's seeds have fallen before the quarter-finals. Top seed Ana Ivanovic and third seed Maria Sharapova had their hopes trampled into the Wimbledon turf last week by players ranked in the 100s. At least the seeding committee can rely on Venus Williams not to fluff her lines. Champion Williams, seeded seventh this year, continued to pick her way through the carnage with few alarms with a 6-3 6-4 defeat of Russian teenager Alisa Kleybanova. With Tamarine next, a seventh Wimbledon singles final is looming on the Venus horizon. "I'm very happy to get through," Williams told reporters. "The reality now is that everybody comes to grand slams with double vengeance and no match is a given, you have to work for it." Chinese wildcard Zheng Jie, who ended Ivanovic's tournament in round three, backed up that performance with a solid 6-3 6-4 defeat of Hungary's Agnes Szavay. She is the second woman from China to reach the last eight at Wimbledon, emulating Li Na's run two years ago. All 16 men's and women's fourth round singles matches take place on Monday with defending champion Roger Federer up against Lleyton Hewitt and Rafael Nadal facing Mikhail Youzhny
