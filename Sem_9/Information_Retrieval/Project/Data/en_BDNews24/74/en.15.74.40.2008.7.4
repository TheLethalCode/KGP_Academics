 QUETTA, Pakistan, July 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb planted on a motorcycle exploded on Friday outside a bank in the Pakistani city of Quetta, capital of gas-rich Baluchistan province, killing a girl and wounding 10 people, police said. There was no claim of responsibility but separatist insurgents in Pakistan's western province of Baluchistan have been fighting for control of its gas resources for years. "The girl was a beggar, she succumbed to her wounds during surgery in hospital," said city police chief Mohammad Akbar. Baluchistan is Pakistan's poorest province and many of its people say they do not get a fair share of the profits from its resources. Nationalist rebels have waged a low-level insurgency for decades, attacking gas pipelines, infrastructure links and the security forces.
