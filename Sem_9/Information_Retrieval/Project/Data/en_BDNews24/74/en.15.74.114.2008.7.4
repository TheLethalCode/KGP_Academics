<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, July 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has changed the result of the controversial 2006 Oval test between England and Pakistan to a draw, the governing body confirmed on Thursday. England were declared winners after Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq refused to lead his team back onto the pitch following the tea session on the fourth day after they had been docked five runs for ball-tampering by umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove. Following vehement protests by Pakistan, the ICC appointed an adjudicator to probe the incident that had resulted in the first forfeited result in tests. The ICC executive board took the decision to overturn the result at its annual conference underway in Dubai. "The (ICC) board's decision was based on the view that in light of the unique set of circumstances, the original result of the match was felt to be inappropriate," an ICC statement said. The ICC adjudicator, Ranjan Madugalle, had banned Inzamam for four games but cleared Pakistan of ball-tampering charges. He also censored Hair for overstepping his authority. In November the same year, the ICC board suspended Hair from supervising test and international matches for his conduct and he was only restored in March this year after the Australian underwent a six-month rehabilitation course. Inzamam, who has since retired from the game, said the ICC decision had vindicated Pakistan's stand. "Our team was already cleared of ball tampering charges and now they have changed the result of the test," he said in Karachi. "I think we stand vindicated in our stance that we did nothing wrong. "I have constantly said the whole incident occurred because of the attitude of Hair and I stand by that even today. Inzamam was criticised the ICC for Hair's reinstatement. "It was because of Hair that all the trouble happened and he is back to umpiring and that I feel is unfortunate," he added. The change leaves England 2-0 winners of that series
