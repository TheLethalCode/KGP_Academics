 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com) BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Friday accused the caretaker government of applying double standards in its treatment of rival political parties BNP and the Awami League. Delwar's comment came a day after the Anticorruption Commission filed a case against BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman on charges of embezzling funds from Zia Orphanage Trust. In a press briefing in his NAM flat on Manik Mia Avenue, the BNP secretary general rejected the case as a "false, baseless and ill-motivated" move. "These cases have all been filed to malign, detain and convict them to make them ineligible for contesting the elections. Many more such cases are being readied," Delwar alleged. "The Zia Orphanage Trust case involves some incidents that go back to 1991-96, but the case has been included for trial under the emergency powers rules." The ACC filed the case against the former prime minister and six others accusing them of scamming Zia Orphanage Trust of Tk 2.1 crore. On Thursday's dialogue with the AL, Delwar said: "The CEC treated the Awami League like its close relative during the electoral dialogue, and the CA seemed to have treated AL delegates in similar fashion. I'm not criticising any of these, but why should they treat us as if we're their sworn enemies?" Calling the government's "unfriendly attitude" towards the BNP a breach of mandate, the disgruntled BNP leader said: "The government is losing its neutrality." At the same time, Delwar said, the government is breaching its mandate by holding the local government polls ahead of national elections. "The caretaker government wants to hold a stage-managed election only to create a rubber-stamp parliament to facilitate the perpetuation of power by the vested cliques," Delwar alleged. Replying to a query, the BNP leader said: "The government is playing satanic games with the peopletalking about the local government polls today and filing false cases against the BNP chairperson and her family members only to harass them." Delwar reiterated that his party and the four-party alliance are not participating in the local government polls. "We are for the constitution, law, people and ethical considerations. We'll take steps against the traitors who will submit nominations for the elections." Delwar blamed the government for forming a fresh medical board instead of sending Tarique abroad for better treatment. Expressing his worries over the energy price hike and its impact on the domestic market, Delwar said, "The government should reverse its decision, or people's sufferings will be boundless." bdnew
