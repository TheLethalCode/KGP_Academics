<TITLE> US to continue GSP for Bangladesh: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 03 (bdnews24.com)The US government will continue providing the GSP (generalised system of preferences) facilities for Bangladesh, an adviser said Thursday. American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO) has urged the US government to cancel the GSP facilities for Bangladesh. The AFL-CIO alleged labour rights violations in the garment and shrimp sectors in Bangladesh. "The US government has informed Bangladesh mission in Washington that Bangladesh will continue to enjoy the GSP facilities as before," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters at the foreign ministry. "A review process initiated by a petition from AFL-CIO in the US would be extended by another year," Iftekhar said. "For now, I can say that the continuation of GSP facilities is good news for Bangladesh." "In the meantime, we should emphasise workers' overall welfare which will also improve our market access (to the US)," said Iftekhar. The AFL-CIO filed petitions with the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to cancel the GSP facilities for Bangladesh. It said Bangladeshi companies did not protect the workers' labour rights. Bangladesh has been denying the allegations and assured the USTR that the owners have been improving labour compliance. The USTR in the past arranged hearings on labour conditions in Bangladesh, but did not take any decision to stop GSP facilities. bdn
