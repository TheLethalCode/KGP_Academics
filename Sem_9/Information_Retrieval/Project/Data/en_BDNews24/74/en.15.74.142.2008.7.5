 Dhaka, July 5 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Saturday asked the members of President's Guard Regiment to learn the know-how of new technology and its use for security purpose. "You are engaged in a crucial and sensitive job of providing security to VVIPs, including the heads of state and government," the chief adviser told the PGR members in his speech to mark the regiment's 33rd founding anniversary at its headquarters in the cantonment. "The profession is becoming intricate and challenging gradually in national and international arenas," the CA said. Fakhruddin also asked the PGR members to maintain communications and coordination and cooperation with other security agencies. The CA promised efforts to modernise the regiment and said: "We will continue our effort for the development of the regiment and welfare of its members." "Ensuring security for the VVIPs and significant state programmes is not as easy as it seems it is. The profession demands a keen eye, sleepless nights, hostile situation and hard work that require patience, determination and a great sense of responsibility." "I believe every member of the regiment, comprising the armed forces, has the qualifications," the CA said. Fakhruddin asked the PGR members to be aware of deepening public relations and public involvement. "The PGR members should be rigorous, sincere and responsible as well as gentle and humble." Among others present in the programme were the army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, naval chief, Vice Admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam, Air Force chief, Air Marshal SM Ziaur Rahman. In a statement, the Inter-Service Public Relations Directorate said the programme had started with the hoisting of the regimental flag. The President's Guard Regiment was established in 1975. bdnews
