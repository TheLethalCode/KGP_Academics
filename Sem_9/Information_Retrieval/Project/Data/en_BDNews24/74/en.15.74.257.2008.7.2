<TEXT>
 MADRID, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's victory at Euro 2008 did soccer a favour, UEFA's player of the tournament Xavi has said. Nine of coach Luis Aragones's team were nominated in the squad of the tournament, as selected by European soccer's governing body on Monday, when they were praised for their open, attacking approach and their neat, possession football. But it was the 28-year-old Barcelona midfielder, supplier of the pass for Fernando Torres's winner in the final against Germany, who was singled out for a special mention. "They have rewarded Spain for their style of play and I was the lucky one chosen. They could have given it to any player in our team," Xavi said of his award in an interview with daily El Pais on Wednesday. "Luis (Aragones) deserves the credit for the triumph, for the group he has created over a long period of time. He promoted a particular style and with it we won. "I think it has done football a great favour because it has proved you can win with talent. Our victory is good for football." Spain beat Germany 1-0 in Sunday's final to claim their second European championship title
