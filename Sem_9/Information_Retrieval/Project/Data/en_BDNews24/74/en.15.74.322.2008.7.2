 DENPASAR, Indonesia,Wed Jul 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian drug trafficker Schapelle Corby, who is serving a 20-year jail term in Indonesia for smuggling marijuana, spent several hours having her hair and nails done in a Bali beauty salon on Wednesday. The 30-year-old beautician, whose case is the subject of a documentary film and is frequently in the media spotlight, was convicted in 2005 of smuggling 4.1 kg (9 lb) of marijuana from Australia to Bali. Flanked by two armed officers, Corby went to a beauty salon in the Balinese capital located near a hospital where she has been receiving treatment for depression, witnesses said. Corby instructed the salon staff using English and Indonesian, Ida Ayu Purnama, a member of the salon staff, said. After getting her hair groomed and a pedicure, she spent another hour in the salon hiding from journalists waiting for her outside. Corby, who was wearing a blue hat and top, eventually left but tried to shield her face with a sheet of paper. She was taken from Kerobokan jail to a Bali hospital last month suffering from depression, which her lawyer said was due to a decision by Indonesia's Supreme Court to reject her final judicial review appeal. Nyoman Ratep, a doctor treating Corby, said she was getting better but would need more medical treatment before being allowed to return to her cell. The doctor said she had been allowed to go to the salon because it was close to the hospital. Corby has always maintained her innocence and her lengthy jail term was criticised by many in Australia. Indonesian officials say stiff sentences for drug offenders, including death sometimes, are necessary to tackle growing drugs use in the country. While Australia and Indonesia are negotiating a prisoner swap deal for Corby, she has said she does not want to return home to serve her sentence. A documentary entitled "Ganja Queen" was recently shown on U.S. television. Ganja is a popular term for marijuana
