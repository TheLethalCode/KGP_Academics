<TITLE> Bangladesh-Pakistan face-off in Asia Cup Friday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh look to restrict Pakistan to below 300 when they take on the hosts in the Super Fours last match of the Asia Cup in Karachi Friday. It has been a common phenomenon in the Super Eights matches of the Asia Cup that each team, except Bangladesh, has crossed the 300-mark, but Bangladesh's vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza wants to keep Pakistan below that mark after bowling first. Though Bangladesh have just an academic interest in the Friday match, Pakistan have more than that, the chance to qualify for the final by beating Bangladesh. This, however, depends on the result of the Sri Lanka-India match Thursday. If India overcome Sri Lanka, it will be thrown to the final, and Pakistan's interest against Bangladesh will be academic. If Sri Lanka go down against India Thursday, Pakistan will certainly want to finish their campaign on a high and it would be tough for Bangladesh to restrict the hosts to below the 300-mark. The Tiger management has picked the same eleven that went down to Sri Lanka in their last match. Choosing the same eleven means opener Shahirar Nafees, middle order Mehrab Hossain Junior and spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel will return home playing no match in the tournament. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Alok Kapali, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain.
