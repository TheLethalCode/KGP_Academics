 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday submitted a chargesheet against Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka in a case that alleges earning property illegally and concealing wealth information. ACC director Md Shamsul Alam filed the chargesheet with Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court against the former BNP minister. Earlier in the day, the ACC approved the chargesheet. The chargesheet shows Khoka as a fugitive. Investigating officer Shamsul Alam told bdnews24.com: "Although Sadek Hossain Khoka has been shown absconding in the chargesheet, no arrest warrant was sought from the court against him." The chargesheet said the mayor had concealed information in his wealth information to the ACC about Tk 9.65 crore worth of property. "Also, he earned wealth worth Tk 9.76 crore illegally." Alam filed the case with Ramna Police Station on April 2 against Khoka, his wife and children. The ACC served notice on Khoka and his family on Nov 15 last year, asking them to turn in wealth statements. bdnews24
