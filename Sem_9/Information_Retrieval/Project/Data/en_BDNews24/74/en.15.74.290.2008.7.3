 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Thursday denied former army chief Mustafizur Rahman an exemption from personally appearing in court as one of the accused in the MiG-29 graft case. Judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder ordered the former army chief to file another petition and adjourned proceedings until July 8, when the special court will hear a plea by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, also accused in the case, to have the charges against her cancelled. Six accused in the case, including Mustafizur Rahman, were present in the court. Advocate Sahara Khatun appeared on Hasina's behalf as the former prime minister has been exempted from personal appearance on medical grounds, while she seeks treatment overseas. The now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the graft case in 2001 against seven people, alleging that Hasina during her term as prime minister caused the state Tk 700 crore in losses by purchasing eight MiG-29 war planes. The charge sheet was submitted on Jan 29, 2003 the seven, but the High Court stayed the case proceedings following an appeal by Hasina the same year. The other accused in the case are former air chief Jamaluddin Ahmed, former defence secretary Syed Yusuf Hossain, former joint secretary of the defence ministry Mohammad Hossain Sherniyabat, retired air commodore Mirza Akhter Maruf and Unique Group proprietor Noor Ali. bdnews24
