<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday stayed the proceedings of a case against Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed's wife Anwara Ahmed for six months. An HC bench of justices Sharifuddin Chaklader and Imdadul Hoque Azad passed the order after Anwara Ahmed petitioned the court to scrap the case. The HC also asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain in three weeks why the case proceedings against the wife of the AL leader would not be cancelled. The case accuses Anwara of amassing illegal wealth. The HC on June 2 allowed interim bail to Tofail's wife and daughter Taslima Ahmed Zaman for four months or until the chargesheet in the case is submitted. Advocate Abdul Baset Mojumder participated in the hearing on behalf of Anwara. The ACC on May 29 filed the case with Ramna Model Police Station against them on charges of amassing Tk 2.44 crore worth of illegal wealth and suppressing wealth information about Tk 1.86 crore. Anwara and Taslima were accused of abetting Tofail. bdnew
