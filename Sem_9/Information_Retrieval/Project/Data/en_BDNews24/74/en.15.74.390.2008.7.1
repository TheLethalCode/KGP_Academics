 MADRID, July 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of ecstatic Spaniards lined Madrid's streets and packed into a central square on Monday to raucously cheer home their soccer heroes, after Spain's Euro 2008 final victory in Vienna. Finally free of pressure after beating Germany 1-0 on Sunday, delighted players celebrated on a stage in front of thousands in Madrid's Colon Square and tossed 69-year-old coach Luis Aragones into the air. Captain Iker Casillas credited Aragones, who the players treat more as a father figure than coach, as the main reason for Spain's victorythe first time the country has won a major soccer tournament in 44 years.

On stage, tournament top scorer David Villa screamed "Viva Espana!" as the young squad partied around him. Liverpool and Spain reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina looked like the natural master of ceremonies as he mercilessly poked fun at teammates and led tens of thousands of delirious fans in song. Even the normally reserved and dour Aragones, who has said he is stepping down and seems set to join Turkish side Fenerbahce, allowed a smile to creep across his face as he spoke to reporters at the airport.
