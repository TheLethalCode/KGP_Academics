<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 01 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh said Tuesday it would consider national interests in recognising Kosovo, a breakaway republic from Serbia. The US has been lobbying for Dhaka's recognition of Kosovo, a Muslim majority state, which declared independence on February 17 with support from the US and its allies, defying Russia and Serbia. US ambassador James F Moriarty Tuesday met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury a second time at the foreign ministry and conveyed the US government's request to Bangladesh to recognise Kosovo. "I was once again asked by my government to go and talk to the foreign adviser about Kosovo," Moriarty told reporters after his meeting with Iftekhar. "The main objective of his (Moriarty) visit was to discuss the Kosovo issue. They want a formal recognition. We said we would examine the issue," Iftekhar told reporters. The adviser said Bangladesh would take a decision considering the stance of other Muslim countries on Kosovo's independence. "Muslim states were not all of the same opinion," he told bdnews24.com. "We must have close relations with Kosovo, but we will think about our national interests in recognising Kosovo," said Iftekhar. "On such matters (recognition of any country), we take into consideration how we will benefit from it. There are some political problems," said the adviser. "As Russia has made it clear that it will resist Kosovo's UN membership. There are lots of disagreements on whether a state (Serbia) should be broken or what the relations should be with a country which will not be able to be a UN member," he said. bdn
