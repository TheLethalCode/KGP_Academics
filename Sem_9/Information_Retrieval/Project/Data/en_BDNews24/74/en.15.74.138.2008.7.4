Academics speaking on the occasion said that at this critical juncture, GC Dev's life and philosophy could show the country 'the true path'. Inaugurating the function, Prof AFM Yusuf Haider said: "On the one hand Dr Dev was a philosopher while on the other, science- oriented realism was the main subject of his study."

Chairperson of the department of philosophy, Prof Azizunnahar Islam said that GC Dev was not only the pride of the philosophy department or Dhaka University; he was the pride of the whole nation and an invaluable national asset as well. Noted academic, Prof Sarder Fazlul Karim described Dev as the Socrates of this age. Professor emeritus Serajul Islam Chowdhury said: "We cannot think of this university without Dr Dev. His life is his message. He tried to make this country and nation productive." "True respect can be shown to him by following the lesson of humanity he imparted," said professor emeritus Anisuzzaman.
