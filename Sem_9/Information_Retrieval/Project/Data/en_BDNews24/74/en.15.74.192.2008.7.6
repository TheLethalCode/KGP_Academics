 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday asked the government to explain why the newly promulgated contempt of court ordinance would not be declared unconstitutional. A High Court bench of justice ABM Khairul Haq and justice Md Abu Tarique issued the suo moto rule during the hearing into a contempt of court case against Saptahik Shirsho Kagoj. The law secretary has been asked to reply to the rule in a week. A report "A judge whitens black money" published by the Bangla-language weekly on Jan 7 is at the centre of the case. Following publication of the report, justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Shahidul Islam of the High Court on Jan 10 issued a suo moto contempt of court rule against 18 people including the weekly's editor Md Ekramul Haque, chief reporter Imtiaz Ahmed and reporter Nasrin Akhter. Later, the chief justice transferred the rule to the bench led by justice Khairul Haq for disposal. During the court hearing, advocate Monzil Morshed appearing for the accused said the weekly did not commit "contempt of court" in line with the new ordinance. Former attorney general Mahmudul Islam, an amicus curie, said the new contempt of court ordinance goes against the constitution. "The ordinance needs to be re-examined." The Contempt of Court Act 1926 was scrapped on May 25 and replaced by a new ordinance. bdnew
