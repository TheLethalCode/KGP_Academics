 Dhaka, July 3 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission plans to hold upazila elections in the first week of October, said CEC ATM Shamsul Huda Thursday. The chief election commissioner said the EC would decide on a final date in a couple of days from now. "Work on listing voters in 250 to 300 upazilas have been completed," the CEC said at a roundtable on local government elections, organised by nongovernmental organisation Sujon at CIRDAP auditorium Thursday. "We are preparing for holding elections in those upazilas in the first week of October. The Election Commission will take a decision in a day or two," he said. He sought cooperation from all, including political parties and civil society representatives, for a fair election. The CEC said the local government election would not hamper national elections. "Preparations for national elections will start in November. We have started work on holding the local elections before that." "We are planning to hold upazila elections in those upazila where the voter list will be completed by October," he said. Refuting doubt and allegations of political parties about the national elections, Huda said: "The national election will not be hampered in any way. The election will be held by December." On the obligation of holding elections in 90 days from dissolution of parliament, Huda said: "Those who had the obligation of holding elections in 90 days are gone." The CEC said the EC is working "completely neutrally". "There is no pressure on the commission. The commission is holding local government elections on its own, not under pressure." "We have told the chief adviser that the administration has to be shuffled before the election. We will do whatever is necessary for a fair election." Transparency International Bangladesh chief Prof Muzaffer Ahmad urged the CEC to allow the civil society to monitor the local government elections as well. After the roundtable, the CEC launched a Web site prepared by Sujon to project the candidates for the elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities. bdnews24.
