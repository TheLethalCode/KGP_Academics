<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  A lawyer has petitioned the High Court to freeze elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities. Supreme Court lawyer and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Jasimuddin Sarker filed the writ petition Sunday with the High Court bench of Justice Iman Ali and Justice Md Imdadul Haque. The court is likely to hear the petition on Monday, court officials said. The Election Commission on June 20 announced the schedule for elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities. The government had earlier put into effect local government (City Corporation) and local government (Municipality) ordinances. The petitioner appealed to the court to ask the government why the two ordinances would not be declared against the constitution. The chief adviser, cabinet secretary, secretary to the president, law secretary, and Election Commission have been made respondents to the petition. Advocate Tajul Islam would participate in the hearing. bdnews2
