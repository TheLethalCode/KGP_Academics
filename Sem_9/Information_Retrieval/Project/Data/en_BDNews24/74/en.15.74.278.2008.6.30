<TITLE> UN expands food aid to N Korea; US help arrives </TITLE>

 SEOUL, Mon Jun 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN World Food Program, which has warned of a humanitarian crisis in North Korea due to a food shortage, said on Monday it reached a deal with Pyongyang to rapidly expand aid, and that a US ship arrived carrying wheat. Flooding last year, higher commodity prices and political wrangling with major donor South Korea have pushed North Korea to a food shortfall similar to ones it faced about a decade ago when famine killed an estimated 1 million people, experts have said. The World Food Program (WFP) said the agreement it reached with the North will allow it to expand its operation, previously aimed at feeding 1.2 million people, to now feed more than 5 million in the country of about 23 million. "With their support, WFP will now be able to dramatically expand our food assistance operation, and provide aid to millions of people who would otherwise be at risk of increased hunger and malnutrition," said Tony Banbury, WFP Asia regional director. North Korea also allowed the WFP to place more international aid workers on the ground and expand its operations to a greater number of counties in the impoverished country. The aid deal and arrival of U.S. help comes days after North Korea made a symbolic commitment to an international disarmament pact by blowing up the cooling tower at its plutonium-producing nuclear plant. The United States said in May it would provide 500,000 tonnes of food to North Korea in a sign of improving cooperation. Washington will supply 400,000 tonnes via the WFP while US non-governmental organizations will distribute 100,000 tonnes. US policy is not to use food as a weapon or a reward. The WFP said the first US ship carrying aid arrived on Sunday in Nampo, a port that serves Pyongyang, with a cargo of 37,000 tonnes of wheat. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said in late March it expects North Korea to have a shortfall of about 1.66 million tonnes in cereals for the year ending in October 2008, which would be the largest deficit in about seven years. South Korea usually sends about 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes of rice aid a year to North Korea but has not sent food this year as ties soured between the two when President Lee Myung-bak took office in February and promised a tough line toward Pyongyang. North Korea has branded conservative Lee "a traitor to the nation" over his calls to restrict the free flow of aid the North had seen under his liberal predecessors and tie handouts to how well the North lives up to the nuclear deal
