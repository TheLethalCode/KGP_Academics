<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka city mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka filed a writ petition with the High Court Sunday to quash a case against him on charges of amassing assets beyond his known sources of income and concealing wealth-related information. The High Court bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Imdadul Haq Azad is set to hear the petition Monday. Anticorruption Commission assistant director Shamsul Alam filed the case against the mayor on April 2 with Ramna police. Alam also brought charges against Khoka's wife and daughter for abetting him in amassing illegal wealth of Tk 17.57 crore illegally and concealing information about Tk 9.96 crore. The case is pending with a special judge's court. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, defence counsel, said in court: "According to law, the ACC's investigation has to be completed within 60 days of filing a case." But the investigation overshot the deadline, he said. Public prosecutor Khurshid Alam Khan, lawyer for the ACC, will present his arguments against the writ petition on Monday. bdnews
