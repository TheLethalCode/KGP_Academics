 MELBOURNE, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting has undergone surgery on a wrist injury suffered during the side's tour of the West Indies, Cricket Australia (CA) announced on Monday. Ponting left the tour early after sustaining the injury during the third one-day international in St George's, Grenada on June 29. Australia completed a 5-0 sweep in the one-day series on Sunday after winning the three-match test series 2-0. "Ricky has sustained a tendon injury that requires repair of tissues that hold the tendon in place -- this surgery was performed today," CA medical officer Trefor James said in a statement. James said a decision on Ponting's availability for the home series against Bangladesh in August and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan a month later would be made after monitoring his recovery in the coming week
