<TITLE> Bush arrives in Japan for G8; oil, climate in focus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHITOSE, Japan, Sun Jul 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush arrived in Japan on Sunday for the Group of Eight rich nations' meetings where North Korea's nuclear weapons program, soaring oil and food prices, and climate change top the agenda. Six months before his term ends and shadowed by low job approval ratings, questions abound whether Bush and the other leaders can forge any major agreements, particularly on how to deal with unchecked oil prices and curbing greenhouse gases. The Bush administration has also been under pressure from abroad to take action to stabilize the weak US dollar, another issue likely to come up during the meetings at the luxury hotel overlooking the lakeside resort of Toyako on July 7-9. Upon arriving, Bush headed to bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda. Later this week he will also hold one-on-one talks with the leaders of Russia, China, Germany, India and South Korea. Bush will want to rally support for pressuring North Korea to fully account for its nuclear weapons activities and finish dismantling its program. Other topics include Iran's nuclear program, the political turmoil in Zimbabwe and aid to Africa
