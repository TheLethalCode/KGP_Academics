 Dhaka, July 4 (bdnews24.com)  Recalling the contribution of the late Indian army chief Sam Manekshaw in the independence struggle of Bangladesh, veteran freedom fighters stressed Friday that the 1971 liberation war was not an Indo-Pakistan war, it was a war against Pakistan by Bangladesh and India. They said Manekshaw had got it right in taking up the right strategy to liberate Bangladesh. At a discussion in memory of Manekshaw at the Women's Voluntary Association auditorium in Dhanmondi, the veterans demanded the trial of war criminals, particularly those that were involved with the Pakistani army in mass killings. AK Khandker, who was deputy commander-in-chief of the liberation war, said Manekshaw devised a strategy for liberation that forced the Pakistan army into early surrender. Manekshaw also underlined the need for proper training of the country's freedom fighters. The then Indian army chief feared the war might have taken a turn for the worse if China had become involved in it, Khandker said. Manekshaw's strategy saved the region from a worse war, the former commander-in-chief said. The role Manekshaw played to create an independent and democratic nation would last forever in the hearts of Bangladeshis, Khandker added. Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak said: "Manekshaw was an efficient war leader. He knew where and when to attack the enemy." Razzak said Manekshaw had understood that it was not a war between India and Pakistan. It was a war of India and Bangladesh against Pakistan. Manekshaw devised a unique strategy during the liberation war. His strategy saved many lives during the war, said Mujahidul Islam Selim, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh. President of the Workers Party of Bangladesh, Rashed Khan Menon said governments of West Bengal and Assam had asked India's central government to intervene after Pakistan attacked Bangladesh. But Manekshaw opposed the proposal and devised a different idea that helped create an independent Bangladesh, said Menon. Veteran freedom fighter, Professor Ajay Roy said Manekshaw's friends would always call him Sam Bahadur for his great courage. Roy said Manekshaw stressed three things during the war  bringing all freedom fighters under unified command, forming a joint command comprising freedom fighters and the Indian army and ending the war as soon as possible. AK Khandker vowed to 'wage another liberation war' to press for the trial of war criminals. He demanded nomination of war criminals be cancelled in the national election. He said those who opposed the liberation of Bangladesh and trampled the flag of Bangladesh ended up driving on the city roads with that flag on their cars. "They want to turn democratic and secular Bangladesh into an Islamic state. It cannot be allowed," he said. bdnew
