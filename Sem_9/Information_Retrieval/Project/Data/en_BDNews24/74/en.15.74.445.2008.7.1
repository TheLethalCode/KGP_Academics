<TITLE> IEA chief says oil market very tight </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, July 1 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - The world oil market is very tight, leaving it vulnerable to several factors that could boost crude prices further, the head of the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. "The current market is very tight because of the low level of spare capacity in producer countries and the very low level of inventory in consuming countries," Nobuo Tanaka told Reuters at the World Petroleum Congress in Madrid. "So the buffer is very, very narrow, so geopolitical events, speculation over accidents, strikes or whatever push prices higher." Oil has hit record highs of more than $140 a barrel, driven by supply concerns and robust demand in developing countries. Tension between Israel and Iran, a major oil exporter, has also boosted prices. While the IEA has said the real reasons for rising prices are strong demand growth coupled with shortages of supply and refining capacity, Tanaka said the influence of speculators played a part. "Fundamentals decide the direction of the market, or the expectations of the people, where the price is going, and speculation exists there to amplify the volatility of the price," he said. The IEA, which advises 27 industrialized countries on energy policy, earlier on Tuesday issued its latest Medium-Term Oil Market Report, which said world oil supply would rise more slowly than expected by 2013. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries usually hold some production capacity idle to meet rises in demand or make up for shortages. But that reserve is expected to shrink to a minimal level by 2013, the IEA said in the report
