<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 06 (bdnews24.com)British High Commissioner Stephen Evans said Sunday that the acceptance of the next general election would depend upon the people of Bangladesh, not on the international community. Asked whether the upcoming general elections would be acceptable to the international community if BNP boycotted the polls, he said: "This issue is not whether the international community accepts the outcome of the elections; it is for the people of Bangladesh to accept the outcome of the election" "Clearly what is required is an election which is as inclusive as possible, that includes the political parties, that includes a wide range of candidates and crucially it involves and includes a wide range of voters," the high commissioner said. Evans also told reporters, at a press conference at his residence in Baridhara, that he was in favour of lifting the emergency and said it would be difficult to hold free, fair and credible elections under a state of emergency. "It is difficult to hold a free, fair and credible election with the state of emergency in place. I think there would always be a doubt about the credibility of the outcome of the election that takes place when you have a state of emergency in place," he said. It was the first press conference of the high commissioner since his arrival in Dhaka on June 23, held after he officially presented his credential to president Iajuddin Ahmed on Sunday "Everything that I have been told, everything that I have read and everything I have heard indicates that the caretaker government are determined that elections should take place as scheduled in December," said Evans who replaced Anwar Choudhury as the new British envoy. "Clearly we want to see progress towards lifting the state of emergency." The high commissioner stressed that the elections must be inclusive. "That's we are very supportive of dialogue between the caretaker government and the various political parties." "The best way of ensuring that things move on the right track is for all the stakeholders to talk among themselves and the structured dialogue which leads to the progress we all want to see," said Evans. bdne
