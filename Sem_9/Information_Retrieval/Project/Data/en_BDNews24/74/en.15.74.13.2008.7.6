 TBILISI, Sun Jul 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian officials said five explosions went off on both sides of the de-facto border between Georgia and its breakaway region of Abkhazia on Sunday, in the latest sign of growing tensions between Tbilisi and separatists. A series of incidents in the past week, involving bombs, mortar shelling and shootouts have been matched by sharp condemnations from Moscow and Tbilisi, as both sides blame each other for thawing what had been frozen conflicts. Georgia's rebel regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away from central rule during wars in the 1990s and are flashpoints for tensions with Russia, which provides financial support and has peacekeepers in both. "Four mines exploded today in the morning nearby to a village called Rukhi, in Georgia's Zubdidi region," Georgian Interior Ministry official Shota Utiashvili said. The fourth explosion went off under a police car as officers investigated the site after the initial blasts, slightly wounding the local deputy police chief, Utiashvili told Reuters. Georgian television showed the bomb-damaged car and policemen standing nearby at the scene. The fifth bomb went off in "territory which is de facto controlled by the Abkhaz side in the village of Otobia," Utiashvili said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev urged Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on Saturday to refrain from "stoking tensions" in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Medvedev's message to Saakashvili followed a shootout in South Ossetia and a bomb blast in Abkhazia. Tbilisi accuses Moscow of seeking to annex the regions, where the majority of the population hold Russian passports. Moscow denies such plans and in turn accuses Tbilisi of seeking to restore control over the provinces by force. Georgia, which seeks membership of NATO and the European Union, has said it wants to replace Russian peacekeepers currently stationed there with an international force. The region where the latest explosions took place is under Georgian control, but very close to the frontier with the breakaway region of Abhkazia A Russian commander in Abkhazia said the uniform of a Georgian special forces member was found wrapped around the remains of a shell that had been the source of the blasts, RIA news agency reported. "In the place of the explosion, there remained the uniform," assistant commander Alexander Novitsky was quoted as saying by RIA
