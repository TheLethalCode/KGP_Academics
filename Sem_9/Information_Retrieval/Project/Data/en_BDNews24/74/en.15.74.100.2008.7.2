 MADRID, July 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luis Aragones said on Wednesday he left his post as Spain coach because the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) did not want him to continue. The 69-year-old led Spain to victory at Euro 2008, their first major title in 44 years, but had consistently maintained he would step down after the tournament, four years after taking charge. Turkish club Fenerbahce have said they have a pre-agreement with him to join them on a two-year deal, which is expected to be completed in the coming days. "I don't accept those that say I wanted to leave. I admit I said everyone had a sell by date because there was no movement (from them)," Aragones said in an interview with sports daily Marca. "The Federation did not want me as coach. If they had wanted me they wouldn't have spoken to another while I was still working." Spanish media have reported former Real Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque is due to take over from Aragones, having already reached a verbal agreement with the Federation. RFEF secretary Jorge Perez said there was no possibility that Aragones would be offered an extension to stay on to coach the side to the World Cup in 2010. "Aragones said he would go publicly, to us, and to the sports director Fernando Hierro," Perez told sports daily AS. "The Federation stood by him when the opinion polls were against him because we believed in him and his work. Luis has achieved something historical for the country and he says goodbye in the best possible manner.
