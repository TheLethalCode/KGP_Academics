<TITLE> No guaranteed fall in commodity prices: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday that nobody could give any assurance regarding a fall in commodity prices. "No one can guarantee that the prices of commodities will come down as the market price is dependent on a number of factors such as economic policy, monetary policy and international market situation," the adviser told reporters after a meeting at the Secretariat. Mirza Aziz said the media had only partially quoted one of his remarks made last Saturday, in which he alluded to Shayesta Khan to describe the real scenario of current market prices. "I won't say that the allusion was explained wrongly. But the remark was published only partially. I wanted to say that we have to consider the related issues in any given economic situation." "It is unreal to expect a fall in market prices. We are continuing all possible efforts to control or curb prices." The adviser said that the government had taken three approachesincluding waiving of import duty on food commodities, cutting the prices of ingredients for the production of food, to help curb production costs, and curtailing corporate taxes. But even after those steps, prices are not falling due to the global market situation, Mirza Aziz said. The government has therefore initiated three separate welfare projects in hand to tackle the situation. They are creation of 100-day work programmes for rural people, pregnancy allowances and stipends for male students. "All the projects will help families increase their purchase power," the adviser said. On the fuel price hike, he said: "The government will still have to provide Tk 10,000 crore in subsidy to the energy sector. If prices were not increased the amount of subsidy would have been Tk 17,000 crore." "The increase is relatively low comparing to prices in the international market," the finance adviser said. Mirza Aziz had earlier held a meeting on the use of budget allocation to protect the country from the impact of climate change. The government has decided to create a foundation or trust to disburse the Tk 300 crore, allocated for the 2008-09 fiscal year in this regard. The board of trustees, however, will not be allowed to spend more than two-thirds of the allocation. The remaining money will be kept on account and any interest will be deposited to the trustees, who can also take foreign assistance if necessary, the adviser said. The World Bank and UNDP have already given positive response to the initiative, he added. A steering committee will also be formed with representatives of different ministries as members. bdnew
