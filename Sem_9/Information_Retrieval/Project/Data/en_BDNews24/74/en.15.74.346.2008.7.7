 KARACHI, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's limited-overs skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes Sri Lanka's new bowling weapon, unorthodox spinner Ajantha Mendis, will provide the sternest of tests for his side on their impending tour of the island. Playing in just his eighth international, Mendis used a dizzying array of deliveries to rip through the Indian batting order with figures of 6-13 as Sri Lanka eased to a 100-run victory in the Asia Cup final in Pakistan on Sunday. The 23-year-old was recognised as the man of the tournament for his 17-wicket contribution and his impact was highlighted by India's explosive wicketkeeper-batsman.

But when he bowls a flatter one it is generally a leg-spinner and when you play inside the line for turn you will be in trouble," Dhoni said. India announce their test squad on Wednesday and are expected to be boosted by the return of the experienced batting trio of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly. Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene said Mendis had given his team more options and was the perfect foil for the experienced Muttiah Muralitharan. "You can never discount Murali but Mendis is a confident bowler and he knows what he wants," Jayawardene said. "He is something new and he gives us more options to attack as he can be used in different ways
