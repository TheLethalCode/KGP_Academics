 OMAHA, Nebraska, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Phelps broke his own world record in the 200 metres individual medley at the U.S. Olympic swim trials on Friday, clocking a time of one minute, 54.80 seconds. Pushed to the wall by good friend and rival Ryan Lochte, Phelps sliced 0.18 seconds of his old mark of 1:54.98 set at last year's world championships in Melbourne.

With the win, Phelps has now qualified in four individual events for the Beijing Olympics and is aiming to beat Mark Spitz's record haul of seven gold medals at a single Game
