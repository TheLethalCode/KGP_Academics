 KABUL, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 32 people were killed and 35 injured when two buses collided head-on in Afghanistan, an official said on Tuesday. The incident happened on a highway in Ghazni province just before dusk on Monday, the provincial police chief said. "Two passenger buses hit each other nose-to-nose...in Gilan district of Ghazni province around 6:00 pm yesterday while traveling at high speed," Ali Shah Ahmadzai told Reuters. Five children and two women were among the victims, he said, adding the toll could rise as most of the injured were in critical condition and there was a lack of medical facilities and supplies at the scene. Monday's incident is the deadliest traffic accident in Afghanistan in recent years.
