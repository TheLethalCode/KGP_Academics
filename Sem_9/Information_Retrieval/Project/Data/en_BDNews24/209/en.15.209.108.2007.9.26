 DETROIT, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiations between United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp shifted into overdrive on Wednesday, with a marathon bargaining session stoking expectations the two sides are nearing a deal to end a national strike entering its third day. Officials from the union and the top US automaker met into Wednesday morning, extending talks that began on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported negotiators were working on final details of a four-year deal on wages and benefits that would create a trust fund to handle retiree healthcare and give GM free reign to hire new workers at lower wage rates, citing unnamed people familiar with the talks. Representatives for GM and the union could not be immediately reached for comment on the report. Talks between the two sides began 10 weeks ago. Over the weekend, GM and the UAW had appeared to be nearing a deal, before talks broke down over UAW insistence that GM commit to keep US factories working with future vehicles now in development. More than 73,000 UAW-represented workers walked out on Monday in the first national strike against GM since 1970. Most analysts expected a short strike, arguing that neither side can expect to profit from a prolonged walkout that would cost GM badly needed sales and force working families to get by on strike pay of just $200 per week. By Tuesday, the impact from the UAW-ordered shutdown of more than 80 GM facilities in the United States hit the automaker's plants in Canada and Mexico, which are closely aligned to the US operations and depend on them for some auto parts. Two GM plants in Ontario, Canada, shut down due to the strike, with the company reviewing the status of another plant, a GM spokesman for Canada said. GM employs 17,000 workers in Canada who could face layoffs because of the walkout. Canadian Auto Workers union President Buzz Hargrove said on Monday up to 100,000 Canadian workers could be out of a job if the US strike drags on. GM's production at three Mexican plants could be hit because of a pledge by the Teamsters union to stop hauling the company's vehicles across the border into the US market. "It does not take long for a significant work stoppage to ripple across the entire globe," said Scott Watkins, an Anderson Economic Group consultant. "The longer this goes on, the wider the impact across the country and the globe." UNION SAYS PUSHED INTO STRIKE The UAW has said the world's second-largest automaker pushed the union into striking by not showing a willingness to meet it halfway on crucial issues such as job security. Workers at more than 80 GM facilities around the United demonstrated on Tuesday with signs that read "UAW on Strike." Some wore T-shirts with a "UAW Strike 2007" logo. If the work stoppage continues, UAW workers will begin drawing $200 a week in strike pay from the union. The average GM assembly worker had been making about $1,100 per week. GM, Ford and Chrysler are seeking concessions from the UAW to close a labor cost gap with Toyota Motor Corp and other automakers operating in the United States. Negotiations between GM and the UAW included a GM proposal to cut healthcare costs by establishing a trust fund for retiree-related costs. Both sides agreed on the framework for such a plan over the weekend, according to people briefed on the talks. Under that plan, GM would shift responsibility for retiree healthcare to a new UAW-aligned trust fund known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA. Wall Street analysts have said establishing a VEBA could cut GM's annual costs by $3 billion in exchange for a one-off payment expected to top $30 billion. The UAW contract talks are seen as crucial to efforts by the Big Three Detroit-based automakers to recover from combined losses of $15 billion last year and sales difficulties that have driven their share of the US market below 50 percent. Although GM shares have slipped by about 5 percent from early highs on Monday before the UAW walked out on strike, the stock remains up almost 12 percent this month. bd
