 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  Supreme Court deputy registrar Abdul Razzak Dewan Tuesday filed a case with Shahbagh Police Station against four persons including a lawyer for bail fraud. This brings to five the number of such fraud detected in the Supreme Court. Four cases have so far been filed and three members of a fraud clique have been arrested. The Supreme Court Bar Council has been asked to take action against one lawyer. The four people accused in the latest case are advocate Sheikh Abdul Haque, pursuer Mohammad Ali and convicts Siraj Miah and Md Hannan. According to case details, Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court sentenced Siraj Miah and Md Hannan to 17 years in jail in an arms case. They appealed to the High Court against the verdict and the High Court has not bailed them. However, advocate Haque filed another appeal for the two in the High Court by suppressing the previous bail appeal and changing the FIR and the verdict, it was alleged in the case. He had managed bail for the accused. The forged documents showed the verdict for the two accused to be only five years in jail and the case under the Special Powers Act instead of an arms case. The High Court bailed the two on July 23, 2006. bdnews24
