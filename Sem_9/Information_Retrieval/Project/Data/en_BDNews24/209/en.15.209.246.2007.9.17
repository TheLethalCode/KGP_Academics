 BAGHDAD, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq pledged on Monday to punish foreign security contractors involved in an incident in western Baghdad in which 11 people were killed. An Interior Ministry spokesman said the contractors, working for a US security firm, "opened fire randomly at citizens" on Sunday after mortar rounds landed near their cars. "We formed a committee to investigate the incident and withdraw the licence from this company and also to deliver those who committed this act to the court," Brigadier-General Abdul-Karim Khalaf told Reuters. The US military said on Sunday security contractors working for the State Department were involved in an incident, but gave no further details. Khalaf said the contractors opened fire after two mortar rounds landed in Nusour Square in the western Baghdad district of Mansour. "By chance the company was passing by. They opened fire randomly at citizens," Khalaf said. Eleven people were killed, including one policeman, and 13 people were wounded, he said. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki condemned the shooting and vowed to punish the perpetrators and their employers. "We will work to punish and halt the work of the security company which conducted this criminal act," state television quoted him as saying. Thousands of private security contractors, many of them American and European, have worked in Iraq since the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. Many Iraqis believe they operate outside the law with little accountability either to the Iraqi government or US military forces. Khalaf did not say how many contractors were involved in the shooting. He said the investigating committee had gone to the scene and spoken to witnesses, and would also visit the company's compound in Baghd
