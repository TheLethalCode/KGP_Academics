 LONDON, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - London strengthened its position as the world's currency trading hub, raising its share of global foreign exchange trading to over a third of the $3.2 trillion a day turnover, a survey showed on Tuesday. Altogether $1.359 trillion a day now goes through the UK, amounting to 34.1 percent of global currency turnover, the Bank for International Settlements said in its latest triennial survey conducted in April. That is up from 31.3 percent in 2004 and widened the UK's gap over the second-placed United States in terms of FX market turnover, with the US share of average daily volume shrinking to 16.6 percent from 19.2 percent in 2004. "The geographical distribution of foreign exchange trading typically changes slowly over time, and the 2007 results are no exception," the BIS said in its report. "Among countries with major financial centres, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Singapore gained market share, while the shares of the United States and Japan dropped. In some cases, changing shares reflected the relocation of desks." Switzerland nearly doubled its share of the market to 6.1 percent from 3.3 percent three years ago. This was thanks to Swiss banking giant UBS, the second largest FX bank according to a survey by Euromoney magazine, moving its trading desk to Zurich from London in 2006. Japan's share dipped to 6 percent in 2007 from 8.3 percent in 2004 due largely to a weaker yen, the BIS said. Japan's dominant position as Asia's currency trading centre came under increasing pressure from regional centres on the back of broad growth in emerging Asian markets, particularly China. Singapore claimed 5.8 percent of turnover, up from 5.2 percent three years ago, while Hong Kong's share rose to 4.4 percent from 4.2 percent. "The increased share held by Hong Kong is likely to reflect the growing importance of China," said the Basel-based BIS, a forum for the world's central banks. Australia saw its share of the market rise to 4.2 percent from 3.4 percent three years ago. Interest in trading the Aussie dollar has grown thanks to the explosion in so-called carry trades, where investors borrow low-yielding currencies such as the yen to fund investments in higher yielding assets. In Europe, France, Denmark, Luxembourg and Belgium all increased their FX market slice. But Germany saw its share of the market fall by 50 percent to take just 2.5 percent of the market compared with 4.9 percent in 2004. Canada also saw its share of the foreign exchange market decline, to 1.5 percent from 2.2 percent in 2004.
