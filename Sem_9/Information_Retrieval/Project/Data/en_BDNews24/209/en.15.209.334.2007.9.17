<TITLE> Reforms imposed from outside unsustainable: Hua Du </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)Policy reforms imposed from outside the country cannot be sustainable, said the Asian Development Bank's country representative in Dhaka Monday. "Reforms must come from inside of the country," said ADB's resident representative in Bangladesh, Hua Du, referring to recent controversy stirred by the government's proposed adoption of the International Monetary Fund's 'policy support instrument'. Du made the remarks in response to reporters' questions following the launch of the Asian Development Outlook 2007 Update at its Gulshan office. The IMF is planning to replace its poverty reduction growth facility (PRGF) with the policy support instrument (PSI). The PRGF expired at the end of the last year, while the PSI will impose policy prescriptions on Bangladesh without IMF being required to provide a single penny in funding under the proposed package. In recent weeks, civil society, economists, the media and NGOs have spoken out against IMF's policy instrument, saying that the proposed PSI package will go against the country's sovereignty. They say it will not be wise of the interim government to strike such a policy level agreement now. Meanwhile, experts have questioned why the government is increasingly leaning toward IMF policy at a time when many countries, including the fund's major borrowers, have stopped seeking assistance from IMF. Turkey, Indonesia, Argentina and Brazil together account for 70 percent of IMF's outstanding loans. The countries have nevertheless announced their intention to repay their loans ahead of schedule to free themselves of the fund's policy prescriptions. As a result, outstanding IMF loans have more than halved to approximately $40 billion at the end of 2006 from $90 billion in 2004. "Debates have been going on globally over recent years over the roles of the IMF and the World Bank," Hua Du admitted, though she defended her own organisation saying that the ADB does not insist any country adopt its policies. Quite the opposite, she said. "We won't give any assistance if there is no ownership by the recipient country." Hua Du said the ADB has so far given Bangladesh $8.2 billion, of which $7.3 billion is in the form of soft loans.
