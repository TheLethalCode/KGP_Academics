<TITLE> N Rock suffers, Paulson says crisis not over </TITLE>

 LONDON, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Savers demanded their money back on Monday from the British bank hardest hit by the global credit crisis, while US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said financial market turbulence could continue for a while. Shares in UK mortgage lender Northern Rock plunged further as customers queued for a third day to withdraw funds, despite assurances their money was safe after its rescue on Friday by emergency Bank of England funding. Northern Rock, once a darling of the bank sector for its innovative use of financial markets for funding, has little exposure to high-risk debt. But it got into trouble when global worries about the widespread repackaging of poor-quality debt made banks reluctant to lend to each other in August. The Dutch central bank (DNB) said on Monday the credit crunch may force banks around the world to take back up to 1.2 trillion euros ($1.66 trillion) in debt onto their balance sheets if investors are unable to refinance it, but noted that would be "in an extreme scenario". Paulson, visiting Paris, cautioned: "It will take a while to work through the turbulence in capital markets." However he added: "We're doing so against a backdrop of a strong global economy." Financial markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut the US benchmark interest rate on Tuesday to help ease the squeeze, which risks hurting major economies by driving up market interest rates and tightening the terms set for companies and consumers to borrow. British mortgage lenders are set to make it more difficult and expensive for riskier consumers to take on big home loans, the head of the UK's Building Societies Association told Reuters in an interview on Monday. "We will see much slower house price growth over the next year than over the past few years but we will not see a recession," said Adrian Coles, director general of the BSA whose members account for about a fifth of the UK mortgage market. Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said the probability of a US recession was now slightly more than a third after earlier in the year putting the chances at one-third, The Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. But he also said his successors at the US central bank should be cautious about cutting interest rates because of inflation risks and he forecast home prices will drop further, according to interviews published on Sunday. Monday is a crucial day for financial markets as they discover how far borrowers have succeeded in meeting deadlines for refinancing tens of billions of dollars in commercial paper -- short-term debt used to fund longer term investments. But even if this hurdle is overcome the crisis could roll on for months as U.S. mortgage borrowers become due to refinance low early payments on their loans at higher interest rates. London interbank offered rates for three-month sterling deposits were fixed lower for the fourth straight day on Monday, but overnight rates were sharply up at 6.46875 percent, well above the Bank of England's 5.75 percent base rate, as the crisis at Northern Rock dominated market sentiment. In New York on Friday, Merrill Lynch & Co warned that shaky credit markets had forced it to reduce the value of securities linked to risky subprime mortgages and other products, a move that could hurt third-quarter profits. Investors will be watching third-quarter earnings results this week from four other big investment banks -- Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- to assess how deeply the credit crisis has cut. The US Treasury's Paulson acknowledged in Paris that bad lending practices were at fault in the crisis triggered by defaults on US mortgage debt, but defended innovative lending practices. "The whole world including the US has benefited from innovative financing techniques -- innovations like securitisation and credit availability," he told a joint news conference with French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde. Lagarde wants quick introduction of new rules to prevent a repeat of the credit turmoil. But Paulson said: "We want to make sure we don't rush to judgements." Paulson was due to meet British finance minister Alistair Darling in London later on Monday. Darling told the BBC earlier the pair agreed on the need for more discipline in the financial system. Paulson said that any differences between him and Darling were only a matter of "styl
