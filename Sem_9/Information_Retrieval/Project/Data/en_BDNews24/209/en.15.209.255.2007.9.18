 Sylhet, September 18 (bdnews24.com)A Sylhet court Tuesday sentenced Naser Rahman, son of former BNP finance minister Saifur Rahman, to nine-year imprisonment on charges of attempted extortion and physical assaults. The two co-accused Monwar Sadique, the then Roads and Highways Department engineer for Srimangal, and Fayezul Karim, Moulvibazar municipal chairman, were acquitted. Justice Binoy Kumar Majumdar of Sylhet Third Additional Sessions Judge's Court, handed down the verdict, which sentenced the convict to seven and two years in jail on the two counts of charges: demand for extortion and beatings. But the convict will have to serve a maximum of seven years as the sentences will run simultaneously. Nuruzzaman, a resident of Mirabazar in Sylhet, filed the case with Kotwali Police Station on Feb 16, accusing nine people including Saifur Rahman of demanding Tk 2 crore in illicit tolls for a contract on construction work. Saifur's name was taken off the list of the accused while the case was officially recorded on Feb 17. According to case details, Naser had demanded Tk 2 crore from the plaintiff when he got a Tk 32 crore contract to build part of the Fenchuganj-Srimangal Road. As Nuruzzaman refused to pay the money, Naser had his work order cancelled and the plaintiff did not get back Tk 2.85 crore in security deposit. The case details also mentioned that Naser had the plaintiff detained on Nov 18 2003 at Srimangal Police Station for not meeting his demand. Nuruzzaman was assaulted in police custody, it was alleged. bdnews24.com/cor
