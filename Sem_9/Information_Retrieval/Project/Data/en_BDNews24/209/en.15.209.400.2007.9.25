<TITLE> Pre-election identity scheme resumes in Ivory Coast </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ABIDJAN, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A controversial scheme to give identity papers to thousands of people in Ivory Coast and enable many of them to vote was relaunched on Tuesday, in a step forward for the war-divided country's peace process. Identity was a root cause of the 2002-2003 civil war, which left the nation split into a rebel-held north and government- controlled south. Rebels said people from the largely Muslim north were treated as foreigners by southern Christian tribes. Justice Minister Mamadou Kone presented jeeps and stationery sets to the first teams of judges and government officials who would deploy in two localities in the north and south to start identity hearings. The scheme is key to the country's peace process but is eyed with suspicion by supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo who fear non-nationals supporting the opposition may fraudulently obtain Ivorian nationality and swell the voting register. The scheme ran for several months last year before grinding to a halt after a political dispute over which documents should be issued at the "mobile court" hearings which are usually set up in town halls or public buildings. Kone said he hoped a new consensus over the running of the hearings would ensure the operation's success this time round. "We hope that today this launch will be the good one because we are starting from a clearer basis than in the past," Kone told the officials who met at the Justice Ministry building. The peace process in the world's top cocoa grower saw little progress since a 2003 ceasefire until a breakthrough deal last March between Gbagbo and rebel leader Guillaume Soro, who agreed upon reunification through disarmament and elections. Post-war tensions quickly eased following the deal but progress up to now has mostly involved ceremonial reunions between the former foes. That would change if the identification scheme succeeded. Apart from the future disarmament process, identification is one of the most tricky aspects of the peace deal in terms of garnering political support among Gbagbo supporters as well as logistical constraints. Scores of teams of judges and also doctors who will seek to determine the age of individual applicants, will gradually be deployed around the country for the process which is supposed to last three months but which analysts expect to last much longer. Fuelling fears that accusations of fraud could resurface, the head of Gbagbo's FPI party said recently only 300,000 people required documents, a fraction of the government's estimate of up to 3.5 milli
