 Wanderers, Johannesburg, Sep 18 (BBC/bdnews24.com)  Leg-spinner Shahid Afridi starred with the ball to help a much-improved Pakistan to thrash Sri Lanka by 33 runs Tuesday in the Twenty20 Super Eights match in Johannesburg. Afridi picked up the wickets of Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene (28) and Chamara Silva (38) to finish with three for 18, while Mohammed Asif chipped in with two important wickets. A partnership of 101 between Shoaib Malik (57) and Younus Khan (51) steered Pakistan to on 189 for six after they were reduced to 33 for three. Lasith Malinga (3-43) and Dilhara Fernando (2-17) shone for Sri Lanka. Jayawardene had won the toss and opted to bowl first on a wicket which has seen its share of runs since the very start of the tournament. The seamers gave the Lankans early breakthrough when Chaminda Vaas had Imran Nazir caught at cover off the third over. Dilhara Fernando then comprehensively bowled Salman Butt (12), who was attempting to make room on the leg-side, and a fine yorker took care of Mohammad Hafeez (10) to leave Pakistan struggling at 33 for three. It was left up to captain Malik and Younus to consolidate Pakistan's innings and give their bowlers something to defend. The captain was the more dominant of the pair, but Younus began to unleash his array of strokes in the 13th over, smashing Jayasuriya for two sixes along with a reverse sweep four. The pair brought up the 100 partnership from just 53 balls. Younus's entertaining innings came to an end when he attempted to loft Malinga back over his head, but only succeeded in finding the safe hands of Tillekeratne Dilshan at long-off. The dismissal brought the dangerous Afridi to the crease, but it was his captain who continued the onslaught, mowing Gayan Wijekoon over the deep mid-wicket boundary for another fine six. Malinga eventually removed Malik but big-hitting at the end of the innings from Afridi (17 from nine balls) and Misbah-ul-Haq (16 from six balls) helped Pakistan to a very competitive total. Sri Lanka made the worst possible start when opener Upul Tharanga top-edged Mohammed Asif to Umar Gul at third man off the second ball of the day. His opening partner Jayasuriya soon followed when he was cleaned up by Sohail Tanvir, who had dropped him in the previous ball, in the next over to leave the World Cup finalists struggling at six for two. Sangakkara and Jayawardene attempted to rebuild after Sri Lanka's faltering start, but Sangakkara's innings came to an end when he deflected the ball off his arm onto his stumps. Jayawardene and Chamara Silva began to build a promising partnership, taking advantage of indiscipline from one Asif over to plunder 22, which included two free hits for two no-balls. But Sri Lanka's hopes of victory faded when captain Jayawardene was caught on the mid-wicket boundary by Mohammad Hafeez off Afridi for 28. Silva continued to attack but his risky attacking strategy cost him his wicket as he was bowled attempting to smash Afridi across the line for 38. Mubarak, who had scored an incredible 46 runs from 12 balls against Kenya, could not repeat his heroics and he tamely top-edged Gul to mid-wicket for a simple catch for Afridi at mid-wicket. With all aspirations of victory gone, Dilshan threw the bat at everything, hitting 38 runs before he was caught on the boundary by Younus off Hafeez.
