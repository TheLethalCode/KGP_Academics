 ZURICH, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prices for luxury goods rose twice as fast as consumer prices this year, a study showed, showing the jet set needs even more to fund its lavish lifestyle. Forbes's Cost of Living Extremely Well Index (CLEWI) -- which measures the price of a basket of luxury goods -- rose by 6 percent in the year to August 2007, Forbes said, more than twice the US consumer inflation rate. "The bottom line is, if you have money and you want to spend it you're going to spend it," said Scott DeCarlo at Forbes. "A normal consumer may pull back, but if you're buying any of these items I don't think the cost of inflation will have any effects," he also said.

In the Forbes index several items showed double-digit price rises compared to a year ago. A catered dinner serving 40 at Ridgewells, Bethesda, Maryland, rose by a third to $9,795, representing the index's heftiest price rise. A yearling race horse from championship lines is $710,247, up 14 percent. A Russian sable fur coat from Maximilian at Bloomingdale's cost $225,000, up 18 percent, while a facelift at the American Academy of Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery rose 17 percent to $17,000. But the standard fee for 45 minutes with a psychiatrist in New York's Upper East Side is unchanged at $300 for 45 minutes, one bright spot for those in despair over rising pric
