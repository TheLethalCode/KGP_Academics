 HONG KONG, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on Monday after four straight weeks of gains, with expectations of a US interest rate cut later this week offset by renewed concerns about a global credit squeeze. Those credit worries were also expected to weigh on European stocks, with financial bookmakers predicting Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 will open lower. A public holiday in Japan kept the yen bound in a tight range, but spot gold climbed towards $711 an ounce and was within sight of a 16-month high of $717 set last Friday, buoyed by safe-haven plays. News on Friday that Britain's financial authorities had stepped in to rescue mortgage lender Northern Rock, which fell victim to the sharp rise in borrowing costs between banks, renewed worries about the credit market. "The development is clearly unsettling for investors and highlights that the subprime credit market crisis will take some time to resolve," said Guy Hutchings, chief executive at MFS Investment Management in Australia. But hopes are high that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark Fed funds rate by at least 25 basis points at its policy setting meeting on Tuesday to help take the heat off those credit concerns. By 0615 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had slipped 0.4 percent, reteating slightly after four weeks of gains. The index has risen about 21 percent from a five-month trough on Aug. 17 and was just 3.8 percent below a July 24 life high. Financial markets in Japan were closed for Respect for the Aged Day holiday and will reopen on Tuesday. Investors sold some bank shares on renewed credit worries, knocking Australia's Commonwealth Bank down 0.6 percent and National Australia Bank down 1.5 percent. South Korean exporters such as steel maker POSCO were also under a bit of pressure after China, their top export market, raised interest rates on Friday for a fifth time this year to rein in inflation. But investors snapped up Oil Search on takeover hopes, fuelled by a report that Chinese oil giant PetroChina may make a US$5 billion bid, sending the stock up nearly 12 percent. Major markets in the region were flat to mostly softer, but China's Shanghai Composite Index advanced 1.7 percent and was near a record high set on Sept. 6 as investors shrugged off Friday's 0.27 percentage-point hike to deposit and lending rates, announced after the market close. "The latest rate hike was widely expected, so its impact was muted," said analyst Cao Xuefeng at West China Securities. "But the index has already jumped this year, and the potential for it to rise sharply again in the short term is limited." The dollar was little changed versus the Japanese currency, easing a touch to 115.23 yen while the euro bought nearly 160 yen not far from late New York levels on Friday. Against the dollar, the single currency fetched $1.3880, still within striking distance of a record high just above $1.39 set late last week. Growing expectations of a US rate cut had pressured the dollar against most other major currencies. "With key US economic data printing softer and with inflation having eased in the past few months, the case for lowering the fed funds rate would be building even in the absence of the recent strains in the financial system," said Darren Gibbs, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. But former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed should be careful not to cut rates too aggressively because of inflation risks, according to interviews published on Sunday. Also subdued, US crude edged down 46 cents to $78.64 a barrel, extending its pullback from a record high above $80 set on Friday, while Shanghai copper was broadly steady and expected to remain so until after the Fed meeti
