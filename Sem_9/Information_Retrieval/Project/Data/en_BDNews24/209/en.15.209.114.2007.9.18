<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com) Detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia seeks legal advice on how to appeal in the case against her, which has now been brought under emergency powers rules, her lawyer said Tuesday. Khaleda's lawyer Barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim told reporters: "As the case in which she was arrested has been included under emergency powers rules, she (Khaleda) wanted to know the latest position of the case from me." "She wanted to know what can be done at this stage," Ashim told reporters after visiting the former prime minister at the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises. Barrister Ashim said: "We must go to the High Court if bail cannot be sought at the trial court." The court or tribunal of appeal mentioned in the emergency powers rules does not mean the Supreme Court, the lawyer said. "The leader herself knows that in this case bail cannot be sought. She is respectful of the law." "She asked us all to discuss the matter and take decision regarding the appeal in the High Court. We are considering appointing several senior lawyers including barrister Rafique-ul Huq in this regard." "Besides the legal battle will continue for all the leaders and workers of the party who have been subjected to arrest or harassment after the promulgation of the emergency powers rules," he said. Asked whether the BNP chairperson has appointed Hannan Shah as the party's chief coordinator, Ashim said, "Hannan Shah will provide all-out cooperation for the BNP secretary general. He will work the way he did in the past." "Khaleda Zia conveyed her Ramadan greetings to the people," the lawyer added. Khaleda also expressed concern on Tuesday over the security of her Moinul Road home in the Dhaka Cantonment. Lawyer Abdul Wadud Khondoker told reporters after visiting Khaleda in the afternoon: "Khaleda Zia's house at Moinul Road has remained unprotected after the arrest of the former prime minister and her son Arafat Rahman." "Nobody is staying there now. Khaleda has urged the government to ensure the security of her house so that no one can do any break and enter into the house," he added. Replying to a question, Abdul Wadud said: "Thirteen people are accused in the case in which Khaleda Zia has been arrested. But none of the accused other than Khaleda Zia and her son has been arrested." "It proves that the case was filed with a motive." bdnews2
