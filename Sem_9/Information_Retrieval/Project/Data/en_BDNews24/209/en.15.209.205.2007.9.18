 MINSK, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian man was caught trying to use a metal cup to burrow under the border between Belarus and the European Union, Belarus border guards said on Tuesday. The 19-year-old Russian was detained by border guards as he embarked on his great escape to EU member Poland by digging under the border. "The man tried to tunnel under the security system and at this interesting moment was detained by border guards," a spokesman for the border guards said. "He would have had to tunnel for about 1 kilometre (half a mile) to get to Poland," the spokesman said. It was unclear why the man was using a cup to dig his tunnel. He also had army rations, camouflage, maps and a textbook on survival. The man, who faces a fine of about $300, said he was heading for Germany to see his girlfriend. But border guards suspect he wanted to go to France to join the Foreign Legion.
