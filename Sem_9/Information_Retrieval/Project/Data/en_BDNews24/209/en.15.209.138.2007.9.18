 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik was sent to jail after he surrendered to court Tuesday as he has been facing an arrest order in connection with the August rioting on the campus. Bhowmik, provost of Jagannath Hall, is the second to turn himself in to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court after Dhaka University Teachers Association president Prof Sadrul Amin, who is in jail. The police charged four DU teachers with having roles in the campus violence: Anwar Hossain, Harun-or-Rashid, Sadrul Amin and Nimchandra Bhowmik. Security officials had arrested Prof Anwar and Prof Rashid earlier on charges of breaching the emergency powers rules. Prof Bhowmik's lawyers Syed Rezaur Rahman, Subrata Chowdhury, Parimal Chandra Guha and Habibur Rahman Showkat went to chief metropolitan magistrate Jalal Ahmed and appealed for his division in the jail. The lawyers told him that three other Dhaka University teachers accused in the same case had been granted division in jail, which was why Prof Bhowmik also deserved division. "I will give the same order for him as I had given for the other accused in the case," CMM Ahmed said to them. The court directed jail authorities to properly treat Prof Bhowmik but did not order them to give him division. Before his surrender at 9:30am, Prof Bhowmik told bdnews24.com in the room of the Dhaka Bar Association executive council president, "I was surprised to know from television news on September 13 night that my name was in the two charge sheets of the case. "I was not involved with the incident at any stage from the beginning to the end. My stand is always for peace. I hope the matter can be resolved. I believe in the rule of law." Claiming that he had been accused without any reason, Prof Bhowmik said, "I always worked for the human rights of the repressed and minorities." As many as 36 persons including four teachers of Dhaka University have been named in the charge sheets submitted in 13 cases filed in connection with the August rioting on the campus. A total of 53 cases had been filed with different police stations in Dhaka over the campus violencetwo of them for setting fire to an army vehicle at Shahbagh. Police have arrested 12 of them including Dhaka University professors Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid. Sub-inspector Sirajul Islam and Babul Hossain Bhuiyan submitted charge sheets in the cases no 53 and 54 filed with Shahbagh Police Station under emergency powers rules. Professors Hossain and Rashid were accused in case no 54 and professors Amin and Bhowmik were accused in case no 53. The two charge sheets were submitted on September 9. bdnews24.co
