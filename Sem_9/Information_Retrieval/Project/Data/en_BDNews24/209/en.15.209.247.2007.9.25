 New York, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday called for renewed efforts to promote 'carbon-neutral' economic growth. "For this, developed economies must commit to transferring environment-friendly technologies at preferential terms," the CA said in a speech on climate change as his first official programme as part of his visit to attend the 62nd session of United Nations General Assembly in New York. He co-chaired the session on climate change with the prime minister of the Netherlands. Fakhruddin said: "The high-level gathering this morning demonstrates that we are collectively and unswervingly determined to address the acute threat posed by climate change." "Climate change must be addressed now, and it must be addressed decisively. The price of inaction would be too high," he said in the speech, released by the Press Information Department in Dhaka. Fakhruddin referred to Bangladesh's floods, one of the worst spells in recent times, which inundated more than one third of the country. "In the face of such a deluge, there is little we can do to prevent significant damage." On efforts to promote "carbon-neutral" economic growth, he said developing countries, especially the LDCs, cannot afford to bear the full cost of technological up-gradation of their economies. "Our efforts to address climate change should not disproportionately tax the poorer nations. "The post-Kyoto regime must generate new funds to facilitate development of technologies for a carbon neutral future in a scale that matches evolving requirements. It must also ensure transfer of these technologies to countries like Bangladesh to help secure their energy requirements. Fakhruddin underscored the need for adaptationnecessary to cope with the unavoidable dimensions of climate change. "Adequate physical, economic and institutional capacities can reduce the vulnerability of high-risk communities and groups. Access to appropriate adaptation technologies and know-how at affordable terms is critical. "Adaptation to climate change, however, requires a long-term perspective. It needs investmenthuman and capital." The chief adviser said: "Without sufficient and targeted funding, it may end up as empty rhetoric. The provisions and mechanisms in the existing framework have failed to secure resources flood waters recede." "Deforestation, inadequate carbon sequestration, soil erosion, global warmingall of these are part of the growing menace that is climate change. "There is growing concern that an irreversible climatic shift will displace millions of people worldwide. By some estimates, a one meter sea-level rise will submerge about one-third of the total area of Bangladesh, there by uprooting 25-30 million of our people. "We must take into account two important factors herethat the sea-level rise is an inevitable reality on our current trajectory and that the people who will be affected are the least able to cope with the consequences. "They are most likely to become refugees of climate change. We cannot afford to remain idle until this misfortune actually unfolds. The time to act cannot be delayed. The very first step is to recognise the responsibility of all nations towards the refugees of climate change. "In particular, the post-Kyoto regime should ensure that such refugees are granted the legal rights required to provide for their recovery and rehabilitation. "Scientists have long warned us that a 'business as usual' approach will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Drastic measures are now required. Unless we stem the tide of emissions, the increase in global temperatures and sea levels may accelerate. "Delay will mean greater risks and higher costs. An effective response to climate change challenges must strike a balance between mitigation and adaptation. "We urge all major emitters to collectively establish and implement a global target to stabilise the atmosphere over the short, radium and long term. The principle of common but differentiated required to finance the adaptation deficit." The chief adviser said future framework should include specific commitments towards servicing the current and future adaptation needs and priorities of the most vulnerable economies.
