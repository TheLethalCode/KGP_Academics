 PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 500 Malaysian lawyers held a rare protest rally on Wednesday to demand reforms to the country's judiciary after a scandal erupted over claims of political meddling in the appointment of judges. Lawyers dressed in court attire of white shirts and black trousers or skirts gathered outside the Palace of Justice, an imposing new granite-and-marble court complex, in what organisers described as the biggest protest ever staged by lawyers. "We have concerns about the administration of justice," Ambiga Sreenevasan, president of Malaysia's Bar Council, told Reuters as riot police, wearing helmets and armed with shields and batons, guarded the entrance to the court building. Sreenevasan said the lawyers wanted to march to the prime minister's office about 2 km (1.2 miles) away to urge the government to call a royal commission of inquiry into judicial appointments. "We are walking because we want to strengthen the judiciary and we want reforms. There are larger issues at stake," she said. Last week, the opposition released a video purporting to show a senior lawyer boasting to a judge of his ability to influence appointments. It touched a nerve in the judiciary, whose reputation has been under question since the late 1980s. On Tuesday, the government ordered a special inquiry into the video but stopped short of a royal commission of inquiry, which has special powers to subpoena evidence and witnesses. The opposition labelled the move as inadequate. The Bar Council, which says it represents all of the country's roughly 12,000 lawyers, welcomed the government's initial step but said it should convene a royal commission. "There ought to be a royal commission of inquiry because a royal commission of inquiry will have more powers in relation to the production of evidence," said Sreenevasan, who wore a blue "Walk for Justice" button on her blouse. "We are also handing over a memorandum for the establishment of a judicial appointments commission.
