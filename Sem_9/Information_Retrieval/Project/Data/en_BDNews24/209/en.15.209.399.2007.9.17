 Rajshahi, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com) -- A Rajshahi tribunal Monday framed charges against six Rajshahi University teachers, including former vice-chancellor Saeedur Rahman Khan, in a case filed for demonstrations and ransacking on campus. The six accused teachers were produced before the metropolitan speedy trial tribunal and Judge Fazlul Karim Chowdhury framed the charges against them on allegations of violating the emergency powers rules in the August rioting. The court fixed Sept 23 for the beginning of depositions in the case. Five other accused teachers are Abdus Sobhan, Moloy Kumar Bhowmik, Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun. Five lawyers including Advocate Mansur Rahman defended them in court. In connection with the Rajshahi University demonstrations, law enforcers arrested Prof Saeedur Rahman and Prof Abdus Sobhan on the night of Aug 23 and Prof Moloy Kumar Bhowmik on Aug 24. Motihar police on Aug 25 took them to court on charges of violating emergency powers rules. Metropolitan magistrate Rabiul Islam ordered the three into jail. Motihar police chief Ferdous Ahmed submitted chargesheets against the teachers on Sept 1. Of the six, three teachers of mass communication surrendered to court and were sent to jail. Earlier, the court quashed another case filed under emergency powers rules against Saeedur Rahman, Abdus Sobhan and Moloy Kumar. bdnews24.c
