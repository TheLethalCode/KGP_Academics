<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- The United States on Monday called on Myanmar's military rulers to act with restraint toward tens of thousands of people including Buddhist monks engaged in mass street protests against the junta. "We are consulting with allies and friends in the region on ways to encourage inclusive dialogue between the regime and those seeking freedom, as well as encouraging the regime to show restraint and be respectful of the people who are making their views known and simply want freedom," White House press secretary Dana Perino said. She said the U.S. embassy was closely watching the situation in the south Asian country, which has seen the biggest demonstrations since the military crushed student-led protests nearly 20 years ago. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, will be among the topics that US President George W Bush will raise in his address on Tuesday to the UN General Assembly, the White House said.
