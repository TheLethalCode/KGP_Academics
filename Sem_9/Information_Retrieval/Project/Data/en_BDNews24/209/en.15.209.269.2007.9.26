<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  The election arbitration committee of the FBCCI Tuesday dropped five voters, including Annisul Huq of BGMEA, from the final voter list for the Nov 20 election to the apex business body. The four other voters are: Faisal Samad, Mohammad Abdus Salam, ABM Shamsuddin and Ferdous Parvez Bivan. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association called a press conference for Wednesday to protest the decision by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which Annisul Huq, a former BGMEA president, said was "illegal". "It cannot be accepted. The election arbitration committee made an illegal decision without leaving scope for self-defence," Huq told bdnews24.com by phone. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told bdnews24.com that it was a BGMEA member who had filed a complaint with court, challenging its recent election. "As the complaint is pending, the five BGMEA members have to qualify for FBCCI elections through a legal procedure," Hossain told bdnews24.com. Annisul Huq said: "The three of the four arbitration committee members worked against us. We will fight it out." "We are going to ask all FBCCI voters to reject the decision," he said, adding that more will come from the afternoon press conference. bdn
