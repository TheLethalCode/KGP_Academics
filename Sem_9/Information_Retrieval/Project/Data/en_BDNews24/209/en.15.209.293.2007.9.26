<TITLE> VIP expatriate bank clients to come under extra scrutiny </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank Tuesday asked all commercial banks to exercise more caution in opening and operating bank accounts of expatriate clients with VIP status. "The central bank issued the directive to help implement the United Nations Convention against Corruption and recommendation No. 6 of the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF)," Abul Kashem, Bangladesh Bank's executive director and head of the Money Laundering Prevention Division, told bdnews24.com. A central bank circular said: "Any foreign head of state, top politician, high ranking government official, top executive in a state-owned corporation, important political personality or top businessmen and their family members will be considered VIPs in this connection." Kashem said: "Like many other countries in the world, Bangladesh has also formally adopted this arrangement to comply with FATF's conditions." Central bank officials said FATF was founded by G-8 members in 1988 and is the apex global organisation in the fight against money laundering and terror financing. FATF monitors the issues in all United Nations countries and has made 49 legislative recommendations. Countries deemed not to be cooperating with the recommendations are classed as a non-cooperative country or territory (NCCT). The circular said that a 'risk management mechanism' should be in place to detect potential problems and that banks should determine VIP clients' sources of funds before doing business with them. The circular also advised bank staff to seek endorsement from the highest level in the bank before establishing business relations with clients included on the watch list. FATF last visited Bangladesh in 2003 with their next visit slated for November. bdnews24
