<TITLE> Corruption in India fading slowly, says watchdog </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Petty bribery is still rampant in India and remains an obstacle to business, but graft on a grander scale was becoming less common, the head of an international anti-corruption group said on Wednesday. Businesses that have to get urgent freight through customs are particularly stung by low-level corruption, said Alexandra Wrage, president of TRACE, a non-profit group that advocates greater transparency on behalf of businesses. "It's the hassle factor," she said in an interview. "It's the opportunistic 'Joe-bureaucrat' trying to make five bucks. More than anything it's a huge waste of management time." Wrage was speaking on the same day global corruption watchdog Transparency International released its annual global index of corruption perceptions for 2007. India is still perceived as a corrupt country, the index showed.

This has happened partly because it is increasingly seen as a needless expense, and partly because recent corporate scandals have placed international companies -- and their local contractors -- under greater scrutiny. Technology and automation have also reduced the number of opportunities where people can ask for a bribe, whether it be ticket machines at railway stations or increasing automation in bidding for government contracts. While many Indian businesses have started to take a stand against corruption, the government was still too tolerant, Wrage said. "It has to have zero tolerance. I think there's a very low risk in lining your own pocket and we have to ratchet up that risk," she said, referring to unpunished corruption within the bureaucra
