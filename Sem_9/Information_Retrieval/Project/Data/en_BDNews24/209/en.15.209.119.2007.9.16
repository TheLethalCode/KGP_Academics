<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)Journalists and other employees of Bangla-language daily Jai Jai Din have been on strike over the last four days demanding overdue salaries. The strike began Thursday with an hour's work stoppage from 6pm. Since then, the newspapermen have been striking for two hours daily up to Sunday. In a meeting Sunday, employees gave Jai Jai Din's management an ultimatum of 48 hours to disburse their due wages. However, chief reporter Masud Kamal told bdnews24.com: "It wasn't a formal meeting. We just sat together and asked the authorities to clear our dues before Eid." The daily two-hour strike will continue until their demand is met and another meeting on Tuesday will announce their future action if the demand goes unmet, he added. The newspaper's editor Shafik Rehman refrained from making any comment on the issue. "I am too busy now with my writing," he told bdnews24.com Sunday. But in reply to a question, he did say: "There is no possibility of shutting down the newspaper in the near future. The ownership has been handed over to HRC Group and they are running it. I am just the editor." The organisation has not paid due salaries since mid-July. The employees are now demanding their salary for September in addition to their overdue wages before Eid. bdnews24
