<TITLE> Govt to release comprehensive list of graft suspects: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  No new list of corruption suspects will be made after a comprehensive list is published by the end of September, said adviser MA Matin Monday. "The taskforces will not launch any more drives against corruption suspects after that date," said Matin, who also chairs the national coordination committee on curbing serious crimes. "It has already investigated 142 graft cases. Some of the allegations have already been investigated and the offenders prosecuted." "Some cases have not yet been filed. The Anticorruption Commission will handle these reports," Matin said. The ACC aims to complete all investigations and prosecutions currently underway by the end of 2008, he added. "If new cases are pursued we will never be able to clear the present workload within the allotted time," the adviser said. "That's why we have decided to limit the number of cases, both new and old to 220," he said. The communications adviser also said that those accused in corruption cases are not being detained just because of their political identity. Matin spoke to reporters after a meeting with regional chief engineers and other officials to discuss plans to repair roads and highways damaged by the recent flooding. bdnews24.com
