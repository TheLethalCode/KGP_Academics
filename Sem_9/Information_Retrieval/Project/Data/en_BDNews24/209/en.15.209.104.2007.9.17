Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who led the drive to force Gonzales out, said Mukasey had the potential to become a consensus nominee. "While he is certainly conservative, Judge Mukasey seems to be the kind of nominee who would put rule of law first and show independence from the White House," said Schumer, who is from New York, where Mukasey spent his career. "For sure, we'd want to ascertain his approach on such important and sensitive issues as wiretapping and the appointment of US attorneys but he's a lot better than some of the other names mentioned." While on the federal bench in New York for nearly two decades, Mukasey presided over a number of high-profile cases, including one in which a dozen people were tied to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Cent
