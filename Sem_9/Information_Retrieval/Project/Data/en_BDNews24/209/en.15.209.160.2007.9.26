<TITLE> Japan PM Fukuda's support rate near 60 pct : survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda garnered a support rate of almost 60 percent in the first public opinion poll published after the seasoned moderate took office and tapped veteran ministers for his new cabinet. Kyodo news agency said 57.8 percent of respondents to its nationwide survey backed Fukuda's new cabinet, formally installed on Wednesday, a day after the 71-year-old lawmaker was chosen by parliament to succeed Shinzo Abe. The survey was conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday. Abe's support rates had slid to below 30 percent before his shock Sept. 12 resignation, battered by a series of scandals and gaffes among cabinet members and voter anger over mismanagement of the public pension system that contributed to the ruling camp's humiliating defeat in a July upper house election. "It's higher than expected, given that Fukuda is reserved and hasn't taken any action that stands out," said Yasunori Sone, a political science professor at Keio University in Tokyo. "One thing is clear, people really disliked Abe." The long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) picked 71-year-old Fukuda as its leader to revive party fortunes after a disastrous year of scandals and election defeat under Abe. Fans of Fukuda, chief cabinet secretary under Abe's popular predecessor Junichiro Koizumi, have welcomed his milder style after Koizumi's five years of combative reforms and 12 months of scandals and upsets under Abe. But his selection with the support of LDP factions has raised fears of backpedalling on efforts to rein in Japan's huge public debt as a struggling LDP, which has held power for most of the past five decades, seeks to woo back voters. Fukuda's support rates had been expected to show a rise compared to Abe's in his final troubled days, and analysts said the key was whether and how long the high levels would last. "When it starts out this high, it could last for a while, but we won't know until parliament starts." Fukuda faces a divided parliament, where the main opposition Democratic Party and its small allies control the upper house and can delay legislation. Debate is expected to resume next week after a gap sparked by Abe's decision to resign. Some sceptics discounted the early strong showing as merely polite applause from the public for their new leader. "This is what you call a celebratory gift. It's Japanese culture to support someone when something good happens to them," said political commentator Minoru Morita, adding that Fukuda's go-slow approach to reforms probably appealed to many voters now. "When the celebratory mood dies down, his support rate will fall," Morita said. "Within a month Mr Fukuda's support will be below 50 percent. It has been the same for prime ministers in the pas
