<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday ordered a seven-day freeze on the export of 187 antiquities from Bangladesh to France for exhibition at Guimet Museum in Paris. An HC bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Md Farid Ahmed also issued a rule nisi on the government to explain why it should not be directed to adopt measures to protect the antiquities of "special artistic interest and historic importance". The court also asked the government to explain why an appropriate procedure "shall not be followed in sending the antiquities aboard". The court order came in a public interest litigation filed by Dr MA Kamal Yuree and six others challenging the process of exporting the antiquities to Paris for exhibition on Oct 24. "The antiquities which are now at Zia International Airport, packaged by Homebound Courier Services, will remain there until further order by the High Court," Barrister Tania Amir, counsel for the petitioners, told reporters. On behalf of the petitioners, Tania argued that the government has "illegally" taken steps to export the centuries-old antiquities which were removed from display in museums in Bangladesh. Of them, 45 are from the National Museum, 118 from the Department of Archaeology Bangladesh and 24 from Varendra Research Museum. Tania alleged that the government had moved to export the unique masterpieces without ensuring proper insurance value, with undue risks and appointing a protocol officer who is found "guilty of corruption and smuggling antiquities". The lawyer further argued that the process of sending the items for exhibition is part of a conspiracy to grab the precious antiquities. In the writ petition, it is said that the government issued a memo on July 31 saying that the cultural affairs secretary signed an agreement with the French ambassador in Bangladesh. "The cultural affairs secretary is not legally authorised to enter into such agreement, which is against the national interest." The High Court asked the cultural affairs, foreign affairs, home and law secretaries, director general of the National Museum, the director of the Department of Archaeology, the treasurer of Varendra Research Museum and the Homebound Courier Service to explain. bdnews
