<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Abdul Kader Siddiqui, the Krishak-Sramik-Janata League president, Sunday called for banning war criminals from the general elections. He also demanded the Election Commission take away Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh party's daripalla or scales of justice polls logo. "Jamaat's anti-liberation, pro-Pakistani atrocities are clearly documented. We have asked for revoking their registration as well as their logo," Kader told reporters after the party's electoral reform meeting with the EC. "Jamaat's election symbol is the scales, which stand for justice all over the world. Isn't that ironic?" "We have proposed measures to bar those who directly opposed the 1971 War of Liberation and took an active part in the looting, killing and organised rapes committed by the occupying forces and their accomplices." Kader said his party proposals included allowing political parties to have overseas branches and making them reserve a third of central committee seats for women. The KSJL also proposed cancellation of Tk 5 lakh security deposit required for contesting more than one seat and appointing district judges or officers of equal status as returning officers in elections. A 10-member KSJL delegation met the EC panel in a three-hour discussion. EC secretary M Humayun Kabir later told reporters that once all parties had completed formal discussions, the EC would forward the recommendations to the government. "All political parties will have to register when the draft electoral legislation is made into law. The parties will then be awarded new election symbols," he said. The EC is scheduled to hold electoral reform talks with political parties until November. bdnews24
