 Johannesburg, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mohammad Ashraful is sanguine about a semifinal spot ahead of Bangladesh's second ICC Twenty20 World Championship Super Eights game against Sri Lanka at Wanderers Tuesday. "We have not gone down or anything. We can lift ourselves and finish very well in the next games," a confident Asraful was quoted by Bangladesh Cricket Board's official site tigercricket.com as saying. The Tigers then take on Pakistan in Cape Town on Sept 20 in their last Super Eights match. A sensational win against the West Indies that dumped the Caribbeans out and a sparkling start against the hosts earned Bangladesh the tag of one of the most entertaining teams in the Twenty20's big edition. Fans did not rule out an odd upset against the Australians too, keeping the "Cardiff Epic" in their mind, but the world champions put in a masterclass to easily tame the Tigers by nine wickets. Ashraful praised the Aussie bowlers but defending his batters. "The plan was the same. We just told the openers to get a measure of things in the first couple of overs and then go for it. "The Australians bowled really well. They mixed things up, bowled a lot of slower balls, took the pace of the wicket and that made it very difficult for us to play like we did against South Africa." He said the plan remains same for Tuesday's Sri Lanka match. "The plan will be to stay positive. The wicket of Wanderers is a better strip to bat on." Under lights, in excellent batting conditions, Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and the likes would look to show their full array of strokes, but it would doubtless be a stiff challenge for the bowlers to contain the in-form Lankan batsman led by Sanath Jayasuriya The one-day World Cup runners-up are yet to lose a match in the tournament and have racked up the highest total of 260 for six against Kenya. Pakistan are no easy-beaters. Ashraful thinks otherwise, though. "These are the teams that we know well and played a lot of matches against. We are confident of getting good results against the both teams." "We have the players who can make it possible and we expect to do well in the next two matches," said the skipper, the mainstay of his side's batting. He sees positives from the loss in Cape Town. "The batting of Aftab is one as he scored in all three matches. The bowling was good too. Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel all did their job nicely." Winning the toss matters to Ashraful. "There is less pressure when you know your target and you can pace yourself accordingly." He hinted that there could be changes in the Sri Lanka game, possibly in the opening. Opener Mohammed Nazim uddin, who has failed to score in both matches, can be a spectator in the match with left-handed Zunaed Siddique getting the nod. But Bangladesh will still rely heavily on the bat of the captain himself. If Ashraful comes firing on all cylinders, there should surely be something for the Tigers. bdn
