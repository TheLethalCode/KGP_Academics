<TITLE> Britain's violent kids need love, not punishment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With more than 17 young people killed in stabbings or shootings in London this year, the issue of youth violence is rising up the British political agenda, forcing policymakers to reassess society's attitude to children. One of the country's most acclaimed child experts says one issue -- abandonment -- lies behind the growing problem of muggings, stabbings and shootings in urban Britain. "Abandoning a child is worse than abuse," says Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of Kids Company, a charity which works with some of London's most damaged and disturbed children. Prime Minister Gordon Brown expressed horror at the increase in street violence when an 11-year-old boy was shot dead in Liverpool, northwest England, last month, and has promised to punish such "heinous" behaviour. But Batmanghelidjh, a 44-year-old Iranian-born psychotherapist whose flamboyant style, eloquence and charisma as well as 11 years of street level experience have won her the ear of policymakers, says Britain must turn its approach to children on its head. "We have created a culture in which threat and crime drives the care agenda," she says. "This culture is so convinced that punishment delivers good behaviour, that it has absolved itself of showing curiosity. And because it has no curiosity, it never manages to seek and implement the right solutions." Rather than punishing disturbed youngsters, Batmanghelidjh says politicians should understand the reality of such children's lives and resolve to change it. "It's not about poverty or punishment, it's about attachments and the amount of loving care children have." Batmanghelidjh points to Scandinavia, where bonds between parents or carers and children are highly valued and protected. Kids Company, which has a paid staff of about 200 and another 2,000 volunteers, seeks to help disturbed children recover from their trauma using a team of psychologists, teachers and therapists. It helped 11,000 children last year. Academics, police and sociologists have repeatedly evaluated and analysed the charity's work and rated it "outstanding". When she founded Kids Company in 1996 in a run-down area of London, Batmanghelidjh said the children who came to her for help were usually 14 or 15. Now they are even younger. "A typical child who comes to our door now is only 10 or 11, and is an Oliver Twist lookalike -- gaunt, depleted, bags under their eyes. And they have that stare, a stare of terror." They also have awful tales to tell. They live in squalor, often alongside violent and drug-addicted adults. The boys are commonly used as couriers for drug dealers who threaten or beat them. The girls are being sexually exploited, sometimes by parents who force them into prostitution to fund drug habits. But Batmanghelidjh fears those at the top are still unable, or unwilling, to see what really happens at street level. "This country suffers from having policymakers who conceptualise childhoods like their own. What people don't understand is that these children's homes are the worst possible place to be. "The notion of putting children back into these households is a middle-class, well-cared-for concept of childhood. If you really understood what you were putting the child back into, you wouldn't do it," she said. "Unfortunately people in politics don't talk about love and care and its implications, so my aim is to make them visibl
