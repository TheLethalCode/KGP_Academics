 LONDON, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index fell nearly 1 percent by midday on Tuesday ahead of US consumer data, dragged down by BP and miners, while lingering credit worries kept financials under pressure. At 1100 GMT the FTSE 100 index was down 0.9 percent at 6,405.3. Miners fell along with metal prices with Antofagasta the biggest loser, down nearly 7 percent, while Lonmin lost 5.5 percent and Vedanta shed 6.1 percent. BP lost 2.4 percent after the Financial Times said the oil group's CEO, Tony Hayward, had warned staff of "dreadful" third-quarter revenues, saying its financial performance was at its lowest since 1992-1993 when it was forced to cut its dividend. BP declined to comment. Elsewhere in the sector, Royal Dutch Shell gave up 1.3 percent and BG Group lost 1.9 percent, as oil prices extended their slide towards $80 a barrel as investors continued to take profits on last week's record high. Investors awaited U.S. consumer confidence data at 1400 GMT to gauge the resilience of U.S. consumers to recent credit troubles, while U.S. existing home sales numbers for August are due at the same time.

Investors are also looking for any signs that the Federal Reserve may continue to ease monetary policy after it cheered markets last week with a bigger than expected 0.5 percentage point cut in interest rates. European financial stocks remained under pressure one day after sources familiar with the matter said profits at Deutsche Bank could be hit by up to 1.7 billion euros due to loans that have dwindled in value as a result of the credit market crisis. Barclays was down 3.4 percent, RBS shed 0.5 percent and HBOS gave up 1 percent. Northern Rock was down 2.5 percent as worries about its future lingered. In the latest twist, Britain's government appointed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to advise it on Northern Rock, a source close to the Treasury said, as the stricken bank told politicians its business was sound. But worries about the sector affected the wider stock market. "If you look at the way that markets are trading, what's notable is that it's been very choppy," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. "That's purely a function that there's so much uncertainty regarding what will be the fallout of the recent financial market turmoil. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 3.4 percent despite saying it would report very strong first-half results and that it was very close to completing its merger with Borsa Italiana. Man Group gained 2.1 percent after the world's largest listed hedge fund firm said its assets under management had risen to $68 billion from $61.7 billion at the end of Mar
