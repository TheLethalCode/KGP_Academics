 LONDON, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A special effects technician involved in the filming of the new Batman movie has died in a car accident, the film's producers said on Tuesday. An investigation has been launched after the man was killed when his 4x4 vehicle crashed into a tree during a dummy film run, Warner Brothers said in a statement. The studio said that none of the cast, which includes several Hollywood stars, was involved in the accident that occurred at a special effects facility. It added the fatal crash did not happen on the set or during filming for 'Batman: The Dark Knight'. Media reports said the vehicle was following a stunt car, believed to be the Batmobile, at a property near Chertsey, Surrey. "There was a fatal accident ... at a special effects facility for 'The Dark Knight,' the studio said in a statement. "A special effects technician on the film was in a truck that struck a tree at the end of a test run-through." The name of the deceased has not been released. An HSE spokesman added: "There was filming of some sort involving a vehicle stunt and there was an accident. "It appears one vehicle was undertaking some stunt driving and another 4x4 provided the camera platform. The second vehicle and a camera operator were involved in a collision with a tree." 'Batman: The Dark Knight,' starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine as his butler, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman, is due for release in the United Kingdom next year. Most of the film, British director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to 'Batman Begins,' has been shot in Chicago, with other scenes from London and Hong Ko
