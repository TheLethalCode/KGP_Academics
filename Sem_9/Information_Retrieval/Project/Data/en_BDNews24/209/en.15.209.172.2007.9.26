 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A key road that was heavily mined and destroyed during Angola's civil war has reopened, the latest sign of progress in rebuilding infrastructure in the oil-rich southwestern African nation. The road linking Lumbala N'guimbo in Angola's eastern Moxico province with other parts of the country was deemed safe for traffic again as a result of an $8 million bridge-building project carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme. It had been unusable for most of the 27-year war between the government and rebels from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), leaving many in the region cut off from essential government services as well as markets. The conflict ended in 2002. "This road is a vital lifeline for the entire region and tens of thousands of people will now be able to move around freely again -- to take their children to clinics and their goods to market," Bradley Guerrant, the WFP's country director for Angola, said in a statement. Angola's government, a mix of reformed Marxists and Western-leaning technocrats, is struggling to rebuild bridges, roads and ports to further fuel a booming economy and raise the living standards of the nation's 15 million residents. The poor state of the roads also has been previously cited by the government in Luanda as a reason for delaying national elections, which have not been held since an aborted presidential poll in 1992. The ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola has said parliamentary elections will be held in 2008, followed by a presidential race in 2009. While awash in oil -- Angola is pumping about 1.4 million barrels per day and expects to raise output to 2 million barrels by the end of this year -- the government has done little to narrow one of Africa's worst income distribution gaps. Many of its citizens survive on less than $1 day. The former Portuguese colony is also plagued with a dire skills shortage, forcing it to rely on Western engineers, bankers and other workers to keep its oil sector and infrastructure reconstruction programmes running. Foreign expertise and funds have played a critical role in the refurbishment of roads and bridges. The WFP said it had been responsible for building 10 bridges in Luanda Sul province in addition to those constructed in Moxico since 2005. The bridge-building project has been funded by a variety of donors, including the European Commission and several European nations, and undertaken with the cooperation of the Angolan governme
