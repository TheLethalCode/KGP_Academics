 LUCKNOW, India, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's most populous state, also one of its most lawless, fired nearly 4,000 policemen from their jobs on Tuesday on top of the 6,500 sacked last week saying they had bribed their way to the posts. The government of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by firebrand woman politician Mayawati, who uses only one name, said 3,964 policemen had been removed due to "irregularities" in the recruitment process. More dismissals were likely as an inquiry into the recruitment of around 22,000 policemen by the previous government was not yet complete, officials said. "A high-level inquiry found gross irregularities in the recruitment process and there were allegations of even play of money, corruption and nepotism," said J.N. Chamber, the state's home secretary. Mayawati came to power in May on the back of a surprise mandate, seen partly as a vote against the previous government's failure to curb crime and modernise an inefficient and corrupt police force. She ordered an inquiry which found that people paid recruiters up to 300,000 rupees ($7,300) to become policemen under the previous government led by Mulayam Singh Yadav. Mayawati is widely seen as one of India's rising political stars but her critics say her decision was driven by a vendetta against her opponents. Yadav has rejected all charges of corruption.
