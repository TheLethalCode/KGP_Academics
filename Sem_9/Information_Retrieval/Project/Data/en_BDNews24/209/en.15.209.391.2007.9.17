 ISLAMABAD, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf plans to quit as army chief to become a civilian leader, removing a key objection to his proposed re-election in October, a senior ruling party official said on Monday. "We expect that after his re-election process next month, God willing, General Musharraf would take his oath of office as a civilian president before Nov. 15," Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, secretary-general of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, told Reuters. General Musharraf has been holding the post of army chief since he seized power in a military coup in 1999 despite calls from the opposition to quit the dual office. His acquiescence could be seen as a victory for Benazir Bhutto, who has said that any power-sharing arrangement with Musharraf will depend, among other things, on him becoming a civilian president. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party announced on Friday the two-time former prime minister will return to Pakistan on Oct. 18, ending more than eight years of self-exile. Giving up the army role would undoubtedly dilute Musharraf's power in a country that that has been ruled by the military for more than half the 60 years since it was founded. It will also be a wrench for a life-long soldier who described his uniform as a "second skin", but aides say he has been reconciled to quitting the army for months. Senator Sayed said that Musharraf would abide by the constitution and quit the army before the end of 2007. Musharraf's current term as president expires on Nov. 15. "Yes, I have no doubt that the president will keep his commitment," said Sayed, who recently met Musharraf. "He is clear on this issue." LEGAL THREAT Before quitting the army, Musharraf plans to seek another five-year term as president from the sitting parliament by Oct. 15, Sayed said. The PML and its allies have a majority in parliament to elect Musharraf but several members of the ruling coalition have expressed reservations over Musharraf's re-election while remaining in uniform. An alliance of opposition parties has threatened to resign from parliament if Musharraf went ahead with his plans. A walk-out would not affect the election but it would dent its credibility. However, the most significant threat to Musharraf's plans could be country's Supreme Court which is regarded as hostile to the US ally after his ill-fated attempt to fire the chief justice. On Monday, the court is taking up a number of legal challenges thrown up by opposition parties and lawyers' bodies against Musharraf's bid for re-election and keeping the dual offices of the president and army chief.
