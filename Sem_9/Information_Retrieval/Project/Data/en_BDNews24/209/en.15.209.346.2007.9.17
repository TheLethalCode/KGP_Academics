 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks plunged to a month's low Monday on profit-taking and jitters over a probe into an institutional investor's credit extension to its clients. Shares fell in morning trade and the slide continued through to the closing, pushing almost all issues lower. "Adjustment by merchant banks and withdrawal of funds by some individual investors apparently sparked the decline," said a senior official with the Dhaka Stock Exchange, preferring anonymity. A Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into credit extension by AB Bank's merchant banking wing also rattled stocks, market operators said. The regulator launched the investigation into allegations that credit extended unlawfully to relatives of some AB Bank staff prolonged the surges on the market in the last couple of months. The main DGEN or general index slumped 36.64 points or 1.43 percent to 2511.64, the biggest fall since August 12. The DSI or all-share price index dipped 44.03 points or 2.07 percent to 2077.93 on the back of price correction of IFIC Bank. The DSE-20 blue chip index finished 45.36 points or 2.21 percent lower at 1998.88. A total of 1, 11, 89, 890 shares worth Tk 1.09 billion traded and 43 gained, 132 declined and 23 held steady. All the indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange slumped with losers beating gainers 78 to 22. Six scrips held steady. The CSE also recorded highest fall in last one month since August 12. Turnover on the bourse rose to Tk 176.24 million from Sunday's Tk 168.63 million. "The market is in a correction phase. Profit-taking by some individual investors has led to the fall," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 800 million in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh. Banking sector major BRAC Bank, the leader in turnover, slumped 3.14 percent to Tk 1264.25. DESCO led the slide in power stocks, losing 1.70 percent to close at Tk 1141. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh fell 1.44 percent to Tk 616. Square Pharma, one of the heavyweights, dropped 2.67 percent to Tk 3248.5.
