 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) -- A religious school administrator in Chittagong Tuesday sued Shaptahik 2000 acting editor Golam Mortuza, publisher Mahfuz Anam and writer Daud Haider. The administrative officer of Al Jamia Al Islamia Islamic University, Mohammad Reza, filed the case with the court of Chittagong metropolitan magistrate, Aminul Ahsan. The case brought an allegation of hurting religious feelings, sedition and violations of the Printing Press and Publications (Declaration and Registration) Act. Magistrate Aminul Ahsan asked the Kotwali police chief to take necessary steps about the case. The government has already banned the Eid issue of Bangla-language weekly magazine. The autobiographical article written by Daud Haider, exiled in Germany, is at the heart of the controversy. The magazine authorities had decided to take the Eid issue off the newsstands, taking into account the "confusion it might have created in public mind". bdnew
