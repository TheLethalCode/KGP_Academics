 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com) - Saarc finance ministers have agreed to strengthen institutional cooperation between member countries in a bid to develop the region's capital markets, said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday. Azizul briefed reporters at Zia International Airport on his return from the two-day South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meeting in New Delhi. "The meeting recommended harmonising regulations in the securities market, facilitating cross-border capital transactions and improved agreements between regulators and finance ministries," Azizul said. The adviser also said the meeting approved the early implementation of the Saarc Development Fund to improve regional development projects. The fund is currently worth $300 million. "Finance secretaries will prepare and submit project proposals for the fund, with poverty reduction goals getting priority," Azizul said. Representatives also reviewed the association's progress since the first finance minister level meeting in Islamabad in July 2006. The Maldives have made a bid to host the 2009 Saarc Finance Ministers' meeting in Male. Founded in 1985, Saarc members include India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan became its eighth member in 2005 at the 13th annual summit in Dhaka. bd
