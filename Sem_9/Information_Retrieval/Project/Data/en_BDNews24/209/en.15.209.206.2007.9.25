 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) Bus and launch fares will not be hiked for Eid travellers, transportation leaders said Tuesday. GM Siraj, president of Bus-Truck Owners' Association, and Badiuzzaman Badal, president of Launch Owners' Association, made the announcement from a roundtable. Badal gave further assurances that launch owners would charge 10 percent less than the usual fares for Eid travels. An 11-point set of recommendations for curbing passenger harassment during the Eid was presented at the roundtable, organised by Citizen's Rights Movement at the National Press Club. BRTA chairman Hedayetullah Al Mamun, who joined the roundtable, said: "BRTC has already earmarked its buses for Eid travels. Any BRTC lessee or staff member charging inflated fares will be liable to be punished and the lease will be cancelled, as appropriate." BIWTA director Monwar Hossain said: "All launch terminals including Sadarghat in Dhaka will be equipped with necessary monitoring outfits to ensure that launch owners do not hike fares." The speakers said the CNG-driven buses charged four to ten times higher fares than diesel-operated ones, although the prices of CNG had not seen any increase recently. The 11-point recommendations included a freeze on bus-fare hikes, efforts to ensure short-haul commuting by taxi and autorickshaw drivers and a ban on hydraulic horns. bdnews
