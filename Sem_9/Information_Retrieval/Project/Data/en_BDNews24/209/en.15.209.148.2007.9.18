 LONDON, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All the sheep on a farm in southern England will be slaughtered after blood tests suggested they had contracted foot and mouth disease, the British agriculture ministry said on Monday. The sheep are on a farm inside the protection zone west of London set up last week when a new outbreak of the disease was discovered and hundreds of pigs and cattle were culled. "Initial blood tests on clinically healthy sheep on a farm within the Protection Zone suggest exposure to FMD (foot and mouth disease)," the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement on its website. "These animals were identified as part of the surveillance work that is being carried out in the area. All animals on the premises are being slaughtered on suspicion. Further laboratory tests are ongoing," it said. Two nearby sites were hit last week by foot and mouth. The first of those came less than 24 hours after EU veterinary experts agreed to declare Britain free of foot and mouth from Nov. 9 and lift an export ban -- imposed after the disease was found on two farms in July and August. Britain suffered a crippling outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001 when more than 6 million animals had to be culled. The outbreak hit agriculture and tourism hard, costing the economy an estimated 8.5 billion pounds. Foot and mouth is a highly contagious disease which spreads easily on the wind. It can cause animals to foam at the mouth, collapse and leave them with serious health problems
