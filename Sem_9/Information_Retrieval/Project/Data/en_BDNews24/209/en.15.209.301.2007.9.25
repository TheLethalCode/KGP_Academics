 BOURNEMOUTH, England, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Health Secretary Alan Johnson said on Tuesday a new health regulator would have the power to close hospital wards, part of a new drive to fight hospital infections. Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised a fresh blitz on hospital bugs like MRSA and C-difficile in his speech to the Labour Party's annual conference on Monday and Johnson said the new regulator would lead the crackdown on hygiene. "Today I am setting out how we will equip the new regulator with tougher powers, backed by fines, to inspect, investigate and intervene where hospitals are failing to meet hygiene standards," Johnson said in his speech. "And this tough regime will not just apply across the NHS but in the private sector as well," he said. "To ensure patients' safety, I want a regulator with the power to close, clean and then re-open wards if necessary." Johnson said the National Health Service (NHS) had to continue to change to meet the public's demands and said an NHS review would canvass the opinions of all those involved in health. "This is an unprecedented opportunity to shape an NHS which is clinically led and locally driven, constantly focused on a personalised service for the patient," he said. "Centralising care where necessary, for instance for stroke and cancer patients. But localising where possible, so that patients can be treated closer to home." Johnson reiterated Brown's promise to extend doctors' surgery hours and to allow patients to visit surgeries close to work, as well as home. To protect staff, he said personal safety alarms would be issued to health workers who needed them, as part of a 97 million pound boost to the NHS security budget. The Liberal Democrats said Johnson's promises on health smacked of "gimmickry and re-spun policy". "He has failed to answer the fundamental question of where Gordon Brown is taking the NHS," said Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb in a statement.
