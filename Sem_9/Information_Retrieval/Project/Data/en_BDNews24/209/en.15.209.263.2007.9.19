<TITLE> IMF retreats from policy push </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com) - The International Monetary Fund has been forced for the first time to back away from a plan to ink a deal with Bangladesh after public dissent by economists, civic and business leaders and NGOs. An IMF delegation, led by its Asia Pacific Department adviser, Thomas R Rumbaugh, came to Dhaka on Sept 4 with hopes of a new agreement, but left the country empty-handed. The proposed new deal that the IMF named a 'policy support instrument' (PSI) has been adopted by some five impoverished African countries on expiry of their previous poverty reduction growth facility (PRGF) deals. Questions have been raised in those countries over the effectiveness of the PSI. "After several discussions with the government over the last few days, both parties have come to the decision that the PSI treaty is not right for Bangladesh at the moment," Rumbaugh told reporters Tuesday. "It is up to the government of Bangladesh to decide how it wants the IMF to help with reform efforts, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue." "The IMF has signed PSI agreements with different countries. This is not a bad deal. The PSI is the next stage of PRGF," he said. Rumbaugh added that the IMF wanted to continue its talks with the government to determine if any deal, such as the previous PRGF model, could be agreed upon. In recent weeks, local economists, business leaders, NGOs and the media have repeatedly drawn attention to what they described as a worldwide withdrawal from the multilateral lending agency's 'intrusive policy prescriptions'. Even the High Court directed the government Monday to explain within two weeks why it should not be stopped from pursuing a PSI agreement with the IMF. The court order came after Supreme Court lawyer Mesbahul Islam filed a public interest litigation with Justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Md Abu Tarique, challenging the government's proposed adoption of the PSI deal with the global lending agency. The petitioner had earlier urged the HC to direct the government to cease negotiations with the IMF over the probable agreement. Rumbaugh said: "We decided not to sign the deal through mutual discussion. There is no other reason behind it." Under the PSI treaty, the IMF assists policy on different issues of macro-economics; this is not loan assistance, the IMF adviser clarified. Rumbaugh said Bangladesh is making unnecessary noises without having the right information. This is nothing but misunderstanding, he said. The IMF adviser said the delegation had open and productive discussions with the government on economic reforms, which the fund hoped would boost and further reduce poverty in Bangladesh. "The IMF stands ready to support the government's efforts through on-going technical assistance," Rumbaugh said. On the country's economic situation, the IMF said in a statement that other countries had adjusted their monetary policies to curb inflationary pressures from supply side factors, and suggested that the government tighten its monetary policy further. However, the central bank rejected the suggestion, saying it may instead adopt an expansionary policy to rehabilitate post-flood damages and to avert a serious squeeze on private sector credit growth. The IMF statement expressed concern over the current state of the economy: "In Bangladesh while private sector credit growth slowed to 15 percent as of June, this was not due to monetary tightening, but rather a result of uncertainty and reduced confidence in the business community." To make up for huge losses in state-owned enterprises, including Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation and Power Development Board, the IMF also asked the government to adjust prices of energy products and go for an automated pricing policy. The IMF is currently facing global debate over its policy prescriptions, with the fund's major borrowers fast retreating from financial assistance. Turkey, Indonesia, Argentina and Brazil together account for 70 percent of the IMF's outstanding loans. They have announced their intention to repay their loans to the IMF early to free themselves of the agency's hold. As a result, outstanding IMF loans have fallen to about $40 billion at the end of 2006 from $90 billion in 2004. Recent South American experiencesespecially in Argentinahave also illustrated the controversial nature of IMF policies in developing countries, while the past 10 years have witnessed many more countries paying off their IMF loans as 'political health insurance'. bdnews24.
