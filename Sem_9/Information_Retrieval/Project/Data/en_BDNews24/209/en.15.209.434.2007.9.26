 MANILA, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Philippines) - Two soldiers and at least 10 rebels were killed in fresh fighting on a southern Philippine island, the military chief said on Wednesday, warning the largest Muslim separatist group to honour a four-year-old truce. General Hermogenes Esperon said he suspected the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) might have broken a ceasefire with the government by helping the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf in the first major firefight after a lull of almost a month on Basilan island.

Esperon said 15 government troops were also wounded in the fierce battle on Tuesday afternoon and that the rebels also took casualties. The military said the fighting erupted when about 80 Islamic militants tried to disrupt the construction of a road by soldiers in Tipo-tipo town on Basilan. Army commandos rushed to the scene to defend the engineering unit, sparking a three-hour battle that forced dozens of local residents to flee their homes and far
