 LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Expectations of another cut in US interest rates knocked the dollar to a lifetime low against the euro on Wednesday, while easing concerns about the health of British banks buoyed European stocks and supported sterling. Weaker-than-expected US durable goods data for August, combined with Tuesday's disappointing figures on consumer morale and the housing market, cemented the view the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in October to shield the world's biggest economy from a housing slump and financial turbulence. Lower interest rates are damaging for the dollar as they reduce the yield it offers, but help risky assets including stocks because they support growth. In addition, the news that no banks bid for cash at the Bank of England's offer of 10 billion pounds of three-month cash loans -- at a penalty rate above the current market rate -- signalled that credit conditions may be easing and gave added support for European stocks. "On the whole the market seems to have enough liquidity, at least at that price, which is on balance reassuring," said Laurence Mutkin, strategist at Morgan Stanley. Roger Cursley, UK strategist at Investec, said: "The market is starting to hope that the Fed, having been aggressive once, will continue to be aggressive." MSCI's main world equity index was up 0.2 percent, holding near last week's two-month high. U.S. stock futures were up around 0.4 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index hit the day's high after the BoE news. By 1240 GMT, it was up 0.8 percent with gains in banks overwhelming the negative impact on exporters from a surging euro. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 2.5 percent after the Financial Times reported a group led by RBS had doubled its stake in takeover target Dutch bank ABN AMRO. UK mortgage lender Northern Rock, which has been engulfed in crisis since it tapped the Bank of England for an emergency loan, rose more than 10 percent after the lender said it had received a number of approaches including a possible offer for the company. New orders for long-lasting US-made manufacturing goods took their sharpest tumble in seven months in August as demand weakened across nearly every category of durable good. US rate futures inched higher after the data with debt markets pricing in a 90 percent chance of anther 25 basis point interest rate cut in October. The Fed cut benchmark rates by 50 basis points this month to 4.75 percent. The euro rose as high as $1.4162, bringing its gains since January to around seven percent. The dollar index held near a 15-year low set on Tuesday. "(The data is) one more piece of evidence that will support US dollar weakness," said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. In the broader credit market, the closely-watched iTraxx Crossover index tightened six basis points. In the money market rates, London interbank offered rates for three-month sterling deposits were fixed at a 1-1/2 month low around 6.32 percent, having fallen from a nine-year high above 6.9 percent earlier this month. Overnight euro rates rose to a three-week high above 4.35 percent. The December Bund future fell 23 ticks, trimming recent gains triggered by a safe-haven rally in top-rated government debt. Sentiment on emerging markets was firmer, with the MSCI measure of emerging stocks up half a percent and emerging sovereign spreads tightening by 1 bps. London Brent crude oil was up 0.3 percent, while gold edged higher to $732.60 an ounce, supported by the weak doll
