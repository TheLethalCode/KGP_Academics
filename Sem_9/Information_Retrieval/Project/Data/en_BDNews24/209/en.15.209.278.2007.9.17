Droppings are only part of the problem. Authorities say the pigeons are chipping away at the city's marble statues and buildings by pecking at small gaps in the facades to reach for scraps of food that have been blown inside.

The battle against pigeons is part of a broader campaign to improve decorum and cleanliness in the city, a Unesco World Heritage Site which received nearly 20 million visitors last year.
