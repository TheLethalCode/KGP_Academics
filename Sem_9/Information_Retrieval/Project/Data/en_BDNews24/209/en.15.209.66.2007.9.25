 FRANKFURT, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were broadly lower by midday on Tuesday as a key business confidence survey pointed to weaker growth and mining stocks such as Rio Tinto and Anglo American tumbled on profit-taking. Shares in oil major BP fell more than 2.5 percent in the wake of a Financial Times report saying BP's chief executive had warned that third-quarter revenues would be "dreadful". By 1050 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was down 1.2 percent at 1,526.98 points, having hit a one-week low of 1,526.57 points earlier. A fund manager based in Frankfurt said market sentiment was "extremely negative at the moment". He predicted further volatility in the run-up to the corporate earnings season for the quarter to end-September, starting in mid-October. The Munich-based Ifo economic research institute's closely watched business climate index, based on a monthly poll of around 7,000 firms, fell to its lowest level in over 1-1/2 years, spelling trouble for the euro zone's biggest economy. "Credit market problems have probably resulted in a significant, but not precipitous, deterioration in business conditions in Germany, accentuating, we believe, an existing underlying slowdown," Royal Bank of Scotland said in a note. "The striking difference between this and previous months' Ifo indexes is that companies have not only become more cautious regarding the near to medium term future, but also about their current business situation," UBS said. The Frankfurt-based fund manager said the Ifo reading "is not positive for equities" as the findings suggested that some European exporters were beginning to suffer from the appreciation of the euro. The basic resources index, which includes miners, was Europe's leading sectoral decliner, down 3.6 percent. Antofagasta shed 7.4 percent, Anglo American 4.1 percent, Rio Tinto 3.6 percent and BHP Billiton 3.2 percent. The slides reversed gains on Monday when the sector was buoyed by market talk of a large gold find by BHP Billiton. "Profit taking after yesterday's gains is most likely the reason behind the lower sector today," said Victoria Savage, a trader at CMC Markets. Banks, down 1.5 percent, remained under pressure a day after sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, could be hit by up to 1.7 billion euros due to loans that have dwindled in value as a result of the credit market crisis. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. "Banks are going to suffer, there is no doubt about that," said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas. "Even with Q3 results the banks are not going to announce the full story, because they hope that they will recoup some of the losses in the subprime market and corporate and LBO debt and they will probably wait until the end of the fourth quarter," he said. Among gainers, AstraZeneca was up 0.8 percent after clinical trial results showing that patients with advanced prostate cancer given the company's experimental pill ZD4054 lived around seven months longer than those on placebo. Air France-KLM rose 2.8 percent after the airline's CEO told La Tribune newspaper that a new phase of synergies would start soon in Air France's merger with KLM and that the carrier had to be ready to take stakes in rival operators outside Europe. Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund firm, was up 1.8 percent after reporting a rise in assets under management. "The tone of the management comment is positive and Man highlights the group's capital strength will remain a competitive advantage, said Landsbanki, which rates the stock "buy". Greek insurer Ethniki jumped 13.6 percent after parent National Bank of Greece said it would tender for all remaining shares with a cash offer of 5.5 euros per share -- an 18 percent premium over the Sept. 21 close. Later in the day eyes will be on US existing home sales for August due at 1400 GMT, analysts said. "The Fed's post-meeting statement last week seemed to be pretty neutral, implying that rates could rise or fall from here and that the Fed will rely on both the data and any further signs of market pressure to dictate the next move," Bear Stearns said in a note. "On this score today's existing home sales data will clearly be an important indicator of the housing market." Tim Harris, a markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said the recent financial market turmoil and the US housing sector downturn presented "significant risk to the US economy, which itself would hasten downgrades to earnings estimates for the equity markets of that country at least and have a knock-on impact on the earnings of other stock markets around the worl
