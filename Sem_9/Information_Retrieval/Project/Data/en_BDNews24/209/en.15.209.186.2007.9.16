<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)Scotland Yard and the Department for International Development have said they will assist the Anticorruption Commission by providing information to verify whether money has been transferred illegally to the UK from Bangladesh. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury has discussed the matter with senior officials at the London Metropolitan Police headquarters and DFID, during his visit to the UK to join an international conference on money laundering. Speaking to reporters Sunday on his first day of work after his return from the UK, the ACC chairman said a channel has been opened for cooperation with the two agencies. He said there was no formal agreement with Scotland Yard or DFID. "However, they have assured us that they will help by providing information if evidence is presented properly," said Chowdhury. The former army chief also said an official of the ACC would be given the responsibility to maintain contact with the two UK-based agencies. A police official of the rank of deputy inspector general, currently serving with the ACC on deputation, will be assigned this function, he said. In answer to reporters' questions, the ACC chairman said no formal talks have yet been held with the two agencies on returning any specified money or deporting any named persons back to Bangladesh. "That is the responsibility of the foreign ministry," Chowdhury said. "The job of the ACC is to prove whether a person accused of corruption is guilty." If the information necessary to do this is made available from the Scotland Yard or DFID, the ACC's cases against such persons will be made stronger, he added. Asked whether the ACC is planning to file a case against Tarique Rahman, Chowdhury said a case would be filed if it is proved that the wealth statement he gave to the ACC was not correct. bdnews2
