<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, Monday said Bangladesh could be turned into a developed country if its resources were used properly. "Various reasons have stifled the country's potential. But this developing state can be transformed into a developed one if we can utilise its resources properly, " the army chief said at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. He said the government was working hard to uproot financial irregularities and corruption from the country as well as to ensure transparency and accountability in the administration. It was difficult for a single institution to perform the task, he said, adding that it required continuous help from watchdogs. Moeen also urged the auditor general to help retired army personnel and public servants get their pension allowances in time. Comptroller and auditor general Asif Ali and defence secretary Md Kamrul Hasan were present on the occasion. bdnews24.c
