 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  A senior BRAC official leaves for Afghanistan Wednesday in the wake of the latest kidnap of one of their representatives in the war-ravaged country. "Jalaluddin Ahmed, a former head of BRAC in Afghanistan, will leave for Kabul to assess the situation," M Anwarul Haq, a BRAC spokesman, told bdnews24.com. BRAC staffer Nurul Islam was kidnapped from his Lagor Province office in south of Kabul on September 15 in what was the second case of abduction involving one of the NGO's staff. BRAC's founder Fazle Hasan Abed said in a written statement from New York: "I appeal to his abductors to release him immediately." "I am also deeply saddened by the killing of another BRAC officer, Abdul Alim, in Afghanistan last week," he said. Afghan security forces have arrested three people so far in connection with the kidnap, including a guard from BRAC's office in Lagor Province where Nurul was abducted. Taliban officials on television Monday denied their link to the kidnap. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury sent a letter to his Afghan counterpart Rangin Dadfar Spanta asking for Afghanistan's support in securing the release of the abducted official. The letter said: "BRAC is a Bangladeshi NGO with a worldwide reputation for its social services." "Nurul Islam's mission was of a peaceful and humanitarian nature. His family is understandably deeply upset." "I would like to add that the people of Bangladesh have always stood by their Afghan brothers at all times and under all circumstances," it said. The BRAC founder added from New York: "Alim's death was senseless and I sincerely hope that the Afghan authorities will quickly bring the perpetrators of this horrible crime to justice." "I wish to convey my sympathies to Nurul's family as they face this ordeal and assure them that BRAC will do everything in its power to bring him back to safety at the earliest." "We have an extremely dedicated and courageous team of Bangladeshi development experts working in Afghanistan to ameliorate the suffering of the Afghan people. I salute them and their unwavering commitment to serve humanity," he said. bdnew
