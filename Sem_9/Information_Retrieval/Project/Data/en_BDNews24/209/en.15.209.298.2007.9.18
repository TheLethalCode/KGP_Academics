 Dhaka, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com) - Commerce and finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam left Dhaka Tuesday for Manila to attend a two-day discussion on how to empower less developed economies and small states to benefit from global trade. Top global and regional trade ministers and officials along with key private sector representatives are expected to gather in Manila for the Sept 19-20 meeting. The Asian Development Bank and the World Trade Organisation, in partnership with the Philippines government, will host the regional review meeting titled "Mobilising Aid for Trade: Focus Asia and the Pacific". At the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference 2005, major donors pledged around $15 billion to the "Aid for Trade" package. "Aid for Trade" is development assistance targeted at helping developing countries take advantage of trade opportunities, and to strengthen their ability to assess and represent their interests in trade negotiations. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, also accompanying the adviser, said that Bangladesh would seek funds to develop its trade infrastructure to fulfil supply-side constraints. However, Bangladesh is concerned that Aid for Trade schemes will be financed out of funds made available for the existing millennium development goals (MDG) programme. Ahmed said the funds should come from new funds, not from MDG funds. Bangladesh would also suggest that such aid be allocated to those countries that would face preference erosion from liberalising trade under WTO rules. More than two-dozen top finance and trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific region along with participants from investment banks and corporations are expected to discuss ways and means to strengthen trade-related capacity and infrastructure in developing Asia and the Pacific. ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda and WTO Director General Pascal Lamy will open the conference on Sept 19. This will be followed by plenary sessions and ministerial roundtables that will focus on issues such as why aid matters for trade and how public-private partnerships can help less developed economies and small states to benefit from globalisation and regional integration. bd
