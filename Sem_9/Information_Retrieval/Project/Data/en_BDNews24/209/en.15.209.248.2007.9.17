 ATHENS, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece's conservatives face the tough task of tackling reforms needed to catch up with euro zone countries after winning a second mandate in an election on Sunday, but with their majority depleted. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, praised by Brussels for his economic record, vowed to push on with reforms but analysts say deadly forest fires and scandals have clipped his wings in parliament and may complicate economic efforts. Ahead is the need to overhaul a pension system expected to go bust in 15 years due to an ageing population. Other goals are planned privatisations, measures to boost competitiveness and raise living standards. "It's not a very comfortable majority, which makes it a little difficult but they can start to tackle the pension system," said Theodor Schonebeck, an economist at Deutsche Bank. Cheered by jubilant supporters who stormed onto the streets of Athens, waving flags, blaring horns and setting off firecrackers, Karamanlis appeared determined to continue reforms, "You have given us a mandate for a new, more decisive start, to continue faster and with more determination," he said. FIRES SINGE RESULT Karamanlis called the snap poll in August, sure his economic record -- 4.4 percent economic growth and reduction of unemployment -- would secure victory. But last month's forest fires that killed 65 people on the back of scandals -- such as the sale of overpriced state bonds to pension funds -- turned a large number of voters away. With 95 percent of votes counted, he was winning only 153 seats in the 300-seat parliament compared to 165 in 2004, when his landslide election victory ended 11 years of socialist rule. Opposition socialist PASOK party leader George Papandreou also seemed to lose out to smaller groups, failing to capitalise on the government's problems. PASOK was in second place with about 38 percent of the vote and 102 seats in parliament, compared with 117 seats in 2004. The far-right LA.O.S. party was winning 3.7 percent of the vote, gaining them 10 seats, and was the first far-right party to make it to parliament since a 7-year dictatorship in Greece ended in 1974. "In everything good Karamanlis does for citizens and Greece, we will stand by him, for everything dubious, we will stand against him," LA.O.S. leader George Karatzaferis told supporters. Karamanlis has cut budget deficits and created 200,000 jobs but unemployment remains above the EU average despite the healthy GDP growth rate. Greek per capita GDP is the second lowest in the euro zone after Portugal's. He appeared to get the message that economic reforms had not yet trickled down to the poor. "In the new 4-year term, we will continue with steady steps for a stronger economy and to fight poverty," he said. "To create more opportunities for young people, to strengthen and expand the social state." bd
