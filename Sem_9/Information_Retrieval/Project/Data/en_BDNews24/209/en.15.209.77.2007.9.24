 WARSAW, Mon Sep 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A popular former prime minister from Poland's governing conservatives endorsed an opposition candidate for next month's parliamentary election on Monday, dealing a blow to the ruling Kaczynski twins. Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz is the latest of several conservative leaders to turn from Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his brother Lech, the president, in favor of a pro-business opposition party from the centre-right. Marcinkiewicz said he would back Senator Jaroslaw Gowin, a candidate for the Civic Platform opposition in Krakow, the biggest city in the south of the former communist European Union member. "I will not be engaged in the election campaign ... but Mr. Senator will be able to write that he has my support," Marcinkiewicz told news channel TVN24. The parliamentary election is being held two years early in the country of 38 million after the prime minister fired two fringe parties from his cabinet. Marcinkiewicz resigned as prime minister for the Law and Justice party in mid-2006 after less than a year in office and was replaced by Jaroslaw Kaczynski. He now works in London, but opinion polls show he remains a popular figure. He said last month he had grounds to suspect he was spied on while in office and that under the Kaczynskis Poland had become an "Orwellian state" -- a reference to the totalitarian state in George Orwell's book "1984". A poll on Monday showed the opposition leading in several major cities, including Warsaw, where Kaczynski was nine points behind the leader of the Civic Platform.

Recent national polls have put Law and Justice neck-and-neck with the Civic Platform, suggesting the Kaczynskis retain strong support in rural areas that feel more left out under the changes since communism ended in 1989. Markets favor the Civic Platform, hoping it would speed up privatization and other economic reforms and that it would move more swiftly to adopt the euro currency. The ruling twins' tough tactics and increasingly populist policies have alienated several one-time allies. A former defense minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, has announced he would contest the October 21 election for the Civic Platform. The contest in Krakow is another high-profile race. Polls show Gowin has a 17-point lead there over Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who has helped spearhead the government's anti-corruption drive. The opposition and some former ministers have accused Ziobro of abusing state services to undermine political rivals. The Civic Platform said on Monday that party leader Donald Tusk would campaign in Britain and Ireland this week to try to win support from Polish emigrants in the countri
