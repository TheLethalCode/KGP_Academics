 LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - European shares rallied on Wednesday, led by financials, after sources said the group headed by Royal Bank of Scotland doubled its stake in ABN AMRO, cutting the cost of its bid for the Dutch bank. UK mortgage lender Northern Rock jumped 10 percent after it received a number of approaches including a possible offer for the company. It cancelled its dividend however. By 1058 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.6 percent at 1,538.01 points, partially paring Tuesday's 1.0 percent fall when soft US data raised concern about the outlook for growth. The index has risen by nearly 8 percent since hitting an eight-month low in mid-August when the Federal Reserve cut the US discount rate in response to the tight lending conditions that arose as the housing downturn spread to credit markets. "Many investors adopted a wait-and-see approach in the last few weeks, waiting for a sense of direction regarding the uncertainties," said Morgan Stanley strategist Teun Draaisma in a note. "We think it is very possible that a real benchmark and performance chase will develop over the next few weeks and months, as investors put the cash positions they built to work," he added. London's FTSE 100 index was up 0.9 percent, Paris's CAC-40 rose 0.7 percent and Frankfurt's DAX gained 0.4 percent.

Finnish mobile phone provider Nokia rallied 1.8 percent, making it the top weighted gainer on the FTSEurofirst after a price target upgrade from Citigroup. "The stock has been a particularly strong performer of late, but we believe there is still more to come," Citigroup said. Shares in Deutche Boerse shot up by more than 3 percent as traders cited support from recent cost cuts and share buyback announcements, and merger activity in the sector. Shares in Nordic bourse operator OMX edged up 0.4 percent after Borse Dubai and Nasdaq said they had agreed with key shareholders of OMX on a revised offer and secured nearly 48 percent of shares in the company through ownership and options. OMX said its board would consider a joint offer from Nasdaq and Bourse Dubai. Miners BHP Billiton and Anglo American gained, paring the previous day's losses. Shares in Anglo-US fund management company Invesco rose by more than 5 percent and were among the top FTSE 100 gainers as traders cited expectations of higher valuations after the firm proposed moving its primary listing to New York from Lond
