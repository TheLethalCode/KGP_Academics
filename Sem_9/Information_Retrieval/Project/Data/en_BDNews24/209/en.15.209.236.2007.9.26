 BAGHDAD, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected al Qaeda militants have stepped up attacks in Iraq, the US military said on Wednesday, as a spate of bombings in the north of the country killed 15 people and wounded dozens. "There has indeed been an increase in violence in the last few days, largely in areas in which al Qaeda in Iraq operates and with al Qaeda in Iraq signatures as they have sought to ramp up attacks," spokesman Major-General Kevin Bergner said. Bombers struck across northern Iraq on Wednesday, including one suicide bombing which targeted a tribal leader near the town of Sinjar. Five people were killed in the attack and nine were wounded, but the fate of the tribal leader was unclear. Around the start of Ramadan two weeks ago, al Qaeda vowed to step up attacks throughout the Muslim holy month. It has specifically warned it would attack tribal leaders cooperating with the security forces. "This was an increase that was actually expected some weeks ago given past upturns in violence during Ramadan," Bergner told a news conference. "So far this year the number of incidents is well below the level of 2006 and about in line with what we saw in 2005." In the city of Mosul, 390 kilometres (240 miles) north of Baghdad, residents reported hearing four explosions in one hour. Police said three people were killed and 30 wounded. In the town of Shirqat, south of Mosul, two car bombings targeting local police killed seven people and wounded five, police said. "We are continuing our efforts to suppress (the violence) and keep the pressure on the extremist networks," Bergner said. Al Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility this month for killing Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha, leader of a Sunni Arab tribal alliance in western Anbar province which joined forces with the US military to drive al Qaeda out of much of that vast region. In the most serious recent attack, a suicide bomber killed 26 people including the police chief of the city of Baquba on Monday in a mosque compound where local Shia and Sunni Arab leaders were holding reconciliation talks. A sustained campaign of violence would undermine US and Iraqi assertions that a seven-month security crackdown had disrupted the Sunni Islamist network's operations in and around Baghdad while also reducing attacks from other grou
