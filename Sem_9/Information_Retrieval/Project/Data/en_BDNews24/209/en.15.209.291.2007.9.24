 BOURNEMOUTH, England, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged on Monday to set Britain on a new path to meet its people's rising aspirations and give them the skills to compete in a globalised world. Speculation had been rife that Brown could use his first speech as leader to the annual conference of the ruling Labour Party to announce an early election, but Brown made no mention of a vote. Instead, he gave an impassioned declaration of the values he believes in and of the challenges he believes Britain must face up to in the years ahead. "Today the rising aspirations of the British people summon us to set a new direction," he said. "Up against the competition of two billion people in China and India, we need to unlock all the talent we have." "The country that brings out the best in all its people will be the great success story of the global age," he said.

Announcing a drive to improve public services in Britain, Brown said the government would offer one-on-one tuition for 300,000 children in both English and maths. He reaffirmed his goal of abolishing child poverty in Britain in this generation and said the government planned to increase house-building to 240,000 new homes a year to meet a shortage of affordable housing. Brown pledged the government would respond with "calm vigilance" to turbulence sweeping the financial markets. A credit crunch led to the first run on a British bank in a century last week. He set out steps to both punish and prevent crime and announced a crackdown on binge drinking and under-age drinking.
