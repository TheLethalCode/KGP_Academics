<TITLE> IMF pulls back from new policy push </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  The International Monetary Fund backed away from plans to implement a controversial Policy Support Instrument deal Tuesday. "It is up to the government of Bangladesh to decide how it wants the IMF to help with reform efforts, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue," the IMF said in a statement. The decision comes in the wake of widespread criticism of the PSI arrangement which would have replaced the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility but without any financial commitments pegged to it. An IMF delegation, led by its Asia Pacific Department adviser Thomas Rumbaugh briefed the press in the conference room of Bangladesh Bank on the day of their departure. He said: "After several discussions with the government over the last few days both parties have come to the decision that the PSI treaty is not right for Bangladesh at the moment." "The IMF wants to continue its talks with the government to determine if any treaty can be signed such as the PRGF model." "The IMF has signed PSI agreements with different countries. This is not a bad deal. The PSI is the next step of PRGF." "Under the PSI treaty the IMF assists policy on different issues of macro-economics. This is not loan assistance." "We just started our discussions with the government to sign the agreement. But the country is making unnecessary noises without knowing the right information. This is nothing but misunderstanding." Over the last few weeks local economists and other experts have repeatedly drawn attention to what they have described as a worldwide withdrawal from the multi-lateral lending agencies 'intrusive policies'. Rumbaugh said: "Through discussions with various levels of the government we have confirmed that Bangladesh does not need IMF policy assistance at the moment." "We decided not to sign the deal through mutual discussion. There is no other reason behind it." The IMF's press statement said that other countries had adjusted their monetary policies to curb inflationary pressures from supply side factors. However the statement added: "In Bangladesh while private sector credit growth slowed to 15 percent as of June, this was not due to monetary tightening, but rather a result of uncertainty and reduced confidence in the business community." "We have had open and productive discussions with the government on economic reforms that would boost and further reduce poverty in Bangladesh." "The IMF's stands ready to support the government's efforts through an on-going technical assistance." "This can be complemented either through a new PRGF arrangement or through consultations and policy dialogue during regular visits." "It is up to the government of Bangladesh to decide how it wants the IMF to help with reform efforts, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue." bdnews24.
