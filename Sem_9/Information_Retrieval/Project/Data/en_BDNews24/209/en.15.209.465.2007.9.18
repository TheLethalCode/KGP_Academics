<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Detective Branch of Police detained daily Prothom Alo cartoonist Arifur Rahman midday Tuesday from in front of his Uttara home. Rahman did a cartoon story titled "Naam" on the sixth page of the 431st issue of daily's fun magazine Alpin that hit the stands Monday. The home ministry Tuesday ordered confiscation of all its copies, saying the cartoon story hurt the religious sentiment of the people. The government has already taken initiative to hold talks with religious leaders about the issue and asked all to play a restrained and responsible role regarding the unwanted incident. Prothom Alo authorities Tuesday apologised for mistakenly publishing the cartoon and said they had withdrawn the cartoon story. bdnews
