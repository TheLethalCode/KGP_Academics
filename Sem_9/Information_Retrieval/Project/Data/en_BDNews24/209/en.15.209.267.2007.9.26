 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)Stocks edged lower for a third-day Wednesday after heavyweights suffered losses in bank, power and pharmaceuticals sectors due to selling pressure, mainly from institutional investors. Although the market crept downward throughout the day, buying pressure prior to midday trade helped indices narrow the losses. Market operators attributed the steady fall to profit taking prior to Eid, and institutional investor making' adjustments on margin credits after the share price manipulation scam by merchant banking major AB Bank.
