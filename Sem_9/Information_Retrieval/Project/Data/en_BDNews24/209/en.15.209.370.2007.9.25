A Hapoalim spokeswoman said it would take several weeks for the bank to cease completely its services to Gaza's financial institutions. Israel declared the Gaza Strip an "enemy entity" last Wednesday and said it would reduce its fuel and power supplies to the territory in response to rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. It has yet to carry out any cuts and pledged to keep humanitarian aid flowing.

By formally defining Gaza as enemy territory, Israel could argue that it cannot be bound by international law to supply utilities and services to its 1.5 million people.
