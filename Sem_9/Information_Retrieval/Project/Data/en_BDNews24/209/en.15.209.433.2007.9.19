 Wanderers, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh froze on a sluggish pitch undone by rash hitting to go down by 64 runs after throttling Sri Lanka to a modest 147 for five in the Twenty20 World Championship Group F match in Johannesburg Tuesday. Sri Lanka kept alive their hopes of a place in the semi-finals with the win. Bangladeshi batsmen never threatened to reach their target of 148 from the moment they lost Mohammed Nazimuddin in the first over. Only three batsmen made double figures as the batting bordered on the bizarre and Bangladesh's hopes of progressing fizzled out. The Tigers lost half their batting line-up for 40 runs to get off to the worst possible start in the hunt. Dilhara Fernando took two for 21 in a fast and furious display with the new ball and Chaminda Vaas two for 14 in four tight overs for Sri Lanka. Aftab Ahmed and Saqib Al Hasan were joint top-scorers for Bangladesh with 18 runs apiece but the rest of the batting order were exposed for a lack of skills under pressure. Slow left-armer Sanath Jayasuriya picked up the last two wickets as he joined the attack in the 14th over. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful tried to slog Chaminda Vaas over midwicket but ended up being caught at point by Tilakratne Dilshan for four. The Tigers lost in-form Aftab Ahmed and opener Tamim Iqbal in the pace of two balls in the fourth over. Aftab was bowled by Fernando, who had Tamim caught by Lasith Malinga at third man for three. Vaas trapped opener Nazimuddin for a first-ball duck to reduce Bangladesh to one for one in the first over. Sri Lanka's runs would have been fewer had the Bangladeshi fielders not spilled catches and misfielded. The bowlers did not give much room for the Sri Lankan batsmen on a strip getting slow. Jehan Mubarak stroked 31 not out off 19 balls in the closing overs to boost Sri Lanka's total. He put on 51 runs in 5.1 overs with Tilakratne Dilshan (21 off 16 balls) after the Lankans were reduced to 96 for five in the 15th over. Seamer Syed Rasel bowled a brilliant opening spell in which he conceded just nine runs in three overs, including a maiden. He dismissed Upul Tharanga (23) when wicketkeeper Mushfiqir Rahim, standing up to the stumps, caught a bottom-edged pull between his legs. Kumar Sangakkara, bowled by off-spinner Mohammad Mahmudullah for 20, and Mahela Jayawardene, bowled by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak for 30, also played themselves in before getting out. Jayawardene survived for a run-out scare on one and dropped on 26 by Saqib Al Hasan while Sangakkara was dropped also on one. Mahmudullah Riyad was the best of the Bangladesh bowlers, conceding just 19 runs in his four overs. Sri Lanka will play Australia in Cape Town on Thursday to decide which of the two teams will make the semi-finals from their group, Pakistan being sure of their place. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza brought the first breakthrough sending Sanath Jayasuriya back in the very third ball for a first-ball duckv Saqib trapped Chamara Silva lbw for 12 off 12 balls before Tilakarathne Dilshan and Jehan Mubarak put on significant 52 for the unbroken sixth wicket. Bangladesh, needing the batting to click again after inconsistency in the last two matches, made two changes to the team that played against Australia Sunday. Big-hitting right-hander Nadif Chowdhury replaced batsman Alok Kapali who made 19 in three games and off-spinning all-rounder Mahmudullah coming in place of all-rounder Farhad Reza. For Sri Lanka, Farvez Mahroof came in for Gayan Wijekoon. bd
