 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Forest and environment adviser CS Karim said Sunday that Bangladesh should immediately stop using the gases harmful to the environment even though the country is permitted to use limited amounts as a developing country. Karim made his call from a seminar organised by the Department of Environment to observe International Ozone Day and the 20th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol, which aims to protect the ozone layer. Bangladesh became a signatory to the protocol in 1990. Under the agreement, Bangladesh must limit its consumption of both CFC-11 and CFC-12, which are particularly harmful to the ozone layer. In 1999, Bangladesh moved to cut CFC consumption by 50 percent by 2005. A further reduction of 85 percent by 2007 was also agreed upon, a step before the use of the harmful gas should be eliminated. "We were allowed to use this gas for an extended period considering our status as a developing economy," the adviser said. "CFCs not only destroy the ozone layer but also contribute to climate warming. We may bear less responsibility for this than the developed countries but we will still find Bangladesh's name on the list of most affected countries." "If global temperatures keep rising, 17 percent of our land may become submerged. To combat this we have to take effective measures and raise concerns at international forums," Karim said. Most harmful gases used in Bangladesh are used in cold storages, air conditioning and pharmaceuticals manufacturing. bdnews24.c
