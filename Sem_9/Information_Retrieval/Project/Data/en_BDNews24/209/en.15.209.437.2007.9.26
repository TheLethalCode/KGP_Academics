<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has passed a life sentence on a former aide to Shanghai's disgraced ex-Communist Party chief for his part in a huge financial scandal, state media said on Wednesday. It was the latest in a string of convictions in the social security fund scandal just weeks before the 17th Party Congress, a warning from President Hu Jintao that he wants wayward officials and potential rivals to fall into line. Qin Yu, head of a Shanghai Party district office, was found guilty of taking bribes of more than 6 million yuan ($800,000), according to a report on news Web site china.com.cn, run by the information office of the State Council, or Cabinet. Qin's one-time boss, Chen Liangyu, was sacked in September 2006 in a scandal centring on the misuse of Shanghai's social security fund, and now faces criminal investigation. With his grip on China's financial centre, Chen had defied Hu's authority. Hu is now set to consolidate his power at the five-yearly Party congress opening on Oct. 15. Five other ex-officials and businessmen belonging to the same network of suspected corruption centred on Chen were jailed for up to 15 years. They included Sun Luyi, former head of the Shanghai Party Committee's general office. Two others convicted were Ling Baoheng, former head of the Shanghai state assets administration, who was jailed for eight years for taking a 500,000-yuan bribe, and Wu Hongmei, his former deputy, who was given 11 years, the report added. Sources have told Reuters that Chen himself is likely to face trial after the Party congress. ($1=7.511 Yu
