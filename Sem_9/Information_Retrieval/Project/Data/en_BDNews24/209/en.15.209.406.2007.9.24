<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com) The conduct and action of politicians will determine when the state of emergency should be lifted, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Monday. "We were never in favour of imposing emergency rules," Mainul told reporters after a meeting on land management at the land ministry. "We were rather compelled to resort to declaring a state of emergency as politicians continued to behave erratically, jeopardising the nation's existence." "Now that we want to lift it, the politicians' behaviour will determine for the nation when to end the emergency," Mainul said. Asked about the Election Commission's request for lifting the emergency, the adviser said: "It is the government's obligation to consider the Election Commission's proposal. It should, however, be taken into account that it was the irresponsible actions of the politicians which led to a state of chaos and unrest. "It is imperative, therefore, that their behaviour and attitudes are corrected," he added. "The government is interested to assist in the nation's journey through a free and fair election by removing restrictions imposed on indoor politics and lifting the state of emergency," Mainul said. bdnews24.co
