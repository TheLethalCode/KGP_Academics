 LOS ANGELES, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six months after achieving Oscar glory for his climate change documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth,' former Vice President Al Gore is headed back to the red carpet for the Emmys, US television's highest honors. Gore is expected to receive an 'interactive television services' Emmy, a noncompetitive award, on Sunday for his fledgling cable network and online video venture Current TV, which he launched in August 2005.
