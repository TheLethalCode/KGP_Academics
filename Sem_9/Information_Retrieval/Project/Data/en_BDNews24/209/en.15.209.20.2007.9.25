 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) Five former ministers who were also members of the cabinet committee on purchase testified in the GATCO graft case Tuesday against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 12 others. The Anticorruption Commission summoned the five influential politicians, who had served the Khaleda administration, to help probe the circumstances surrounding the scam. ACC officials said the commission was probing why the cabinet committee had first rejected GATCO's container handling offer but subsequently approved it without raising any objection. Former finance and planning minister M Saifur Rahman was the first to arrive at the ACC at 11am to be quizzed by Zahirul Huda, ACC deputy director. Former information minister M Shamsul Islam and former local government minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan arrived next at 12 noon. Former agriculture minister MK Anwar and industry minister Matiur Rahman Nizami also testified in the case. Khaleda, the BNP chairperson, and younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 from their home. On Sept 2, ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 people, including Khaleda and son Arafat Rahman Coco. The first information report (FIR) of the case filed in 2003 alleged Global Agro Trade Company (GATCO), an "inefficient and inexperienced" firm, had been unlawfully awarded the contract to handle containers at Chittagong Port Terminal Yard and Kamalapur Inland Container Depot. Akbar Hossain, the late shipping minister and son Ismail Hossain Saimon persuaded Coco and Khaleda to intervene to give the work to GATCO, according to the FIR. Saimon was arrested Monday. The purchase committee rejected GATCO's bid on November 12, 2003 on the grounds that it had no experience of container handling and recommended a re-tender. However, the prime minister Khaleda snubbed the committee's recommendation and awarded the work to GATCO, which was unfit for the job, the case alleged. The members of the cabinet purchase committee in question are former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, local government minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, health minister Dr Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, information minister M Shamsul Islam, agriculture minister MK Anwar and industry minister Matiur Rahman Nizami. The cabinet secretary acted as the ex-officio member-secretary to the committee. Dr Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain and AKM Mossharraf Hossain are now in jail. bdnews24
