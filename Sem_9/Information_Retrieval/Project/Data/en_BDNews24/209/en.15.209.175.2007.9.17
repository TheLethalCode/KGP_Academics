 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Days after the dismantling of the 'seven-storey slum' in Mohakhali evicted families are living in the open near the bulldozed site, with no shelter, protection and amenities. The Public Works Department evicted the 10,000 residents of Mohakhali's sprawling slum on September 11, serving just a 12-hour eviction notice and without any arrangement for alternative accommodation. Despite the government's decision to ensure the rehabilitation of any community before eviction from any government land, the PWD bulldozers razed thousands of shanties to the ground, leaving thousands homeless just days before the start of Ramadan. The bdnews24.com correspondent Sunday found men, women and children in their thousands huddled together under the skies in an open field near the demolished slum site. Some had ventured out into the city looking for new living spaceanywhere to shelter or squat temporarilyonly to return hopelessly. At the fag-end of his 70-plus year life, Shukkur Miah was resettling under a tattered blue polythene sheet in the open field alongside his former home. His family has been fasting through Ramadan so far by drinking plain water before sunrise and breaking their fast with water and a fistful of dry chira (flattened rice), as they could not cook. Adding insult to injury, the local ward commissioner's men and PWD officials Sunday ordered them to vacate the area within two days, threatening them with violence if they did not. Slum evictee Abdul Zahir told bdnews24.com that commissioner of local ward no. 20 Abul Kalam Azad and his men Selim, Morshed and Abu Taher have been intimidating them constantly and asking them to leave. "Dhaka is flooded, so is my village. Where shall we go for shelter? Aren't we Bangladeshis? Don't we have any right to live somewhere in this country?" Zahir asked. "I must find a place to sleep like a human," he said. "But room-rent in other slums has doubled or tripled in some cases after they heard about this seven-storey slum eviction." Hosne Ara Begum, another evictee, told bdnews24.com: "The PWD men severed our water supply lines during Ramadan." "We are breaking our day-long fast by drinking contaminated water. Allah will certainly punish them for such atrocities." Kamaluddin, a retired government employee and ex-resident of the slum, said: "This is the first time in my long life that I ever interrupted my fasting during Ramadan and it's because of this eviction and lifestyle getting upset." Aminuddin, son of Kamaluddin, pointed to a sackful of school textbooks and other study materials of his seven brothers and sisters stashed under a polythene sheet. In tears, he asked: "Will the government take notice of our situation?" The evicted slum dwellers complained that two tin-roofed houses owned by PWD employees Rustam and Abu Taher were still standing intact "flying red flags" though all other shanties were just demolished. Following the demolition, slum dwellers and lawyers said the move was illegal as the High Court had frozen demolition of any slum in the city until disposal of a case filed in 2003. bdnews24.c
