 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has rejected a government appeal to cancel the stay order on the export of 187 antique artefacts for exhibition in Paris. The High Court bench of Justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Md Farid Ahmed Tuesday extended the one-week stay order it issued on Sept 17 by another two months. The extension of the stay will prevent the antiques being flown to Paris in time for exhibition on Oct 24 in Guimet Museum, a museum of Asian art in Paris, France. On Sept 17 the High Court ruled on a public interest petition submitted by seven persons, including convenor of the National Council for Protecting Archaeological Heritage Dr MA Kamal Yuri. The court issued a stay order for one week on the transport to France of 187 artefacts of historical and archaeological interest for display at the museum. Barrister Tania Amir, counsel for the petitioner, told bdnews24.com: "With the extension of the stay order, the government will not be able to send the antique pieces to France for the exhibition on Oct 24." The cultural affairs ministry Tuesday appealed to the High Court to cancel the stay order, while the seven original petitioners appealed for an extension. Deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil told bdnews24.com: "The High Court has rejected the government appeal for cancelling the stay order." "If the ministry advises, an appeal will be filed with the Supreme Court against the High Court order," he added. The government issued a circular on July 31 saying the ministry had signed an agreement with the French ambassador to send 187 antiques for exhibition at the French museum that has one of the largest collections of Asian art outside Asia. bdnews24
