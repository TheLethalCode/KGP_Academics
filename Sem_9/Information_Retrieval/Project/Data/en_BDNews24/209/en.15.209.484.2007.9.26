 UNITED NATIONS, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com) -- The President of Latvia Wednesday called for a comprehensive approach to United Nations peacekeeping, involving all facets of the system, in his address to the annual high-level debate of the General Assembly. A former surgeon, President Valdis Zatlers drew an analogy between surgery and collective security. "It is not enough for the Security Council to prescribe peacekeeping operations, crucial as they are for international peace and security," he said, quoted by the United Nations in a statement. "The whole United Nations system is necessary for the long-term recovery of conflict zones." He paid tribute to dedicated staff working in difficult peacekeeping missions. "It is our duty in our capitals and here at the UN Headquarters to support their efforts, each Member State according to its capacity," he said. On the specific case of Kosovo, he expressed support for the proposal put forward by the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari. "This proposal currently remains the only viable diplomatic solution on the table," he said, calling the active involvement of the European Union "important to achieve a lasting solution." Ahtisaari's proposal calls for a phased process of independence for the Albanian-majority Serbian province. "We urge both parties to show flexibility and commitment to a peaceful, negotiated outcome," said President Zatlers.
