 MADRID, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho is working to recover from his calf injury and expects to be back in time for Barcelona's next Champions League match, club president Joan Laporta said on Tuesday. The 27-year-old Brazilian pulled out of the squad to face Sevilla in the Primera Liga on Saturday, and has been the subject of intense speculation and criticism over his form, having been substituted in the previous three games. "He is suffering because he is injured. He's completing a recovery plan and he probably won't make the Zaragoza or Levante games, but he has told me he will play against Stuttgart," Laporta told radio station Cadena Ser. He went on to say the club needed to support Ronaldinho so he did not feel left out. "He brought hope back to Barcelona and we have to thank him for that and stand by him because I am sure he will return to give us more afternoons of success," Laporta added. Barca, who are fourth in the standings two points behind leaders Real Madrid, host Real Zaragoza on Wednesday and visit Levante on Saturday. They travel to face VfB Stuttgart in Champions League Group E next Tuesday
