 BAGHDAD, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's Interior Ministry has finished draft legislation that would end legal immunity enjoyed by private security contractors in the wake of a deadly shooting involving US firm Blackwater, an official said on Tuesday. In fresh violence, a suicide car bomb killed three people near a police station in the southern Shi'ite city of Basra. Car bombings are rare in Basra, the hub for Iraq's oil industry. Two car bombs also killed six people and wounded 20 in the Zayouna district of eastern Baghdad, police and a hospital official said. Interior Ministry spokesman Major-General Abdul-Kareem Khalaf told a news conference the draft law had been submitted to the State Shura Council, a body which vets legal language in drafts before they can be passed to parliament for debate. Iraq has said it would review the status of all security firms after what it called a flagrant assault by Blackwater contractors in which 11 people were killed while the firm was escorting a U.S. embassy convoy through Baghdad on Sept. 16. "This legislation will cover everything to do with these companies. The companies will come under the grip of Iraqi law, will be monitored by the Interior Ministry and will work under its guidelines," Khalaf said. "They will be strictly punished for any (violations) on the street," he said. The shooting has incensed Iraqis who regard the tens of thousands of security contractors working in the country as private armies that act with impunity. At issue for many Iraqis is sovereignty, given that security firms have immunity from Iraqi law under a 2004 regulation written while Iraq was under US administration following the toppling of Saddam Hussein the year before. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had vowed to freeze the work of Blackwater, which guards the US embassy in Baghdad, and prosecute its staff over the shooting he called a crime. But Iraq has since appeared to soften its stand. The government spokesman said this week that no action would be taken against Blackwater until after a joint investigation with US officials. The US embassy is conducting a separate inquiry into the circumstances of the shooting, in which Blackwater guards are accused of opening fire without provocation. Blackwater says its guards reacted lawfully to an attack on a US convoy. Khalaf has previously said the draft law would give the ministry powers to prosecute the companies and to refuse or revoke contracts. A number of security firms do not have the proper registration to operate in Iraq, something they blame on bureaucratic delays and obstacles. In Basra, the city's police chief Major-General Abdul Jalil Khalaf blamed Sunni Islamist al Qaeda for the car bombing there, which he said had also wounded five people. A health official said 20 people had been hurt. Most violence in Basra has either been directed against British forces in the region or been fighting among Shi'ite factions vying for influence. Suicide car bombs are the hallmark of al Qaeda, but they attack mostly in the centre of Iraq or in northern and western are
