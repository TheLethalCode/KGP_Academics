<TEXT>
 Dhaka Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government's policies to reduce inflation have created uncertainty among business leaders and contributed to price hikes rather than curbing them, the Asian Development Bank said Monday. "Investigations into certain businesses suspected of hoarding supplies, measures to regulate stock levels and prices appeared to have had no discernible impact on inflation," said the bank in its Asian Development Outlook 2007 Update. "They have rather created uncertainty and upped the price pressures," continued the report. Hua Du, ADB's Bangladesh representative, spoke to reporters after the reports launch: "The bank is concerned with the rising inflation and a lack of business confidence and its consequent impact on the economy." The report made an upward adjustment in its inflation forecasts, from 6 percent to 7 percent for fiscal 2007-08, in the light of heightened pressures that influenced the second half of the last fiscal year. Hua Du said: "The government must ensure that the transitional period will not affect the national economy." However, she remained upbeat regarding the long-term benefits of the caretaker government's recent steps. "The drive against corruption and efforts to improve poor governance will lay foundations for the long-run benefit," Hua Du said. The Update said: "Bangladesh's economy will expand by 6.5 percent in fiscal 2007-08, lowered slightly from the ADO 2007 projection because of floods." "Robust remittance, steady industrial expansion and moderate agricultural growth of (2.8 percent despite floods) will ensure continued economic growth in FY 2008." it said. "Despite steady growth in exports, the country still runs the risk of facing tough competition in its two largest markets, US and Europe, as the safeguard quota measures on Chinese textiles will expire at the end of 2008." "Private sector credit growth slowed down to 15.1 percent in June 2007 from 18.3 percent in the previous year because of lack of business confidence following anti-corruption measures, not for the policy measures of the central bank," the report said. The report also pointed to various risks that could derail their projections, such as political uncertainty. The ADB report continued: "The outlook will depend crucially on the caretaker government's success in maintaining political stability with broad public support until the elections are held." "Any material setback on the political front would undermine business confidence and negatively affect investment and growth." The Manila-based multilateral lending agency also suggested the government strengthen measures to reduce ongoing losses in the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, Bangladesh Power Development Board, nationalised commercial banks and other state-owned enterprises. The ADO Update predicts growth in Asia and the Pacific region at 8.3 percent this year from an earlier estimate of 7.6 percent, mainly due to rapid growth in China and India. The Asian Development Outlook is an annual economic report on member countries. The ADO 2007 was released in March with the current update released worldwide Monday. bd
