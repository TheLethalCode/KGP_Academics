 NEW YORK, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad met leaders of an anti-Zionist Jewish group on Monday at the start of a visit to New York for the UN General Assembly meeting that has sparked protests and anger. Mainstream Jewish groups were among those who condemned an invitation by Columbia University for the Iranian leader to speak later on Monday at its World Leaders Forum.

"This is somebody who is the president of a country that is probably the greatest sponsor -- state sponsor -- of terrorism." She said she did not see a way to reach Ahmadinejad but she hoped more moderate elements in Iranian politics would see the futility of Iran's remaining so isolated in the world. "(The) regime needs to change its behavior," she said. Ahmadinejad said in a CBS television interview broadcast on Sunday that Iran did not need nuclear weapons and his country was not heading for war with the United States. Asked whether Iran and the United States were heading toward conflict over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, he said: "It's wrong to think that Iran and the US are walking toward war. Who says so?
