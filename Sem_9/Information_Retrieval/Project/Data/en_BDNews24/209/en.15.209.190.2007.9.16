<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)LDP president Badruddoza Chowdhury Sunday denied the possibility of joining a BNP faction as part of a proposal by so-called reformists. "I won't join any of the BNP factions," he told reporters at a joint meeting of LDP and BNP leaders at Baridhara KC Memorial Clinic. "However, if an alliance or platform of nationalist and democratic forces, including the BNP faction, is forged on political necessity, I will be at the forefront of it," he added. The joint meeting was held to discuss the proposal by the Bhuiyan-led reformist faction of BNP for Badruddoza's return to the troubled party. The day-long meeting, which was adjourned in the evening without reaching a decision, resumes Monday. LDP secretary general Abdul Mannan told reporters earlier in the day: "When Badruddoza Chowdhury left BNP four years ago to form political party Bikalpa Dhara, many BNP leaders made derogatory remarks about him." "The same people are now trying to use Prof Chowdhury as their safety talisman. Both the factions of BNP have realised his merit, but too late," he added. Mannan went on to say that BNP was now a sinking ship and that leaders of both BNP factions are coming to Badruddoza Chowdhury to keep it afloat. "But one has to keep in mind that he is the head of a political party," Mannan said. "When a house catches fire many othersapart from the firemenmay help to put out the fire. Prof Chowdhury may come forward to put out the fire within BNP as a guardian to allbut he will do it as the LDP leader," Mannan said. Badruddoza's son and LDP member Mahi B Chowdhury told reporters: "Those who once termed him (Badruddoza) conspirator have now rushed to him to save themselves." "It proved that he is not only a leader of LDP, he is the leader of all. If an alliance or platform of nationalist and democratic forces is forged in future he will remain at its forefront as a guardian," bdnews2
