 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday ordered arrest of former minister Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, former prime minister's political secretary Harris Chowdhury and Basundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, better known as Shah Alam, and 20 others. In the same case, two more persons face orders to appear in court in so-called "warrants of custody" as they are already detained in jail in separate cases. Judge Md Azizul Haque of Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court issued the warrants against a total of 25 people at 3pm on charges of having roles in selling 18 government houses without tender, forcing the government to count about Tk 128 crore in losses. Among the accused, former housing and public works minister Mirza Abbas and former Rajuk director (finance) Humayun Khan are in jail. Deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission Rezaul Hasan Tarafder submitted 15 chargesheets to the court on Sept 20 against the 25 people. Forty people have been made witnesses in the case. ACC assistant director Shahidul Alam on March 29 filed the case with Motijheel Police Station charging them with abusing powers to sell the houses without following a proper procedure. The case alleged that Mirza Abbas in collaboration with the former and present officials of the city developer sold the abandoned houses in Dhanmondi, Gulshan, Banani and New Eskaton without tender. The houses were sold at much lower than market prices and their "corruption" cost the state coffers Tk 127.64 crore in losses, it was alleged. bdnews24.com
