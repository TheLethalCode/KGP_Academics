 LOS ANGELES, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most US parents said their children had encountered 'issues' like bad language, sex or advertising online over the past year, but they are not stopping their kids' Internet use, according to a new study.

It also found that 85 percent talked to their children about online safety in the past year.
