 TBILISI, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's parliament boosted defence spending on Wednesday by more than a quarter to improve its army to NATO standards and show a strong face amid deteriorating ties with its former imperial master Russia.

Georgian officials say they have no plans to invade. Senior Georgian military officials say they want to turn the army into a professional force and are seeking to employ more officers, offering a range of benefits including higher salaries and apartments.
