<TITLE> New Japan PM Fukuda's strongest weapon: blandness </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In keeping with traditional Japanese humility, new prime minister Yasuo Fukuda says he's uneducated and lacks expertise. But fans of the 71-year-old say his air of normality may be what Japan needs after five years of populist leader Junichiro Koizumi's combative reforms, followed by a year of political scandals and missteps under outgoing prime minister Shinzo Abe. Fukuda was picked as prime minister by parliament's lower house on Tuesday, making him the oldest new leader since Kiichi Miyazawa assumed the office in 1991 at the age of 72, and the first son of a premier to hold the post. "I'm not highly educated or talented, and I don't have much experience," Fukuda said after he was chosen as the ruling party president on Sunday to succeed Shinzo Abe, who abruptly announced his resignation on Sept. 12. Fukuda, who won the backing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's main factions, doesn't seem bothered by criticism of his laid-back style, saying the public needs to get to know him better before he can exert strong leadership. The bespectacled Fukuda has described his own personality as normal, and can seem a bit shy and stiff in front of a crowd. On a campaign tour last week in a Tokyo suburb, he was given a chance to hug a baby -- but politely turned down the offer. Later, though, he took a toddler on his knee when visiting a child-care centre. Fukuda has also been criticised for the vagueness of his policy platform. But some analysts say he has been making the best of his apparent shortcomings. "His humanity shows through more than it did. He laughs at himself and makes jokes," said Steven Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in Tokyo. "He used to be the dourest face in the world." SHREWD, BUT TESTY After graduating from the prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo with an economics degree, Fukuda worked at a Japanese oil company for 17 years, during which he spent two years in the United States. In a party filled with family dynasties, he later became a political aide to his father, Takeo Fukuda, who served as prime minister from 1976 to 1978. First elected to parliament in 1990, Yasuo Fukuda served in the pivotal post of chief cabinet secretary under Koizumi, extending his influence into diplomacy and sparking a highly public feud with the foreign minister at the time, fiery lawmaker Makiko Tanaka. Tanaka, who accused Fukuda of acting as a "shadow foreign minister", lost the fight and was sacked by Koizumi in 2002. Critics of Koizumi's visits to Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism because World War Two leaders convicted as war criminals are among the dead honoured there, had hoped Fukuda would challenge Abe for the premiership last year. Sino-Japanese ties chilled markedly under Koizumi, in part because of his pilgrimages to Yasukuni. Fukuda has said he will stay away from the shrine. He favours a new, secular memorial where both civilian and military war dead would be honoured but said last week the time was not yet right. Despite his shrewd image, though, Fukuda is no stranger to gaffes. He set off a furore when he told reporters in 2002 that Japan, the only country to suffer atomic bombings, might review its ban on nuclear arms. Although a professed advocate of policies to promote gender equality, Fukuda came under heavy fire in 2003 when reporters leaked an off-the-record remark that some women were asking to be raped by dressing provocatively. Known for a short temper, Fukuda abruptly stepped down as chief cabinet secretary in 2004 after admitting to skipping some payments into the public pension scheme. Some analysts, though, attributed his departure to friction with Koizumi and his close aides over diplomatic poli
