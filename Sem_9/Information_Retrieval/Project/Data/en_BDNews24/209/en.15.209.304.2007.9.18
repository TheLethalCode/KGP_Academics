 Johannesburg, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mohammad Ashraful is sanguine about a semifinal spot despite back-to-back losses ahead of Bangladesh's second ICC Twenty20 World Championship Super Eights game against Sri Lanka at Wanderers Tuesday. "We have not gone down or anything. We can lift ourselves and finish very well in the next games," a confident Asraful was quoted by Bangladesh Cricket Board's official site tigercricket.com as saying Sunday. The Tigers then take on Pakistan in Cape Town on Sept 20 in their last Super Eights match. "These are teams we know well and play a lot of matches against. We are confident of getting a good result against both teams. Also, at the Wanderers the wicket will be better to bat on," Ashraful was quoted by TigerCricket.com. "Obviously winning. We have the players who can make it possible and we expect to do well in the next two matches," he said to a question about what is a good result against those teams. He said the plan remains same for the Sri Lanka game. "The plan will be to stay positive. The wicket of Wanderers is a better strip to bat on." Under lights, in excellent batting conditions Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and the likes would look to show their full array of strokes. Bangladesh Bangladesh have blooded in two youngsters for Tuesday's game. Big-hitting right-hander Nadif Chowdhury will replace batsman Alok Kapali who made 19 in three games and off-spinning all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad coming in place of all-rounder Farhad Reza. "Sri Lanka is a team we know well. I don't see any reason why we cannot get a result against them if we play anything like we did against the West Indies and for the first 10 overs against South Africa," said Ashraful. "This is a 40-over game and things change fast. Chris Gayle made a stunning hundred against South Africa and was out in the first over against us. "Same thing may happen to Sri Lanka's prolific scorers like (Sanath) Jayasuriya and Mahela (Jayawardene). The wicket is good whether you bat first or second and the outfield will not be spongy like Cape Town and there will be value for shots," added Ashraful. A sensational win against the West Indies that dumped the Caribbeans out and a sparkling start against the hosts earned Bangladesh the tag of one of the most entertaining teams in the Twenty20's big edition. Fans did not rule out an odd upset against the Australians too, keeping the "Cardiff Epic" in their mind, but the world champions put in a masterclass to easily tame the Tigers by nine wickets. Ashraful praised the Aussie bowlers but defending his batters. "The plan was the same. We just told the openers to get a measure of things in the first couple of overs and then go for it. "The Australians bowled really well. They mixed things up, bowled a lot of slower balls, took the pace of the wicket and that made it very difficult for us to play like we did against South Africa." It would doubtless be a stiff challenge for the bowlers to contain in-form Lankan batsman led by Sanath Jayasuriya although he failed against Pakistan. The one-day World Cup runners-up, who racked up the highest Twenty20 total of 260 for six against Kenya, lost to Pakistan by 33 runs in their first Super Eight clash and would be desperate to win Tuesday's tie. Pakistan, who put their campaign back on track by thrashing Sri Lanka, are no easy-beaters who showed . Ashraful thinks otherwise, though. He sees positives from the loss in Cape Town. "The batting of Aftab is one as he scored in all three matches. The bowling was good too. Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel all did their job nicely." Winning the toss matters to Ashraful. "There is less pressure when you know your target and you can pace yourself accordingly." Vice-captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza also hopes they will be able to put in a better performance this time. "Just remember that we have beaten the West Indies and almost got one over South Africa where another 15-20 runs could have won it for us. "We have played good cricket and let's go and enjoy the remaining two matches and give it our best shot," Mortaza said while speaking to the players after a stretching session at the team's hotel in the afternoon. All said, Bangladesh will still rely heavily on the bat of the captain himself. If Ashraful comes firing on all cylinders, there should surely be something for the Tigers. bdn
