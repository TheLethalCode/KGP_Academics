<TITLE> EU tries to save satellite system with public funds </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -The European Union's executive arm will lay out a funding plan on Wednesday for its troubled satellite navigation system, hoping public money will jump-start the project before it loses political support. The multi-billion-euro system, dubbed Galileo, is meant to rival the US Global Positioning System. But it has suffered from extended delays and a funding crisis after a consortium of companies charged with building it collapsed earlier this year amid political infighting and concern about costs. In June EU ministers conceded that plans to secure private financing had failed, but did not agree whether a resulting 2.4 billion euro ($3.3 billion) shortfall should be covered by EU states or the 27-nation bloc's collective budget. The European Commission will seek to solve that problem on Wednesday with a proposal laying out where to get the money. "It's a way which relies on a mix of several sources, several community sources," said one EU official familiar with the proposal. Brussels hopes the proposal, which will also specify responsibilities for all the institutions involved in Galileo, will reinvigorate the project before it fails for good. YEAR-END DEADLINE "If we don't have a decision before the end of the year including on the financing, we consider that the whole project is really at risk," the EU source said. The 30-satellite system is meant to be running by 2012 at a cost of 3.4 billion euros. Critics say the cost will be higher and have questioned the logic of replicating the US service. But the Commission has maintained its support, arguing the system will create jobs and revenue and ensure independence from the United States' technology. Officials in Brussels declined to comment on whether EU states would be asked to contribute more funding or whether the project could be financed through the previously established EU budget, possibly by taking money away from other schemes. "It will be a community funding proposal," said a spokesman for the Commission's budget division, defining that as "money that member states contribute to the European budget and spend through the European budget." German magazine Focus, citing government sources in Berlin, said Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy had agreed their two countries could cover the full cost of Galileo if necessary. "Talks are continuing at the European level," a German government source told Reuters, when asked about the report. German and French companies would likely be heavily involved in the construction and deployment of the satellites. The original consortium included aerospace giant EADS, France's Thales and Alcatel-Lucent , Britain's Inmarsat, Italy's Finmeccanica, Spain's AENA and Hispasat, and an eighth member that includes Deutsche Telekom and the German Aerospace Centre.
