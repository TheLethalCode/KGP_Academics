 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday cleared former president HM Ershad of charges in the Gold Smuggling Case. First additional sessions judge Md Abul Bashar handed down the verdict, which had been deferred several times earlier. "I have got justice," Ershad, chief of Jatiya Party, told bdnews24.com in his instant reaction. Ershad's lawyer Sheikh Sirajul Islam said: "The verdict has proved that the judiciary works independently." "The then BNP government filed the case with a political motive. The eight witnesses on behalf of the state could not say anything about Ershad's involvement in the case," he added. Immigration officials seized gold worth Tk 2.4 crore from two foreigners' luggage at Zia International Airport on July 16 1990. Customs and VAT inspector Md Zakaria filed a case with the Airport Police Station. Ershad was not named in the case, nor was he included in the first chargesheet submitted to court. The police pressed charges against Ershad in a supplementary chargesheet, submitted to court on Aug 31 1991. The judge Tuesday said the accused person was acquitted of the charges as nothing was proved against him beyond doubt under the Special Powers Act. Ershad appeared in court shortly after 10 in the morning, accompanied by party colleagues Anisul Islam Mahmud, ABM Ruhul Amin Howlader, Syed Abu Hossain Babla and Zia Uddin Bablu. bdnews24
