 LONDON/PARIS, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If pricey hotels put you off travel, China, South Africa and Florida might be more attractive destinations for your next vacation than Europe. Moscow, New York, Venice and London have the most expensive average hotel prices, while Cape Town, Guangzhou in China and Orlando in Florida have the cheapest, a survey released on Tuesday by Internet booking site Hotels.com said. "We're finding the traditional weekend breakers who used to go to Paris, Venice, Rome are now looking further afield," Hotels.com spokeswoman Alison Couper said. She said one of the trends in Europe was a growing interest in low-budget eastern European destinations such as Budapest. Poland, Hungary, Germany and Slovakia had some of Europe's cheapest hotel prices on average. Average prices paid for hotels across all categories in the second quarter of the business year for 2007 ranged from a top-end of 284 euros ($393.60) a night for a room in Moscow to just 81 euros in Cape Town, the survey revealed. Budget two-star hotel prices were cheapest in China, with three cities; Guangzhou (46 euros), Shanghai (46 euros) and Beijing (48 euros) rated as the top three cheapest, while New York at 170 euros, Venice (149 euros) and Amsterdam (131 euros) cost the most. Moscow also topped the list of four-star hotel prices at 332 euros a night, followed by New York, Venice and Paris, while Cairo took first place as the cheapest place to find four-star accommodation at 86 euros, followed by Berlin, Budapest and Frankfurt. Russians were also revealed as the biggest spenders when it comes to hotel prices, paying an average of 146 euros a night, but followed fairly closely by British tourists who paid on average 138 euros a night for a room. Finnish travelers were the most frugal with an average price paid of 111 euros. Average US hotel room rates fell in the second quarter of 2007 but rose to record levels in Europe, led by a 20 percent jump in Oslo, according to the Hotel Prices Index (HPI) survey. The survey is based on data gathered by the bookings site, which is owned by Expedia. The index rose to 116 from 115 a year earlier. But this masked declines in America and the rest of the world. The survey showed that a US hotel room in the three months to June 30 cost on average 105 euros a night, down 0.5 percent year-on-year. However, New York prices rose 7 percent to 210 euros, making the city second only to Moscow on 284 euros in the league table of the world's most expensive destinations. Prices in Europe rose on average 5.2 percent to 132 euros, driven by big gains in London and Nordic cities which offset declines in Germany, where prices were boosted in the same 2006 period by the soccer World Cup championships. "The UK posted a rise of 17 percent year-on-year to be the most expensive country destination across Europe. A hotel in the UK now sets the average traveler back 162 euros a night - eight percent more than Switzerland, the next most expensive nation," hotels.com said in a statement. Poland (102 euros), Germany and Hungary (both 105 euros) were the cheapest countries. French hotels cost on average 124 euros a night despite a 10 percent rise in Paris to 151 euros. A hotel room in Beijing, due to host the Olympic Games in 2008, cost on average 100 euros in the period, roughly the same as in Berlin, one of Europe's cheapest cities, hotels.com sa
