 CARACAS, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Calling capitalism a poison, President Hugo Chavez threatened on Monday to close private schools that break state rules as a new school year began with many Venezuelans worried about ideology in education. Chavez plans to propose a new education law that has stirred strong debate even before a draft has been published, and some education leaders accuse the government of wanting to indoctrinate children in socialism. The ally of Fidel Castro dismissed fears of a Cuba-prescribed education in Venezuela, but he told private schools they had to accept state inspectors and could not act above the law. "We cannot let the private sector do whatever it likes," he said in a speech to inaugurate the school year to a school audience of pupils dressed in white uniform shirts. "They are subordinate to the constitution, to the national education system ... If anyone does not like that, they will have to close their school," he added. He said history textbooks needed to be changed because they were Eurocentric and he told teachers to eschew promoting capitalism. "We cannot allow them to poison our children with those old models that teach capitalism, consumerism," said Chavez, who acknowledged having to wake up hours earlier than usual to make it to school. He said Venezuela needed educational reforms because the current system was "colonial, capitalist and soul-destroying." Chavez has nationalized oil, electricity and telecommunications assets this year and regularly warns other sectors such as clinics or banks to toe his government's line as he strives to turn the OPEC nation into a socialist state. But he has moved slowly in making changes in the country's schools since 2001 when his educational reform plans became a lightning rod for massive street protests against him. Polls consistently show Venezuelans reject government interference in their private lives, especially if it involves their children. For Luis Vicente Leon, the head of local pollster Datanalisis, Chavez's warning to private schools stated the obvious but was likely to worry upper- and middle-class parents who fear him imposing his ideology on a polarized nation. "They are very sensitive when it comes to education," he said. "This will be perceived as a threat and cause them a lot of stress.
