<TITLE> IMF's Rato says liquidity crisis easing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The liquidity crisis on global financial markets is easing and most of the world will emerge unscathed, with the exception of the United States, IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said on Tuesday. "We have to recognise that the evolution of recent days is moving towards normalisation," Rato told a news conference in Moscow. Rato said the situation on interbank and credit markets was easing after turbulence stemming from the US subprime mortgage loans crisis. But it would take some time to tally the losses suffered by investors in securities backed by home loans that have turned bad. Rato welcomed steps taken by central banks to keep the global financial system afloat. "Events on financial markets are still unfolding and it will be some months before the extent of banks' and investors' losses will become clear," Rato said after meeting Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin and central bank Chairman Sergei Ignatyev. "In this context of a lack of confidence and state of turbulence, we welcome the actions of central banks to maximise liquidity," he said. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half point last week. Rato's remarks were slightly less gloomy than his comments in Madrid on Monday but echoed the Fund's twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report just released. U.S. WORST HIT Rato said the economic impact of the liquidity crisis on the world economy was still uncertain. "It will probably be felt more in 2008 and probably the most affected country will be the United States," he said. He said the credit crisis occurred against the background of a strong world economy, and strong corporate balance sheets. "Although the crisis is serious, I think the impact on the world economy will be modest," he said, pointing to economic "decoupling" in China, India, Russia, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. "Also we see the impact of the credit crisis to be limited on European growth." Rato was in Moscow to push an IMF reform agenda designed to boost the voting power of emerging markets nations that will be discussed at its October meeting in Washington. Rato, who is stepping down from the job early, declined to comment when asked about Russia's nomination of Czech former central banker Josef Tosovsky as his replacement. France's Dominique Strauss-Kahn looks a racing certainty to land the job after winning the backing of both the European Union and the United States, which between them have enough IMF votes to push through an agreed candidate. Rato said he was "encouraged" by the latest changes in Russia's government, in which President Vladimir Putin on Monday promoted Kudrin to the rank of deputy premier and brought pro-reform technocrats into the government. "A strong reform agenda should build on the achievements of the last few years," Rato told reporters. He said Russia should experience "very limited" short-term effects from the global markets squeeze, but cautioned that parts of the financial sector could be affected by a lack of access to international credit. Rato also called on the authorities to liberalise the exchange rate of the rouble, which is now at eight-year highs against the U.S. dollar, and tighten fiscal policy. "The IMF is of the opinion that it would be to the advantage of Russia to have a more flexible exchange rate. I once again, in the name of the fund, advised the Russian authorities to concentrate policy on inflation," he sa
