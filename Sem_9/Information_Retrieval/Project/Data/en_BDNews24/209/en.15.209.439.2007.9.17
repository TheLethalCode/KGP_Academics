 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Non-governmental organisation BRAC may rethink its operation strategy in Afghanistan if the killing and abduction of its staff were "politically motivated", a top official said Monday. "If the killing and abduction of our staff are politically motivated, we have to rethink the operation in Afghanistan strategically. We are concerned about the incidents of killing and abduction in a week," Dr Mahbub Hossain, BRAC's executive director, said to reporters. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee official Abdul Alim was killed on Sept 13 and colleague Nurul Islam was abducted in Lagore Province, south of Kabul, on Sept 15 in Afghanistan. BRAC has been active in Afghanistan since 2002, aiming to empower the poor with programmes in micro-finance, education, health and agriculture. "So far we have come to know from the Afghan government that the killing and abduction of BRAC staff are stray incidents. The Afghan police are providing us with support," Dr Hossain said after he had led a BRAC delegation to a meeting with acting foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain. BRAC's deputy executive director Aminul Islam and director of Public Affairs and Communication M Anwarul Haq also attended the meeting. The BRAC officials asked the secretary to send a letter of appreciation to the Afghan government for its sincere efforts to end the hostage crisis. The secretary assured the BRAC officials of all help to secure the release of Nurul Islam. "Earlier, there were campaigns against NGO in Afghanistan, but the local people protected us as we work for their welfare," said Dr Hossain. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday made a general appeal for the release of the kidnapped BRAC official. "I fervently appeal to the abductors to release him (Nurul Islam) as his mission in Afghanistan is purely humanitarian," Chowdhury told reporters at his office at the ministry of foreign affairs. The adviser said he had talks with Afghan ambassador in Dhaka Ahmad Karim Nawabi who assured him of his government's cooperation in the matter. BRAC has nearly 4,000 workers including over 200 Bangladeshis in 351 offices in 26 provinces across Afghanistan. Bangladesh has no mission in Afghanistan and the ambassador in Uzbekistan has been told to get in contact with the Afghan government for the release of the BRAC staffer. bdn
