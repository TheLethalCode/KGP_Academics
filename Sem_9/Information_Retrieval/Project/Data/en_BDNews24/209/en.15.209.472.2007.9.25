 WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fuses intended for use in a suspected plot to bomb US installations in Germany came from Syria through Turkey, the German interior minister said on Tuesday. Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble revealed more details about the plot that authorities said they disrupted with three arrests earlier this month. He said the suspects had received an order from Pakistan to act by mid-September. German security officials also were monitoring three men who had trained in a Pakistan camp for militants, but lacked the evidence to arrest them, Schaeuble said. The threat from the al Qaeda-linked Islamic Jihad Union, which claimed responsibility for the German plot, has not been eliminated, he said. US installations remained a potential target. "We have the message of Islamic Jihad Union that the threat is ongoing, and I think we have to take it seriously," Schaeuble told reporters. Schaeuble was in Washington for security talks with Bush administration officials and congressional leaders. He cited details of the plot as an example of the challenges in fighting militant networks. "We know that fuses for these bombs ... came from Syria via Turkey to Germany," he said. "We know there are connections. We know that there is a clear network." "The demand came from Pakistan (that) it's time to take action in the first half of September," he said. Al Qaeda is believed to have regrouped in the remote mountains of Pakistan's border area with Afghanistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Schaeuble reiterated his call for an overhaul of international law and for common trans-Atlantic security policies to fight the "asymmetric" battles waged by militant networks. He cited frustration with the issue of two German citizens and a permanent resident who were arrested in Pakistan after training in a militant camp. The three were returned to Germany, but authorities lacked a basis to detain them. "Now we have to watch them," he said. After a long debate over whether to punish the "intentions" of a terrorism suspect, Germany is likely to pass legislation outlawing training in militant tactics such as bomb-building, Schaeuble predicted. Countries need common policies on issues including civil liberties and data privacy so they can better fight terrorism and win international support, he said. "Unilateral decisions are not very effective in convincing other people." Schaeuble also said he was discussing with U.S. officials ways to combine US and European operations to train police in Afghanistan. Germany led the training of Afghan police from 2002 until this year, when the European Union took over the role.
