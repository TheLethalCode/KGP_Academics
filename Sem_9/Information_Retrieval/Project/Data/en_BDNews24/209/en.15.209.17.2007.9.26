<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second seed Andy Roddick withdrew from the Thailand Open due to injury on Wednesday, the latest big name no-show on the courts of the ill-fated tournament. Roddick called a news conference 30 minutes before his first round match with Taiwan's Yeu-Tzuoo Wang to announce he was pulling out with a foot injury sustained on Tuesday. His withdrawal follows those of world numbers two and three, Rafael Nadal of Spain and Serbian Novak Djokovic, Asian number one Lee Hyung-taik of South Korea, former top 10 Swede Joachim Johansson and home favourite Paradorn Srichaphan. "I came straight here to practice but I had to stop, I hurt the bottom part of my foot, I spent the rest of yesterday getting treatment," said Roddick, who lost to Roger Federer in the final of the 2004 tournament in Bangkok. "It felt ok, but I was in my room, something happened and I hurt it again. "This is part of sport," he added. "It's not fun, no one enjoys it." Czech Tomas Berdych is the only top 10 player remaining in the $550,000 tourname
