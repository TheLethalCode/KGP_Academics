 WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of US violent crimes increased in 2006 for the second consecutive year, with more than 17,000 murders nationwide, the FBI said on Monday. Criminal justice experts have blamed the crime increases on gangs, youth violence, more gun crimes and fewer police on the beat.

According to the report, law enforcement authorities made more arrests for drug abuse violations in 2006 -- an estimated 1.9 million arrests or about 13 percent of the total number of arrests -- than for any other offense.
