 ISLAMABAD, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto said on Tuesday she was surprised President Pervez Musharraf would seek re-election while still army chief and said her party might quit parliament if he did not take steps to restore democracy. Bhutto, a two-time prime minister who still leads the Pakistan People's Party, hopes to return after an eight-year exile in October and has been negotiating a power-sharing deal with Musharraf for months. She has insisted he quit the army post before a presidential election due on Oct. 15. "But he has not quite done this ... I was quite surprised to hear that he is going to retire as army chief in November," Bhutto told Reuters in a telephone interview. "The Pakistan People's Party wants to support General Musharraf if he takes the country towards democracy but we do not want to bail out a military dictatorship," she said. Musharraf's top legal aide told the Supreme Court on Tuesday the embattled president would give up his position of army chief if he was re-elected for another term by an electoral college of members of the national and provincial assemblies. Bhutto, who said she planned to return to Pakistan on Oct. 18, with or without a deal with Musharraf, said her party could not support the notion of a military president. "We are not going to compromise on our democratic principles. We want democracy in its true spirit. If it is done through negotiations, good. If we can't get in through negotiations than we will exert pressure through the public." Bhutto faces a slew of corruption charges and possibly arrest if she returns to Pakistan. She said her support for Musharraf would hinge on him accepting proposals she had made, including immunity from prosecution for civilians who ruled between 1988 and 1999 and the lifting of a ban on a prime minister serving a third term. "If he doesn't do it then the Pakistan People's Party ... will consider resigning from parliament," she said. "I think General Musharraf should hear the voice of the people and move towards true democracy." An alliance of opposition parties that does not include the PPP has also threatened to resign from parliament should Musharraf go ahead with his re-election plans. A walk-out would not affect the election -- Musharraf's ruling party has a majority in parliament -- but it would dent its credibility. US-ally Musharraf was army chief when he seized power in 1999. He had previously refused opposition calls to give up the job, but he has seen his authority and popularity plummet since a botched attempt to sack country's chief justice in March
