 MUMBAI, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's triumphant Twenty20 World Cup squad arrived home from South Africa on Wednesday with thousands of joyous fans gathering at the airport to greet them. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his team mates were greeted by the region's chief minister before being taken on an open-top bus to the Wankhede stadium for a reception hosted by the national cricket board. Elaborate security measures were in place on the 35-kilometre journey from Mumbai airport, with giant hoardings on display to congratulate the surprise winners. India beat arch-rivals Pakistan by five runs in a thrilling final in Johannesburg on Monday, a victory to compare with their upset 1983 World Cup final win over West Indies. The Indian board has announced a win bonus of $3 million and a special cash award for batsman Yuvraj Singh, who hit six sixes in one over in a match against England.
