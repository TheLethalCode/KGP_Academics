<TITLE> Nayeemuddin dares BFF over drug row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's Indian football coach Syed Nayeemuddin and the Bangladesh Football Federation are apparently at loggerheads over a drug row. "If they don't believe me, they can send players' urine for dope test, then the truth will come out," Nayeemuddin told bdnews24.com by phone from Cox's Bazar Tuesday. Allegations have surfaced that Naymmeduddin forced the players to take drugs to enhance their stamina since he took the reins in August. "Those who are talking about the banned drug have no idea about it. I thought they (reporters) would talk with me to know the details before filing the report, but they didn't and made an unnecessary dispute," said Nayeemuddin. "They are trying to tarnish my image and Bangladesh's." The footballers are training in Cox's Bazar for the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar in November and SAFF Championship in December in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu last week visited Cox's Bazar and asked Nayeemuddin not to give drugs to the players. He told him that the team doctor would prescribe medicine if needed. Nayeemuddin however admitted he had given injections to the players during the Nehru Cup in India in August. "It was vitamin injection Neorobin Fort that keeps the players well." "I learned it from Uzbekistan coach Rushtom Akramov. Everyone should understand that it is not possible to buy banned drug for six rupees which I spent on Neorobin," said the coach. Nayeemuddin also fed the players herbal syrup Marvellous, produced by Bangladesh Hamdard Laboratories. Omar Faruque, FIFA and AFC doping officer in Bangladesh, said the medicines administered would pose no problems for the fottballers, but the coach should rely on the doctor for medicine. The BFF will sit at an emergency meeting Thursday to discuss the matter and other agendas. bdn
