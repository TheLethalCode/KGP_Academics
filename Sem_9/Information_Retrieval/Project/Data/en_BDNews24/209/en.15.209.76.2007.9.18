 WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar and Venezuela have "failed demonstrably" to do enough to fight illegal drugs for a third straight year, said a US report on Monday that waived sanctions on Caracas to maintain aid for democracy programs. The 20 countries identified as major illicit drug transit and drug producing countries in the annual US presidential report to Congress were unchanged from 2006, but Washington said allies Afghanistan and Colombia had made some progress. "Burma and Venezuela have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in US law," said the report, using the former name of military-ruled Myanmar. "However, the president determined to maintain US programs that aid Venezuela's democratic institutions," it said. Countries that fail to meet anti-drug commitments can have non-humanitarian US aid programs cut. The report identified Afghanistan, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries. Christy McCampbell, the State Department's top drug enforcement diplomat, said Washington still worked with Caracas despite strained ties with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, but wanted more anti-drug cooperation. "We still do work with the police there and do eradication efforts. One of our greatest concerns though is the corruption there with narco-trafficking and it is such a transit country it's just becoming a real hub for drugs," she said. Myanmar, Asia's largest source of methamphetamine pills, was "very lackluster" in interdiction and fighting corruption, said McCampbell, deputy assistant secretary for counternarcotics. "The country's declining poppy cultivation has been matched by a sharp increase in methamphetamine production," she said at a news conference. The report said one third of Afghanistan's economy remains opium-based, fueling corruption and boosting the militant Taliban insurgency. McCampbell said, however, that 13 Afghan provinces had become poppy-free and northern provinces had made some headway against opium, the raw material for heroin. Bolivia, the world's third-largest cocaine producer, has done enough to fight the drug trade in the past year to avoid US sanctions, but had uneven results, McCampbell said. The Andean country met a US target of eradicating at least 12,360 acres (5,000 hectares) of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, the report said. But Bolivian President Evo Morales' "zero cocaine, but not zero coca" policy had focused primarily on interdiction and not enough on eradication and alternative development for growers, it said. In response to the report, Bolivian Interior Minister Alfredo Rada told Erbol radio the US recognition of progress did not change his government's view that the US annual practice was "unilateral and colonialist." "It is a mechanism that is losing force in the new Latin American context," Rada said
