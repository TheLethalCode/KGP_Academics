 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  ICC Emirates Elite Panel match referee Mike Procter has praised Bangladesh and Pakistan cricketers for donating $ 5,500 to Ugandan cricket during the quadrangular series in Nairobi, Kenya. "When you talk about the Spirit of Cricket, well, the players from Bangladesh and Pakistan really displayed it with their gesture as far as I am concerned," said Procter, who officiated in the series, according to ICC media release received here Tuesday. The series acted as a warm-up for the two teams and Kenya ahead of the ongoing ICC World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa. "It is about respect for your opponents and that is exactly what the players of these two sides showed with their generosity. They are among the big boys of world cricket and to help out a country that is still developing in the game is a superb effort. "Uganda is moving forward with its cricket, as it showed during the series when it beat Kenya, and the generosity of the players of Bangladesh and Pakistan will be a huge help in that regard. It is something that deserves to be talked about and recognized," he added. The cash was made up of five Man-of-the-Match awards, each $500, as well as the player of the series prize, a total of US$3000 that was shared by the two captains, Mohammad Ashraful of Bangladesh and Pakistan's Shoaib Malik. The gesture began when Pakistan's Shahid Afridi was named Man of the Match in the first game of the series against Uganda. It was then continued by players from both line-ups through the six-match series that took place in the first week of September. One of the Man-of-the-Match award winners, Bangladesh fast bowler Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, explained why the players acted in the way they did. "We donated the money to help Uganda's cricket development," he said. "They are trying hard to improve their game and so far the signs have been encouraging. "In a small way we wanted to be a part of the effort to take cricket forward in Uganda. As a Full Member of the ICC I feel we have a responsibility to try and help Associate countries in any way we can." The Man-of-the-Match award recipients from the two sides during the quadrangular tournament were Afridi, Nazimuddin, Imran Nazir, Mortaza and Younus Khan. bd
