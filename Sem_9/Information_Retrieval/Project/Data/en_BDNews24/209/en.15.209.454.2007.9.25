<TITLE> Chechnya says singers must show national character </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GROZNY, Russia, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Singers and dancers in Chechnya must ensure their performances reflect the national character, the minister of culture said on Tuesday. Chechnya's president Ramzan Kadyrov, a former rebel in the south Russian republic, has imposed strict rules on how Chechens are supposed to behave throughout the year. "National artists are always at the centre of attention, therefore they have to set an example to match this," said Minister of Culture Dikalu Muzakaev. Musicians can only play and sing songs on an approved list and have to wear a certain amount of national clothing, he said. Last October Kadyrov, famed for keeping tigers as pets, flew in Russian pop stars for his 30th birthday party at his fortress home outside the town of Gudermes in eastern Chechnya. Kadyrov has told women to wear headscarves if they work in government and has recommended to men they take more than one wife. Two wars between Chechen rebels and Russian soldiers since 1994 have destabilised and scarred the north Caucasus region. While overt fighting has subsided recently in Chechnya, neighbouring Ingushetia has witnessed a surge in violence.
