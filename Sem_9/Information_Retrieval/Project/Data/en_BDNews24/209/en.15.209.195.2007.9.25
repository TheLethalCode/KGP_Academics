 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) Stocks slipped for a second day Tuesday amid selling pressure from the institutional investors who moved to adjust their margin loans after the regulator detected huge anomalies in AB Bank share dealings. Profit-taking ahead of Eid also contributed to the downturn, analysts said. "We have observed irregularities at AB bank and have asked for an explanation," said Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission. According to reports, the SEC detected a Tk 1.20 billion share scam by the bank, following a probe into loan disbursements to relatives of employees. "It appears that institutional investors are adjusting their margin loans after the report on AB Bank," a senior official with the Dhaka Stock Exchange said.
