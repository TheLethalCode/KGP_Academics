 BOURNEMOUTH, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign Secretary David Miliband said on Tuesday that Britain's role in Iraq had scarred the government and divided the country and added that it was vital to stop the conflict spreading through the Middle East. In his speech to the ruling Labour Party's annual conference, Miliband said the party had to learn lessons from "the scars of 10 years in government" and focus on new issues. "The war in Iraq was divisive in our party and in our country. It was a huge decision and the passion on all sides was sincere and understandable," he said. "Whatever the rights and wrongs, and there have been both, we've got to focus on the future," he said. Britain must continue to support the development of an effective Iraqi security force and keep its promise to Iraqis that they will have a stake in their country's future, he said.

Referring to Britain's other main battlefield, Miliband urged the Afghan government to work with Pakistan in order to tackle terrorism on both sides of the border. He also reaffirmed Britain's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, calling for "urgent progress" to address Israeli security and Palestinian rights. In a wide-ranging speech, Miliband also defended the European Union as a key international institution and pledged that the issue of Britain's place in Europe would not divide the Labour party as it had the opposition Conservatives. The government is coming under increasing pressure to hold a referendum on the latest European Union treaty. Britain's biggest-selling daily paper, the Sun, launched a campaign for a referendum at the start of the Labour conference, adding to the demands of trade unions and politicians from all parties. Miliband said the treaty should be studied and passed by parliament, dashing hopes of a popular debate and a public vo
