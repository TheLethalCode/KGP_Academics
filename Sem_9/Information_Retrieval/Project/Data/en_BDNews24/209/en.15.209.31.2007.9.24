 YANGON, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Myanmar's ruling military junta threatened legal action against Buddhist monks who on Monday led the biggest public demonstrations against the generals in 20 years. In the regime's first response to the monks' protests which began six days ago, Minister for Religious Affairs Brigadier General Thura Myint Maung was quoted on state-owned radio as saying "actions will be taken against the monks' protest marches according to the law if they cannot be stopped by religious teachings." The minister blamed the protests on "destructive elements who do not want to see peace, stability and progress in the country."
