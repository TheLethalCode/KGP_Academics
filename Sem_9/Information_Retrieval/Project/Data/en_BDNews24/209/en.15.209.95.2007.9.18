 Dhaka, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Donors have blamed uncertainty and a lack of business confidence for the significant slowdown in private-sector credit growth. According to Bangladesh Bank data, private-sector credit growth declined by 3.15 percentage points year-on-year to 15.12 percent in June. The Asian Development Bank, one of the major development partners of Bangladesh, and the International Monetary Fund at separate press briefings Monday and Tuesday said private-sector credit growth had slowed for uncertainty and lack of confidence, not for the monetary policy as blamed by economists, business community and civic leaders. The IMF Tuesday said that private-sector credit growth slowed to 15 percent as of June 2007 from 18.3 percent a year ago. "This was not due to monetary tightening, but rather as a result of uncertainty and reduced confidence in the business community," the IMF said. The ADB said growth in credit to the private sector had come down because of the government's recent initiatives, including anticorruption and anti-hoarding drives. "The credit growth was contained partly by erosion in business confidence following the caretaker government's anti-corruption measures," the ADB in its Asian Development Outlook 2007 Update released Monday said. The bank said growth in credit to government was expanded rapidly to 35.9 percent in December 2006, but fell to 13.9 percent in June 2007 because of disbursement of budgetary support by the World Bank. Admitting a slow down in private-sector credit expansion, a World Bank official requesting not to be named told bdnews24.com that credit growth increased slightly in July to about 16 percent. Bangladesh Bank this week announced that it was not pursuing a tight monetary policy, introduced in January 2006, to squeeze growth of credit and check inflationary pressure as well. Instead of containing inflation, the move had created uncertainty in the business community and contributed to price pressures. Overall inflation reached 10.1 percent in July on a point-to-point basis from 9.2 percent in June. Food inflation was 12.5 percent in July from 9.8 percent in June. Meanwhile, a visiting team of the IMF warned the BB Monday saying that the country's average basis inflation rate might exceed 9 percent during the present fiscal year if the central bank did not tighten monetary policy. But the policy suggestion was rejected by the central bank, concerned that any contraction in monetary policy would slow the growth rate and hamper reconstruction after this year's consecutive floods. Instead the BB said that it might consider a more expansionary approach, officials said. bd
