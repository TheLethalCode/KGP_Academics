<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday ordered the National Board of Revenue to accept income tax return of Tk 39.20 lakh for tax years 2002 to 2007 of Arafat Rahman Coco, the younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Coco appealed the court against the National Board of Revenue's refusal to accept the income tax return. It also asked the secretary to the Internal Resources Division (IRD) of the finance ministry, the NBR chairman, the deputy director of the central intelligence branch of NBR and the deputy commissioner of income tax to explain in next four weeks why the refusal was not illegal. A HC bench of Justice Md Abdur Rashid and Justice Miftauddin Chowdhury issued the order on a writ petition by Coco. Coco deposited Tk 39.20 lakh in unpaid income taxes for the years 2002 to 2007 to Bangladesh Bank. The NBR, however, declined to accept the income tax return, prompting Coco to appeal with the HC. In his petition, Coco said the government allowed individuals to file unpaid income tax returns through a gazette on June 4. But the NBR unlawfully declined to accept his unpaid income tax. Barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokanw , who argued for Coco in the court, said as Coco's income tax return was not accepted on political grounds since he was Khaleda's son. bdnews24
