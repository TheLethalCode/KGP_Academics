 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Islamist militants have killed 18 Pakistani soldiers in the restive North Waziristan tribal region, intelligence officials said on Tuesday. The soldiers, including commandos, were killed on Sunday night in the same area near the Afghan border where officials said 16 militants were killed in fighting that began late on Sunday. "Villagers found the bodies of the slain soldiers and reported it to army. Most of them were shot dead. Some of them had their throats cut," an intelligence official told Reuters. Northwest Pakistan has been engulfed in a wave of violence since July when a peace deal with militants broke down in North Waziristan and the army assaulted a radical Islamabad mosque, known for its links with the militants. Several hundred people have been killed. The soldiers were killed in the Shawal area, 70 km (45 miles) southwest of Miranshah, the main town of the North Waziristan region, a hotbed of support for al Qaeda and the Taliban. In neighbouring South Waziristan, militants are still holding about 250 soldiers who were captured late last month as the travelled in a convoy.
