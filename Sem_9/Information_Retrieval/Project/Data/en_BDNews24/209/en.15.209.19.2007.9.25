 LONDON, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell on Tuesday as worries about the financial system and earnings weighed on investors while the dollar hugged record lows against the euro and bonds firmed. Weaker-than-expected German business confidence did little to improve the mood. The Ifo economic research institute said first signs of a braking in German economic growth were being detected. Stocks in Europe were lower, dragged down in part by a Financial Times report saying BP's chief executive had warned that third-quarter revenues would be "dreadful". The banking sector was also under pressure, with Deutsche Bank down more than 1 percent. Sources told Reuters on Monday that profit at Germany's biggest bank could be hit by up to 1.7 billion euros ($2.4 billion) due to loans that have dwindled in value as a result of the credit market crisis. The bank has declined to comment. "Banks are going to suffer (from the credit crisis), there is no doubt about that," said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average gained 0.6 percent or 89.12 points at 16,401.73, while the broader TOPIX index put on 0.95 percent to 1,566.83. The market was closed on Monday. Asian stocks outside Japan, however, remained in record territory. The dollar drifted higher against European currencies after steep losses in previous sessions but was still close to record or multi-year lows. Many investors were awaiting new U.S. data to determine how deeply the global credit crunch has affected the economy. "The dollar is gaining a little against the euro probably because it has been oversold for the last few sessions. But longer term, we remain negative on the dollar," said Marcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. The euro was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.4064 after striking a record high of $1.4130 the previous session, according to Reuters data. Euro zone government bonds were higher in line with firming US Treasuries. The December Bund future was up 38 ticks on the day at 112.75 compared with the settlement close of 112.36. The two-year Schatz yield was down 4.2 basis points at 4.016 percent. The 10-year Bund yield was down 3.7 basis points at 4.321 perce
