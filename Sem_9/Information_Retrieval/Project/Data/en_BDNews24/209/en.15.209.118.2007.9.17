 Jessore, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)The mother of BRAC official Nurul Islam, who was abducted by an unknown group in Afghanistan Saturday, has sought the cooperation of the government to gain his freedom. In Nurul Islam's village home in Jessore, the family was found to be in shock Monday at the news of the abduction of the eldest son. Islam's elderly mother Zahura Begum told bdnews24.com: "I want freedom for my son. Those who abducted him in Afghanistan are Muslim like us. I hope they won't kill my son and will release him." "I seek the government's cooperation for the release of my son. I hope the government will be able to return my son to me," she said. Zahura spoke with extreme emotion, and the intensity of grief was so great that family members were not able to talk for long. Nurul Islam's mother offered prayers and supplication throughout the day for the release of her son. Nurul Islam, son of Gafur Mollah and the eldest among four brothers and three sisters, joined BRAC in 1998. He was posted to Afghanistan in 2005. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury has expressed deep concern at the abduction of Nurul Islam and appealed for his release. The adviser also spoke with Afghan ambassador in Bangladesh Ahmed Karim Nawabi Monday. BRAC's area manager Nurul Islam was abducted from his office in the Logar province of Afghanistan Saturday. The gun wielding kidnappers also stole 30,000 Afghanis ($600). Two days before Nurul Islam's abduction, another official of BRAC, Abdul Alim, was shot dead by terrorists Thursday. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee has been working in health, education, microcredit and women's development in Afghanistan from 2002. About 4,000 people are working in 351 offices of BRAC in 26 provinces of Afghanistan. Of them, more than 200 are Bangladeshi. bdnews24.
