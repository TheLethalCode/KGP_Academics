<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan authorities decided late on Friday to let Ang Lee's award-winning erotic film 'Lust, Caution' show uncensored in cinemas around the island, where Lee was born. Authorities in China, where the love and espionage movie is set in the 1940s, had cut some nudity scenes. The film will begin screening in Taiwan on September 24. "Those scenes were not so severe they needed to be cut or blocked," said Pan Shun-yun, senior secretary of Taiwan's Government Information Office's film division. "We felt the sex scenes were natural, so there was no need to do anything to them." 'Lust, Caution' won a Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival earlier this month. It is based on a short story by Eileen Chang and follows a group of revolutionary students who hatch a plot to assassinate a powerful political figure who is collaborating with occupying forces during the Sino-Japanese war. Director Lee won an Academy Award for the 2005 gay cowboy classic 'Brokeback Mountain'. He is known also for his China-based film 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
