 RAMALLAH, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops on Monday shot and killed a Palestinian youth in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, local hospital staff said. The Israeli army said troops identified an armed man handling an explosive device which he was planning to use against the force who were operating in the area and shot him. Local residents said troops on an arrest raid in Ramallah, headquarters of President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah administration in the West Bank, fired at the youth as he and others protested the soldiers' presence by throwing stones at them. An army spokeswoman added that in additional military activity across the West Bank troops arrested 13 Palestinians on Israel's wanted list. The youth, identified as 16-year-old Mohammed Jabareen, is the third Palestinian to be killed in the West Bank in two days. On Sunday Israeli troops killed a Palestinian militant belonging to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of Abbas's Fatah movement, in Hebron and another al-Aqsa militant in Nabl
