 Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Yasuo Fukuda won the key parliamentary vote to become the next prime minister on Tuesday, succeeding Shinzo Abe who resigned abruptly on Sept. 12. Fukuda won the support of parliament's lower house, ensuring he will be formally appointed prime minister later in the day. Here are positions on some key issues held by Fukuda: FOREIGN POLICY Fukuda views the security alliance with the United States as the basis of foreign policy, but he is less U.S.-centric than Abe and advocates strengthening ties with Asian neighbours. He stresses the need to continue a Japanese naval mission in the Indian Ocean which supports US-led operations in Afghanistan. The mission's current mandate expires on Nov. 1 and Fukuda plans to submit a fresh bill to parliament to enable an extension, but its passage could be delayed by the opposition parties who control the upper house. NORTH KOREA Fukuda has signalled a softer approach towards dealing with Pyongyang, stressing the need for negotiations to resolve the issue of abductions of Japanese by North Korea. YASUKUNI WAR SHRINE Fukuda says he will not pay his respects at Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine for the war dead, which is seen by many in Asia as a symbol of past militarism. He favours building a secular national war memorial, although he said last week that he felt the time was not yet right. ECONOMIC POLICY Fukuda has pledged to pursue structural reform to improve Japan's competitiveness but also wants to address the problems of those who have suffered from the side effects of past reforms, including a widening rural-urban economic gap. Fukuda said on Sunday it was impossible to revert to pork-barrel politics under current fiscal conditions but at the same time he could not neglect rural areas. FISCAL POLICY Fukuda has mentioned the need to consider increasing consumption tax from the current 5 percent to fund future social welfare costs in rapidly ageing Japan, but has not specified when it should go up or by how much. Fukuda said on Sunday he would deal flexibly with calls to use all sales tax revenues to finance basic pensions, saying Japan would have no choice but to raise the consumption tax to realise such a plan. Fukuda also vowed to stick to a target of moving the government's annual budget deficit, excluding debt costs, into surplus by the 2011/12 fiscal year. INTEREST RATES In April 2006, a month after the BOJ scrapped its policy of flooding the banking system with interest-free cash, Fukuda said low rates were very abnormal but added that getting Japan's public finances back in order was the priori
