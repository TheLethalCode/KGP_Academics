 Chittagong, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)A Chittagong court Wednesday sent three Chittagong WASA engineers, including chief engineer Shafiqul Islam, to jail, hours after they were arrested in a graft case. Judge Amitabh Sarker of the Chittagong Metropolitan Magistrate's Court ordered them into jail, court inspector SA Farid said. Major Anisuzzaman of RAB-7 said the other two engineers arrested by the elite force were Md Shafiullah and AKM Abdul Quddus. They were arrested in WASA Bhaban at around 10:45am in connection with the case filed by the then Bureau of Anticorruption with Kotwali Police Station in 2004. They allegedly embezzled Tk 17 lakh from a project designed to install a PVC pipeline from Panchlaish Girls' School to Toktar Pool in 2000. The case also involves two others: Abu Taher, deputy divisional engineer of Chittagong WASA, and Faruk Ahmed, a contractor. Investigating officer Jahangir Alam, assistant director for the Anticorruption Commission's Chittagong office, told bdnews24.com: "The accused laid a 2,145.42- metre pipeline instead of a 3,121.45-metre one and embezzled Tk 17 lakh in doing so." Mobinul Islam, an official with the then Anticorruption Bureau, filed the case against the accused on June 17, 2004, Jahangir said. "A three-member probe committee was formed with the then WASA director Sirajul Azim Khan as its head. The committee found the allegations true," he added. bdnews24.co
