<TITLE> Govt to probe milk powder prices </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com)  The government will investigate the huge difference in imported and retail prices of milk powder, commerce ministry officials said Tuesday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in a recent letter asked the commerce adviser to take a look. The interim government head had pointed out that no other imported commodity had such a large difference between its value at import and retail prices. "The retail price of milk powder is 2.3 times the import value at Chittagong port," the letter said. Milk power is a staple for children in Bangladesh with almost all demand being met by imports. Only a few importers control the import process, which leaves scope for price manipulations in the market, officials said. "We will sit with the importers, distributors, the National Board of Revenue and Bangladesh Rifles Thursday to find out why milk powder prices are subject to these pressures," a senior commerce ministry official, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com. According to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, a kilogram of packaged Milk Vita powder now sells for Tk 400, up from Tk 270 a year ago, representing a rise of almost 49 percent. "We cannot live with these prices for very much longer," Rubina Islam, a working mother of two children, told bdnews24.com. The chief adviser's letter added: "If selling milk powder packed in tins adds to the price then importers should make it available in hygienically packed cellophane bags." "I don't think the difference between the import cost and retail cost of edible oil is anywhere near that for milk powder. Edible oil also requires refining and packaging," said the chief adviser's letter. "We have asked all stakeholders to attend the meeting to try and resolve the problem," the ministry official said. bdne
