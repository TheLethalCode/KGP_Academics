<TITLE> India awaits new captain after Dravid's sudden exit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Dhoni are candidates to replace Rahul Dravid as Indian cricket captain after his shock decision to step down last week, local media reported on Monday. Selectors are due to meet on Tuesday to choose a new captain and Indian media suggested selectors had sounded out Tendulkar about returning for a third stint as captain and were waiting for a response from the premier batsman. Tendulkar's last term in charge ended seven years ago when he quit following a 3-0 test series drubbing in Australia. Selectors have little time to play. Australia arrive for a one-day series from Sept. 29, and then India play a one-day and test series with Pakistan until December before embarking on a test tour of Australia. A senior board official said on Monday it was likely a captain would be chosen only for the two one-day series. Former skipper Ajit Wadekar criticised India's cricket board for not trying to persuade Dravid to stay on. "There is no apparent replacement easily available," Wadekar told Reuters from Mumbai. "He seemed to be doing extremely well. He looked every inch a captain. "If Dravid could be prevailed upon, nothing like it. If he sticks to his decision, we should have a younger chap, looking at the future." Wadekar said it was unlikely that Tendulkar, 34, would take up the demanding job once again having turned down the offer on previous occasions. Local media have also identified wicketkeeper Dhoni as a possible candidate. The 26-year-old, captain at the Twenty20 World Cup and the one-day vice captain, has won praise since his debut in 2005 for his flamboyant batting as well as his temperament. India are also without a coach since former Australia skipper Greg Chappell quit following the team's shock first round exit at this year's World Cup in West Indies. The squad for the seven-match Australia series will also be named on Tuesday
