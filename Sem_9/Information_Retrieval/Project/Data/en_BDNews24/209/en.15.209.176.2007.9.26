 LOS ANGELES, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kiefer Sutherland, who stars on the hit TV thriller '24' as a secret agent with nerves of steel, was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving on Tuesday, hours before he was due to be honored by a Canadian actors' union. The arrest comes as the Canadian performer, 40, the son of actor Donald Sutherland, remains on probation for driving under the influence in a previous case that landed him in a court-ordered treatment program for alcohol abuse. Los Angeles police said they stopped Sutherland's car near the boundaries of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood shortly after 1 am after he was seen making an illegal U-turn. A breath test found him to be over the legal blood-alcohol limit, and he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, a police spokeswoman said. She said Sutherland was taken to the police station in Hollywood, where he posted $25,000 bail and was released. He is due to appear in court on October 16.

Assuming the arrest leads to formal charges, it would be up to the judge who handled Sutherland's previous case to decide if he violated probation. The same judge, Michael Sauer, sentenced celebrity socialite Paris Hilton to 45 days in jail for breaching her probation in a previous DUI case. Sutherland last year earned an Emmy Award, US television's highest honor, for his role as the globe-trotting, terrorist-fighting agent Jack Bauer on `24,' one of Fox network's top-rated shows. Averaging 13.5 million viewers earlier this year, the show returns to the airwaves for its seventh season in January. There was no official word from the network or producers of '24,' but a source close to the series said Sutherland's arrest was not expected to affect production of the sh
