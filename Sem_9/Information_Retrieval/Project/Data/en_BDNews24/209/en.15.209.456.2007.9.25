 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) - A 46th minute strike from midfielder Arman Aziz helped the national football team edge past Cox's Bazar XI 1-0 in an exhibition match at the Cox's Bazar Stadium on Tuesday. "It was just an exhibition match and the coach fielded one set each in both halves to see how the booters play against the local team after hard physical training," Coordinator Amirul Islam Babu told bdnews24.com by phone from Cox's Bazar. Babu said the team's top booters -- Biplob, Rajani, Nazrul, Mamun, Wali, Aziz, Sharif, Mithu, Abul, Amili and Moni -- played the first half while the remaining footballers of the team took part in the second half of the game. The footballers, who had undergone a 20-day physical fitness programme in the tourism town, will return to the city Thursday morning. In a bid to increase stamina, some 30 booters drilled on sand and hills in Cox's Bazar under the supervision of Indian coach Syed Naeemuddin. "The coach is satisfied with the booters in the way they were trained on the sandy beach and hills, and he also thinks the fitness level of the players is now up to the mark. "So we are coming back to the city 10 days ahead of the 30- days training schedule in Cox's Bazar," said Babu. After having a one-day rest on arrival in the city, the footballers will leave for Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) to prepare for the World Cup pre-qualifier against Tajikistan on October 8. bdn
