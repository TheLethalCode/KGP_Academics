 BRUSSELS, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Parliament watered down plans on Wednesday to create a new EU research body designed to close the competitiveness gap with the United States, but funding was left unresolved. The European Institute of Technology (EIT) is the brainchild of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who envisaged a 2.3 billion euro ($3.25 billion) campus-based institute to rival the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States and study areas such as climate change.

It also renamed the new body the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. "We don't want to weaken or water down the educational part of the architecture. Higher education must be duly developed in the strategy," Figel said. "We think for credibility and success, we need a more streamlined process which is of course gradual and grows, but cannot be conditional on subsequent debate and positions."

"What is the most important is not the place or the name, we are not speaking about Massachusetts in Europe. the EIT could be a strong promoter and signal of Europe being more innovation-friendly," Figel said. Green Party members voted against the plan, saying the idea was laudable but poorly defined and lacked a realistic budget. "The proposals for an EIT that were endorsed by the European Parliament today would create a pointless white elephant," the party's David Hammerstein sa
