 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Tuesday sentenced the wife of Awami League leader Obaidul Kader to eight years in jail for providing false information and evading tax by suppressing details about income. The court also fined Ishratunnesa Tk 2 lakh on two counts of charges and she has to serve one year more in failure to pay the fine. Judge Shamsun Nahar Begum of Special Judges' Court-4, sited on Sangsad Bhaban premises, handed down the verdict. Ishrat is evading arrest and the sentence will come into force after her surrender or arrest. The verdict handed Ishrat five years for concealing wealth under section 166 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. She was fined Tk 1 lakh or has to serve six months more in jail in default. The court sentenced her to three years in jail for giving false information about her wealth under section 165 of the same law. She was fined Tk 1 lakh or has to stay in jail another six months in failure to pay the sum. As the two jail terms will run simultaneously, Ishrat will have to serve a maximum of five years. The court ordered confiscation of two flats she owns in Segunbagicha and Moghbazar. Nigar Sultana, assistant tax commissioner of the National Board of Revenue, filed a tax-dodge case with the Dhaka Senior Special Judges' Court against Ishrat on Aug 7, which involves Tk 88.76 lakh. Charges were framed against her on Aug 29 after the case was sent to the Special Judges' Court for trial. bdnews24
