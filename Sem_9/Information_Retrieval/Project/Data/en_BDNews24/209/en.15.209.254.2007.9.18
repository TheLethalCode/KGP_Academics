 BAGHDAD, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb outside the Health Ministry in central Baghdad killed seven people and wounded 23 on Tuesday, police said. The bomb exploded in a parking lot close to the ministry, sending a plume of black smoke into the sky. Police said they were checking another vehicle in the car park which they suspected was also rigged with explosives. In the east Baghdad district of Zayouna, a car bomb killed two people and wounded five others, police said. Sunni Islamist al Qaeda militants have pledged a renewed campaign of violence to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started last week.
