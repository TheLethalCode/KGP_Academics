 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) - The National Sports Council (NSC) visits the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) Wednesday to take steps so as to meet the FIFA standard. To get the recognition as an international venue, a one-member FIFA delegation two months ago had advised the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) to ensure the entrance security, upgrade the dressing rooms and improve luminance of the floodlight of the BNS, a proposed venue for the World Cup prequalifier between Bangladesh and Tajikistan. Bangladesh are scheduled to play their prequalifier against Tajikistan on October 8 at home and play the away match against the same rivals on October 28. "In this regard, I Tuesday met NSC secretary Aminul Islam and director (planning) Abdur Rashid Sarkar, and they have agreed to visit the venue Wednesday to meet the FIFA requirements," said BFF acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. Malu said that their efforts to bring the away match of the World Cup pre-qualifying round forward was apparently dashed because of no response from the Tajikistan Football Federation (TFF). The BFF has been trying to shift their away match against Tajikistan to October 22 instead of October 28 for their participation in the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar, scheduled for November's first week. After having failed to contact the TFF, the BFF has requested the Myanmar Football Federation to put their matches in the latter part of the fixture, said BFF media manager Ahmed Sayed Al Fattah.
