 CHIANG MAI, Thailand, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Chen Xiexia swept all three gold medals up for grabs on the opening day of the world weightlifting championships. China's national anthem was the only one played at Chiang Mai's 700th Anniversary Stadium on Monday when Chen got China's Olympics preparations off to the perfect start. She dominated the women's 48kg category with wins in the snatch and the clean and jerk helping her clinch another gold medal in the total category. "I'm so very happy," a beaming Chen told reporters when asked how it felt to win her first world title. "Now, I'm going to work even harder." Chen lifted 96kg on her third attempt in the snatch and had to settle for 118kg in the clean and jerk -- 2kg less than her own world record -- for a total of 214kg, 18 more than silver medallist Pramsiri Bunphithak of Thailand. Imbued with confidence after winning the snatch, a world record looked on the cards in the clean and jerk when the diminutive Chen hoisted the 122kg barbell to her shoulders, but the extra weight proved too much on the jerk. "I was very sorry not to break the world record," said the 24-year-old. "But I'm determined to break all three in my next international competition." Thailand's Pramsiri also took silver in the snatch (86kg) and bronze in the clean and jerk (110). Compatriot Pensiri Laosirikul won silver in the clean and jerk (112) and bronze in the total (195) while Turkey's Nurcan Taylan lifted 85kg to take the snatch bronze
