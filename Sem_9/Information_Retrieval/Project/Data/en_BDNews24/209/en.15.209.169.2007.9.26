<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoist former rebels, who quit the government last week, fear losing this year's elections meant to decide the fate of the monarchy, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said on Wednesday. The Maoists, who began fighting the monarchy in 1996, walked out of the interim government and threatened to disrupt the Nov. 22 polls unless the country was declared a republic right away.

Scores of people have died in the region this year in protests and violence by the ethnic Madhesi people and by several small rebel groups demanding regional autonomy. There was no immediate reaction from the ex-rebels to the comments by Koirala, who also said he was trying to bring the Maoists back into the government. Analysts said a compromise was expected to be reached in back channel discussions. "They are negotiating on a resolution by parliament on a republic," said Kunda Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times weekly. "The Maoists will also be guaranteed a minimum number of seats in the election." Their withdrawal from the government has cast a shadow over the historic elections, Nepal's first national polls since 1999. The former guerrillas, however, say they will continue to honour last year's ceasefire that ended their civil war which killed more than 13,000 peop
