<TITLE> Irish FinMin sees lower spending, economic growth </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DUBLIN, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ireland's economy will grow more slowly than previously projected in the coming years and rates of public spending growth will have to be reduced accordingly, Finance Minister Brian Cowen said on Monday. "The latest indications are that economic growth may be somewhat lower than 4.5 percent in the near term," Cowen said in the text of a speech to members of his Fianna Fail party. Cowen had previously described as conservative a forecast ahead of May's general election that the next government could count on average annual economic growth of 4.5 percent to support plans for spending increases and tax cuts. Ireland's once booming property market has cooled rapidly since then, however, and economists have been steadily reducing their growth forecasts for next year as house building slows. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth is now expected to slow to 3.7 percent in 2008 from 5.1 percent this year, according to a Reuters poll of 11 economists published late last month. Cowen said the fundamentals of the Irish economy remained strong, however, and that the "step change" in rates of economic growth was a welcome development. "It represents an impressively soft landing for an economy that has gone through one of the most dramatic shifts in performance in the history of the developed world," he said. His comments echoed a speech by party colleague, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who told delegates that while housing output would be significantly below the record levels of recent years, there was no place for negativity or pessimism. "Above all, there is no place for politically motivated attempts to talk down the economy and the achievements of our people across all sectors," said Ahern who was re-elected for a record third consecutive following May's election. Ireland's central bank has said it believes high levels of investment in infrastructure and strong growth in other areas of the economy should be able to absorb any slack from lower levels of house building. Economists are watching unemployment data closely, however, to monitor to what extent layoffs in the construction sector, which had been driving jobs growth, will be compensated for by a still thriving services sector and solid manufacturing growth. Cowen said he remained committed to delivering promised infrastructure investment and maintaining Ireland's existing tax model but cautioned that would mean more moderate growth in day-to-day public spending. "The rate of increase in current public expenditure ... will have to be much lower than in recent years," Cowen said, promising to continue to deliver a responsible fiscal policy and balanced budgets. "If we are to avoid the stop-start cycle which has plagued so many developed economies, we have to accept that double digit spending increases are a thing of the past," he sa
