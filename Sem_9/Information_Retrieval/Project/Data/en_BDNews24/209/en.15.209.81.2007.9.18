 DAR ES SALAAM, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan has given Tanzania 2.3 billion yen ($20 million) in loans and grants to help the country fight poverty and HIV, Tanzania's Finance Ministry said on Tuesday. Of the total, a 2 billion yen loan will support the east African nation's budget, the ministry said. The rest will pay for medicines and test kits to counter the threat of HIV/AIDS. About 2 million Tanzanians, out of a population of some 40 million, are infected with HIV, Tanzania's government says. The country is among the continent's top recipients of donor aid, with 42 percent of its 2007-08 budget funded by donors.
