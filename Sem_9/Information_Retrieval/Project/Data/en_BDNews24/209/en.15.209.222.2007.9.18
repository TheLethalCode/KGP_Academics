Pakistan finished sixth in the 11-nation tournament after losing to Japan and China and drawing with Malaysia. "Umpiring was at its lowest ebb in this tournament and some of the appointments for crucial matches smacked of bias," Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) Altaf Sabir said in a statement on Tuesday.
