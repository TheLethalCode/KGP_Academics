 VIENNA, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nuclear test ban treaty members appealed to 10 major signatories including the United States and China on Tuesday to ratify the decade-old pact so it can take effect. The 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been ratified by 140 countries in all, but 10 more must follow suit to transform the CTBT from an informal moratorium into a binding document. "We strongly encourage such Annex 2 states to take individual initiatives to ratify the treaty," some 100 signatories attending a Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT said in a final declaration. The CTBT lists in an annex 44 countries that have nuclear capabilities already. Of those, 34 have both signed and ratified the pact -- including nuclear weapons powers Russia, Britain and France. "Relevant international developments since the 2005 conference ... make entry into force of the treaty more urgent today than ever before," the declaration said. Iran's nuclear energy programme is seen by the West as a disguised quest to build atom bombs, and North Korea has stealthily developed and tested nuclear devices after bolting from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Backing by the United States and China, both long-time nuclear weapons giants and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, was urgently need, said Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno of Costa Rica, which with Austria co-chaired the conference. "We believe that (US) leadership is necessary, much like we would also like to see leadership on behalf of China," Stagno told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting in Vienna -- home of the CTBT's administrative body. "A political binding moratorium is simply not sufficient, it does not give us sufficient confidence and trust." "When we look at North Korea and Iran, and developments in other areas, we need to ensure that there is mutual confidence and trust," he said, mentioning two CTBT signatories that have not ratified and are now seen as proliferation threats. India and Pakistan, both with atomic arsenals, and Israel, an unconfirmed but widely assumed nuclear weapons power, also have not ratified the treaty. They are the only three nations that have not joined the NPT. China reiterated in a statement to the CTBT gathering that the treaty's verification system needed to be shored up to provide no-test guarantees to signatories. It has said its parliament would review the treaty comprehensively. Washington has similarly been concerned that test "cheats" could not be adequately detected or deterred under the CTBT, and the US Senate has declined to ratify it. Washington backs a nuclear test moratorium, but sent no envoys to the conference
