 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  US deputy assistant secretary John Gastright who arrived Tuesday called for additional steps by the government to restore democracy as soon as possible. The US official termed the Election Commission's roadmap to the next parliamentary polls a step in the right direction after meeting chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. Gastright, who looks after the Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan affairs at the US State Department, said the EC's five-point polls plan would guarantee democracy in the country and among the political parties as well. "I have had an excellent meeting with the Election Commission and the election commissioners. I am really impressed by what they are doing. "I think it's a real step towards the right direction," Gastright told reporters at the EC secretariat after the meeting. "The Election Commission by the way has really an outstanding plan, a five-point plan to move towards democracy and elections," Gastright said. Huda told reporters, "I have told [Gastright] that we will hold elections before December 2008 if possible." He said he would seek assistance for delimitation of the constituencies, if necessary. "Gastright noted that the US government looked forward to additional steps by Bangladesh to restore democracy as soon as possible, and the two (Gastright and CEC) discussed the steps underway to prepare for elections by the end of 2008," said an official text on the meeting issued by the US Embassy. The written official text was distributed among journalists as soon as Gastright finished his media briefing at the gate of the EC secretariat building. "Gastright welcomed the recent relaxation of the ban on internal politics and emphasized the important role that political parties, NGOs, and the civil society play in the electoral process," it further said. Gastright, who arrived in the city Tuesday morning on a two-day visit, is expected to meet Wednesday foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and acting foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain. This is his first visit to Bangladesh since the arrests of former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. His previous visit was in December last year. bdn
