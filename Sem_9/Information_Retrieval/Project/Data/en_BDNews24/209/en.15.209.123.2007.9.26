 BOURNEMOUTH, Wed Sep 26, (Reuters) - Gordon Brown's closest ally heightened speculation on Wednesday over when the British prime minister might call an election as a new poll gave the ruling Labour Party a commanding lead. Ed Balls, schools and families secretary and formerly Brown's right-hand man at the Treasury, questioned whether it was a bigger gamble to call a poll this year or wait. "It's a very interesting question as to where the gamble really lies," Balls told BBC Radio from Labour's annual conference in the southern seaside town of Bournemouth, when asked if Brown was likely to risk an October or November vote. "I think that Gordon Brown will be looking very closely at the events of this week," he added. Speculation of a snap election has dominated Brown's first Labour conference as prime minister, fuelled by his consistent lead in polls since Brown succeeded Tony Blair in June. Brown inherited a poll deficit from Blair but the tables have turned. The latest YouGov poll for Channel 4 News gave Labour an 11-point lead over the opposition Conservative Party, with Labour on 44 percent and the Conservatives on 33 percent. Brown has refused to comment on election speculation, repeatedly saying he is just getting on with the job of governing and unveiling a raft of new policy ideas this week. But some of his ministers and Labour supporters are eager for him to hold an election this year, believing it would be an even bigger gamble to wait until 2008 or 2009, with a potential economic downturn on the horizon. Brown is now ruling with a majority won by Blair in 2005, and has until 2010 to call the next election. Some in Labour say he wants his own mandate from the British people, but others say he is too cautious to risk the premiership so soon. The Conservatives are already spending large sums of money in marginal parliamentary seats. They approach their own conference next week very much in the shadow of Labour, uncertain whether or not it will mark the launch of an election campaign. Labour's finances are in a worse state than the Conservatives but Jack Dromey, Labour's treasurer, said on Wednesday that general election planning was underway. "This year ... is also about planning for a general election. I am confident of our capacity to be ready and we will be but to do that we are going to need the most immense cooperative effort," he told the party conference. Balls, who hinted earlier this week that Brown would want to hold off on an election to establish himself, said Brown's main focus was on setting out Labour's vision for the country. "I think the priority for him is to ensure that the public knows his priority is delivering on their priorities," he said. Brown has been faced with a series of crises since he took over, from attempted car bomb attacks to flooding and an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Most worryingly, a global credit squeeze led to the first run on a British bank in a century earlier this month and some analysts predict more turbulence that could affect Britain's economic stability and house pric
