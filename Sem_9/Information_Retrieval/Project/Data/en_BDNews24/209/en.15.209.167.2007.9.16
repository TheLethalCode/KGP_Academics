<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdndws24.com)The Supreme Court Sunday allowed the filing of an appeal by AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed seeking permission to move against his conviction in the Bangabandhu murder case, after a delay of more than eight years. A three-member Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Tafazzal Islam granted an early application by the former army major, condoning the delay of eight years, seven months and 16 days, in filing the so-called petition for leave to appeal. Mohiuddin's counsel Barrister Abdullah-al-Mamun represented him in court. Mamun argued in court that Mohiuddin did not know before his arrival from the US in Bangladesh on June 16 that he had been convicted in absentia in the Bangabandhu murder case. He claimed that Mohiuddin was not involved in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mamun further argued that on August 15, 1971, there was a "coup", which cannot be termed a murder. Earlier in the day, four other convicted appellants in the murder case appeared in court. The Appellate Division however adjourned the hearings until Tuesday upon the plea of Aminul Haque, special prosecutor for the state. bdnews
