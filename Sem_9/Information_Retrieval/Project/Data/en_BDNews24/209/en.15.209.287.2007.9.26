<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser to the BNP chairperson retired brigadier general ASM Hannan Shah Wednesday said Khaleda Zia had played no roles in GATCO corruption. "Khaleda Zia did not see the approval letter of GATCO tender," Hannan told reporters at his DOHS home at Mohakhali in the city. "The prime minister does not have the privilege to approve if any purchase proposal is cancelled in the cabinet committee and so was the case with GATCO," he said. "It is unusual to arrest Khaleda Zia during investigation of GATCO case. Nobody can be arrested during investigation." He also renewed the demand for release of Khaleda and her arch political foe Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. On expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, the former jute minister said he was blessed by a special quarter. "Mannna Bhuiyan is not a reformist. He is working for a particular quarter." "The government has upheld the state of emergency as the situation in the country is not normal," Hannan commented, adding, "We want to do open politics." He said, "The Election Commission should comment on the political parties after having proper knowledge about them." "The issue of reform is the internal concern of the party This is not the agenda of EC." Hannan said they wanted to bring changes to the party and would do it along with the chairperson. bdnews24
