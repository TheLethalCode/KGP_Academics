 LONDON, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities hit their lowest in a week on Tuesday as a combination of weaker-than-expected US confidence data and German business sentiment stoked economic growth worries. Banks again topped losers on worries the sector would be hit by the recent turmoil in credit markets. Both Societe Generale and BBVA fell more than 1.5 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares ended 1.0 percent weaker at 1,529.9 but above the day's intra-day low of 1,521.6 as US markets reversed losses. The index is up 3 percent so far this year after recovering from its August lows hit during the credit market crisis. "In Europe, confidence indicators are coming down from relatively high levels, but still we see some slowdown in growth worldwide and we still have to wait and see where this is leading us to," said Dirk Thiels, head of global equity funds at KBC Asset Management. "If this would cause somewhat more of a slowdown, probably equity markets will start having their growth scare again and the very strong reaction we saw last week could be reversed." U.S. consumer confidence fell more sharply than expected in September and the pace of existing home sales swooned in August. German business morale sentiment fell to its lowest in more than 1-1/2 years in September, according to the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. Among standout losers, OMV fell 5 percent as the Austrian oil and gas group told shareholders of Hungary's MOL it would offer $20 billion if MOL's board agrees to negotiate. But MOL once again rebuked the approach and its shares rose.
