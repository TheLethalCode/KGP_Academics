<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)The ongoing war of words between the so-called 'reformist' and 'loyalist' factions of the BNP escalated Monday as BNP leader Ashraf Hossain dismissed an alleged crisis in the reformist camp. Ashraf fired back at comments made by recently appointed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain accusing him of "unsuccessfully" soliciting LDP chief Badruddoza Chowdhury to the reformist agenda. Talking to reporters at his home Ashraf said: "Some BNP leaders might very well have visited the LDP leader on their own. However, the party has not made any such move." He said: "The BNP doesn't suffer from any crisis in leadership. Delwar's statements sound rather brash." Referring to Delwar as the 'illegal secretary general' Ashraf added: "He does not have any mandate to take party decisions." "According to the BNP's constitution we are the lawful representatives of the party. Former BNP lawmakers, central leaders and executive committee members are all with us." "BNP is a democratic political party run in accordance with its constitution. We propose to change all undemocratic clauses in the constitution in a future party council." bdnews24
