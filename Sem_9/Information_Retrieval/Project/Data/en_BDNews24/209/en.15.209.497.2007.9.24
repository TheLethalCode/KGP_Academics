 COLOMBO, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 20 Tamil Tiger rebels and one soldier were killed in clashes in northern Sri Lanka on Monday, the military said, the latest in a rash of confrontations amid renewed civil war. The military said intercepted radio communications revealed about 20 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were killed in the Jaffna clash, up from an initial estimate of three.

Mannar," Tiger military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan said in an email. "The LTTE front-liners confirm a heavy toll on the Sri Lankan armed forces in this confrontation," he added, saying rebel fighters had sighted military helicopters evacuating wounded troops from the area.
