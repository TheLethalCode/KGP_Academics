 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday stayed the proceedings of two tax evasion cases against former state minister for civil aviation Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin and son Mir Helal Uddin. Justices Md Awlad Ali and Justice Shamim Hasnain stayed the proceedings of the cases on trial at Chittagong Special Judge's Court until Oct 29 on two writ petitions submitted by Mir Nasir and Mir Helal. The court also ordered the government and the National Board of Revenue to explain in two weeks why the proceedings of the two cases would not be declared illegal. NBR's deputy tax commissioner for Chittagong zone-2, Bhuban Mohan Tripura, filed the tax evasion cases in September against Mir Nasir and Mir Helal. The cases alleged that Mir Nasir did not pay his income tax fully from 1991 to 2007 and that the income tax returns he submitted were not correct. Mir Helal evaded income tax from 2001 to 2004. He also gave false information in the income tax returns he submitted for 2004 to 2007. bdnews
