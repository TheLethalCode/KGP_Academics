<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has approved an appeal to bring a case against Khaleda Zia and son Arafat Rahman Coco under the emergency powers rules, slimming a chance for them to seek bail. In a regular press briefing Monday, ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman said the investigation officer of the case, ACC deputy director Mohammad Zahirul Huda, made the appeal on Sept 5. "And the commission approved it," he said. Coverage of a case under emergency powers rules means the accused would not be able to appeal for bail and the trial of the case must be complete in 60 days. The accused have to be present in court during the proceedings of the case, according to the rules. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the corruption case against 13 people, including Khaleda and Coco with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2. Khaleda and Coco were arrested on Sept 3. The case detailed a controversy over a tender floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor to handle containers at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Inland Container Depot. The accused gave the work to Global Agro Trade Company although the firm did not meet all the conditions of bidding. In the case, it was alleged that the shady deal cost state coffers more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses. In the briefing, the ACC secretary indicated that a case might be filed against Khaleda's other Tarique Rahman soon. Asked to comment on progress on an investigation into Tarique's wealth, he said: "The investigation is almost done. You will see the results soon." bdnews
