<TITLE> Russia run by secret police -Soviet-era dissident </TITLE>

 MOSCOW, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Veteran Russian rights activist Sergei Kovalyov said the secret police in Russia today have even more influence than when he was jailed for 7 years for spreading anti-Soviet propaganda. Kovalyov, who was part of the same dissident circle as Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov, told Reuters in an interview that the heirs to the Soviet KGB had adapted their methods but were still repressing civil liberties. Aged 77 and widely considered the elder statesman of the Russian human rights movement, Kovalyov pointed to the fact that President Vladimir Putin, himself an ex-KGB spy, had installed dozens of his former colleagues in positions of power. "In certain senses the situation is even worse (than in the Soviet Union)," Kovalyov told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. "The current Kremlin team ... are all from the KGB, all of them, everyone who takes decisions is from there or shares the same ideology, the same concept of what a state should be. And that team acts single-mindedly and very effectively." "They do not use quite the same methods. They use modified Soviet methods. They have been very successfully modified." A biologist, Kovalyov began speaking out in defence of political prisoners in the 1960s. He was arrested in 1974 for "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" and sentenced to 7 years in jail and 3 years in internal exile. After that he worked as a night-watchman but was elected to parliament when the perestroika reforms began. Former President Boris Yeltsin made him head of a human rights commission, but Kovalyov stepped down over Moscow's military campaign in Chechnya. Kovalyov said that in Russia today he was free to criticise the authorities. "In a certain sense the situation in the country is better. We are not living in the Soviet Union," he said at a congress of the opposition Yabloko party, of which he is a senior member. "We are talking now (about civil liberties). I talked like that in the past. Then, that sort of talk cost me 10 years ... Now, I am sure nothing like that will happen." But he said the media were unable, or afraid, to report on many issues damaging to the Kremlin. National television coverage was slanted in favour of the Kremlin, and the biggest newspapers were owned by Kremlin-friendly magnates. "In the Soviet Union censorship was carried out very simply. There was a censorship committee ... A state censorship organ. Today that organ does not exist but there is censorship. Ask any journalist. Is there censorship? Yes, there is." He said the justice system today was even worse than it was under Soviet rule. Judges still took instructions from officials on whom to convict and whom to acquit, but now many were corrupt as well, he said. "Our courts briefly lifted themselves up from their knees and then collapsed back into their Soviet past. Now they are just as servile," said Kovalyov. "There is just one difference: the courts did not take bribes like they do now. Now they know their price. Potential clients know how much dough they have to fork out," he sa
