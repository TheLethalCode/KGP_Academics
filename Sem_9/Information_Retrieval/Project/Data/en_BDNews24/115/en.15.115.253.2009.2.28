<TITLE> New laws to try mutineers, if needed: Ashraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb (bdnews24.com)  New laws will be introduced if needed to try the BDR mutineers, the local government minister said Saturday. "None involved in killings, arson and plunder during the border guards' mutiny will be spared," said Syed Ashraful Islam. "They will all be brought to justice." "Exemplary punishment will be given to the killers to prevent a repeat of such atrocities and news laws will be introduced, if necessary," Ashraful told a press conference. The two-day mutiny by rebellious border guards, that began with gunfire Wednesday at the BDR headquarters, left a death toll of 77, mostly officers, as more bodies were dug up Saturday. More than 70 officers were still reported 'missing'. On the prime minister's offer of 'general amnesty' for the BDR men, he said, "This is applicable only for those who were not involved in killings, arson and plunders." Ashraf said many details of the mutiny were yet to come out. "We're not getting correct information; much evidence may have been destroyed," he said. "How many BDR jawans were inside the headquarters during the mutiny; how many jawans had come here to join the Bangladesh Rifles Week; how many attended the Darbar Hall meeting?" Ashraf said they were trying to find the answers to all these questions. He said it was impossible to tell the exact death toll so far, as new graves were being discovered. He said a high-powered probe committee led by the home minister has been asked to submit its initial report within seven days. bdnews24.co
