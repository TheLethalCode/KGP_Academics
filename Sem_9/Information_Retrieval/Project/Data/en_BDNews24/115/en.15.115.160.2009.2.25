The court also asked the government not to arrest or harass Hazari during the period. The bench of justices Syed AB Mahmudul Haque and Mainul Islam Chowdhury passed the orders on hearing his petition for bail in cases. One case was filed under Public Safety Act and the other on charges of persecution of a journalist. Hazari surrendered before the court around 11:30am to seek bail.
