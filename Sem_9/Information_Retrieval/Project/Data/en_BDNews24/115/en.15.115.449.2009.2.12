 ATHENS, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Fanis Gekas equalised midway through the second half to earn former European champions Greece a 1-1 draw with Denmark in a friendly international on Wednesday. Jonas Borring opened the scoring for Denmark when he slid the ball across Greece goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas four minutes after the break. Gekas netted his 13th international goal after Alexandros Tziolis swung the ball over from the right and Vassilis Torosidis nudged it into the Portsmouth striker's path. Greece, who are lead World Cup qualifying Group Two with nine points, play Israel in back-to-back matches in the next round of qualifiers for the 2010 tournament. Denmark, who head Group One, face Malta on March 28.
