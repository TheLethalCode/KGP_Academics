 Bandarbans, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The army recovered weapons and ammunition in an armed raid on suspected terrorists in the hill district of Bandarbans on Thursday, a day after two terror suspects were killed, an army officer said. "The arms recovered, in Ruma Upazila, include one light machine gun, a G-3 rifle, four mortar shells, three magazines and 60 bullets," said an army major not wanting to be named. In a raid in the same Upazila on Wednesday, two unidentified terror suspects were killed and an army member injured in an exchange of gunfire between security forces and the suspected terrorists. An AK-47 rifle and a 3-G rifle were later recovered. A similar exchange of gunfire took place on Jan. 31, between security forces and suspected terrorists, which led to the arrest of two terrorist-suspects, he said. Security forces are guessing that the terrorists might belong to neighbouring Myanmar's separatist Democratic Party of Arakan, said the major. It has been alleged that DPA members have been taking position in Ruma and Rowangchhari areas of the hill district and resorting to extortion and terrorist activities, say army officials. Meanwhile security forces in another raid in the remote Boro Modok area of Thanchi Upazila destroyed a poppy field of over 40 acres, said the major. bdnews24.co
