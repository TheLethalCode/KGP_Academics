 YANGON, Fri Feb 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Law enforcement officers in Myanmar seized more than 148 kg (326 lb) of heroin in January, state media reported on Friday, and police sources said the bulk of it came from a raid on a single cargo ship. The haul for January compares with 2.33 kg seized in December and 68.37 kg in the whole of 2007. Official figures for all of 2008 have not been published. Police sources said the ship was raided after a tip-off from Interpol and Chinese officials as it prepared to leave a Yangon port. A huge amount of heroin was found among its cargo of logs. The sources did not say exactly how much heroin was discovered on the ship, which is owned by a Singapore-based company. "It's confirmed that a large amount of heroin was seized from that ship," a Home Ministry official said, asking for anonymity. "I can't give you any further information at present but I can say it could be the biggest single haul in Yangon," he added. Myanmar is considered the world's second-largest producer of heroin after Afghanistan. Its heroin goes mainly to China and Pacific Rim countries such as Australia
