 Bandarban, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - Two unidentified terror suspects were killed and an army member injured in an exchange of gunfire between security forces and the suspected terrorists in Bandarban on Wednesday, an army officer said. Security forces are guessing that the terrorists might belong to bordering Myanmar's separatist Democratic Party of Arakan, said the officer of the army's 69th Brigade in Bandarban, who asked not to be named. He said members of security forces, who were on a rescue operation to find eight recent kidnap victims from the Rowanchhari area, suddenly found themselves facing off the terrorists in the evening. It has been alleged that DPA members have been taking position in Ruma and Rowangchhari areas of the hill district and resorting to extortion and terrorist activities, said the officer. Both groups exchanged several rounds of gunfire, during which the casualties occurred and an army man was hit by a bullet in the leg. Security forces recovered an AK-47 rifle and a 3-G rifle. A similar exchange of gunfire took place on Jan. 31, between security forces and suspected terrorists, which led to the arrest of two terrorist-suspects. bdnews24
