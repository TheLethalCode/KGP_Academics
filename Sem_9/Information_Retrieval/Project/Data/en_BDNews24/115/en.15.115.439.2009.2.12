 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh may not get some facilities under WTO's intellectual property law until 2013 and patented drug until 2016 if the latest draft on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) is signed with the US, the commerce minister said on Thursday. "Besides, there might also be problem regarding zero-tariff access of Bangladeshi products to the US market and quality of labour," Faruq Khan told reporters at a meet-the-press programme at National Press Club in the city. He said the government would not sighn any agreement against public interest. "We've experts; everything will be reviewed before doing anything," he said at the programe organised by the Economic Reporters' Forum. The minister claimed the previous BNP-led government had not agreed to sign the agreement as it had reservations about the clause on kickbacks and graft. Faruque again advocated extending transit facilities to India. "We'll earn a lot of royalty through transporting Indian goods. We'll think further about how Bangladesh can [derive maximum gains] from the transit agreement." "However, the agreement will not be signed hurriedly and Bangladesh's interest must be [safeguarded]." "The country's export sector has begun to face the negative impacts of ongoing global economic crisis, with less export in January" "A taskforce will be formed to see how export can be increased and find out the sectors in need of subsidy." The export may fall 5-10 percent; however, the government will take measures to increase export, Faruque said. If managed well, he observed, the negative impacts would not as severe as those had been in Europe and America. He also urged the businesses to mount efforts to lessen the affects of the global meltdown. The minister said governmental efforts were on to make ways for Bangladeshi businessmen to invest outside the country. Currently, Bangladesh Bank bars Bangladeshi businesspeople from tarnsferring money outside the country beyond a certain limit. Prices of daily essentials would come down further in the coming days, the minister said, adding the market was unstable because of the previous governments' failure to make the businessmen cut prices when international market cooled down. "We've begun strengthening the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh to oversee the market and, if necessary, to intervene." If need be, he added, the government might form a price commission to control the prices. "We hope the businessmen will further lower the prices and make less profit," the minister said. The government was considering to set up four vegetable markets on the outskirts of Dhaka City to allow farmers to sell vegetables at the right prices, the minister said. He urged the main opposition BNP not to use trade and commerce as political tools. The commerce minister said the Indian foreign minister during his recent visit had assured Bangladesh that India would shorten the black list of Bangladeshi products currently barred for export to that country. bd
