 GRAZ, Austria, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden made light of the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrik Larsson by beating Austria 2-0 in a friendly on Wednesday. Second-half goals from rising youngster Rasmus Elm and Lyon's Kim Kallstrom were enough to give Sweden the morale boosting away victory. Sweden grabbed the initiative in the first half with striker Markus Rosenberg, set up by Elm, wasting a golden opportunity to score in the sixth minute. Elm, 20, opened the scoring with an spectacular volley 12 minutes into the second half. Six minutes later, Kallstrom doubled the score with a free kick that went in via the crossbar after a foul on striker Marcus Berg. A minute later Austria came close to reducing the score with a well struck free-kick that keeper Andreas Isaksson was unable to hold, but the Sweden defence was able to clear. The match marked the return of regular left back Erik Edman, who had been absent from the Sweden side since injuring his knee in March last year.
