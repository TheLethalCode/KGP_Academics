 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has stressed on dredging in rivers to prevent water-logging, her press secretary said on Wednesday. She also pointed to the illegal filling of water lands as another reason behind the water-logging, Abul Kalam Azad said. The prime minister directed authorities to take measures to retrieve the occupied water lands when a panel of experts on the ongoing Hatirjheel-Begunbari project updated her on the project's progress. She directed the project authorities to be careful to keep the loss of the poor people living in the project area at a minimum. MPs Rashed Khan Menon and Aslamul Haq, among others, were present at the meeting. bdn
