 Dinajpur, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders of 'Oil, Gas, Power, Port and Mineral Resources Protection National Committee' on Saturday announced to resist the on-test open-pit mining in coal mine, which they said was 'a part of a conspiracy'. They also urged the government to execute the six-point deal with the people who demonstrated against the Fulbari coal mine in 2006. "No way the Barapukuria coal mine will be allowed to be closed down; the problems must be resolved. "But any efforts to extract coal through open-pit mining will be resisted," the member secretary of the committee, Prof Anu Muhammad, said at a rally in Barapukuria. During her election campaign, prime minister Sheikh Hasina had pledged to implement, if in power, the six-point deal signed by the previous BNP-led government, he said. "Now we hope she will live up to her pledge. Otherwise, people of this region will be bound to take tough measures," he said. bdnew
