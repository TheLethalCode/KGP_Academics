 WANA, Pakistan, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US drones fired two missiles into a hideout of Pakistan's top Taliban commander near the Afghan border on Saturday, killing at least five people, intelligence officials said. "According to initial reports, five people are dead. We don't know more than that," an intelligence official told Reuters. The missile strike in the Zangari area in the South Waziristan region was the third such attack since US President Barack Obama took office last month. Waziristan is the power base of Baituallah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban and an al Qaeda ally, who is also accused of involvement in the assassination of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. An aide of Mehsud said Zangari was a remote region and that Taliban officials had gone to check the damage. Zangari is 70 km (45 miles) north of Waziristan's main town of Wana. Frustrated over what it sees as Pakistan's failure to stem the flow of al Qaeda and Taliban militants from its lawless tribal regions into Afghanistan, the United States stepped up cross-border attacks last year. Pilotless U.S. drones carried out about 30 missile attacks on suspected militants in 2008, according to a Reuters tally, more than half after the beginning of September. The attacks killed more than 220 people, including foreign militants, according to a tally of reports from Pakistani intelligence agents, district government officials and residents. Pakistan does not officially confirm the strikes but has said they violate the country's sovereignty and increase resentment toward the Pakistani government and the United States. Obama said this week there was no doubt terrorists were operating in safe havens in the tribal regions of Pakistan, and the United States wanted to make sure Islamabad was a strong ally in fighting that threat. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower and who was elected to office last year, told CBS in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday that the Taliban had established itself across a large part of Pakistan, forcing the country to fight a war that was about Pakistan's own survival
