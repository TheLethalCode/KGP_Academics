 Maruf Mallick and Syedul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondents Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Rifles mutineers have alleged that army officers holding the top posts in the border force had goaded them into the armed rebellion at the BDR headquarters on Wednesday. bdnews24.com correspondents spoke to BDR jawans through the day, who poured out the resentments and angers that had built up against the army officials. "Today's situation was not created in one day," said a BDR rebel wielding his rifle at the sprawling compound's Azimpur gate. "Army officers are the most corrupt; why has the Anticorruption Commission sued only the civilians? They should sue the army officers too," he said. They spoke of discrimination in pay, repression of BDR personnel and arbitrary punishment by officers. "Officers torture and punish us severely. They strip us of ranks," another BDR jawan said. "They take half the rations we are allotted. If anyone protests, they are punished," he shouted, from behind a cloth masking his face. Citing a recent BDR initiative to sell daily essentials at low prices, during the tenure of the army-installed caretaker government, the jawans alleged the officers had pocketed crores of taka from the operation. "They (BDR officers) had sold soybean at Tk 140 each litre, exporting from Malaysia at Tk 33," one member said. "The higher officials were informed about these irregularities over the years, but in vain," he said. In an announcement in loudspeaker, a BDR member at noon said it was the army, which had killed country's independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and former president Ziaur Rahman. bdnews2
