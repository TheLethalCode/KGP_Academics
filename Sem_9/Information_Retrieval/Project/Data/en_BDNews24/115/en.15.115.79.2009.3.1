<TEXT>
 Arshad Mahmud Washington, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)Still gripped by shock and disbelief, a group of Bangladeshi-Americans in the greater Washington metropolitan area held a candle light vigil on Saturday night for the victims of the BDR mutiny in Dhaka. Braving frigid temperature men, women and children from Washington DC, Virginia and Maryland gathered on George Mason University campus, just outside Washington, responding to an email appeal. Almost all present on the occasion appeared distraught and traumatised by the brutality and savagery of the incident. "How could they indulge in such a cruel act", wondered Nancy Kamal, a resident of Virginia. Such sentiment was shared by most others. While they acknowledged that the BDR men might have genuine grievances, the way they vented their anger was totally unacceptable. They were all especially shaken by the mayhem and carnage that didn't even spare families and homes. They expressed deepest condolences to the victims' families and loved ones. Names of some of the fallen army officers were also read out on the occasion. Ehsan Hoque, Atia Mahzabin Nitu and Wahed Hossaini were among those who spoke at the vigil of their deep shock. The vigil concluded with a prayer for the departed souls led by Mr. Hossaini, a long-time resident of Virginia. Before the prayer, participants sang the national anthem in a sign of solidarity with Bangladesh. A unanimous resolution was adopted at the vigil, which strongly condemned the senseless violence unleashed by renegade troops of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR). The resolution also called on the Bangladesh government to bring the perpetrators of these atrocities to justice by forming an independent, impartial commission. At the same time, it commended the concerted effort made by the political leadership to resolve the crisis through negotiation rather than resorting to violence. "We call on the Bangladesh government to put checks and feedback mechanisms in place to prevent a similar crisis in future", the resolution said. bd
