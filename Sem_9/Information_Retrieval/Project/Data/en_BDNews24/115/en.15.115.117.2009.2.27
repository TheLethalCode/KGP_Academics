 ROME, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A (all times GMT): AC Milan's injury woes continue ahead of Sunday's visit to Sampdoria (1400) with midfielders Clarence Seedorf and Massimo Ambrosini in doubt after taking knocks in Thursday's UEFA Cup against Werder Bremen. "Seedorf and Ambrosini probably won't be available on Sunday," coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is under fire with his side trailing leaders Inter Milan by 11 points in third, told reporters. "We'll try to recover Kaka (from a foot injury) but it's not easy." Ronaldinho should be fit to play after shaking off a heel problem, Italian media reported. Sampdoria's Claudio Bellucci is suspended but fellow forwards Antonio Cassano and Giampaolo Pazzini should return after being rested for Thursday's 2-0 home defeat by Metalist Kharkiv, which saw the Genoa side knocked out of the UEFA Cup as well. Defender Christian Panucci may be called up for sixth-placed AS Roma's game at leaders Inter Milan on Sunday (1930) after apologising to coach Luciano Spalletti for refusing to go on the bench at Napoli last month and asking for a transfer, media said. Panucci has not played since and was left out of Roma's squad for the Champions League knockout stages. Spalletti could use the versatile Panucci with fellow defenders Marco Cassetti and Juan injured and full back Cicinho in doubt with knee trouble. Inter defender Walter Samuel has a calf problem, but Marco Materazzi is back in training after a thigh injury and should be available. Juventus midfielder Mauro Camoranesi has a fractured rib and thigh strain and media report he is likely to be out for 40 days, although he would have missed his side's home game against Napoli on Saturday (1930) anyway through suspension. Coach Claudio Ranieri may be tempted to rotate his strikers and field Vincenzo Iaquinta and David Trezeguet from the off after starting with Amauri and captain Alessandro Del Piero in Wednesday's 1-0 defeat at Chelsea in the Champions League. Striker Alberto Gilardino, who has scored 15 league goals so far this term, is suspended for fourth-placed Fiorentina's game at bottom side Reggina on Sunday (1400). Midfielder Massimo Mutarelli could make his debut for Bologna on Saturday (1700) at Lazio, the club he took to a tribunal in order to free himself from his contract after being frozen out of the side at the start of the season
