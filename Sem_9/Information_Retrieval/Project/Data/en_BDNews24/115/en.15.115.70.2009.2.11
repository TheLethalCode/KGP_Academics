<TITLE> Lack of monitoring shut many privatised firms: Mirza Jalil </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Many state-owned firms privatised in past years were closed down for lack of monitoring, newly appointed Privatisation Commission chairman Mirza Abdul Jalil said Wednesday. "Stricter monitoring will be put in place soon to protect the enterprises and make them profitable," Mirza Jalil told the first press briefing on Wednesday after he assumed office. Asked why the privatised units, many of which were profitable concerns, were closed, the commission chief blamed poor or no monitoring. "Some 70 more units are still awaiting privatisation but a decision can only be made after the relevant ministries take quick steps to that end." To another question, the chairman said, "There should not be a lack of coordination between the commission and the ministries as the commission only implements the government decisions." "And the ministries should not stand in the way of implementation." About the failure in selling off Rupali Bank Ltd., he said, "Those who dealt with the issue failed to identify the real buyers. He, however, avoided a direct comment about his decision about the bank, but said, "We'll wait for a while as I hardly know a thing about the matter." "Since independence, all governments except Awami League-led ones took steps against the interests of people, democracy and development," complained Mirza Jalil. Asked if they would take decisions at the dictates of World Bank and IMF, he said, "The body was formed with a noble objective. This country belongs to us and not to the World Bank or the IMF." "We'll take no decisions against the interests of the nation and the people." The government appointed Mirza Jalil, Bangladesh Krishak League president, to the Privatisation Commission as its head on Tuesday. b
