 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)Twenty three new photo exhibitions on the theme of 'Freedom' have been unveiled at different city galleries, including the Shilpakala Academy, in the second phase of the International Festival of Photography, Bangladesh 2009, or Chobi Mela V. Shilpakala Academy alone hosts 15 separate shows, which were inaugurated by former adviser and advocate Sultana Kamal on Wednesday. The other eight exhibitions are being housed by leading galleries in the capital. "This international festival, which has come together by the efforts of a huge number of dedicated professionals, has showcased human captivity, despair and craving for esteem," said Sultana, declaring the exhibitions open. "The eternal human hankering for freedom has been quite aptly expressed in these photographs. Only humans striving together, holding hands, forming ranks can achieve liberation, as the exhibitions point out." Festival director Shahidul Alam and Concern Bangladesh country director Kiran Crawley also spoke on the occasion. The 23 shows display the works of photographers from every corner of the world, including Bangladesh. The show titled 'Amra-o Manush (We too are humans)', by Bangladeshi photographer Shehab Uddin, drew a large crowd on the opening day. Shehab's shots capture the plight of the 'dispossessed': long queues of rootless people in front of public toilets and a disabled 'Rabeya' rolling sideways across an avenue are just two of these artist's powerful images. Mads Nissen from Denmark has a series titled 'Upheaval in Tibet' depicting the long years of protest against Chinese occupation and misrule. Brazilian Eduardo Martino's work "The captives of hope: modern Brazilaian slaves" deplores the fate of bonded farm labourers. Norwegian Tom Hatlstadt's work "Freedom Track" is a documentary project, which upholds the festival theme. Hatlstadt, who drove a Land Rover from Norway through Scandinavia, eastern Europe, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India and Nepal, depicts the communities he met on the way and their notions of 'Freedom'. The exhibitions will run till Feb 20, the last day of Chobi Mela V; the shows are open everyday from 11am to 8pm, except Fridays when the opening hours will be 3pm-8pm. bdnews
