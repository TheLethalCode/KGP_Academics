 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnewws24.com)  The government has ordered all BDR troops to return to their posts within 24 hours. "All BDR personnel, absent form their posts in the wake of the quelled mutiny, have been asked to join their posts within the next 24 hours," said an order issued at 1.30pm Saturday. "If it is not possible to return to their work stations within this time, they can report to their nearby BDR headquarter, battalion headquarter or police station," said the order signed by Syed Mostafizur Rahman, joint secretary (Ansar and border section) of the home ministry.
