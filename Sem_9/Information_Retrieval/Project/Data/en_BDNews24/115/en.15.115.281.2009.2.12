 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka moved into the Grameenphone Women's Cricket Series final Thursday with a massive 115-run win over Pakistan in the rain-curtailed match at Birshreshthha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. The Lankans bundled the Pakistanis out for 92 in 33 overs after racking up 207 for nine in the stipulated 34 overs. It was the third consecutive triumph for Sri Lankan women, who had earlier beaten Bangladesh and Pakistan in Bogra. Openers Nain Abidi (11) and Bismah Mahroof (18) put on 35 runs for Pakistan before Hiruka Fernando blasted through the top order to return three for 14. Suvini De Alwis wrecked Pakistan's middle order with another three for 10 runs in her 10-over spell. Urooj Mumtaz (17) and Javeria Khan (11) were other two batswomen to touch double digits. Earlier, put in to bat first, Sri Lanka fell in trouble losing openers Dedunu De Silva (5) and Chamari Polgampala (4) for 10 runs. Captain Shashikala Siriwardena, however, was on hand to rescue her side, smashing 66 off 72 balls, studded with 10 fours and one six. Tail-ender Dilani Manodart chipped in with 25 off 28 balls. Sri Lanka will play their last match on Friday against hosts Bangladesh who have lost both their matches in Bogra
