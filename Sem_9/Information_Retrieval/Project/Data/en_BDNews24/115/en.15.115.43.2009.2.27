 LOS ANGELES, Fri Feb 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - `Slumdog Millionaire', the rags-to-riches movie that took the Oscars by storm, also produced two of the most influential words of the 2008 Hollywood awards season, a language monitoring group said on Thursday. "Jai Ho!", Hindi for Let There be Victory and the title of the movie's Oscar-winning best song, and "Slumdog" -- the controversial term coined by the filmmakers for young slum-dwellers in Mumbai -- were named the top "HollyWords" of the year that closed with last Sunday's Oscars. The Global Language Monitor, which uses an algorithm to track the frequency of words and phrases in the world's print and electronic media, said it was rare for two words from the same movie to be ranked in its annual list. "Slumdog Millionaire" crowned its awards sweep by winning eight Oscars, also including best picture and director. Last summer's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" inspired the new expression "Nuke the Fridge" -- a phrase coined on the Internet to describe a moment when a cinematic franchise has run its course. The phrase came in third on the list, followed by "Hmong" -- a mountain dwelling people in Laos -- from the Clint Eastwood movie "Gran Torino". "What doesn't kill you makes you....stranger", the Joker's twist on German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's epigram that was spoken by Heath Ledger in Batman blockbuster "The Dark Knight" was also among the Top Ten. along with the line "There are no coincidences" from the animated movie "Kung Fu Panda.
