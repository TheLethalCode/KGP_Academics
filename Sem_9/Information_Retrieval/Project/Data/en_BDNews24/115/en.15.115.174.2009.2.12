 Mustak Ahmed, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Dakhil-level Bengali and English courses will be expanded to cover examinations of 200 marks each, similar to the SSC, the Madrasa Board chairman said Thursday. Currently, the English and Bengali courses for Dakhil diploma call for holding exams of 100 marks each. "After discussing the matter with the madrasa teachers, we have made the decision of English and Bengali language teaching and exam holding for 200 marks each," professor Md Yousuf Thursday told bdnews24.com. "Now its modus operandi will be determined after consulting the education ministry." The changes to the curriculum have been undertaken under the SESDP (secondary education sector development project) of the secondary and higher education directorate. "A taskforce entrusted with the assignment has deposited its report with the education ministry," Ratan Kumar Roy, director, madrasa education sector development project told bdnews24.com. "Opinions of eminent educationists and other important people will also be sought, workshops held and only then the decision will be finalised." The taskforce report also mentions expanding the English and Bengali curricula so that exams should cover 200 marks each instead of the current 100 marks allocated to each of these subjects. The current practice has given rise to problems in the Dakhil qualified students seeking to pursue higher studies. The education ministry officials say that under the madrasa system, the importance of English is undermined and hence the anomalies, which should be addressed. They say once the 200-marks course for English and Bengali is introduced at the Dakhil stage, the same will be done from Alim level too. The Madrasa Board's 100-mark English and Bengali exams have been barring madrasa students from seven Dhaka University departments requiring 200-mark exams in the two subjects to be passed by applicants. A dispute has brewed, all the way to the High Court, since the seven DU departments introduced the new admissions criteria last year. bd
