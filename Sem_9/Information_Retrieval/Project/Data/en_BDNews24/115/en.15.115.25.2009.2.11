 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka University Journalists' Association has awarded bdnews24.com university correspondent Jannatul Ferdous Tanvi the Shahid Sangbadik Chishti Shah Helalur Rahman Medal 2008 for the best reporting on campus. Jannatul received the award Wednesday for her 2008 report on the plight of thousands of rare manuscripts lying neglected at DU's central library. She also reported fearlessly when most mainstream new media outlets kept mum amid campus violence, resulting in a curfew imposed under the state of emergency, through the night of Aug 22 2007 and following days. DU vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique handed the medal to Jannatul at Senate Bhaban at the awards ceremony. The young correspondent is studying for a masters degree from the university's mass communication and journalism department. bdnews24
