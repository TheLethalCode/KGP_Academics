 GENEVA, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Switzerland and Bulgaria warmed up for the next round of World Cup qualifying with an uninspiring 1-1 draw at the Stade de Geneve on Wednesday. Bulgaria were the livelier side throughout most of the encounter and took a deserved lead shortly after the half hour mark when striker Ivelin Popov played a neat one-two with Stanislav Manolev before calmly firing past Marco Woelfli. The Swiss keeper did well a few minutes later to smother a close range chance for Manchester United forward Dimitar Berbatov. Bulgaria paid the price for that wasted opportunity in the final minute of the first half as midfielder Benjamin Huggel turned in a well-weighted pass against the run of play from Swiss captain Alex Frei. Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld made six second-half substitutions in preparation for his team's next two qualifiers against Moldova but it did little to improve the fare on offer. Wednesday's draw is also unlikely to boost the morale of the Bulgarians as they prepare for their visit to World Cup qualifying group eight rivals Ireland next month. The game in Geneva was Bulgaria's first under returning coach Stanimir Stoilov whose predecessor was sacked after the team's first three qualifiers all ended in draws.
