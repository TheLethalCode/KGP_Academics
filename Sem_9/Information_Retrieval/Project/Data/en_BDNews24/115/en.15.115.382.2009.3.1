<TITLE> Nepal says bans protests near China embassy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal has banned all protests around the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu because of the "sensitivity of the situation", the government said on Saturday, before Tibet marks the 50th year of the Dalai Lama's exile. Thousands of Tibetan exiles, including monks and nuns, protested almost daily near the Chinese embassy in Nepal last year after the Chinese crackdown in Tibet following riots in March. Many were beaten by police before being arrested. The protests embarrassed the Nepalese government which accepts Tibet as part of China. Analysts say the Maoist-led government's decision is aimed at appeasing donor China. Home (Interior) Ministry spokesman Navin Ghimire said Kathmandu district administration office had prohibited demonstrations around Chinese diplomatic missions. "The ... order will remain in place until further notice," Ghimire said. Next month marks the 50th year of the exile of Tibetan spiritual guru the Dalai Lama who fled to India after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Demonstrations by monks in Lhasa in March last year escalated into deadly riots and prompted protests against Chinese rule within Tibet and across the world, particularly in the run-up to the summer Olympics in Beijing last August. More than 20,000 Tibetans live in Nepal since first fleeing their homeland after the abortive 1959 uprising.
