 Dhaka, Feb12 (bdnews24.com)Postponed elections to six Upazila will be held on April 6, an Election Commission official said Thursday. "Polls to six Upazila were postponed on or before election day (Jan 22) due to reports of irregularities. They will be held on April 6," EC senior assistant secretary Md Abdul Baten told bdnews24.com. "The chief election commissioner and two commissioners decided the date in a meeting today," he said. The six Upazila are: Brahminbaria Sadar, Ramganj, Barura, Belkuchi, Dighinala and Ukhia. The EC official added: "Polling at 11 voting centres in eight Upazila were also suspended during the election due to disturbances. These 11 centres will be re-polled on March 16." The 11 centres are spread through Chowhali, Islampur, Nandail, Gazaria, Rupganj, Faridganj, Lakshmipur Sadar and Swandip upazilas. The third Upazila Parisad polls were held on Jan 22 to 475 of the total 481 local government bodies in 64 districts across the country. Results of 447 polls have been published in a 'first phase' gazette. The Election Commission earlier in the week said it will hold judicial inquiries in 20 of the 34 Upazila that were omitted in the 'first phase' gazette of poll results after allegations of irregularities. After the publication of the probe committee's reports, it will be decided whether their suspended results will be reinstated or re-elections will be held, election chief ATM Shamsul Huda said Tuesday. The inquiries will be completed within one month, Huda said. The 20 Upazilas, partial or full elections results of which have been suspended and judicial inquiries ordered, are: Bancharampur, Araihazar, Teknaf, Kaliganj, Mehendiganj, Muradnagar, Raipura, Madarganj, Atpara, Pakundia, Chandina, Raipura, Harinakunda, Sagolnaia, Ishwarganj, Gaforgaon, Madaripur Sadar, Jagannathpur, Ajmiriganj and Daudkandi. The CEC said the commission will send directions to the law ministry for conducting judicial inquiries into the alleged irregularities in these Upazilas. bdn
