<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday told the parliament a 'white paper' on corruption of the immediate past caretaker and the BNP-led four-party alliance governments was much needed. "We will take necessary measures to bring the laundered money back home," she said, on a supplementary question from Mujibul Haq, during her weekly question-answer session. "White papers on corruptions will be published. I support this proposal made in the parliament. Of course, publication of the white papers is an utmost necessity." "How much black money did the then prime minister, her sons and the finance minister had stacked up that they needed to whiten them," Hasina added. Haq asked if the government would take measures to bring the money laundered abroad during the tenures of the four-party alliance government and the immediate-past caretaker government. Hasina also pledged measures against those who had perpetrated killings without trial. "I was the first to protest the extra-judicial killings. I am against the extra judicial killings. "A tiger having tasted blood cannot forget the same; it wants to get it again. Those who committed [the extra judicial killings] will need some time to change the habit. "We will be trying to stop the extra-judicial killings. At the same time, we will take actions against those committing such killings," the prime minister said. Replying to another question, Hasina said two universities, one named after social revolutionary Begum Rokeya, would be set up in Rangpur district. bdn
