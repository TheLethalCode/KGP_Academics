<TITLE> Serve big, small clients equally: BB chief to banks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank governor on Saturday urged the banks to serve all clients, however big or small. "One of the main problems of our banks is that they prioritise the big clients and business houses. They seldom attend to the smaller clients," Salehuddin Ahmed told the annual conference of the state-owned Sonali Bank at Hotel Purbani in the city. "But this attitude is not desirable. All clients, no matter how small or big, will have to be treated equally," he said. He said the volume of deposits in state-owned commercial banks was gradually on the fall. "The private commercial banks are eager to woo depositors. But state-owned banks are equally indifferent to attracting clients," said Salehuddin. For instance, the governor said, the private banks would help the interested clients to immediately open an account, whereas the state-owned commercial banks harass the would-be clients. "Because of this attitude people are less inclined to do banking with the state-owned banks. Nowadays people do not want to waste time. "Considering the clients' behaviour, new projects will have to be initiated to improve the standards of service (in the state-owned banks)," the governor noted. He said the state-owned banks needed to keep pace with the private commercial banks that keep coming up with new banking services. The governor stressed on extending loans to industrial and agricultural projects. "Our banks prefer to give loans for commercial projects. This sort of loan makes some businessmen profitable but leaves no positive impact on the overall economy," he said. "New loans in the agricultural and industrial sectors will create new job opportunities leading to rise in the GDP ". He asked Sonali Bank to draw in more foreign remittance. "Sonali Bank was the highest remittance collector but recently it slipped to second," he said. Finance secretary Mohammad Tareq, Sonali Bank chairman Ali Imam Majumder and the bank's chief executive S A Chowdhury also spoke. bdnews24.c
