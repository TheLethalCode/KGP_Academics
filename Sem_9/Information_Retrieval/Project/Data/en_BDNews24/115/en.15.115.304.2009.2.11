 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  China financing for a Sirajganj fertiliser plant, with a half million tonne production capacity, is being considered by the government, said industries minister Dilip Barua after talks with Chinese ambassador Zheng Qingdian on Wednesday. "The government will soon reply to the financing proposal of the Exim Bank of China for the Northwest Fertiliser Company in Syedabad, Sirajganj, through the Economic Relations Division," said the minister. The proposed plant has a 5.77 lakh tonne production capacity. The Chinese government has previously funded a DAP (Di Ammonia Phosphate) factory in Chittagong. The government also plans to extend the Natural Gas Fertiliser Factory in Fenchuganj, Sylhet, said Barua. Talking about the country's deficit of gas for supply to fertilser plants, Dilip Barua said, "The Chinese are efficient and we shall try to bring out a feasible solution through discussion." The construction of a route from Kunming, China, to Cox's Bazar via Myanmar was also discussed, said the minister. Barua also sought China's participation in the tender for the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) to be constructed at Savar. "Due to the absence of CETP, the tannery cannot be relocated to Savar from the present position in Hazaribagh," sai the industries minister. bdnews24
