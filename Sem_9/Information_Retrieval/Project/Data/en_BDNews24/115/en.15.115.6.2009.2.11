<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP on Tuesday censured recent comments by the Indian envoy, saying the way he spoke to the mass media about opposition to the Indian transit issue "broke the customary code of diplomatic decorum". "Newsmen asked the high commissioner on Sunday about Bangladesh's political parties opposing a transit deal with India," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, coming out of a BNP standing committee meeting, told reporters. "He replied discourteously saying 'There can be no meaning to such nonsense'," said Khan. "This breaks the customary diplomatic etiquette," he added. Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty on Sunday (Feb 8) was briefing the press after a meeting with home minister Sahara Khatun, ahead of a visit by Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee. Asked about objections and controversy raised by some quarters to a transit deal with India, Chakravarty had said: "When we are opposed to something, we may say all kinds of nonsensical things to prevent that thing happening." "Opposing something is sometimes just a political stand," he had said. Khan said Tuesday that BNP, the country's main opposition party, was calling on the government to take steps in regard to Chakravarty's comment. He said the matter could be settled easily if the Indian high commissioner apologised for the comment. The BNP leader also said the party's standing committee discussed the political situation in the country and international issues. BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia convened an 'urgent meeting' of the party's top policy making forum at her Gulshan office on Tuesday. The meeting, beginning around 7.30pm, discussed the overall situation of the country, said Khan. The three-hour meeting was adjourned at 10:15pm until Feb 12. bdnew
