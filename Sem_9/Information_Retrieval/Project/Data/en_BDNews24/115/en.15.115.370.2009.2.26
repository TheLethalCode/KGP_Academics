 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)Troops and tanks left their positions in the capital's Dhanmondi area Thursday midnight, four hours after the home minister declared an end to the two-day BDR mutiny. They were seen rolling back towards barracks from their positions around the troubled BDR headquarters. At least eight tanks had arrived in Dhanmondi around 4pm, rolling through the Road 27, a situation that forced thousands of residents to leave their homes around the 2-km radius of Peelkhana. They moved up the Satmasjid Road, closing in on the main entrance of the BDR headquarters from 5.30pm, with thousands of spectators crowding the streets. The armoured vehicles and army trucks were stationed at Abahani sports field in the residential area. Since early afternoon, the troops had been asking people by loudspeaker to move out of the areas around the sprawling BDR complex, where hundreds of armed rebels were holding on. The end to the bloody rebellion was bloodless as the nation's political leadership put their stress on talks, rather than tanks. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, led marathon negotiations that resolved the crisis. The rebellion and the ensuing impasse had threatened to erupt into an all-out battle between the paramilitary forces and the tanks-totting troops in the busy residential district. bdn
