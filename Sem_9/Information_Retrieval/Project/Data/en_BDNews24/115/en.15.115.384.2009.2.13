 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Two separate cases have been filed against more than 1,200 workers following violent clashes with police at Kushiara Composite Knit Industries Ltd at Ashulia in Savar on Wednesday. Manager Rezaul Karim filed a case against 51 workers, while Ashulia Police Station sub-inspector Mofizul Islam filed another case alleging attacks on police against 1,200 mostly unnamed workers. Police had arrested 11 workers, who were named in both cases, upto Thursday noon. At least 100 knitwear workers and riot police were injured as they locked in violent clashes on Wednesday involving dozens of rounds of teargas and rubber bullets at the Ashulia factory, said police. Angry employees of the factory, demonstrating for outstanding wages, went on a rampage of several factories and damaged dozens of vehicles when police swooped on them, said witnesses. Police were forced to fire 59 rounds of teargas shells and more than 200 rubber bullets to bring the situation under control. The situation was getting back to normal as the workers' leaders reached an agreement with the owners on payment of the dues on Thursday, said Ashulia PS officer-in-charge Rafiqul Islam. But problems erupted when a few workers suddenly pelted brickbats; the scene soon turned into a battlefield as employees of neighbouring factories joined them, he said. The furious workers damaged dozens of buses and also vehicles of other garment factories, said Islam, who was also hurt in the violence. Some 30 policemen were among the more than 100 injured in the incident. bdnews24.com
