<TITLE> Russia offers Rooppur backing for Rooppur N-plant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Russia has proposed backing for a 1000 megawatt nuclear power station in Rooppur, Ishwardi, said Russian ambassador Gennady P Trotsenko on Thursday. The power station could be completed and online within five years, he added. The ambassador made the proposal after meeting Yafes Osman, state minister for science, information and technology. "Russia is keen to establish an atomic power plant in Bangladesh to resolve the power crisis in Bangladesh," said the state minister. He also said that a Russian specialist team is coming next month to observe the selected spot and finalise the proposal. After that, the matter of the power plant, a joint venture between Bangladesh and Russian will be finalised, added Yasef Osman. Rooppur Nuclear Power Project was originally conceived in 1961 in view of the growing need for electricity against the inadequate supply of primary energy resources in the country. Before liberation, companies from Belgium, Canada, USA, USSR, UK and Switzerland had submitted proposals and undertaken a number of feasibility studies. The government also acquired land for the plant and residential complex during the time. But the project was not implemented due to the then-Pakistan government's reluctance, and the original proposal for the nuclear plant was later implemented in Karachi. The yet to be realised Rooppur project has gone through many twists since independence; its latest incarnation under the past BNP-led government was a 600-650 MW plant to be built with China's assistance. The immediate past caretaker government had also maintained negotiations with China. bdnew
