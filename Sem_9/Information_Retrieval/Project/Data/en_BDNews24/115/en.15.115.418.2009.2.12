<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will not need any assistance from the IMF or any other international agencies to avert any impact of the ongoing global recession, IMF director for Asia and Pacific region Anoop Singh said on Thursday. These are many reasons why Bangladesh will not need any foreign aid or assistance, the main one being that the country's banks and stock market have been largely protected from an initial impact, he said. Singh, after daylong meetings with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, finance minister AMA Muhith, planning minister AK Khandaker, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed and others, briefed reporters at the central bank headquarters in Motijheel. Asked if the IMF would provide assistance to the country to face off any impact, the International Monetary Fund director said, "Bangladesh's economy has been able to resist  the effects of the global financial crisis." "The domestic economy has retained momentum from a favourable agricultural performance and Bangladesh has benefited from the fall in food, fuel and other commodity prices." Singh added, "Limited capital account dependence has largely protected the country's banks and stock market from the first round impact of the global crisis." Singh, who arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday, met with finance minister AMA Muhith and finance and planning adviser Moshiur Rahman Thursday morning. Muhith told reporters after the meeting, "We talked about different aspects of our economy and told the IMF that our economy was in a better position than that of many other Asian countries." Singh agreed, saying since Bangladesh is not elaborately linked to the global economy, the impact of the ongoing economic slump will be minimal. He observed Bangladesh's readymade garments, the chief source of export income, was in a better position than others'. There will not be too much of a negative impact on GDP, Singh told reporters. But the finance minister said the effect of the global economic recession may be felt in the 2009-10 fiscal year. A meeting will be held with representatives from all sectors, in the first week of the next month, to discuss ways to counter the negative impact of the global recession, Muhith added. He said measures would be adopted to ensure that the flow of foreign remittance was not adversely affected. Finance secretary Mohammad Tareq, adviser to the IMF for the Asia-Pacific region Masato Miyazaki and IMF country head Jonathan Dunn were also present at Thursday's meeting. The IMF slashed its 2009 forecast for global growth at the start of February to just 0.5 percent, the weakest year since World War Two, from a November estimate of 2.2 percent. Finance minister Muhith at the time reassured businesses and the public that despite IMF's gloomy global prediction Bangladesh's economy still remained 'insulated' from the world recession. But Muhith has also warned in recent days that the recession may be finally having an impact on the local export trade, and that a taskforce was being formed soon to counter the fallout. bdnews
