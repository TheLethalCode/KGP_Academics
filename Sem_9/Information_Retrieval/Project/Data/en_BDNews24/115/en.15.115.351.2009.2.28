<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League-led 14-party alliance has accused the opposition leader of misleading the people by raising irrelevant questions about the bloody BDR mutiny. The people and the international community are appreciating prime minister Sheikh Hasina's government for quelling the mutiny in less than 36 hours, but Khaleda Zia is trying to mislead the people, the 14-party said. The remarks came from a statement after the 14-party held a meeting chaired by Hasina, the AL president, at her residence. A bloody 33-hour mutiny by the disgruntled border guards that began Wednesday left a death toll of 77, mostly officers, up to Saturday afternoon, though more than 70 officers were still 'missing'. Khaleda, also BNP chairperson, Friday had alleged the prime minister's offer of general amnesty for the BDR mutineers when they were holding hostages at the BDR headquarters was a tactical mistake. She had said the amnesty might have emboldened the rebels to inflict more casualties. Khaleda added the "resentment and mistrust that have crept up among different law-enforcing agencies across the country" needed to be cleared quickly. She had said the permission to launch operations to rescue the army officers and their families who had been held hostage came too late. Time was wasted in the name of negotiations and junior-level representatives were assigned to negotiate, the opposition leader had observed. The 14-party alliance asked Khaleda to think if force was used to quell the mutiny, what would have been happened to the hostages the mutineers had been holding. The statement urged all to try to overcome the current circumstances from their respective positions. In the current situation, the combine observed, inactiveness and silence of the opposition leader and the fact that no opposition leader visited the mutiny site have given rise to question. Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil later told reporters the meeting had thanked the prime minister for her timely intervention to keep things under control during the bloody mutiny. He said the meeting expressed shock at the deaths of the army officers, their relatives and civilians in the horrific events. bdnews24.com/
