 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com) A senior army officer said in a statement Friday night that trial of those who killed scores of army officers in the two-day BDR mutiny will be fast-tracked. "The general amnesty announced by the prime minister does not mean that those who took part in killing, mutiny, arson and other heinous activities will be pardoned," lieutenant general Muhammad Abdul Mubin said. "Vested quarters have tried to damage the image of the patriotic armed forces through provocation and propaganda," the general said, calling for national unity. Mubin read out from a written statement minutes before midnight and said he was clarifying "a few points at the instruction of the prime minister". "Those who committed such barbaric and brutal acts cannot be pardoned and will not be pardoned," said Mubin, principal staff officer to the Armed Forces Division overseen by the prime minister herself. "In order to ensure a speedy trial, the government will form a special tribunal and surely give exemplary punishment (to those guilty)," the general said. "And proper representation from the army in the inquiry committee will be ensured," he added. He repeated an earlier government announcement that the dead would be buried with full state honour and that the families provided with "all facilities". The general said the two-day mutiny had tarnished Bangladesh's image internationally. "The incidents of the last two days have completely destroyed the BDR chain of command, which makes this force as well as the country's security very much vulnerable. "Restoring the chain of command is imperative in the interest of national security. "The government has already appointed Brig Gen Moinul director general of the Bangladesh Rifles. "Under his leadership, the command structure of the entire force will be re-organised." The statement followed Gen Moeen's meeting with the prime minister, which ended at 11pm. "Respected members of the armed forces, the Honourable Prime Minister and the government are fully aware of, and sympathetic to, all your sentiments and reactions." The general said the members of the armed forces must be patient, and play a responsible role. "We must remain united and act together to show respect to the departed souls of the officers who died," Mubin said. "This is absolutely vital for the country's security and peace in general. "It is our moral responsibility to maintain national unity in these times of national crisis." He referred to the government announcement that the nation would officially mourn the dead till Sunday
