 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Secondary school students around the country on Saturday were facing their last day of preparation ahead of the SSC, and equivalent exams. Some 10.63 lakh students - 5.58 lakh boys and 5.05 lakh girls - from 26,239 schools countrywide will simultaneously begin their SSC, Dakhil and SSC Vocational exams on Sunday at 10am with an English paper. The 2009 secondary school certificate and equivalent exams are seeing around 50,000 more candidates than the previous year, though the dropout rate remains high countrywide at around 42 percent. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid stated earlier in the week that the exams this year would be "free of cheating and all attempts at dishonesty will be curbed with due strictness." He said the results would be out on May 25. Education secretary Syed Ataur Rahman has said the education and energy ministries have been working together to ensure uninterrupted power supply during exam hours. Of the total 10.63 lakh exam candidates, 7.33 lakh are regular candidates and 3.3 lakh irregular candidates. Of these, just over 8 lakh candidates will sit for the exams under the eight general boards. Some 2.4 lakh students are sitting from the Dhaka Board, 1.14 lakh under Rajshahi Board, 88,523 under the Comilla Board, 1.07 lakh under Jessore Board, 62,037 in Chittagong, 48,808 in Barisal and 1.02 lakh in Dinajpur, according to the ministry of education. This is the first time SSC exams are being held under the Dinajpur Board. The Madrasa Board is putting forward 1.86 lakh students for the Dakhil exams and 75,057 are sitting for SSC Vocational exams under the Technical Board. Another 254 students are sitting the exams from seven overseas centres. Massive dropout rates unstemmed Another massive dropout rate of 42 percent is seen countrywide this year ahead of the exams, with the Sylhet Board suffering the highest dropout rate of 57 percent. "There is no doubt that many students are still dropping out because of social and economic factors," said Prof Mohammad Shamsul Huq, new chairman of the Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board of Dhaka. The dropout rate has fallen this year, however; last year the countrywide dropout rate was 48.15 percent. Over 12.67 lakh regular students registered for the 2009 secondary school certificate and equivalent exams out of eight education boards, one madrasa and one technical board across the country, but 5.34 lakh students have failed to submit entry forms for the exams. The dropout rate is 46.98 percent for girls and 37.11 percent for boys this year. Prof Huq held early marriages responsible for female dropouts, and economic pressures for male dropouts. "Many girls are married off in our country before SSC exams, and are unable to pursue their studies," he told bdnews24.com. "In the case of boys, it is seen that many guardians give them education to some extent but then engage them in earning money. In that case they lose interest in education or no longer have the time or opportunity," said Huq. The dropout rate under the Sylhet Board is highest this year at 57.25 percent. Rajshahi Board has the lowest rate at 32.76 percent. Dhaka Board sees a 44.19 percent dropout rate, Comilla Board 50.79 percent, Jessore 43.01 percent, Chittagong 45.35 percent, Barisal 43.11 percent, Dinajpur 33.15 percent. The Madrasa Board (Dakhil) sees a 33.62 percent dropout rate, and the Technical Board (SSC Vocational) 54.32 percent. bdnews
