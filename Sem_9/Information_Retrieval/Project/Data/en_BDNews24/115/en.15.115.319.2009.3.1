 Dhaka, March 1(bdnews24.com)  Lalbagh police recovered the body of Lt Col Golam Kibria Mohammad Niamatullah on Sunday. The uniformed body was recovered at around 8am from Nawabganj sluice gate, near Kamrangirchar where eight officers' bodies have previously washed up since the mutiny. Lt Col Golam Kibria's body was probably similarly dumped over the wall of the BDR compound, into a Hazaribagh sewerage channel, said police. The body was later sent to the Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital morgue, where the body was identified by his wife. The deceased was commanding officer of Chapainawabganj Rifles Battalion-39. He joined the BDR headquarters as a senior record officer just eight days before the mutiny. bdnews24.c
