<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia striker Eduardo da Silva marked his return to top-level soccer after a year-long absence by setting up Niko Kranjcar's winner that secured a 2-1 victory over Romania in their friendly on Wednesday. Eduardo, who suffered a horrific leg injury last February while playing for his club side Arsenal, came on just before the hour and from his incisive pass inside the penalty area Kranjcar shot home a 75th-minute winner. Romania, without injured striker Adrian Mutu, opened the scoring in the 22nd minute through striker Ciprian Marica but it took only seven minutes for Croatia to equalise. Midfielder Ivan Rakitic made it 1-1 when he fired home a 30-metre free kick. Romanian midfielder Razvan Cocis wasted a great opportunity in the 58th minute when he was denied by a fine save from goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa. The entire game was congested in midfield with both teams failing to create many scoring opportunities.
