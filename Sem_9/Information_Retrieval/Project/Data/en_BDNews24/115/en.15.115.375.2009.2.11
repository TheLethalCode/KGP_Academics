<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Feb 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - `Grey's Anatomy' stars Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight will soon be leaving the TV medical drama, Us Weekly magazine reported on Tuesday. Actor James Pickens Jr, who plays Dr Richard Webber on the ABC show, confirmed long-swirling rumors that Heigl, 30, would be taking off her scrubs for good. "Yes, she is," Pickens was quoted as telling the magazine at the weekend. "Wherever Katherine goes, I wish her nothing but the best." Pickens added that Knight, who plays Dr George O'Malley, is "going too." "He just wanted to pursue other career paths," Pickens said. ABC said it was "not commenting at this time" on the report. Both Knight, 35, and Heigl, who won a 2007 Emmy for playing Dr Isobel "Izzie" Stevens, have been cast regulars since the show started in 2005. Knight has been reported for some months to be seeking a release from his "Grey's Anatomy" contract and Heigl has recently starred in the movie comedies "27 Dresses" and "Knocked Up"
