<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion picked up at least 60 fleeing BDR men up to Thursday midnight as buses and other vehicles were stopped and searched at a Savar checkpoint on the Dhaka-Aricha highway, RAB officials said. They said the hunt for BDR men would continue overnight. Some said army personnel were also participating in the search. The 60 BDR jawans have been detained at the elite force's Savar camp, said RAB-4 officer Ariful Islam on Thursday night. He could not say to whom or where the detainees would be handed over. More than one captured jawan said they were escaping the headquarters out of fear that they would have to face trial despite the prime minister's amnesty. One RAB officer, on condition of anonymity, said army men were present at the Nabinagar checkpoint in front of the Savar cantonment gate. Earlier in the day, police and RAB caught 16 BDR men in civilian clothing as they tried to escape over the wall of their Peelkhana headquarters, the site of a two-day mutiny by rebel border guards. They were taken to a makeshift army camp at Abahani Sportsground. One of the arrestees, not wishing to be named, told reporters he was not involved with the mutiny. "Many of us were not involved in the mutiny. We were confined in houses on the BDR compound," he said. "I was able to escape as the ones holding us left the house unguarded at one point," he said. bdnews24.com/sm
