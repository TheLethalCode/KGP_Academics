<TITLE> Khaleda questions amnesty decision </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  The prime minister's offer of general amnesty for the BDR mutineers when they were holding hostages at the BDR headquarters was a tactical mistake, the opposition leader Khaleda Zia said Friday. The amnesty might have emboldened the rebels, she said in a statement at a press briefing at her Gulshan office in the city. "I think the amnesty increased the casualties," Khaleda, also opposition BNP chairperson, said as she read out the written statement. She said it was evident by then that an anti-state force was instigating the bloody mutiny. "We, in unison with the people, demand that the conspiracy be uncovered." "This is not the time for revenge," she said. Khaleda added the "resentment and mistrust that have crept up among different law-enforcing agencies across the country" needed to be cleared quickly. She stressed on rebuilding the rebellion-hit BDR and its chain of command. The former prime minister urged all to remain alert at the critical moment of the nation. "Now maximum alertness and unity are needed." Khaleda said the permission to launch operations to rescue the army officers and their families who had been held hostage came too late. Time was wasted in the name of negotiations and junior-level representatives were assigned to negotiate, the opposition leader observed. She asked her party leaders and supporters to observe the national mourning "although the government was slow in announcing national mourning days". Referring to the recounts of the released army officers and their families, Khaleda said "the atrocities were inexplicable". "The bodies were mutilated with bayonets; the women and children were tortured to death." bdnews
