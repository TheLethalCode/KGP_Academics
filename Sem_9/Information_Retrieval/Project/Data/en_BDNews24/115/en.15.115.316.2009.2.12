 MILAN, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlo Ancelotti would turn down the chance to coach Chelsea from June, the AC Milan manager said on Thursday. The Premier League club, who courted Ancelotti in the close season before appointing Luiz Felipe Scolari, have appointed Guus Hiddink until the end of the campaign having sacked the Brazilian. "The only club which has come forward has been Chelsea. In the summer I met (owner Roman) Abramovich but I didn't want to leave Milan," Ancelotti told Italy's La Stampa newspaper. "The same thing is happening now but I am not thinking about leaving."
