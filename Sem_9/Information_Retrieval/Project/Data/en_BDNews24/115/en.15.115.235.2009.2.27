 NEW DELHI, Fri Feb 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's economy grew a slower than expected 5.3 percent in the December quarter from a year earlier, slowing sharply from the previous quarter's 7.6 percent as the global economic crisis cut demand and exports. The annual growth for India's fiscal third quarter was lower than a median forecast of 6.2 percent in a Reuters poll of economists and also lower than a upwardly revised 8.9 percent annual expansion in the same quarter a year ago. The manufacturing sector fell 0.2 percent in the October-December quarter from a year earlier, while the farm sector contracted an annual 2.2 percent, government data showed on Friday. India has estimated the economy to grow 7.1 percent in 2008/09, slowing from the 9.0 percent in the previous year
