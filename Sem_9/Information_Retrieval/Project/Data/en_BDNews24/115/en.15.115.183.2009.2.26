 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  Police officers have entered the BDR compound and taken control of the main entrance, apparently ending a 33-hour mutiny. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who entered the compound at around 4:45pm for a second time to negotiate a full surrender with BDR rebels, state minister for local government Jahangir kabir Nanak and the police commissioner were still inside the headquarters. The prime minister's deputy press secretary Nakib Uddin Ahmed told reporters at 7pm Armed Police Battalion had taken control of the armory at the BDR headquarters. He said finance minister AMA Muhith, Sahara Khatun, Nanak, whips Mirza Azam and Segufta Yasmin Emily, MPs Meher Afroze Chumki, Waresat Hossain Belal and Mahbub Ara Guinea were boarding the trapped and wounded hostages in Red Crescent ambulances. bdnews24.com correspondents at the BDR main gate say they saw two police trucks and a pick-up van enter the compound, known as Peelkhana, at 6:33pm. Police brought out a dejected-looking BDR officer major Quamruzzaman after a while. Nearly 150 people, including women and children and some 20 BDR officers, have been freed from the headquarters until Thursday evening. Earlier, a top aide to the prime minister said all the rebellious BDR personnel surrendered and that the situation was under control. "The situation is under complete control of the government," the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters. "BDR members have completed arms surrender." Tanks and other military vehicles moved further up Satmasjid Road towards the main entrance to the BDR headquarters at 5:30pm as the standoff over rebel paramilitary troops lingered on to the second day. bdnews24.com correspondents said the armoured vehicles, which moved up from Dhanmondi Road 12A onto Satmasjid Road to the intersection of Road 15A, were each carrying five army personnel in black uniform. Tanks and army trucks had earlier taken position at Abahani sports field at Road 12A in the capital's Dhanmondi residential area. The tanks took position in and around the sports field, where convoys of army soldiers were also setting up a temporary camp, less than a kilometre from the main gate of the BDR Headquarters. At least eight armoured vehicles were seen moving up Road 27, around 4pm, closing in on the Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters in the heart of the city where hundreds of armed rebels were holding on. Army troops had been asking people by loudspeaker to move out of the areas around the sprawling BDR complex from early afternoon.
