 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government will only invite trouble if a regional anti-terror taskforce as proposed by Dhaka is formed, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami says. "Our police, BDR, RAB and army are enough to prevent terrorism in the country. If foreign troops are called inside the country it will amount to inviting trouble," party chief Matiur Rahman Nizami said on Friday at Institution of Engineers in the city. Nizami said the government had been impatient to sign "anti-people" agreements on transit facilities with, regional anti-terrorism taskforce, and Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the United States. "Such hasty move proves that they were put to power through a conspiracy only for signing such anti-people agreements," Nizami observed. Referring to Dec. 29 general election, the Jamaat chief said, "We welcomed the government for the sake of democracy. But [Awami League] has grown impatient to sign anti-people agreements immediate after forming government."
