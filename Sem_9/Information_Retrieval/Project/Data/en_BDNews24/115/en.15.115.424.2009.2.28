 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 72 army officers are still unaccounted-for since the bloody mutiny by renegade paramilitary BDR men began on Feb. 25, the army said Saturday. Bodies of 63, including women, have been recovered and 47 of them have been identified while 33 survived the rebellion, director of the Military Intelligence Department Brig Gen Mahmud Hossain told a briefing at the Army Headquarters. He said, "We were ready to take military measures and waiting only for orders. "Had the government ordered us we would have carried out military operations. But the prime minister ordered a political resolution to the crisis." Gen Hossain said the crisis was resolved politically though by then many lives had been lost. " I believe the real story will be unearthed after investigation." He said the army officers and Jawans are angry after the massacre of their colleagues but "being a disciplined force we can control our emotions". "If a proper investigation is run and if those who carried out the crime and who instigated it are given exemplary punishment, then, I believe, the officers and the Jawans will calm down," Gen Hossain said. The government and the army have launched separate enquiries and the perpetrators will be punished on their finds. " i believe not all of the BDR members were involved in the rebellion, only a handful were," he added. "Our demand is that the trial is held on an emergency basis. The guilty are handed down maximum punishment," the official said.
