<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) More than two hours after the home minister led an unarmed team of four into a battle-scarred territory occupied by armed BDR rebels, reports began trickling out from the paramilitary headquarters early Thursday morning that the mutineers had begun surrendering their guns. A top police official told bdnews24.com at around 2:30am that a section of the rebels had started handing in their weapons. The official spoke on condition of anonymity and did not say who the mutineers were surrendering to. Army troops had earlier pulled back from their positions around the BDR headquarters as the home minister, Sahara Khatun, drove into the besieged compound half an hour past midnight. Withdrawal of army units emerged as the key demand from the rebels after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, announced general amnesty during a two-hour meeting with a team of 14 BDR men. The 14, flanked by government negotiators state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak MP and whip Mirza Azam MP, were driven straight to the prime minister's official residence at Hare Road from the blood-stained BDR compound. They arrived at 3.40pm and spent more than two hours with the prime minister. They were also joined, among others, by army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed. The prime minister also told the 14 that she would meet their demandsno army in BDR command and better payin phases. On return to their headquarters, the 14, however, failed to get the message across to their fellow mutineers, who insisted on sending the army convoys back to their barracks. The home minister, at this stage, led a government team in nearly three hours of talks with the paramilitary mutineers at a hotel nearby. What transpired in the Ambala Inn talks could not be known, but the minister drove into the den of the armed rebels, believed to be in their hundreds, for further negotiations. The minister, accompanied by state minister for law Quamrul Islam and police chief Noor Mohammad, was driven in a privately-owned bullet-proof SUV of the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina. A fourth person, described by correspondents as an aide to Sahara Khatun, was also in the vehicle. As the minister entered the BDR premises, the army convoys pulled back by hundreds of metres, bdnews24.com correspondents on the spot said. Two ambulances were seen waiting near the main entrance when the SUV carrying the ministers went in. bdn
