 WASHINGTON, Wed Feb 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tornado killed eight people when it struck a small town in Oklahoma in central United States, a local official said Wednesday. The tornado, one of three to hit the state Tuesday night, cut a half-mile (0.8-km) swath through Lone Grove, halfway between Oklahoma City and Dallas, Texas, said Michelann Ooten of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. "Eight fatalities have been confirmed ... and 14 injured," Ooten told Reuters. Local media put the death toll as high as 15. Ooten said rescue operations would resume at daybreak. The two other tornadoes caused some damage, but no deaths or major injuries, she said. Lone Grove's population was put at 4,631 in the 2000 census, according to www.lonegroveoklahoma.com
