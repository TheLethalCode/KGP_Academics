 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  There was no official confirmation on the fate of BDR chief Major General Shakil Ahmed even after the end of the two-day mutiny late Thursday evening. But, Lt Col Kamruzzaman, one of the officers who had 'a brush with death', told private TV station ATN Bangla, " Sir died at the Darbar in the morning (Wednesday)." Widely believed to be one of the first casualties in the armed rebellion against army officers at BDR headquarters, the general has been blamed for letting the situation go out of hand. Major Zaman, one of the officers held hostage and freed on Thursday, said he believed over 100 officers died inside the BDR compound since the mutiny began at 9:30am the previous day. "But I have not seen Major General Shakil Ahmed since yesterday morning," he told reporters outside the BDR compound on his release. There was no update on Gen Shakil Ahmed from the authorities after the mutiny ended. His wife was also missing. Angry jawans set fire on his bungalow. An arrested border guard, one of 16 caught trying to escape the BDR compound on Thursday, said troops opened fire on the director general and deputy director general "after a heated altercation". "And then they killed BDR officers one by one in their offices," claimed Rakibul Hasan. Rakibul, however, could not say if the DG died on the spot or not. The body of the DDG Brig Gen Abdul Bari, however, was one of the six found in Kamrangirchar Thursday. Police said the bodies were possibly dumped Wednesday morning in a ditch-like canal ending in the Buriganga. A former major general, Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, said he would blame the mutiny on what he called "command failure". A former DG of BDR, Fazlur Rahman, echoed Ibrahim. bdnews24
