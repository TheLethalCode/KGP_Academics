 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) The Election Commission declared Zillur Rahman as president-elect on Wednesday. After resigning as an MP, Zillur is scheduled to take oath to the presidential office at the Darbar Hall of Bangabhaban at 7pm on Thursday. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda declared the 79-year-old veteran Awami League leader elected unopposed at 4:01pm at the EC Secretariat as no other nominees were put forward for the presidential election. The ruling party nominated Zillur, deputy leader of the house, for the titular head of state soon after assuming power in January. President-elect Zillur expressed his desire to work for the welfare of his countrymen, speaking on the eve of his oath taking. "I will work for the people neutrally, even though I will be away from active politics," the veteran Awami League leader told bdnews24.com on Wednesday at his Ivy Tower residence in Gulshan. The building was besieged by people from all walks along with party men congratulating Zillur will be the country's 19th president. Zillur, responding to their greetings and replying to a query, said: "I will do everything possible within my limited capability to safeguard democracy and people's welfare. "You know well that the president enjoys limited power. I will do my job as best I can within those limits." Known as a close companion of Awami League founder and independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, fondly referred to as Bangabandhu, Zillur said: "Bangabandhu always worked for people in changing their fate." "The country became independent under his leadership and we have got the acknowledgment as a nation on the world map." "The people have given us the scope to form government by giving our party overwhelming support. The new government under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Bangabandhu, has been working from the very first day to this end." Zillur determined to maintain neutrality in the presidential post. "I will work neutrally as a president and make no discrimination between the ruling and opposition parties.</TEXT>
