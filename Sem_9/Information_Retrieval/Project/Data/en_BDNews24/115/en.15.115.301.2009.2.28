 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Veteran politician Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan has demanded the "severest penalties" for those behind the BDR mutiny. "It is a most heinous, heart-rending and unprecedented incident in the history of our country. We must bring the instigators to justice," he said in a statement. He advised the government to form an all-party parliamentary committee alongside the government-formed probe team to look into the events. "The pride of our country, the armed forces, faced an irreparable loss which we have to overcome patiently." He said, "Certainly there is a plot behind this." The former BNP leader prayed for peace of the departed souls and expressed deep condolences to the bereaved families. Bhuiyan demanded the government provide free medical services to the wounded survivors. He called on the government to take all measures to avoid recurrence of such an incident in future. bdnew
