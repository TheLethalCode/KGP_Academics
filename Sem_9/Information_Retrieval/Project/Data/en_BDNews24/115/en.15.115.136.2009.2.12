 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  At least 100 knitwear workers and riot police were injured as they locked in violent clashes involving dozens of rounds of teargas and rubber bullets at a factory in Ashulia on Wednesday, said police. Angry employees of Kushiara Composite Knit Industries Ltd, demonstrating for outstanding wages, went on a rampage of several factories and damaged dozens of vehicles when police swooped on them, said witnesses. Police were forced to fire 59 rounds of teargas shells and more than 200 rubber bullets to bring the situation under control. Transportation came to a standstill during the four-hour disturbance from 2:30pm, stranding several thousand road users. "The workers were restive as the owners failed to keep their promise to pay their outstanding dues on Wednesday," Ashulia police station officer-in-charge Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com. "When the owners said their dues would not be paid until Feb. 18, the employees became violent," said Islam. "They were already upset about a production manager who had broken mobile phone sets belonging to some workers a few days back." The OC said police were called to the spot as the workers started rioting. "The situation was getting back to normal as the workers' leaders reached an agreement with the owners on payment of the dues on Thursday." "But problems erupted when a few workers suddenly pelted brickbats at the police. Soon the scene turned into a battlefield as employees of neighbouring factories joined them," said Islam. The furious workers damaged dozens of long-distance buses and also vehicles of other garment factories, said Islam who was also hurt in the violence. Some 30 policemen were among the more than 100 injured in the incident. Police and locals said the factory belongs to member of parliament Mahmud-us-Samad Chowdhury. Chowdhury could not be reached for comment. bdnews24.c
