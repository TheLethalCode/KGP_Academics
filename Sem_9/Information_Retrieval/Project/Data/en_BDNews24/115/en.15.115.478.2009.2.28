<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - Main opposition party BNP has called for the government to form an all-party probe committee on the BDR mutiny, said a statement issued by the party's highest policy-making body on Saturday night. The probe body should include members acceptable to the nation, said the statement signed by BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. It also suggested that representatives of the Armed Forces Division be included in the committee. It questioned the government's purpose in already forming a committee, headed by home minister Sahara Khatun "who had failed to protect the life and properties of the slain military officers and their families", according to the statement. "The nation was now in a dire predicament following the mutiny at BDR headquarters on Feb 25 and 26," it said. The situation had worsened "as the government showed its narrow-mindedness and took disputed steps", said the BNP in its statement. "It is clear that the government has totally failed to resolve the crisis," said the opposition party. The statement was issued around 10pm, after a meeting of the party's national standing committee. "The committee adopted a mourning motion in the meeting," Rizvi Ahmed told reporters emerging in the middle of the meeting that began shortly after 7pm. They also directed all leaders and activists of BNP and its front organisations to arrange prayer meetings, he added. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia chaired the meeting at her political office in Gulshan. bdnews24.com/
