 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion picked up 16 BDR men dressed in plain clothes Thursday, as they tried to escape over the wall from their Peelkhana compound, the site of a mutiny by armed rebel border guards. The RAB took them to a makeshift army camp at Abahani Sportsground. Of the arrestees, ten were arrested around 4:30pm, another six an hour later, assistant commanding officer in RAB-10, Kamal Hossain, told reporters. Hossain said they were guarding the headquarters to watch if anyone was escaping before a possible drive into the BDR headquarters. One of the arrestees, not wishing to be named, told reporters he was not involved with the mutiny. "I and other BDR personnel not involved in the mutiny were confined in a house on the BDR compound," he said. "We were able to escape as rebel BDR personnel left the house unguarded after noon," he said. bdnews24.co
