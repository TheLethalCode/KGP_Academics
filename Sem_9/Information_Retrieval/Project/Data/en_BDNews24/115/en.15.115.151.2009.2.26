 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  BDR second-in-command Brig Gen Abdul Bari was confirmed dead, after nine more bodies were found at the BDR headquarters half an hour after midnight Thursday, police said. The official toll for army officers stood at seventeen by midnight, with the new body count. The nine could not be identified immediately, assistant sub-inspector of Dhanmondi Police Station Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com. Six of the bodies were sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and then to Mitford Hospital for inquest. Another six bodies were recovered from a drainage ditch in Kamrangirchar near the Buriganga early Thursday, they said. "All six were found in BDR officer uniforms," Kamrangirchar officer-in-charge Mainuddin Khan told bdnews24.com. The bodies, recovered between 6am and 8am, were laid out for inquest and identification at Nawabganj Park until around 10am before being taken to Mitford Hospital for autopsy, he said. Brother-in-law Nero and ex-colleague Brig Gen (retd) Saber Ahmed identified the body of the BDR DDG. Wife Nusrat Jahan and brother-in-law Zia identified the body Col Abu Musa Ayub Kaiser Ahmed. Nephew Baktia Sumon identified Col Zahid Hossain. Brother Mahbubul Haider identified the body of Captain Mazharul Haider, son-in-law of IGP Noor Mohammad. Relative Dr Atiur Rahman identified the body Col Anisuzzaman, son of former cabinet secretary and former minister Mahbubuzzaman. One of the bodies remained unidentified, said Kamrangirchar OC Khan. "They were found this morning, in the same area as the two the day before," he said. The bodies of two senior officers were the first to be recovered Wednesday. They were apparently dumped in a drain behind the BDR compound and then floated up to Kamrangirchar, police said.
