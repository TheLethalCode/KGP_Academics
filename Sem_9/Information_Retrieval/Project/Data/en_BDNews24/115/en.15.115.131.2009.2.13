<TITLE> Q+A - Diplomacy and the Mumbai attacks investigation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD, Fri Feb 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistani government has said for the first time that last November's Mumbai attacks were launched and partly planned from Pakistan, and it was holding in custody a ringleader and five other suspects. The move was cautiously welcomed by India and comes after nearly three months of angry rhetoric between the two nations, which have gone to war three times since independence in 1947. WHAT'S NEXT? Pakistan has 30 questions for India over the investigations into the Mumbai attacks, so expect a lot of back-and-forth in coming months. Pakistan has also signalled there were connections to the attacks in other countries, such as Italy. This means that the probe will be widened, and therefore lengthened, with a global investigation. There are many questions that need answers. The Pakistani investigation seems to show the main people who organised the logistics of the operation have been caught. But there is a question about who gave them the go-ahead to launch such a devastating attack, and who trained the gunmen used to execute the plan. IS WAR BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN LESS LIKELY? Yes. A military response by India was never really on the cards because an escalation would hurt both nuclear-armed powers. But the angry rhetoric between them could now wane, opening up space for some confidence-building measures. WHY DID PAKISTAN ACT ON THE PROBE? Pakistan realised that the weight of international opinion was that the Mumbai attack had been carried out by Pakistani militants, and that denying it would have been damaging diplomatically beyond relations just with India. Pakistan is trying to build a relationship with a new U.S. administration. It is probably no coincidence its announcement came when U.S. envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke was in the region. IS PAKISTAN SERIOUS ABOUT THE PROBE, OR IS IT A WHITEWASH? The frank way in which Rehman Malik, adviser to the prime minister on the Interior Ministry, described the investigation, the arrests, and acknowledged that the attack was launched and at least partly planned from Pakistan represented a "seismic shift" in Pakistan's approach, according to an editorial in The News, a leading Pakistani daily. Indians are more sceptical. They fear Pakistan may just drag the investigation along, appeasing the United States just enough to ensure continuing aid from Washington. The mention of other countries being involved may also give Pakistan a "get out" clause by blaming other nations for slow investigations. Analysts also say it is hard to imagine Pakistani intelligence giving up their old Islamist militant contacts, if they can get away with making them lie low. So there remains the question of how sincere Pakistan will be in pushing for convictions and carrying out sentences. What does seem clear is that Pakistan's move was tactically smart, putting the onus on India days before Holbrooke arrives there. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE UNITED STATES? Holbrooke's remit is ending militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. But India is a crucial part of the regional jigsaw, with Islamabad fearful of New Delhi's influence in Afghanistan. So, if relations thaw between the two powers, that makes life a little easier for Holbrooke. Certainly, the last thing he needs is a Pakistan-India standoff to distract from his official task. Pakistan would be delighted if the United States tries to mediate in the Kashmir dispute as part of its regional strategy, but India fiercely opposes this idea. Holbrooke has his work cut out but, if American pressure was behind Pakistan's change of attitude, he does seem to have made a decent start. WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT Any thaw in relations could help the Congress Party-led government in the run-up to general elections in April or May. The Pakistan acknowledgement of involvement has been seen in India as proving that India's diplomatic pressure was working. But do not expect a real breakthrough until after the elections. If Pakistan is to make any further concessions to India, it would prefer to do so to a new government, not a lame duck one
