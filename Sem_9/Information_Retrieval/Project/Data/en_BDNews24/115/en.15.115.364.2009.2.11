 MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Wed Feb 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Low-cost carrier SpiceJet raised fares, with unsustainably low tariffs failing to spur demand as expected, and in line with hikes by peers, and the government on Wednesday said it was keeping watch to prevent cartelisation. SpiceJet increased ticket prices by 30-40 percent over the last 48 hours, spokesman Deepa Dey said over the telephone from Bangalore. Earlier, Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways said they had raised fares. Jet Airways late on Wednesday said it had introduced discount fares on certain domestic routes for early bookings. The revisions come less than two months after most Indian carriers cut fares on cooling fuel prices and to attract more passengers. "The kind of fares seen in January would have required each airline to have a load factor of over 100 percent for break-even," SpiceJet spokeswoman Deepa Dey said over the telephone from Bangalore in the morning. "Ministry is against any cartelisation among airlines. We will keep watch and take strict action in any such case," Aviation Minister Praful Patel said in a statement. Kingfisher declined to comment, while the other two firms were not immediately available to respond. Analysts had said in December, when airlines announced a round of price cuts to boost flagging traffic, that deep cuts would not be sustainable. The fare cuts have failed to boost traffic, Dey said. Kingfisher on Tuesday said it had eliminated the lower-end fares on flights that could "sustain higher revenue" and would focus on earning revenue and not increasing seat factors. A Jet spokeswoman said the firm had raised fares on some domestic routes, but did not quantify the hikes. "Jet Airways adjusts its fares on regular basis depending on market conditions. Recently fares have been adjusted on certain sectors and fare buckets," the spokeswoman said. "Full fare business and economy fares remain unchanged as well as the fuel surcharge," she said. State-run Air India has eliminated a 99-rupee concessional fare it earlier offered, a spokesman said
