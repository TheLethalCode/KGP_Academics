 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The parliament on Wednesday for the first time in its history formed two parliamentary standing committees on two ministries in the first session. Wednesday's sitting also formed three more parliamentary bodies. Besides, the positions of one member from the main opposition and one from the reserved women seats have been kept vacant in four out of the five committees formed. The five parliamentary committees are: Privileges Committee, Public Undertaking Committee, Estimate Committee, Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Finance. Chief whip Abdus Shahid proposed formation of the committees and the proposals were approved by voice vote in absence of the BNP-led opposition. Senior lawmaker Suranjit Sengupta was elected chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry. Other eight members of the 10-member committee are: Abdul Matin Khasru, Rahmat Ali, Fazle Rabbi Mia, Kamrul Islam, Nurul Islam Sujan, Fazle Noor Tapash and Ziaul Haq Mridha. AHM Mostofa Kamal has been elected chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry. The other eight members of the 10-member committee are: Abul Maal Abdul Muhit, Ali Ashraf, A K M Maidul Islam, Lutful Hye, Tajul Islam, Golam Dostogir Gazi and M A Mannan. Speaker Abdul Hamid has been elected chairman of the Privileges Committee. Other members of the 10-member committee are: Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, H M Ershad, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzaq, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Abdus Shahid. Mohiuddin Khan Alagmir has been elected chairman of the 10-member Public Undertaking Committee. The other eight members from the treasury bench are: TIM Fazle Rabbi Chowdhury, Khalidur Rahman Tito, Dhirendra Chandra Devnath, Biren Shikhder, Moinuddin Khan Badal, SKM Abu Baker and Bazlul Haq Harun. HN Ashiqur Rahman has been elected chairman of the 10-member Estimate committee. The other members from the treasury bench are: ABM Golam Mostofa, Sirajul Akbar, Hafiz Uddin Ahammad, Hafiz Ahmed Majumder, Mostofa Faruk Mohammad, Abdul Karim Khandaker and Fazle Hossain Badsha. In the previous parliaments, the treasury benches delayed for months formation of parliamentary standing committees on different ministries as there was no binding for the treasury bench to form watchdog bodies. The eighth parliament, which formed parliamentary standing committees 20 months after the first session, amended the Rules of Procedure, making a provision to constitute all parliamentary bodies within third sessions of a new parliament. The ruling Awami League before the elections pledged to form the standing committees "as soon as possible". bdn
