<TITLE> Karzai's rivals say early Afghan poll a mistake </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, Sun Mar 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bringing Afghan presidential elections forward from August to April as demanded by President Hamid Karzai will not give other candidates time to contest the campaign, rival presidential contenders said on Sunday. Karzai's call on Saturday for the poll to be held much sooner than almost anyone sees as practically possible was a deft maneuver, analysts say, to force opposition groups to let him stay in office after a May constitutional deadline. Karzai's decree puts the young Afghan democracy in uncharted constitutional territory and sets the president at odds with the election commission, which set August 20 as the date for polls, and his US backers who supported the commission's decision. The United States believes August would be a better time to hold elections in a secure environment, the State Department said. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the election date with Karzai on Saturday, the presidential palace said. US President Barack Obama has ordered 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan to try to secure the elections in August against the strong threat from Taliban insurgents. Bringing the polls forward would not give the troops time to arrive in the country. Other candidates would also be put at a disadvantage, said presidential contender Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. "All candidates and influential figures have been trying to get ready for the campaign in the month of August, but a sudden change to the decision and holding the elections in the month of April will create certain problems," he told Afghan television late on Saturday. Karzai's decree said the election should be held according to the constitution. That states the president's term ends on May 21 and new polls to elect his successor must be held between 30 and 60 days before that, giving April 21 as the last possible date. "It is possible that Karzai was trying to catch his opponents napping and stab them in the back," said parliamentarian Ramazan Bashardost who plans to run for the presidency on an anti-corruption platform. "Karzai won't get any votes either now or later," he said. Hafiz Mansur, the head of one of the two main opposition groups, said his party believed in the constitution but it should not be exploited to "create chaos, disorder and hold the elections unfairly," he told Afghan television. ILLEGITIMATE Opposition leaders had said Karzai's position would be illegitimate if he remained in office beyond May 21. Karzai's call for the election to be held before then may be designed to force his opponents to admit an early poll is impossible and allow him to remain in office beyond May. Karzai, unpopular due to his failure to bring security and tackle corruption, would then at least retain all the advantages of office such as access to state media and air transport as he enters the campaign. No other strong contender yet emerged. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) has said a spring election would be impossible because it would have to be organized during the harsh Afghan winter when many areas are inaccessible and people in those areas would be disenfranchised. The IEC said it had not yet received an official copy of the presidential decree and could not make a decision until it had. Top of the list of problems for early polls would be the Taliban insurgency raging across much of the south and east up to the fringes of the capital, Kabul. The extra troops Obama ordered to be deployed were meant to boost security by August. The Taliban called Afghans not to participate in the election "as this is an infidel system and Afghanistan is now a country occupied by foreigners," Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press. NATO said it was too early to comment on whether its 56,000-strong force in Afghanistan would be able to secure an election in the next three to seven weeks. Afghan security forces are to take the lead in providing security for the vote
