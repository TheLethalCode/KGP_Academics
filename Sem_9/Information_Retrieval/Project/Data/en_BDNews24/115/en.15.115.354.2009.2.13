 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Booklovers in their thousands thronged the Amar Ekushey Book Fair on Friday, the first day of spring, leaving the fair venue and surrounding choked with crowd. Dressed in colourful clothes, people of all ages, specially the young ones celebrating the 'Basanta Utsab' on the Dhaka University campus, went to the book fair at the Bangla Academy premises in the afternoon. The venue was so packed that many found it hard to snake through the crowd. Bookstall owners said the sale was not satisfactory, as people seemed to be less inclined to buy and those willing could not browse through the racks in peace. University Press Limited stall in-charge Abul Kashem Bhuiyan said huge crowd had negative impacts on sales. Ahsan Ullah of Ahmed Publishing House, however, said the sales were higher than the other weekend holidays. Public Relations department of the Bangla Academy said a total of 159 new books arrived on the day. Some organisations launched a signature campaign at the fair venue for war crimes trial, while there were two separate rallies - one for preventing repression against women and the other for Basanta Utsab. Writer Muhammed Zafar Iqbal launched a website, ekusheyboimela.com, at the venue. bdnew
