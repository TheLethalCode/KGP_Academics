<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed BDR chief has assured the public that all national borders were secure in the wake of mutiny by rebel border guards at their Dhaka headquarters. "All the country's borders are secure," Brig Gen Moinul Hossain told reporters Saturday. "I visited the BDR headquarters today for the first time since my appointment to have a look at the overall situation there," said the new director general, who is also a member of the probe committee formed to investigate the Feb 25-26 armed uprising at the Peelkhana complex. He was appointed DG Friday as his predecessor Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed was confirmed dead, among 70 officers' bodies found up to Saturday afternoon, slain by rebel BDR men. A 10-strong high-powered committee began investigations into the mutiny Saturday. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who heads the committee, said they were planning to submit a report within seven days. Asked about the investigation, the new BDR chief said: "We will interrogate those suspected of carrying out the mutiny, and question those who have suffered its losses." "We will also interview the residents of Peelkhana's surrounding areas." Measures were being taken to restore discipline and morale among the rebellion-hit ranks, said Gen Moinul. "It'll take time. But we are working on it," said the director general after a first meeting of the probe body. "Today was the first meeting of the committee. We'll meet again to decide our next course of action," he added. On how many personnel were inside the headquarters, he said those who did not flee were inside. "But I cannot say their number at the moment." "And those who had fled have been asked to return." "We'll also interrogate those members who were caught escaping and have been detained," he said. bdnews
