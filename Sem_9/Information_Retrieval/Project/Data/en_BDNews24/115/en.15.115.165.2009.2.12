 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The US ambassador on Thursday welcomed the prime minister's announcement that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. Ambassador James F Moriarty said all the extrajudicial killings should be probed properly. "I think all extrajudicial killings need to be investigated in a transparent and accountable fashion, absolutely," he told bdnews24.com on Thursday He went to the office of Odhikar, an NGO working on human rights, to hand over US State Department's 2008 Freedom Defender Award. "And I was glad to hear the prime minister herself brought it up," the US envoy said. Odhikar was selected by the US government as a runner-up for the award. The US ambassador observed that an elected government could protect human rights better than an unelected government. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday told the parliament that her government would investigate all the incidents of extrajudicial killings that had taken place during the caretaker regime. According to Odhikar, 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in the name of so-called "crossfire". "Any government must make a fundamental commitment to protect its citizens. The citizens have a fundamental right to hold any government for not doing that. That is why, the bodies like Odhikar is so important," Moriarty said. The US State Department relies heavily on Odhikar for preparing its state of human rights report. The Bangladesh chapter of the US state department's human rights report 2007 was mainly taken from Odhikar.
