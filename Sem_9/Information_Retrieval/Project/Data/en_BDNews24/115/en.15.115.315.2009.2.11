<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bowlers, as in the Abahani-Gazi Tank match, dominated the Wednesdays other two matches of the Premier Cricket League, with Mohammedan Sporting Club and Biman Bangladesh Airlines winning their games. Left-arm pacer Sajedul Islam struck a hattrick and took two wickets, as title contenders Mohammedan, who had tied against Young Pegasus in their first match, handed an emphatic eight-wicket defeat to Partex Sporting Club at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. A five-for from pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin guided Biman to a convincing six-wicket win over Young Pegasus at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishthan ground. MSC vs Partex Opting to bat first, Partex fell in deep trouble losing three batsmen in as many deliveries by pacer Sajedul, who finally returned five for 15 in 7 overs. The left-handed pacer first removed opener Wasiur Rahman (10) in his very fourth delivery and then dismissed one-down Musfiqur Rahim (0) and Tariq Ahmed (0) to complete his hattrick. Partex were reeling at nine for three in two overs and never recovered the damage. Strike pacer Tareq Aziz Khan wrecked the middle order to return two for 26 and Sajedul removed tail-enders batsmen Rezaul Haq (8) and Ariful Haq (1) to reduce Partex to 68 for eight. Skipper and left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo (2/10) cleaned up tail to wrap Partex up for 87 in 26.3 overs. Mohammedan, in reply, reached 89 for two in 26.2 overs with opener Nasiruddin Faruque and Pankaj Joshi remaining unbeaten on 45 and 21 respectively. They together put on 59 runs for the unbroken third wicket after opener Shamsur Rahman Shuvo (13) and one-down Nadimuddin Mintu (6) returned cheaply. Biman vs Partex Put in to bat first, Young Pegasus were 166 all out in 47.5 overs as pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin grabbed five wickets for 21 while Shahadat Hossain, Neaz Morshed and Nabil Samad took one wicket apiece. Robin ran through the top order before Ruvin Pieres topscored with 52 off 89 balls. M Jubaer made 40 off 53 balls to get Partex bowlers something to try to defend. In reply, Biman lost opener Javed Omar (4) to be reduced to six for one before opener Nazmus Sadat (16) edged Zakaria Islam to wicketkeeper Rahat Sadek to leave the national flag carrier at 38 for two in 7.5 overs. Jahurul Islam and Shakib Al Hasan rescued their side, putting on 64 runs for the third wicket. Ruhul Amin dismissed Shakib who hit five boundaries for his 41 off 40 balls. The one-down batsman then paired with Indian recruit Rahul Dev to take Biman to 164 for four before Rahul fell to Iftikhar Naeem for 14. Jahurul, however, finally remained unbeaten on 74 off 103 balls with seven fours and one six to propel Biman to 168 for four in 39.4 overs, their second win in as many matches
