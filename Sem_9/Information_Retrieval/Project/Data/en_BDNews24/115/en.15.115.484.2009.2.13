 MANILA, Fri Feb 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen abducted a Sri Lankan aid worker from his house on a remote southern Philippine island before dawn on Friday, military officials said. The gunmen ransacked the home of Umar Jaleel, a member of the Nonviolent Peaceforce (NP), in Lamitan town on Basilan island before they dragged him out, navy commander Alexander Pama said. "They fled on foot towards the interior of the island," Pama told Reuters, adding about nine men wearing camouflage uniforms, most of them teenagers, fired warning shots in the air while escaping to scare people who might attempt to intervene. Pama said the kidnappers initially took the Sri Lankan and a man hired to guard the aid agency's dormitory, but in the ensuing confusion the Filipino managed to escape. In a statement posted on its website, www.monviolentpeaceforce.org, the Belgium-based agency appealed to Jaleel's captors "to release him unharmed as quickly as possible". "Nonviolent Peaceforce does not pay ransom and requests all parties concerned to seek a nonviolent return," the agency said. "The motive for his abduction is not known, nor it the affiliation, if any, or identity of his captors." The Nonviolent Peaceforce, which has had a presence in conflict areas in the southern Philippines since 2007, assured Jaleel's family it was "doing all it can to ensure his safe return" and promised to keep them up to date on developments in the southern Philippines. The incident is the latest in a rash of kidnappings in Basilan, one of the areas in the south where Muslim militants are fighting for a separate homeland. Three teachers, a nine-year-old boy and an employee of a money lending company in Basilan have been held captive for the past two weeks. Muslim rebels are also holding three workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and a Chinese trader in nearby Jolo
