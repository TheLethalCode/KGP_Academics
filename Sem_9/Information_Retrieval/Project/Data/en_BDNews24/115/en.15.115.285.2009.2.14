 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim's maid apparently jumped to her death from the roof of his five-storey building at Banani in the city Saturday, police said. Asma, 17, fell off the roof of the building at around 12 noon where she had gone to do laundry, officer in charge of Gulshan Police Station Mir Rezaul Hossain told bdnews24.com, quoting the family. She was taken to a local clinic and later moved to Dhaka Medical College Hospital after her condition worsened. She died there, he added. Sheikh Selim was talking to people from his Gopalganj electoral constituency on the ground floor at the time, Hossain said. Police found signs of laundry on the roof. "The railings of the roof are quite high. There is no chance of an accidental fall from the roof," Hossain said, pointing to the possibilities of suicide. He added that the relatives of the maid did not make any complaint at the scene of the incident. bdnew
