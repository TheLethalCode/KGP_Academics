 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (IBCCI) has asked for direct rail service for good imports from India, increase in internal rail service and improvement of road communication with the country. A team of representatives from the IBCCI, led by president Abdul Matlub Ahmed, met communications minister Syed Abul Hossain to raise the issues. The minister said negligence in the past left the rail department in the lurch. "That is the reason why we have sought assistance from the donors to develop this department." "The donors have also promised to help us out," he added. "The government will also take initiatives to use the experience of the Indian government in the development of railway and, if necessary, we shall contact the rail minister of India and seek help," Abul Hossain added. The IBCCI president also suggested Bangladesh trade fairs at various Indian states and separate export processing zones for exporting goods to India
