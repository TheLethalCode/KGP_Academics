 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com chief reporter Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  President-designate Zillur Rahman expressed his desire to work neutrally for the welfare of his countrymen, on the eve of his oath taking as the country's 19th president. "I will work for the people neutrally, even though I will be away from active politics," the veteran Awami League leader told bdnews24.com on Wednesday at his Ivy Tower residence in Gulshan. The building was besieged by people from all walks along with party men congratulating Zillur, who is set to take oath as the country's 19th president at a Darbar Hall ceremony on Thursday evening. Zillur, responding to their greetings and replying to a query, said: "I will do everything possible within my limited capability for safeguarding democracy and people's welfare. You know well that the president enjoys limited power. I will do my job as best I can within those limits." Known as a close companion of Awami League founder and independence architect Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Zillur said: "Bangabandhu always worked for people in changing their fate." "The country became independent under his leadership and we have got the acknowledgement as a nation in the world map." "The people have given us the scope to form government by giving our party overwhelming support. The new government under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Bangabandhu has been working from the very first day to this end." Zillur determined to maintain neutrality in the presidential post. "I will work neutrally as a president and make no discrimination between the ruling and opposition parties."</TEXT>
