 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman H M Ershad, who insisted on becoming president himself, says he is happy to see senior Awami League parliamentarian Zillur Rahman become president. "I am happy that Zillur Rahman is president. He is a sacrificing leader. He's sacrificed a lot for the party. That's why he deserves presidency," the former president told reporters Thursday at the lobby of the Darbar Hall of the Bangabhaban where Zillur took oath. Ershad has changed stance several times before and after the Dec. 29 elections on his desire to be president. He made vociferous claims to the presidency in the lead-up to general election. After the election, Ershad claimed he had no wish to give up his party and its chairmanship to be president. On Jan 11, just days after AL nominated Zillur for the presidential election, Ershad told his home constituency in Rangpur: "If I am made president then JP will disintegrate and I will not be able to work for the country." Ershad also praised prime minister Sheikh Hasina's presidential pick, and said he would rather accept the position of deputy leader of the parliament. Just two days later, on Jan. 13, he again told a meeting in Kurigram he would like to be president 'one more time'. Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury was appointed deputy leader of the parliamentat a meeting on Thursday. bdnews24.com/
