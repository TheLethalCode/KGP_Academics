<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Paceman Robiul Islam Shiplu snared six scalps to propel star-studded Gazi Tank Cricketers to victory by as many wickets over holders Abahani Limited in their second-round match in the Premier Division Cricket League on Wednesday. Newcomers Gazi Tank, who had also defeated Abahani in the T20 semifinal, raced to 106 for four in 22 overs in reply to Abahani's paltry 105 all out in 24.3 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Put in to bat first, Abahani got off to a fine start with 6.6 runs a over in the first five overs before the Abahani batsmen succumbed to probing bowling from Robibul, who rattled the top and middle orders to return six for 36 in his eight-over spell. Robibul broke the opening stand, trapping Tamim Iqbal leg before for six in his third over, although the left-handed opener, who struck 98 in the first match, seemed unhappy with the umpire's decision. The national team's opener also expressed his dissatisfaction outside the field. The right-handed pacer then removed the first match's centurion Rony Talukdar, caught by Enamul Haq Junior to leave Abahani at 43 for two in 6.3 overs. Rony looked confident having struck five boundaries in his 22-ball 30-run knock, but his departure triggered a collapse and Abahani slipped to 68 for seven in 10.4 overs. Robibul had Nasir Hossain caught by M Mithun for a three-ball duck and Rubel Hossain trapped Mumbai-based Indian Amol Muzumdar leg before for a first-ball duck, leaving Abahani wobbling at 44 for four in 7.2 overs. Afterwards, Robibul dismissed Nadif Chowdhury (1), one-down Shahagir Hossain (15) and Arafat Sunny (4) in a row. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior (2/11) and Mohammad Ashraful (1/8) shared the remaining three wickets to wrap Abahani up for 105, a stark contrast to their first-match innings total of 320 for four. Rezaul Karim made a patient 21 off 52 balls to take Abahani beyond the 100-mark. Abahani never appeared confident of defending the total as Talha Jubair dropped two catches off openers Imrul Kayes (14) and M Mithun (26), who together made 40 runs. Abahani captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, however, sent back Imrul in the fifth over before second-change bowler Ziaur Rahman dismissed Mohammad Anwar for 8. Later, Ziaur removed Nayeem Islam while Mashrafee trapped Mithun leg before to reduce Gazi Tank to 57 for four in 14.3 overs. But, Ashraful along with Indian recruit Pravanjan Mullick eased the pressure to steer Gazi Tank home, denying further damage. Ashraful struck a lovely 28-ball 36 studded with eight fours while Mullick was not out on 11 off 24 balls. The national team captain gave credit to the man-of-the-match Robibul although he said Abahani batsmen played rush strokes. "They (Abahani) started well, but Robibul swung the ball nicely to wreck their top and middle orders as he was getting fine out-swing after the first three overs," said the Gazi Tank captain after the match. Abahani coach Sarwar Imran blamed the rashness of his batsmen for the debacle
