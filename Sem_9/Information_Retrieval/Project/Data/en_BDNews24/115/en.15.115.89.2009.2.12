 Chittagong, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of a readymade garment factory put up a three-hour road blockade in the port city demanding payment of outstanding wages on Thursday. Khulshi police officer-in-charge Enayet Kabir told bdnews24.com, "The blockade that created heavy traffic congestion, was lifted at 3:30pm on assurance by the owners of the Golden Horizon factory, a concern of Sunman Group." "The owners have already started paying the wages," said the OC. BGMEA Chittagong chapter secretary Moyeenuddin told bdnews24.com, "Pay day is usually the 11th or 12th day of every month but the workers got agitated as they were told this time that they would get paid on the 17th."
