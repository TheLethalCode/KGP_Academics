 LONDON, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Premier League ahead of this weekend's matches (all times GMT): Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard could return to the starting lineup for Saturday's trip to Middlesbrough (1500), but striker Fernando Torres is a doubt after sustaining an ankle injury against Real Madrid on Wednesday. Middlesbrough striker Jeremie Aliadiere could play for the first time this year, but defender Chris Riggott (knee) and midfielder Didier Digard (thigh) are injured. Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby will miss Saturday's match at home to Fulham (1500) after injuring his calf in the Champions League match against AS Roma on Tuesday. Manager Arsene Wenger is also without six other injured first-team players, including Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Adebayor. Everton's Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta is ruled out for the season with cruciate ligament damage, but Tim Cahill, their main goal threat in recent weeks, and defender Tony Hibbert return from suspension for Saturday's home match with West Bromwich Albion (1245). Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho is available for Saturday's visit of Wigan Athletic (1500), but his fellow Portuguese international Jose Bosingwa is suspended. Wigan midfielders Antonio Valencia and Daniel de Ridder are both injured and Ben Watson is suspended after picking up five yellow cards this season. Newcastle United midfielder Kevin Nolan begins a three-match suspension and therefore misses a return to former club Bolton Wanderers on Sunday (1300). Forward trio Alan Smith, Mark Viduka and Obafemi Martins are all available for selection, but Michael Owen (ankle) remains injured. Manchester City winger Shaun Wright-Phillips is suspended for Sunday's trip to West Ham United (1230). Stoke City midfield duo Rory Delap and Matthew Etherington are still suspended for Sunday's match at Aston Villa (1500)
