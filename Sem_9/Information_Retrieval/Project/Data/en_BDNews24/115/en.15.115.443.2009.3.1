 Seoul, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president told the destitute North on Sunday to abandon its plans to develop weapons of mass destruction and return to talks with its capitalist neighbour. Secretive North Korea has stoked regional tensions in the past weeks by readying a test-flight of its longest-range missile, which is designed to carry a nuclear weapon as far as Alaska but has never successfully flown, U.S. and South Korean officials have said. "Of all the countries in the world, South Korea cares most about the lives and happiness of the North Korean people. What protects North Korea are not nuclear weapons and missiles, but cooperation with the South and the international community," President Lee Myung-bak said. "Denuclearisation is a short-cut for North Korea that allows it to grow into a member of the international community," Lee said in a speech to mark an uprising against the 1910-1945 Japanese colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula. Analysts said the North was using brinkmanship to pressure the new U.S. government and its main allies in the region, South Korea and Japan, to reverse tough policies against the North. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Asia in February, warned North Korea against any provocative moves. North Korea has cut off dialogue with the South and threatened to reduce its rich neighbour to ashes in anger at Lee's policy of cutting off what once had been a free flow of unconditional aid and instead tying handouts to the North's disarmament. Lee repeated an often made call for the North to return to talks, while Pyongyang at the weekend labelled Lee a U.S. sycophant pushing the peninsula to the brink of war. North Korea has said it was preparing to launch a satellite and it had the right to do so as part of a peaceful space programme. South Korean officials have said a launch would be met with sanctions and they do not see any difference between a missile or satellite launch because they use the same technology and the same rocket. North Korea, which conducted a nuclear test in October 2006, does not have the technology to miniaturise a nuclear weapon to mount as a weapon, experts have said. The reclusive state has also dragged down an international nuclear disarmament-for-aid deal by refusing to agree to a system to check claims it made about its nuclear programme. Pyongyang has complained aid has not been delivered as promised.
