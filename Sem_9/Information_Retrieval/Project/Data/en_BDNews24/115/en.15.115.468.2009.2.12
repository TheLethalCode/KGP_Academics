<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  IMF director for Asia and Pacific region Anoop Singh has said Bangladesh is still insulated from the ongoing global economic recession. Singh, who arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday, met with finance minister AMA Muhith and finance and planning adviser Moshiur Rahman Thursday morning. Muhith told reporters after the meeting, "We talked about different aspects of our economy and told the IMF that our economy was in a better position than that of many other Asian countries." Singh agreed, saying since Bangladesh is not elaborately linked to the global economy, the impact of the ongoing economic slump will be minimal. The IMF official also said the capital account of Bangladesh was well protected. He observed Bangladesh's ready made garments, the chief source of export income, was in a better position than other's. There will not be too much of a negative impact on GDP, Singh told reporters. But the finance minister said the effect of the global economic recession may be felt in the 2009-10 fiscal year. In the first week of the next month, a meeting will be held with representatives from all sectors to discuss ways to counter the negative impact of the global recession, Muhith added. He also said measures would be adopted to ensure that the flow of foreign remittance was not adversely affected. Finance secretary Mohammad Tareq, adviser to the IMF for the Asia-Pacific region Masato Miyazaki and IMF country head Jonathan Dunn were also present at Thursday's meeting. The IMF slashed its 2009 forecast for global growth at the start of February to just 0.5 percent, the weakest year since World War Two, from a November estimate of 2.2 percent. Finance minister Muhith at the time reassured businesses and the public that in spite of IMF's gloomy global prediction Bangladesh's economy still remained 'insulated' from the world recession. But Muhith has also warned in recent days that the recession may be finally having an impact on the local export trade, and that a taskforce was being formed soon to counter the fallout. bdnews24.com
