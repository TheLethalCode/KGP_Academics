<TITLE> Asif gets one-year doping ban from India league </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI/KARACHI, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif received a one-year ban for doping from an Indian Twenty20 league on Wednesday and is considering appealing the suspension. "I don't know if I am allowed to appeal the ban. Once the picture is clear my intention is to challenge the ban," Asif told Reuters in Karachi. Asif was initially suspended last May after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone in the inaugural edition of the league. The 26-year-old maintained he had never intentionally used drugs. "I'm relieved that the drugs inquiry tribunal has finally given its decision. Since last year I have been under a lot of pressure," Asif told Reuters. "I want to play for Pakistan and be cleared of this doping charge because I have never used banned substances intentionally." LEGAL OPTIONS Asif said he was in touch with his legal advisor and would take a decision on challenging the ban soon. "We will explore all legal ways to see if we can challenge this ban. In the meantime, I will carry on training to keep myself fit for a return to the national team this year." Organisers of the Twenty20 league said the ban would be retroactively imposed from Sept. 22 last year. "Mohammad Asif was found guilty... in as much as a prohibited substance namely nandrolone was found in the urine sample extracted from the player during the support period and the match played on May 30, 2008," they said in a statement in Mumbai. "The year's ineligibility for Mohammad Asif will be from Sept. 22 2008, as that was the date when the league had imposed the suspension order, post which the cricketer has not been allowed to play any match." Both Asif's urine samples showed traces of the banned substance above the permissible limit. Asif, who was also banned by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) following the positive test, quit the league a week before his appeal against the charges last month. PCB Chairman Ejaz Butt told a news conference in Karachi Asif would be eligible for selection when the ban ended. "Once the ban is over we will consider him and also think about giving him a central contract," he said. Asif, who has played 11 tests and 31 one-day internationals since his Pakistan debut in early 2005, was also detained for 19 days in Dubai last June after customs officials found opium in his wallet. Butt said no case was registered against Asif in Dubai. "But we are also waiting for the findings of our internal committee, which is probing his detention in Dubai," said Butt. "Once the committee gives its findings at the end of this month, we will decide if he is to be punished or cleared." The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it expected all member boards to enforce Asif's ban. Asif also tested positive for nandrolone in 2006 and was initially banned for a year by the PCB but the suspension was overturned by the board's anti-doping appeals committee.
