 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)Another massive dropout rate of 42 percent is seen countrywide this year ahead of the SSC and equivalent exams, due to begin on Sunday, with the Sylhet Board suffering the highest dropout rate of 57 percent. "There is no doubt that many students are still dropping out because of social and economic factors," said Prof Mohammad Shamsul Huq, new chairman of the Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board of Dhaka. The dropout rate has fallen this year, however; last year the countrywide dropout rate was 48.15 percent. Over 12.67 lakh students registered for the 2009 secondary school certificate and equivalent exams out of eight education boards, one madrasa and one technical board across the country, but 5.34 lakh students have failed to submit entry forms for the exams. The dropout rate is 46.98 percent for girls and 37.11 percent for boys this year. Prof Huq held early marriages responsible for female dropouts, and economic pressures for male dropouts. "Many girls are married off in our country before SSC exams, and are unable to pursue their studies," he told bdnews24.com. "In the case of boys, it is seen that many guardians give them education to some extent but then engage them in earning money. In that case they lose interest in education or no longer have the time or opportunity," said Huq. According to the education ministry, some 12,67,634 class IX students registered during the 2007-8 education year for this year's SSC, Dakhil and SSC Vocational (technical) exams of the ten education boards. The dropout rate under the Sylhet Board is highest this year at 57.25 percent. Rajshahi Board has the lowest rate at 32.76 percent. Dhaka Board sees a 44.19 percent dropout rate, Comilla Board 50.79 percent, Jessore 43.01 percent, Chittagong 45.35 percent, Barisal 43.11 percent, Dinajpur 33.15 percent. The Madrasa Board (Dakhil) sees a 33.62 percent dropout rate, and the Technical Board (SSC Vocational) 54.32 percent. A total of 10.63 lakh students from 26,239 educational institutions across the country are appearing for the SSC and equivalent examinations, 7.33 lakh regular candidates and 3.3 lakh irregular candidates. Of the ten boards, SSC candidates stand at 8.01 lakh, Dakhil candidates at 1.87 lakh and SSC Vocational at 75,057. bdnew
