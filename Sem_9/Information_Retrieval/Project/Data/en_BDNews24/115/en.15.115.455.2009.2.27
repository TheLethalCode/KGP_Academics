 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com) Home Minister Sahara Khatun said Friday she would personally supervise the rescue work being done with the help of the armed forces. Minutes after her statement that the army units had gone inside at the instruction of the prime minister, navy divers arrived at the BDR headquarters. Meanwhile, an army major at the BDR gate claimed there were "36 live grenades" at the guard room as the minister, flanked by army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed, stood just feet away to brief the media moments earlier. Major Imran said he counted the grenades and showed some live bullets after the minister departed and went inside again. "I shall be around and see for myself the work being done," said the minister, who had promised Thursday to the BDR rebels that army units would not be allowed inside the BDR complex. Sahara Khatun, at the BDR main gate, told reporters at 12:38pm, nearly one and a half hours after the armoured vehicles and the troops went in, that the army units had gone inside to help with the rescue and recovery work. "Please do not distort my statements. Report accurately what I have said," the minister said, speaking to the media. "I had said yesterday that the army would not (be allowed to) come here. But today, with permission of the prime minister, they have been allowed in, to support the rescue work," the minister said. "Rumours are being spread. Do not heed to propaganda," the minister said. Earlier, army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed arrived at the BDR headquarters at 12:10pm, 25 minutes after the home minister had entered the complex. Home minister Sahara Khatun drove into BDR headquarters nearly 40 minutes after the army units took positions inside the complex in the morning. A white four-wheeler carrying the minister arrived at the main entrance to the complex at 11:44am, bdnews24.com staff correspondent Prodip Chowdhury at the gate said. The correspondent saw six APCs, 20 armoured vehicles roll through the main entrance of the paramilitary headquarters at 10:57am.
