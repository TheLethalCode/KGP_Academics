<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP vice chairperson MK Anwar Friday called for a high-powered commission mandated to publish White Papers on the corruption of all governments since independence. "The announcement made by the prime minister on [the necessity of the publication of] White Papers on corruption committed during the past four-party and caretaker governments only indicates that the Awami League government intends to persecute a particular political party," Anwar told reporters at his Elephant Road residence. "Publication of White Papers to curb graft did not work in the past. The caretaker government too harassed the politicians when they failed to cut corruption." "So one must be careful about not letting the campaign serve as a tool for persecuting a party or particular group or community. BNP would really like to see the country free of corruption." The former minister said if a high-powered committee was formed to probe activities of all the corrupt regimes that the nation had seen since independence, everything would be transparent to the people. He also said his party was eager to join the parliament deliberations. "BNP will go to the parliament as soon as the row over seats is resolved. We are against parliament boycott. Though what the prime minister said about the seat arrangements saddened us, we are waiting for them to tell us what they would like to offer and we'll join the parliament." He said in the previous parliament Awami League was given eight seats in the first row and not six. He added that prime minister Sheikh Hasina did not tell the whole truth. On a query while congratulating the new president, Anwar said, "We hope the new president will be ably restoring befitting glory associated with his supreme position. Personally speaking, as university students, Zillur Rahman and I were residents of the same hall." bd
