 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - Main opposition BNP has congratulated veteran Awami League leader Zillur Rahman on his being elected president. "We congratulate him," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on a question Wednesday evening. "Mr Zillur has already said that he would work in line with the law and the constitution. We'll be waiting to see [the reflection of his remark]," Delwar said. Known as a close companion of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 79-year-old Zillur is set to take oath as the country's 19th president on Feb. 12. Delwar reiterated BNP's position against the government's proposed South Asian anti-terrorism taskforce, saying, "Such a taskforce is unnecessary for the country". "If the taskforce is formed, it will give rise to multifaceted terrorist activities inside the country that may hamper the country's stability and independence," he remarked. Claiming that the former BNP-led alliance government had taken measures to prevent militancy in the country, Delwar said BNP thought militancy was no more there. "And to do that Bangladesh did not have to seek to foreign assistance, rather police, RAB, BDR and the armed forces have played an exemplary role in preventing militancy," Delwar said. He alleged that the government, instead of keeping confidence in the country's security agencies, was making ways for foreign forces to work inside Bangladesh in the name of establishing peace. Delwar said the people were in the dark about the proposed taskforce and urged them to be on guard against government's "anti-people" activities. Referring to the comment of an Indian journalist at a Bangladesh-India joint press conference earlier this week that Bangladesh was being used by Pakistan to perpetrate anti-India activities, Delwar said, "It is sad that the 'puppet' foreign minister of a puppet government could not protest the comment." bd
