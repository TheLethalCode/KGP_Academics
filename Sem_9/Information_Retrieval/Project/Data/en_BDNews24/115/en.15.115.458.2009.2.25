 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)The curtain was about to fall on a long day's drama as BDR mutineers began giving up their guns and hostages early Thursday after a bold move by Bangladesh's first woman home minister to drive straight into the rebels' den. Sahara Khatun watched as the rebel border guards began handing in their guns. The minister with no security also led hostages out of their homes in the residential blocks of the sprawling Bangladesh Rifles complex in downtown Dhaka. The news began trickling out more than two hours after the home minister led an unarmed team of four into a battle-scarred territory occupied by the heavily-armed rebels. A top police official told bdnews24.com at around 2:30am that a section of the rebels had started surrendering their weapons. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. A member of the BTV crew called in by the BDR men told bdnews24.com at 3:15am that he had seen guns being put down. "They surrendered their weapons in presence of the home minister," said Rafiqul Islam, a BTV cameraman, speaking to bdnews24.com correspondent Golam Mortuza by phone. "Sahara Khatun then went into the homes of BDR officers and got their families out," the BTV man said after leaving the compound that had plunged into complete chaos after the 9:30am Darbar called by the BDR chief, now believed killed by his own troops. There was still no confirmation whether major general Shakil Ahmed was alive after reports through the day of his death. bdnews24.com correspondent Sumon Mahbub, standing outside the main entrance to the headquarters, saw a "requisitioned" police bus enter the compound at 3:26am. The bus was greeted with gunfirefirst with a single shot and then a burst of fireostensibly because it was being followed by three RAB vehicles. The shots diverted the three RAB microbuses with tinted windows, which were about to enter the compound, towards Rifles Square, the BDR-owned shopping centre right next to the main entrance. Mahbub said he believed the bus would be used to ferry the hostages out. Army troops had earlier pulled back from their positions around the BDR headquarters as the home minister drove into the besieged compound half an hour past midnight. Withdrawal of army units emerged as the key demand from the rebels after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, announced general amnesty during a meeting with a team of 14 BDR men. The 14, flanked by government negotiators state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak MP and whip Mirza Azam MP, were driven straight to the prime minister's official residence at Hare Road from the blood-stained BDR compound. They arrived at 3.40pm and spent more than two hours with the prime minister. They were also joined, among others, by army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed. The prime minister also told the 14 that she would meet their demandsno army in BDR command and better payin phases. On return to their headquarters, however, the BDR men failed to get the message across to their fellow rebels, who insisted on sending the army convoys back to their barracks. The home minister, at this stage, led a government team in nearly three hours of talks with mutineers at a hotel near the BDR compound. What transpired in the Ambala Inn talks could not be known, but the minister drove into the den of the armed rebels, believed to be in their hundreds, for further negotiations. The minister, accompanied by state minister for law Quamrul Islam and police chief Noor Mohammad, was driven in a privately-owned bullet-proof SUV of the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina. A fourth person, described by correspondents as an aide to Sahara Khatun, was also in the vehicle. As the minister entered the BDR premises, the army convoys pulled back by hundreds of metres, bdnews24.com correspondents on the spot said. Two ambulances were seen waiting near the main entrance when the SUV carrying the ministers went in. bdn
