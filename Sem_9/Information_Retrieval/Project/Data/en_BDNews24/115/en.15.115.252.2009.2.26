 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Members of parliament called for a statement from the home minister on the armed rebellion by BDR soldiers against their officers on Wednesday. "The whole country is anxious. The prime minister and the home minister are trying to thrash out an acceptable solution to the problem," deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury told parliament as opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque demanded a statement from the home minister on the incident. "I have come to know a little while ago that the negotiations have been successful," Sajeda said in her first statement after being elected deputy leader of the House. "Our home minister will inform the nation about it," said Sajeda. Zainul Abdin Farroque and Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury initiated the unscheduled discussion over the BDR revolt. Farroque said the BNP MPs submitted notices to suspend all activities of the House and discuss the BDR incidents. "An unwanted incident is still going on in Peelkhana. The whole nation is anxious about it." "We hoped that the home minister would issue a statement on the issue. But both the prime minister and the home minister are absent from the House," said Farroque. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had been involved in tense negotiations with representatives of BDR rebels through the day, while home minister Sahara Khatun had entered the BDR compound in the early hours of Thursday morning after hours of talks with the mutinous border guards. Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was presiding over the session, "hoped" the government would give a statement in parliament soon. Chief whip Abdus Shahid tried to issue a statement on the incident but deputy speaker Shawkat Ali stopped him as the minister was the person to issue statement according to parliamentary practices. "I am really sorry that parliamentary conventions have been broken today. "This is not the duty of the chief whip to issue statement on such issue," said Rashed Khan Menon MP of the Awami League-led alliance. Senior Awami League MP Tofail Ahmed said, "I hope a statement from the government will be issued in parliament soon". bdnews
