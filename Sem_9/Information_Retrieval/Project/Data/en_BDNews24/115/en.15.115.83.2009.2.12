<TITLE> US seen naming Bosworth as North Korea nuclear envoy </TITLE>

 Washington, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stephen Bosworth, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, is expected to be named as the U.S. envoy to six-party talks on curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The sources spoke on condition they not be identified, noting that the selection of the envoy was a sensitive matter before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China next week. Reached at home, Bosworth declined to comment on whether he may be named the six-party envoy. A State Department spokesman also declined comment on the matter. Near the top of Clinton's agenda will be discussing how to approach North Korea, which committed in 2005 to abandon its nuclear programs under a six-party deal struck in talks among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. But Pyongyang went on to test a nuclear device in 2006, has since been slow to carry out agreements on disabling its plutonium-based program and has refused to commit to a verification regime, leaving the multilateral process stalled. Analysts believe that among Clinton's main objectives in Asia is to reassure U.S. allies Japan and South Korea that the United States will not bargain over their heads in talks with North Korea and will consult closely on negotiating strategy. In settling on Bosworth, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Clinton is tapping a retired diplomat with extensive experience in Asia, where he served as ambassador to the Philippines from 1984 to 1987, the period when former President Ferdinand Marcos' government collapsed. He also has been the State Department's director of policy planning and executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, a consortium that was building two light-water nuclear energy reactors in North Korea until an earlier nuclear deal with Pyongyang collapsed six years ago. Michael Green, a former National Security Council official who handled North Korea under former President George W. Bush, praised the choice, saying Bosworth offered a rare combination of Asia experience, nonproliferation expertise and negotiating skills. "As a former ambassador to Korea, he will recognize that the first thing we need to do is not to announce some grandiose scheme for re-engaging North Korea, but instead to listen to Seoul and to listen to Tokyo," Green said. "The North Koreans have been extremely belligerent toward the South and the Japanese have been very anxious about the threats of a missile launch," he added, alluding to reports Pyongyang may plan to test a long-range missile. "Success in the negotiations is going to depend on the U.S. and our allies being in lock-step." 'TERRIFIC SELECTION' Jack Pritchard, who worked on North Korea under Bush and his predecessor, Bill Clinton, called Bosworth "a terrific selection," saying "he has the respect of those within the U.S. government and no doubt in other capitals as well." Since taking office as secretary of state less than a month ago, Hillary Clinton has described the six-party talks as "essential" and has made clear the United States intends to continue to pursue them. In what appeared to be a gesture in that direction, the State Department said it would send a delegation to Moscow next week for a gathering of a six-party working group on "Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism." The working group is one of five set up under the six-party talks. By attending the meeting, the Obama administration seemed to signal its commitment to the multilateral track despite campaign rhetoric about the need for deeper bilateral engagement with North Korea.
