<TITLE> What can Obama do about Afghanistan, Pakistan? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Wed Feb 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama's point man, Richard Holbrooke, is seeing up close the scale and complexity of his task to overhaul US policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan as he tours the region. Holbrooke, in Pakistan until Thursday before going to Afghanistan and India, is expected to redefine objectives and present a new strategy at a NATO summit on April 2. The emphasis Obama has placed on pacifying Afghanistan and liquidating the al Qaeda threat in Pakistan has moved the region to centre stage among US foreign policy challenges. WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS IN AFGHANISTAN? The Taliban insurgency has gained strength and levels of violence have shot up more than seven years after US-backed forces vanquished the Islamist militia. The best business to be in is drug-running. The country could become a narco-state. Governance is poor, corruption is rife, and five years after his election, President Hamid Karzai has been unable to show his people substantive improvement in their lives. It's not just his fault. The West has poured billions of dollars into Afghanistan, and it does not all pass through the Afghan government. Yet, with a presidential election due in August, the Obama administration is looking critically at Karzai, and has to decide whether to extend support further. There is speculation that it may be weighing alternatives to Karzai. Obama is boosting the number of troops in Afghanistan, and the so-called surge is expected to result in a virtual doubling over the next 18 months to more than 60,000. The United States faces problems getting NATO partners to pledge more troops to a war that to many seems unwinnable. U.S. policymakers know there is no military solution to Afghanistan, there has to be better work on socio-economic development, and ultimately there will have to be some kind of reconciliation with the Taliban. The difficulty is finding the Taliban moderates who have enough influence to count. AND PAKISTAN? Pakistan's help is needed militarily and logistically to support the West's mission in Afghanistan, and its help in intelligence is crucial to eradicating al Qaeda. But its government is weak, its economy is living from one IMF loan disbursement to the next, and its powerful military believes Pakistan's own security concerns have been ill-served by following a U.S. agenda since 2001. Not only has Islamist militancy spread across the northwest, but rival India has regained influence in Kabul, raising the spectre of encirclement in the Pakistani military mind. There are strong suspicions among allies and rivals that Pakistani intelligence has covertly maintained support for the Afghan Taliban and militant groups that, though focused on fighting India, are sympathetic to the global jihadi cause. Add to that almost nationwide distaste for the alliance with the United States, made worse by reports of civilian casualties whenever U.S. missile attacks are launched on militant targets in Pakistani tribal areas. Longer term, there are fears for the stability of Pakistan, a nuclear weapons state, a hiding place for al Qaeda and recruiting ground for global jihadi causes. The United States realises the dangers. A bill promises $15 billion over five years for Pakistan and a further $7.5 billion over the subsequent fives years, with a focus on development rather than military support. But Pakistan's military wants more equipment, particularly helicopters, for counter-insurgency warfare, and it wants the United States to pay heed to Pakistan's security concerns regarding India and Afghanistan. WHY INVOLVE INDIA? India might be asking the same question. But it is the biggest regional power. Some analysts that the Obama team has listened to have advocated trying to persuade India to reach a settlement with Pakistan over Kashmir. They say this would remove one cause of militancy in the region, and secondly allow Pakistan to focus in fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban on its western border without fear of insecurity on its eastern border. India has always resisted outside meddling in what it sees as an internal matter and a bilateral dispute. It has no confidence that a settlement in Kashmir would stop Pakistani-based jihadis attacking Indian cities. Officials suspect Pakistani intelligence agents had ties with the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group it blames for carrying out the attack on Mumbai that resulted in the slaughter of 179 people. Pakistan should show good faith by bringing those involved to justice before expecting India to revive a five-year-old peace process on "pause" after the attack on Mumbai, Indian officials say. Holbrooke is likely to be told not to link Kashmir with Afghanistan as India has its own security concerns, analysts say
