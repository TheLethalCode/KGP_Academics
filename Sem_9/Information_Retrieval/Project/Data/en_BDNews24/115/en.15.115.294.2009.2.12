<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Maradona's Argentina were impressive 2-0 winners in France on Wednesday as two of world football's heavyweights squared up for a friendly in Marseille. Goals from Jonas Gutierrez and Lionel Messi gave Maradona his second victory in two games since taking charge of the national team after French fans had chanted the former midfielder's name before kickoff. On a hectic day of friendly internationals and a smattering of World Cup qualifiers, there was a shock 1-0 defeat for Germany at home to Norway while next year's World Cup hosts South Africa were given another reminder of how much work they need to do when they lost 2-0 at home to Chile. After Brazil's 2-0 defeat of Italy in London on Tuesday it was Argentina's turn to put aside their stuttering World Cup qualification progress with a classy display. Argentina went ahead in the 41st minute when Gutierrez fired a shot past Steve Mandanda. The South Americans contained France comfortably after the break and Messi sealed the victory late on after good work by substitute Carlos Tevez. In one of the few matches with points at stake Ireland boosted their chances of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup when record scorer Robbie Keane struck twice, including a penalty, as his side came back to beat Georgia 2-1 in Dublin. Giovanni Trapattoni's side are now level with Italy on 10 points at the top of Group 8. A second-half Christian Grindheim goal handed Norway victory over a lacklustre Germany in Dusseldorf. The visitors grabbed a deserved winner in the 63rd minute when Morten Gamst Pedersen crossed for Grindheim to tap in. In other friendly fixtures, the Netherlands were held to a 1-1 draw by Tunisia while Brazil-born striker Eduardo da Silva made an impressive return to top-level action, setting up the winner as Croatia beat Romania 2-1. Eduardo has been out for a year since suffering a horrific leg injury playing for Arsenal.
