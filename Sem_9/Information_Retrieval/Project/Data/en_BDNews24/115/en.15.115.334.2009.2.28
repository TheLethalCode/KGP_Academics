<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  Measures are being taken to restore discipline and morale among the rebel-hit jawans of Bangladesh Rifles, the newly appointed chief said on Saturday. "It'll take time. But we are working on it," said director general Brig Gen Moinul Hossain after a first meeting of the probe body into the BDR mutiny. He also assured the public that border security was not a concern since the armed uprising by rebel BDR ranks at their Dhaka headquarters was quelled Thursday. "All the country's borders are secure," the BDR chief told newsmen on Saturday. "I visited the BDR headquarters today for the first time since my appointment to have a look at the overall situation there," said Gen Moinul, who was made a member of a high-level probe body. The 10-strong committee began its investigations from Saturday into the mutiny that left a death toll of 77, mostly officers, up to that afternoon, though more than 70 officers were still 'missing'. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who heads the committee, said it aims to submit an initial report within seven days. Bodies were still being unearthed from shallow graves at BDR headquarters on Saturday, two days after the mutiny was quelled. Among the dead were the BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed, and his second in command. Gen Moinul was appointed the new chief of the paramilitary force as the death of his predecessor was being confirmed. Asked about the investigation process, the new BDR chief said: "We will interrogate those suspected of carrying out the mutiny, and question those who have suffered losses." "We will also interview the residents of Peelkhana's surrounding area." "Today was the first meeting of the committee. We'll meet again to decide our next course of action," he added. On how many personnel were inside the headquarters, he said those who did not flee were inside. "But I cannot say their number at the moment." "And those who fled have been asked to return." "We'll also interrogate those members who were caught escaping and have been detained," he said. bdnews
