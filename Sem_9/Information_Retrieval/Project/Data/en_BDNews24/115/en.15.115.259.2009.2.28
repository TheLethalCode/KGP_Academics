<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The sharp 6.2 percent fourth-quarter drop in U.S. gross domestic product reported on Friday underscores the pressing need for action sought by President Barack Obama, the White House said. "I think it underscores the urgency with which the president feels we have to move to improve our economy," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters aboard Air Force One after the Commerce Department reported the worse-than-expected GDP figures. The figures showed the U.S. economy suffered its deepest contraction since early 1982 during the fourth quarter, falling at a 6.2 percent annual rate.
