<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)The government can make "a giant leap" in establishing rule of law in the country if the trial of war crimes are held properly, an adviser to the prime minister said Saturday. "Fair trial of all crimes carried out in the past is a must in establishing the rule of law," HT Imam told a roundtable on 'People's expectation: Trial of war crimes and rule of law' at the National Press Club. Imam said if the trial of war criminals is held, then holding the trial of other killings would be much easier. "Now we've got an opportunity to try war crimes. Decisions are being taken in this regard and the concerned ministries will be directed to materialise those decisions," he said. "And for the establishment of good governance, there need to be reforms in the administration," Imam observed. Another speaker, Barrister Amir-Ul-Islam, said, "Activities to determine legal aspects for the trial of war criminals should be started without any delay." "There should be a committee formed with experts, inquiry team and lawyers team within two weeks," Amir said. Bangladesh Muktijoddha Samonnay Parisad hosted the roundtable. bdnews24.c
