 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Zillur Rahman received backing from across the political spectrum as he became the 19th president of Bangladesh Thursday, promising to work impartially and strengthen democracy. Zillur Rahman was sworn in at a 7pm ceremony at the Bangabhaban. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin administered the oath at the Darbar Hall. Among those present were prime minister Sheikh Hasina, ministers, politicians and diplomats. Known as a close companion of independence architect and Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 79-year-old Zillur shook hands with his predecessor Iajuddin Ahmed and the chief justice immediately after taking oath. Zillur and Iajuddin swapped chairs as the audience gave them a standing ovation at the ceremony broadcast live by Bangladesh Television, Bangladesh Betar and private TV and radio stations. "We're happy to get such a personality as president, who had leading roles from the Language Movement in 1952 to the 'mass uprising' of 1990," the prime minister said after the swearing-in. "We hope the new president will now play a role to materialise 'Vision 2021' and the country's independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's dream of establishing a Sonar Bangla (Golden Bangladesh)." Opposition chief whip Jainul Abdin Faruk, in an instant reaction, told newsmen: "We congratulated Zillur Rahman earlier on his election as president, and we congratulate him again today." "He is an experienced politician. If he puts his experience to use, he will do a good job of upholding democracy." "And if he works neutrally, BNP will extend all cooperation," said the BNP MP. Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, who had insisted on becoming president himself, says he is happy to see the senior Awami League parliamentarian become president. "I am happy that Zillur Rahman is president. He is a sacrificing leader. He's sacrificed a lot for the party. That's why he deserves presidency," the former president told reporters Thursday at the lobby of Darbar Hall. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda announced Zillur the new head of state Wednesday as there was no other candidate for president. The elite Special Security Forces and the President's Guard Regiment had taken charge of security of the new president and his residence at Ivy Tower in Gulshan since the announcement. An Awami League parliamentary party meeting earlier in the day named party presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury new deputy leader of the House, replacing Zillur Rahman. Zillur told the ALPP meeting, his last as an MP, that he was glad to be taking over as president, but sad to be leaving the party. "We have worked together, but from now there will be a break." He asked all to pray for him and sought support. Awami League chief Hasina said after the meeting she believed that the country's democracy would be strengthened with Zillur helming the state. "A dedicated politician, having risen from the grassroots, he has struggled a lot for the country," the prime minister said, throwing some light on Zillur's life and work. "He kept the party united through the difficult period when I was in the jail," Hasina said, and added that her father too had taken Zillur's advice. On his election Wednesday, Zillur said he would work neutrally. "I will work for the people impartially, even though I will be away from active politics," he had told bdnews24.com at his residence hours after he was officially declared president-elect. The veteran politician was born on March 9, 1929 at Bhairab, Kishoreganj, and took to politics in his student days. Zillur was elected MP in the Dec 29 vote, and in past elections of 1973, 1986, 1996 and 2001, from his Kishoreganj (Kuliarchar-Bhairab) constituency. He was also elected to the provincial council (Pradeshik Parishad) in 1970. Zillur, who has two daughters and one son, lost his wife, senior AL leader Ivy Rahman, to the grenade attacks on a party rally in Dhaka on Aug. 21, 2004. Hasina handed the baton to Zillur after she was arrested in 2007 by the military-installed emergency government on charges of corruption. bdnews24.com/
