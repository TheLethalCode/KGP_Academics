<TITLE> Hatirjheel project key to resolving city waterlogging: expert </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  There is no alternative to implementing the ongoing Hatirjheel-Begunbari project to stop the capital Dhaka being water-logged, urban planner Prof Nazrul Islam said on Friday. "But the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha seems to be in a hurry to complete the master plan of the project which may compromise the very purpose of the project," Prof Islam, University Grants Commission chairman, said. "The RAJUK needs further research on the project," he suggested in an essay at a seminar titled 'Climate change and climate refugee: Urbanisation problem and remedy' at Novo Convention Centre in the city. He stressed on further initiatives by the developed countries and governmental efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change that is causing sea-level rise, heavy downpour, drought, river erosion and cyclones. Unplanned urbanisation means each year hundreds of thousands of people rush to the capital city with the hope of making a living, only to make the city even worse to live in, Prof Islam said.
