 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina went to a Dhaka hospital for a routine eye examination on Thursday. "The prime minister came to Square Hospital for her eye tests," general manager retired brigadier general John Gomes told bdnews24.com. "The condition of her eyes has improved, but she comes here for routine check-ups," said the hospital official. "After her check-up, Hasina visited the ailing language movement leader Ghaziul Haque and Awami League MP Dewan Farid Ghazi and enquired into how they were being treated at the hospital," said Gomes. The general manager said Ghazi, suffering a number of old age complications, was receiving treatment at the intensive care unit of the hospital. Hasina has been suffering from an eye disease in recent years among other ailments, most notably an ear complaint, which her doctors said were exacerbated by her detention in 2007-08. Her ear was initially damaged in the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally in the city. She was released from special jail by the previous caretaker government, in June 2008, to seek medical treatment abroad for eye, ear and other ailments. bdnews24.c
