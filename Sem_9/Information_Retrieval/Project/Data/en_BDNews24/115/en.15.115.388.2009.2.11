 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith refused comments Wednesday on the ongoing turmoil of the capital market. "I have no comments on the capital market.......the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) will talk about it," he said, fending off queries from reporters at the ministry after a meeting with a delegation of the Bankers Association of Bangladesh. The market has been seeing a downturn for more than five weeks with the indices on the country's twin bourses plummeting for a fourth straight day on Wednesday due to continued sell-offs by panicky investors. On Monday, Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark DGEN or the general index lost about 70 points followed by a fall of 45 points Tuesday on the opening session, prompting retail investors to take to the streets. The DSE benchmark on Wednesday shed 86.54 points or 3.45 percent to end on 2416.66, dropping to the lowest in 17 months with the DSI or all share price index closing at 2013.61, down by 70.91 points or 3.40 percent. Indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also fell. The selective categories index or CSCX finished at 4793.31, falling 178.38 points or 3.58 percent while the all share price index or CASPI slumped 267.85 points or 3.46 percent. A liquidity crunch and poor institutional participation have been cited as the reason behind the gloomy atmosphere of the market. "There is a shortage of liquidity in the market as retail investors are unable to pour money amid low prices of their holdings," DSE senior vice president Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed added low participation of institutional investors triggered the recent market turmoil. "Institutions are refraining from trading which has intensified the crisis." Meanwhile, the market regulator came up with a series of measures to inject funds into the market followed by a meeting with the DSE authorities. The SEC raised brokerage firms' credit margin to 1:1 ratio from existing 1:0.67, which means brokers would be able to give away loans equivalent to deposits Other measures include opening of another counter for trading of shares of non-performing 'Z' category scrips to discourage investors from taking part in the trade of those shares. It also decided to propose to Bangladesh Bank to increase the brokers' borrowing limits from banks. At present, each broker can avail bank financing up to Tk 1 crore against its membership of the DSE. But brokers argued the value of each of their membership was not below Tk 15 crore. "The increase in this limit would enable us to take part in the market with more liquidity," said a senior official of IDLC Securities, preferring anonymity. The market regulator also agreed to expedite the process of awarding merchant banking licences to banks and financial institutions to ensure increased participation in trading.
