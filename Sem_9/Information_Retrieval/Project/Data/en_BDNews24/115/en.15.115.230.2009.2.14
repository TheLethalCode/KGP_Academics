 TRINCOMALEE, Sri Lanka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka rejected on Friday Britain's appointment of a special envoy to oversee the end of its war with Tamil Tiger separatists, and thousands more people fled a war zone growing smaller by the day. The military said at least 34,000 people this year have fled the war zone in the Indian Ocean island's northeast, where troops are battling to crush a 25-year-old civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels. More than 1,600 people reached military-controlled areas on Thursday, military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. The area now held by the Tamil Tigers has shrunken to just 142 square km (55 sq miles), he said. Tens of thousands of people are trapped between troops and the LTTE, drawing international concern for their welfare. The United Nations is preparing for an exodus of 150,000 people. On Thursday, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed former state secretary of defence Des Browne special envoy to Sri Lanka, saying he would focus on the humanitarian situation and government efforts to forge a last political solution to the war. Sri Lanka's cabinet rejected the decision as unilateral. "There should be approval from both countries and there is no need for that type of an appointment. It's quite unnecessary," cabinet spokesman and Media Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said. Britain had no immediate comment, a spokesman for the High Commission in Colombo said. Overnight, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) brought another 400 people out of the Tiger-held coastal village of Puttumatalan and ferried them to the eastern port of Trincomalee. There were 160 sick and wounded people among them admitted to hospital, where they joined a first load of 240 patients carried there on Tuesday, the ICRC said in a statement. Puttumatalan is a coastal village which is inside a new no-fire zone the military set up for civilians on Thursday, to replace an older one over which both sides traded accusations over who was firing weapons inside it. Those who escaped explained the horror they experienced as the rebels kept them from moving freely amid shelling and government air raids, most of it centred around Puthukudiyiruppu. "I have cancer and got slightly injured from an air raid by a Kfir when I was in Puthukudiyiruppu," Vellupillai Murugupullai, a 62-year-old former postmaster said, referring to a military jet. The government has accused the rebels of setting up heavy weapons inside thickly populated areas and shooting at people to keep them from leaving, which the LTTE denies. The military denies targeting civilians. "I saw the LTTE had fired at 28 civilians who tried to flee the area three days ago," he told Reuters from Trincomalee hospital. "People want to leave but there is no chance for them.
