 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) - The education ministry has decided to make special arrangements for any SSC examinees that were affected by the BDR mutiny. They will be allowed to sit the mathematics paper on March 19, instead of Sunday, said the education minister Saturday. "Moreover, the rest of their exams may be taken according to a new schedule with fresh question papers and the dates will be announced later," Nurul Islam Nahid told a press conference. "The affected examinees will have to notify the Controller of Examinations directly or via their headmasters by March 10," he also said. Nahid said the BDR mutiny was "unprecedented". He paid respects to the slain, which included over 70 army officers, and expressed deepest condolences for the affected families. bdnew
