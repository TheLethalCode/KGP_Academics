<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Feb 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Television's "Desperate Housewives" are losing a resident of Wisteria Lane. Nicollette Sheridan, who plays blonde-bombshell Realtor Edie Britt on the ABC comedy, is leaving the show, a spokeswoman for the network said on Wednesday. ABC gave no further details about the timing or circumstances of the departure of Sheridan's loud-mouthed character. But E! online columnist Ted Casablanca wrote that Britt would be involved in a car accident after dodging a plot hatched by shady new screen husband Dave Williams to kill her off. Sheridan's character has already left the TV show once. She was driven out of Wisteria Lane by the other housewives last season but returned when the show jumped five years forward in the fall of 2008. British-born Sheridan, 45, appeared in the US TV soap opera "Knots Landing" in the 1990s before joining the cast of "Desperate Housewives" in 2004
