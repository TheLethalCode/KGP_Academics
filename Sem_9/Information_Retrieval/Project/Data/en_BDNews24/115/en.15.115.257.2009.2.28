 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  A high-powered committee, to investigate the BDR mutiny, aims to give an initial report within the next seven days, said home minister Sahara Khatun on Saturday. The home minister, who heads the probe body, told reporters after a first meeting the committee would inspect the entire site of the armed uprising at the Peelkhana HQ. The bloody rebellion left a body count of 77, mostly officers, up to Saturday afternoon, though more than 70 officers were still 'missing'. Newly appointed BDR chief Brig Gen Moinul Hossain, also a member of the committee, said: "As part of our investigations we will question those suspected of perpetrating the mutiny and the victims of the mutiny." "We will also question those who live around the BDR headquarters." Asked how many BDR men were inside the Peelkhana compound, he said, "I cannot tell you the exact number of jawans present in the barracks." "But orders have been issued to those who fled the headquarters after the mutiny erupted, to return to their posts." He also said the detained BDR men, who were arrested while trying to flee during the mutiny, would be questioned. Gen Mainul said steps were being taken to restore morale and discipline within the ranks. "Work has already begun to boost confidence within the force, but this will take some time." He said all borders around the country were secured. Home minister Sahara Khatun had earlier led members of the probe committee into BDR headquarters for the first time on Saturday, two days after the mutiny by armed border guards was quelled. She asked Dhaka police commissioner Naeem Ahmed to ensure no evidence was disturbed ahead of the investigation. "All of the evidence must be properly preserved," she said, pointing out a bullet-ridden car of slain BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed that had been left uncovered since Wednesday. The government formed the ten-member committee on Friday, whose members include: the home minister, state minister for law, law secretary, the new BDR chief, two additional secretaries, to the home ministry and the prime minister's office respectively, two additional inspectors general of police (Special Branch) and joint secretary (political) of the home ministry. bdnews24.
