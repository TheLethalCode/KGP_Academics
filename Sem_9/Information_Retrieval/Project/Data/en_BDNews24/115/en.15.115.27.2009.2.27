<TITLE> FIFA rule makers to mull extra refs, sin-bins </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BELFAST, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA's lawmakers meet on Saturday to discuss changes to soccer's rulebook including extra referees, sin-bins for yellow card offences and increasing the number of substitutions during a match. The International Football Association Board (IFAB)which sets the rules for the world's most popular sportwill assess whether extra linesmen monitoring penalty areas at the end of each pitch can help alert referees to fouls or diving, while avoiding the need to introduce potentially disruptive video replays. European governing body UEFA will deliver the results of its recent trials at under-age tournaments and international matches in Slovenia, Cyprus and Hungary. UEFA chief Michel Platini and FIFA president Sepp Blatter both favour such an approach instead of video replays like those used in rugby when the referee is unsure whether a try has been scored. The game's top officials say such television replays hamper the fluidity of a match with unnecessary stoppages. But the IFABmade up of the four British associations and four representatives from FIFA will look at the merits of introducing rugby's sin-bin whereby a player booked for a foul is sent to sit on the sidelines for a set amount of time. The proposal has been made by Irish Football Association. OFFSIDE RULE Another proposal being considered, from the Scottish FA, is to increase the number of substitutes allowed from three to four when a match goes to extra-time. The IFAB will also consider a plan to extend halftime from 15 to 20 minutes and a clarification of the wording of the offside law. The new wording relates to the type of incident that arose at a Euro 2008 match in Berne in June when Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy opened the scoring in a 3-0 win but appeared to be offside because Italy defender Christian Panucci was off the pitch. The goal was correctly awarded by referee Peter Frojdfeldt. Initially his decision was widely criticised, although he interpreted the law to the letter. The new wording seeks to erase any doubt that even if the defender leaves the field, he is still "active" as far as offside is concerned. It would read: "Any defending player leaving the field of play for any reason without the referee's permission shall, until he returns to the field  be considered to be on his own goalline or touchline for the purposes of offside.
