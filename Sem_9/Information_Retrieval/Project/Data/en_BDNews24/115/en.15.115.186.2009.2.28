 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  The nation was mourning the officers and civilians slain in the BDR mutiny with flags flying at half mast on Saturday. The bloody 33-hour mutiny by rebellious border guards that began Wednesday left a death toll of 77, mostly officers including the BDR chief, up to Saturday afternoon, though more than 70 officers were still reported 'missing'. Flags were at half mast at Bangabhaban, the prime minister's office, secretariat, all government offices and Bangladesh missions abroad. Special prayers were offered for the dead on Friday, during Jumma prayers, in all cantonment mosques across the cantonment, and at Baitul Mukarram National Mosque. bdnews24.com/
