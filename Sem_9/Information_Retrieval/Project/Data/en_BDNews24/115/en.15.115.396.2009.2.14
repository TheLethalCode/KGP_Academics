 By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Widespread fears that US efforts to revive the economy and stabilize banks may prove insufficient drove investors into safe havens like gold and bonds pushing world stock markets down last week. More bleak economic data from Asia and Europe that pointed to deflation in Japan and record plunges in industrial production in the euro zone added to market unease sparked by the lack of details in U.S. rescue plans announced on Tuesday. Concerns over the health of the global economy dragged U.S. oil futures to a three-week low below $35 a barrel and cut two-year yields on euro zone government debt to their lowest since the euro began circulating in 1999. Safe haven buying marked trading across all asset classes, lifting the dollar higher against most currencies and pushing gold prices to new highs in Britain and India. A slide in equity markets also was a catalyst in the flight to safety. "Risk aversion has returned to the market with full force," said Ole Hansen, senior manager with Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. "That makes people seek out safe havens, which is reflected not only in the inflows into gold but also the bonds market." Gold priced in sterling and gold futures in India hit all-time highs, adding to record highs on Wednesday for bullion in euro, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc terms. Sliding stock prices have helped bolster gold as investors move out of equities, a risky asset class, in favor of bullion, Hansen said. Gold prices slipped slightly on Friday as fears of financial meltdown receded, but analysts say investors expecting only a brief respite from the maelstrom will carry on piling into the precious metal. Traders said short-term investors selling their holdings ahead of a U.S. holiday on Monday weighed on gold. Firmer equities and news that the United States was working on a program to subsidize mortgages for homeowners before they fall into loan arrears also hit gold market sentiment. Rising hopes of financial stability prompted a bout of profit-taking which took spot gold to a session low of $931.40 an ounce. Bullion was at $937.80 an ounce at 2:02 p.m. EST (1902 GMT), down 0.8 percent from the last trade $945.05 late in New York on Thursday. U.S. gold for April delivery GCJ9 settled down $7.00 at $942.20 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. "A lot of bad news, for this week at least, seems to have been priced in," said Michael Widmer, analyst ay BNP Paribas. The escalating crisis in the banking sector has pushed up gold prices by about 40 percent since late October last year. Higher prices are reflected in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The fund's holdings reached a record above 970 tonnes as of Feb. 12, a 30 percent jump since the end of October. "It tells you how worried people are about the state of our financial system. When you see gold making new highs in many different currencies, it shows that a lot of people are worried about the printing of money by governments," said Joseph Foster, portfolio manager of the $550 million Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund in New York. Investors expecting years of inflation and global economic instability are pouring money into securities backed by gold bullion, helping to turn a simple safe haven into a mainstream asset class. Many traders think a new record could be set should inflation take off next year because of the large amounts of money being pumped into the global economy by central banks and governments to boost growth and confidence.
