 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone's revenue went up 13 percent to about Tk 6,100 crore year-on-year in 2008, but customer growth was slightly lower than 2007, the company said. The country's largest mobile-phone operator by subscription published the financial statement for the fourth quarter of 2008 on Wednesday. At the end of 2008, the number of subscriptions was about 2.1 crore with a subscription market share of 47 percent, it said. "While it continues to grow, our subscriber growth is effected by the existing high SIM tax, which limits affordability for customers with limited incomes," said Grameenphone CEO Oddvar Hesjedal. "Nonetheless, we have consolidated our position in the market and closed the year on a positive curve," he added. GP's chief financial officer Arif Al Islam said, "Total amount as a net profit in 2008 is 320 crore, in 2007 it was 130 crore." Profit after tax is little more than 5 percent in 2008. Last year it was around 2.4 percent, he added. "It has been around 27 percent customer growth. Net addition to the market was 45 lakh compares with 57 lakh in 2007. "So growth has been slightly lower than 2007." Accordingly, Grameenphone's net addition in the fourth quarter was 164,000 compared to 521,000 of the third quarter. The total revenue of 2008 increased 13 percent compared to 2007 mainly due to good contribution from customers, revenues from international gateway (IGW) and interconnection revenues from Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). EBITDA margin in 2008 increased to 46.4 percent compared with 45.9 percent of last year mainly due to higher revenue, the company further said. Grameenphone invested over Tk 2,700 crore in 2008, including Tk 592 crore investments on acquiring additional 7.4 MHz GSM frequency on 1800 band in the fourth quarter. This brings Grameenphone's accumulated investment to about Tk 14,000 crore since inception. Grameenphone has paid the government Tk 3,172 crore in 2008 in direct tax, VAT and duties, and in fines through the BTRC. In addition, Grameenphone paid Tk 335 crore through commercial agreements with Bangladesh Railway and Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL).
