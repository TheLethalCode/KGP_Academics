 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government will move to stage direct polls to reserved women's seats in parliament, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Saturday. "The constitution will be changed to that end, if necessary," the senior Awami League leader said while distributing nomination forms to prospective women candidates at the AL president's office in Dhanmondi. "The Awami League believes that women should come to parliament through direct elections. Our election manifesto also mentioned the same," he said. Ashraful handed the first form to Jubo Mohila League president Nazma Akhter. AL office secretary and state minister for home and public works Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters the forms could be collected and submitted at the AL office from 11am to 4pm up to Feb. 18. Each aspirant must pay a non-refundable deposit of Tk 10,000 per nomination form. Ashraful said the forms would be sent on to the AL Parliamentary Board and they would be finalised there. Candidates would be chosen based on educational qualification, and "sacrifice for the party in various movements", he said. "AL believes in women's empowerment," said Ashraful. "For that we have given two women the portfolios of the home and foreign ministries for the first time in the country's history." "Our prime minister, opposition leader and deputy leader of the parliament are also women." Deputy secretary at the Election Commission, Mihir Sarwar Morshed, told bdnews24.com last week the schedule for the election to reserved women seats might be declared this week. The EC was likely to declare schedule after completing necessary tasks including listing the political parties and lawmakers, he said. It is mandatory to hold the election within 90 days after publication of the general election results. Farhad Ahmed Khan, senior assistant secretary at the EC, told bdnews24.com that they were making preparation for the election to reserved women seats by March 31. The AL gets an allocation of 35 seats, Jatiya Party candidates will contest four, BNP-led four-party combine gets five and independent leaders will vie for one seat, in proportion to party strengths in the House. bdnew
