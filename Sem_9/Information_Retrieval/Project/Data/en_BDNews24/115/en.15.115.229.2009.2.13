 MOSCOW, Fri Feb 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States is ready to look at the possibility of a new configuration for missile defense in Europe that would involve Russia, Interfax news agency quoted a senior US diplomat as saying on Friday. The statement by US Undersecretary of State William Burns was one of the most conciliatory to date from the United States on its plan, fiercely opposed by Moscow, for a missile defense shield based in Poland and the Czech Republic. "Regarding the administration of President Obama, the United States is open to the possibility of new forms of cooperation in the field of missile defense," Interfax quoted Burns as saying in an interview. Moscow says the missile shield plan is a threat to its security and has said it will retaliate if the plan goes ahead. The United States says the shield is designed to stop missiles from what it calls "rogue states," specifically Iran. "(Washington is) open to the possibility of cooperation, both with Russia and NATO partners, in relation to a new configuration for missile defense which would use the resources that each of us have," Interfax quoted Burns, who was in Moscow for talks this week, as saying in an interview
