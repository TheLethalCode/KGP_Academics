 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government will hunt down the "instigators" of the BDR mutiny, "We will investigate how it occurred," she told newsmen on Friday. "We will hunt down those who instigated the BDR mutiny." "We will discover whether it was a planned or spontaneous event," the prime minister told reporters at Mirpur Cantonment, after visiting officers' families who were held captive in the Peelkhana compound during the bloody two-day revolt. "[They] couldn't have carried out the mutiny alone," she said of the rebel personnel whose surrender Thursday evening ended a crisis that threatened at one point to turn into a full-blown battle against army troops. "Some vested quarter must have been involved," Hasina said. The prime minister asked all to stay alert against the instigators "who are still in play". Almost 150 hostages, including 34 army officers, were released from the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters throughout Thursday. The officers walked out in small groups up to 6.30pm, when the mutinying jawans officially surrendered. The rest of the freed hostages were wives and children of missing and dead officers. The freed families were taken to Mirpur army staff quarters, where Hasina visited them Friday afternoon. Those who died during the rebellion will be buried with full state honours, a government official said. The prime minister had earlier visited those injured in the mutiny at the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka Cantonment. Meanwhile, those who died during the BDR mutiny will be buried with full state honour, a government official said. bdnews2
