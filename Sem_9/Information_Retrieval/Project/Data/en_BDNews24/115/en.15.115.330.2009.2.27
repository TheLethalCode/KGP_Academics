 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Gen Moeen U Ahmed renewed army's loyalty to democracy Friday, saying the armed forces are always "subservient to the government". "Rumours are swirling ... (but) the army belongs to you (people)," the army chief said after meeting the prime minister at her home late Friday night. "What happened in Peelkhana was a catastrophe that caused an irreparable loss to not only the army but also the country," Gen Moeen said, in his first public comments since the bloody BDR mutiny, to reporters outside the Jamuna. "We will have to overcome it," he said after the late Friday night meeting, joined also by senior Cabinet ministers. "Who are we harming by spreading rumours?" Gen Moeen asked. Rumours were ripe that discontent was brewing in the army ranks over the killing of the army officers during the two-day mutiny at the paramilitary force's headquarters. "We should not act against one another. The army fought in the liberation war alongside the people. "Think about the children who lost their fathers, or the wives who lost their husbands or those who lost their relatives," he said in his two-and-a-half-minute appearance. "We cannot bring them back; but we all will have to think how we can overcome the catastrophe." The army chief said the army would not be able to overcome the aftermath alone, the nation will have to give a hand. On his meeting with the prime minister, the army chief said he had briefed her about "some points" that he had collected from "every area of the army". "Some points were made and I spoke with the prime minister about those issues. She was positive and said she would look into them." He also asked the news media to filter the truth from rumours. "I request you: please don't say anything, run news scrolls that are not true. "Many army men misinterpret them." Said the army chief: "I request you that after collecting information cross-check with us; we can give you the correct information," . The general arrived at the prime minister's house at 9:15pm, senior bdnews24.com correspondent Sumon Mahbub said. Earlier in the day, Gen Moeen joined the home minister at the BDR headquarters in supervising the rescue and recovery work assisted by his troops. bdnews2
