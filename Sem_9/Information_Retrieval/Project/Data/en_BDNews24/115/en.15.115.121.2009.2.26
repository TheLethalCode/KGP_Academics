 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders Bangladesh Biman and holders Abahani continued their winning streak in the Premier Cricket League, but title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club went down again on Thursday. Fifties from openers Nazmus Sadat and Zahid Niaz powered Biman to an emphatic six-wicket win over City Club at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Indian Venugopal Rao and Imran Ahmed each struck half-centuries to guide Abahani to a 27-run win over Old DOHS at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium while Surjo Tarun Club handed a five-wicket defeat to Mohammedan at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. The matches resumed from where they left off on Wednesday following the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny in Dhaka. The Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis has meanwhile suspended the ongoing Premier Cricket League for two days till Feb 28, said a press release. Biman vs City Club Put in to bat, City Club, who lost all their earlier five matches, posted a modest 236-9 in 50 overs, thanks to a 70-run knock from one-down Hamidul Islam. Openers Rasel Al Mamun (32), Maysheur Rahman (25), lower-order batsman Rashedul Islam (28) were other main scorers. Zahid Hossain led the attack with 4-28. Biman, in reply, faced no trouble chasing the target especially after a 148-run opening partnership. Golam Hossain broke the stand dismissing Nazmus for 75 off 86 that included nine fours. Opener Jahid was run out for 92, leaving the side at 196-2 in 39.2 overs. He smashed four fours and five fours from 127 deliveries. Biman finally reached 237-4 with 20 balls to go with Sajjad Kadir and Sanwar Hossain remaining unbeaten on five and two. Abahani vs DOHS Electing to bat, Abahani posted a challenging total of 290-7 in 50 overs despite openers Tamim Iqbal (2) and Rony Talukdar (11) returning to the dressing inside nine overs. Imran and Venugopal took Abahani to 160-3 from 24-2 before Monir Hossain had Imran caught by Mehrab Hossain Jr for 70 off 107 balls studded with six fours. Venugopal was caught by Nayeem off Abul Hossain for 77 off 82 balls with seven fours and one six, leaving the side at 201-4. Sahagir Hossain and Nasir Hossain hit quick knocks of 39 and 42. DOHS also responded well after a 90-run knock from opener Nayeem Wasim, who struck nine fours and one six facing 118 balls. But the departure of Nayeem half way through the innings dashed their hopes though the former champions went close to the target with knocks from Golam Rahman (36), Mehrab Hossain (32) and Mahmuduall Riad (29). DOHS eventually finished on 263-8 in 50 overs as Subhashish Roy grabbed three wickets and Arafat Sunny took two wickets. MSC vs Surjo Tarun Sent in to bat, Surjo Taurn bundled Mohammedan out for a paltry 159 in 49.2 overs with Saklain Sajub and Shafiul Islam leading the attack to return three scalps each. Delwar Hossain and Sanjumul Islam chipped in with two wickets each. Captain Suhrawardi Shuvo top-scored with 38 while Marshal Ayub added 28. In reply, Surjo Tarun reached 163-5 in 36.5 overs. Middle-order batsman Anisur Rahman was the top-scorer with a 50-ball 41 while opener Junaed Siddique and one-down Hannan Sarkar struck identical 33. bd
