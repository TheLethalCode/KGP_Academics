 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion and police arrested 121 'on-the-run' members of Bangladesh Rifles from the capital, and 99 from elsewhere in the country, up to Saturday. The Dhaka CMM court has ordered the 121 to jail, said police. The jawans had mostly escaped the BDR headquarters during the 33-hour mutiny from Wednesday morning that left a death toll of 77, mainly army officers, as more bodies were unearthed Saturday. "Some 114 fleeing jawans were caught up to Friday and seven on Saturday from different places across the capital," said Masudur Rahman, Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional deputy commissioner. "Most of the arrests were made by RAB who handed the captured over to police," said Masudur. "We sent them on to the court", he said. RAB also picked up 99 of the paramilitary border guards from Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, as well as Tangail, Bogra and Rajbari districts. The elite law enforcing agency rounded them up from buses and other vehicles that were stopped and searched at various checkpoints. Some were detained with gold ornaments reportedly looted during the mutiny, RAB officials said. All were fleeing in civilian clothes. More than one captured jawan said they were escaping the BDR headquarters, site of the mutiny, out of fear that they would be tried despite the prime minister's 'general amnesty'. bdnews2
