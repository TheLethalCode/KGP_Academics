 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Most bank accounts of the influential individuals and organisations frozen during the emergency rule will be reopened conditionally, the National Board of Revenue chairman said on Wednesday. "The frozen accounts of those who have not faced any cases or are being probed will be allowed to reopen for a time after deducting due taxes and fines for tax-dodge," Mohammad Abdul Mazid told bdnews24.com. "But the issue will not be resolved right away and the NBR will carry on with legal battles. A final decision will follow the court's verdicts." "The frozen accounts of those who have been convicted or are awaiting court verdicts will not be reopened at the moment. We've officially sought opinion from the law ministry about those accounts." "We'll act in accordance with the ministry's response." Mazid said, "Those who have not faced any cases or are facing inquiries into the frozen accounts will have to seek the NBR permission to reopen the accounts after paying the NBR-fixed taxes and fines through bank drafts or treasury challans." Bank accounts of some 252 people were frozen during the emergency rule. Later accounts of their kith and kin were also frozen at the time of inquiries, raising the number to 307. Bank accounts of 16 of them, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, were reopened later at the intervention of the courts or the government. Hasina's account was reopened on request before she left for abroad for treatment. Opposition leader Khaleda Zia has not yet made any such request. Lower courts awarded punishments, including freezes on bank accounts f 39 people. The NBR chairman said, "The bank accounts, documents, money, ornaments or other valuables of individuals or institutions can be frozen or seized for concealing incomes as per the section 117(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance-1984." "The frozen accounts will be reopened in the light of this law that provisions imposing a yearly 10 percent fine on the evaded tax," said Mazid. Asked about his stand on the NBR move, finance minister AMA Muhith declined comments. Politicians, businessmen and a number of former bureaucrats are among those getting the chance to reopen their frozen bank accounts. bd
