 WELLINGTON, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All rounders James Franklin and Jacob Oram have been recalled to the New Zealand side after recovering from injuries, while uncapped opening batsman Tim McIntosh has been brought in for the tests against West Indies. Franklin, who has not played international cricket since the 2007 World Cup as he recovered from knee surgery, has been in outstanding form in domestic cricket, scoring a double century and half century in three matches this season. Oram missed the 2-0 test series loss in Australia last month after suffering a back injury in Bangladesh and returned to New Zealand to recuperate and get match fit. "James Franklin's return to form as an all rounder has been good news," head of the selection panel Glenn Turner said in a statement. "With Jacob Oram able to bat and returning after injury we're in the fortunate position of having both our leading all rounders available." The 29-year-old left-handed McIntosh, who scored 78 for Auckland against West Indies on Friday, replaces Aaron Redmond at the top of the order. Pace bowlers Chris Martin and Tim Southee have also been dropped along with middle-order batsman Peter Fulton. Mark Gillespie will lead the attack, while offspinner Jeetan Patel will act as a second slow bowling option to captain Daniel Vettori should the University Oval pitch in Dunedin take spin. "Mark Gillespie has shown good recent form, bowling a lot of overs and taking eight wickets in his last match -- he becomes our strike bowler in this series," said Turner. The first test in Dunedin begins on Dec. 11, with the second in Napier starting on Dec. 19. Squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Jamie How, Tim McIntosh, Daniel Flynn, Ross Taylor, Jesse Ryder, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, James Franklin, Mark Gillespie, Iain O'Brien, Jeetan Patel
