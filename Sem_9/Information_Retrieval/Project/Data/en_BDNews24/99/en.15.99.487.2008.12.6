 DHAKA, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh's planned tour of the West Indies in April has been rescheduled for June and July, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official said on Friday. Bangladesh were due to play two tests and three-one international in West Indies in April but BCB chief Gazi Ashraf Hossain said the squad would now travel to the Caribbean after the Twenty20 World Cup in England. "It was a win-win situation for us. West Indies were looking for a window to play in England and we were also not very interested in playing in April," Hossain said. The BCB had been concerned that forcing its players to go to the West Indies could jeopardise their chances of earning lucrative contracts to play in the Indian Premier League. England invited West Indies to play two tests and three one-day internationals to help them prepare for the 2009 Ashes series against Australia
