 NEW DELHI, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday urged Pakistan to move fast to help catch those responsible for the Mumbai attacks that have threatened Pakistan's relations with India. "This is the time for everybody to cooperate and do so transparently, and this is especially a time for Pakistan to do so," Washington's top diplomat told a news conference. Rice flew into New Delhi on Wednesday to help ease tensions that have surged with Islamabad over the attacks in Mumbai that killed 171 people last week. India has demanded Pakistan move swiftly to capture militants responsible for the attacks, whom Indian police said had trained for more than a year on Pakistani soil. "We have to act with urgency, we have to act with resolve," Rice said. "I have said that Pakistan needs to act with resolve and urgency and cooperate fully and transparently. That message has been delivered and will be delivered to Pakistan," Rice said.
