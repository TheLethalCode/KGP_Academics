 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury says on Wednesday that if he is asked to leave, he would "go for good", rather than "take a holiday". A newspaper reported Wednesday that the ministry of law had endorsed an alleged corruption investigation against the ACC chairman, and that he had been asked to take 'mandatory leave' during investigation. "If I get any hint that I am not welcome then other possibilities can be considered," he said at a press conference ahead of the International Day Against Corruption. On the antigraft drive, the ACC chairman said: "We must be careful that the fight against corruption does not become a formality." He also cautioned: "No profession or group should be singled out." The International Day Against Corruption is observed globally on Dec 9. Dr Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh, informed reporters that due to Eid falling on the same date this year, the day would be observed early in Bangladesh. The annual anticorruption rally, with more than 50 organisations involved, will be held on Dec 4. With the slogan 'Rise to prevent corruption', it will start at 11am on Thursday from the south plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban and end at the China-Bangladesh Friendship Centre. A related cultural programme has been arranged at the Rabindra Sarobor on the afternoon of Dec 5. bdnews
