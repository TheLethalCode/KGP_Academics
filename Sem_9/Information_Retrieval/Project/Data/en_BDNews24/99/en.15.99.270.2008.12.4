<TEXT>
 PARIS, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker David Trezeguet said he could come back from international retirement, five months after announcing he was quitting the France team. "I didn't want to quit the national team," Trezeguet said in an interview with French sports daily L'Equipe released on Wednesday. "Now I think the 2010 World Cup could be an objective for me. I don't forget it. I have always missed Les Bleus and I still miss them today," the Juventus forward added. Trezeguet said in July he was quitting international soccer after Raymond Domenech was confirmed as France coach. The striker has had an uneasy relationship with Domenech, who left him out of France's Euro 2008 squad. "I don't set any conditions If Domenech thinks Trezeguet can help his team, then we will see," he added. New France assistant coach Alain Boghossian had telephoned him in August and told him that he and Karim Benzema would make the best pair up front, the striker said. Trezeguet, who last played for France in a 1-0 win over England in March, said he would rather talk to Domenech. Trezeguet said he was recovering well after undergoing surgery on both knees in September and should be back in action in February
