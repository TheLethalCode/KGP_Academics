<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief general Moeen U Ahmed has expressed the willingness to construct a 25-kilometre road linking Chittagong with the Myanmar capital of Yangon. He made the remark while inaugurating the Ranir Haat bridge in Rangunia on Sunday. If the army is allowed to build the link road, then the government will be able to save 'a lot of money', he said. General Moeen said he had a similar discussion with a team from Myanmar on this issue. A solid communication system is necessary for the development of the socio-economic structure of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. "The government has awarded the construction work of 15 roads in the hill areas including the marine drive in Cox's Bazar to the army." "The army will complete the task in time," he said. The government has saved around Tk 3.75 crore as the 130.27 metre-long Ranir Haat Bridge was constructed by the army in collaboration with the Department of Roads and Highways, he said. The construction of the bridge will make easier the communication between Rangamati and other areas of the country and the marketing of vegetables grown in the remote hill areas, the army chief observed. It took three and a half years for the bridge over Isamati River to be built at a cost of Tk 8.30 crore. The work started in 2005 and ended in October 2008. b
