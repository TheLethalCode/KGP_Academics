<TITLE> Thai court ruling fails to end political stand-off </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sinfah Tunsarawuth BANGKOK, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supporters and opponents of Thailand's elected government reacted with anger and glee on Tuesday to the disbanding of the ruling party, suggesting the court decision will do nothing to heal deep social divisions. "The judgment was fixed," pro-government businesswoman Rojarek Phalaburee from the northern province of Chiang Mai said. "We will continue to join the protest." The anti-government People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) called off its crippling week-long sit-in of Bangkok's two airports in response to the court decision against the ruling People Power Party (PPP). But government supporters predicted a resumption of hostilities after the king's birthday on December 5, as the gulf between the rural masses, who love ousted and exiled leader Thaksin Shinawatra, and the Bangkok middle classes and elite, who despise him, shows no signs of narrowing. "There will be more people coming out to join the pro-government forces after December 5," said lawyer Supakorn Meekaiw. The pro-government Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship (DAAD) is now holding a rally of its red-shirted supporters outside Bangkok's City Hall. Supakorn said the seizure of two Bangkok airports by anti-government protesters had already caused one of his friends to lose his job as a tourist guide and another to fail to deliver goods to overseas clients. At Don Muang airport, where the PAD protesters have been camping for a week, there was exultation at the removal of an administration seen as a Thaksin puppet. "Thaksin should be executed," Chutamas Sae Koew, a retired civil servant, said. "We are here because we feel the government is corrupt. I feel guilty any day that I don't join the protest." Other PAD protesters acknowledged that the ruling by the Constitutional Court to remove Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat -- Thaksin's brother-in-law -- would do little to solve the political impasse. "I will be satisfied only when the system that has been put in place by Thaksin is ended," said one Interior Ministry official. "Even though Somchai has been ousted, someone will replace him. This wasn't worth the effort," he said.
