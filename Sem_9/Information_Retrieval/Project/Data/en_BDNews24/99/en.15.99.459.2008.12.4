<TEXT>
 HARARE, Thu Dec 4,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe has declared a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 560 people a national emergency and appealed for help from donors to deal with the crisis, state media said on Thursday. Economic meltdown in Zimbabwe, isolated by Western countries under President Robert Mugabe's rule, has left the health system ill prepared to cope with an epidemic that it would once have been able to prevent or treat easily. "Our central hospitals are literally not functioning. Our staff is demotivated and we need your support to ensure that they start coming to work and our health system is revived," Health Minister David Parirenyatwa was quoted as saying in an appeal to donors. Parirenyatwa said Zimbabwe needed medicines and medical equipment, as well as food for patients and for child supplementary feeding programs, according to the state-run Herald newspaper. "The emergency appeal will help us reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the current socio-economic environment by December 2009," Parirenyatwa said. The United Nations humanitarian office estimates the death toll from a deadly cholera outbreak at 565 people, with the capital Harare the worst affected. Zimbabwe's health sector is collapsing with not enough money to pay for essential resources and doctors and nurses often striking over pay. The water system is in disarray, forcing residents to drink from contaminated wells and streams. REGIONAL SUPPORT Any hopes of rescuing Zimbabwe from economic collapse are on hold because of deadlock between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai over how to implement a power-sharing agreement. South Africa, dealing with cholera patients who have fled across its border, said it was extremely concerned about developments in Zimbabwe and would look to work with other regional countries to help. Western neighbor Botswana, one of Mugabe's strongest critics, on Wednesday announced it would donate 3 million pula ($371,000) for health and food relief in Zimbabwe. Critics blame the crisis on Mugabe's policies, such as seizing white-owned farms to give to black Zimbabweans. The 84-year-old leader, in power since independence in 1980, blames sanctions from Western countries. Deputy minister for water and infrastructural development Walter Mzembi said the ministry had only enough water treatment chemicals to last about 12 weeks, and called for donor support, the Herald reported. "I am appealing for at least 40 million rand ($3.9 million) to purchase chemicals for the next two months and the money is needed between now and next Monday," the newspaper quoted him as saying. The Zimbabwe government also appealed for $450 million in aid to deal with food shortages
