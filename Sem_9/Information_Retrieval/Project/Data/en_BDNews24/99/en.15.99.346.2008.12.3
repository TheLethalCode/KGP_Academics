<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and planning adviser Mirza Azizul Islam has called on Bangladesh Bank and other banks to take strict measures to prevent loan defaulters exploiting loopholes in the law to become 'eligible' for election. "The parliamentary election is being held in a changed atmosphere and we are hoping to have a free, fair and neutral election," he said. "To ensure a fair election, efforts must be taken to ensure that loan defaulters cannot participate by exploiting the law." "As a citizen of the country, I want to see that loan defaulters are barred from becoming candidates," said the planning adviser and further added, "but if a loan defaulter becomes a candidate due to loopholes in the law or judicial system then I can only express anguish." He also hoped that the people of the country would help in holding a fault-free election. The adviser was briefing reporters at the finance ministry Wednesday after returning from the 'Financing for Development' summit in Dubai, which addressed the global economic crisis among other issues. Bangladesh represented Least Developed Countries (LDC's) at the Doha summit, he said. Historically, developed countries are supposed to give 0.7 per cent of their GDP to LDC's as Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) but in the last few years only a handful of developed nations fulfilled this obligation, the adviser pointed out. "The EU has pledged to give 0.56 per cent of their GDP as ODA by 2010 and by 2015 that amount will reach 0.7 per cent." He also said that Japan, USA and other developed nations promised to increase ODA. "From the experience of the Qatar meet, I can say that, in the future, there is no chance for ODA to go down in Bangladesh," assured the adviser. Talking about the ongoing global economic downturn, the adviser said the summit had concluded that the crisis may subside by mid-2009. "The newly elected government will not face any major economic worries due to the global crisis for the next one and a half years," he said. Asked to comment on Awami League's election pledge to provide one kilo of rice for Tk 10 he said, "Everything depends on the international market but if any government can do that then I shall welcome it because I am a man with a limited income." bdnews
