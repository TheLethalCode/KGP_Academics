<TITLE> Thaksin's ex-wife returns to see ailing mother: aide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The former wife of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Thailand to visit her ailing mother and had no plans to involve herself in politics, Thaksin's personal spokesman said on Saturday. Potjaman Shinawatra landed at Bangkok's international airport on Friday night, nearly four months after she fled into exile to avoid graft charges. "She comes home to visit her mother, who is ill and will have a surgery," Pongthep Thepkanchana, who has been speaking on behalf of the former couple, told Reuters. Despite several arrest warrants, police did not detain Potjaman because her appeal against a 3-year jail sentence for tax evasion was still ongoing, police said. Pongthep denied local media reports that Potjaman's return was aimed to work out issues in the Puea Thai party, a new party floated by Thaksin supporters after the ruling People Power Party was disbanded in a court verdict this week. The new party is due to choose its leader on Sunday. "Khunying Potjaman doesn't want to be involved in politics. Puea Thai party has a process to choose its leader. Certainly, it has nothing to do with her," the spokesman said. Pongthep did not disclose the whereabouts of Thaksin, saying his personal phone number could not be reached. Potjaman's return from exile is the latest twist in Thailand's three-year old political crisis, which has pitted Bangkok's royal and military elites against Thaksin, ousted in a 2006 coup, and his allies in the current government. In the latest escalation, protests by the anti-government People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) shut down Suvarnabhumi international airport for a week. Thaksin remains in exile, but his whereabouts are unknown. The couple lost their London base after Britain revoked their visas. They divorced in November after 32 years of marriage, but there has been no explanation for the shock separation
