<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 9bdnews24.com)  A cow wandering from the road through the store-front windows of Gulshan's Aarong branch on Sunday caused pandemonium on the eve of Eid at the upmarket shop, said witnesses. Zahid Islam, an employee of a private organisation, had arrived to do his holiday shopping on Sunday evening when he heard the sound of shattering glass and tried to take cover. Panicked shoppers all ran for cover as the cow, one of the main sacrificial animals for Eid-ul-Azha, created uproar in the store, said eyewitnesses. "Was it a bomb? Or a terrorist attack, people wondered," said Zahid. 'No, it was a cow!" The cow was inside Aarong for all of five minutes before security guards managed to shoo it outside. "The cow caused terror and left the shop in disarray, but no one was hurt," said Koushikur Rahman, manager of Gulshan Aarong. bdnews
