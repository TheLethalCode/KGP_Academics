 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has adjourned the general election in the Noakhali-1 constituency in wake of death of Nurul Islam, a candidate for the constituency. "The election in the Noakhali-1 constituency has been postponed due to the death of Ganotontri Party president and a candidate for the seat Nurul Islam," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Thursday evening. "The Election Commission will announce the election schedule for the constituency later," he added. Islam, the Awami league-led alliance nominee sustained critical burns in a fire at his home and died at the Dhaka Combined Military Hospital in the afternoon. Relatives on Wednesday alleged the fire at Islam's Lalmatia home was an arson "to foil the election" and demanded a thorough investigation. According to the Section 17 (1) of the Representative of the People Order, Islam was considered to be a valid candidate for Noakhali-1 (Chatkhil-Sonaimuri) seat. It says, "If a validly nominated candidate who has not withdrawn his candidature dies, the returning officer shall, by public notice, terminate the proceedings relating to that election." Thursday was the last date for nomination scrutiny for the general election. bdnews
