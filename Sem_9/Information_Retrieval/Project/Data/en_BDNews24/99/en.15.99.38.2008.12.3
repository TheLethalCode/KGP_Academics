<TITLE> Not my name on defaulter list: mayor Khoka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka has clarified that his name does not appear on a list of loan defaulters of Sonali Bank, after the name 'Sadek Hossain' was found on the list. "The publication of this list has caused embarrassment for me and my party," said Khoka on Wednesday, asking the EC, central bank and related organisations to be more cautious in formulating lists of defaulters. "The person named is actually Sadek Hossain of Sirajganj," Khoka clarified at a press conference in the capital. Sadek Hossain from Belkuchi in Sirajganj took a loan from Sonali Bank in 1984, said the mayor. Khoka stated: "I do not even have any account with Sonali Bank." The mayor added that he had 'cleared' his name by presenting a testimonial signed by Md Shawkat Ali, deputy managing director of the central bank. BNP leaders and others were present at the press conference. bdnew
