 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has refused to allow Fair Election Monitoring Alliance to monitor the general elections as its chief is tied to a political party. The EC said the decision has been taken considering FEMA president Feroz M Hasan's links with Liberal Democratic Party. EC will reconsider FEMA's request if Hasan dissociates himself from FEMA, it said. SM Asaduzzaman, officer-in-charge at the EC secretariat, said FEMA had been notified on Thursday of the decision after the hearing on the allegations raised on Nov. 24. "FEMA will be allowed to monitor the polls if its chief Feroz M Hasan quits FEMA within December 6 and notifies EC about it," said Zaman. "Election Commission will finally decide the issue of engaging election monitoring agencies on December 6." "The chief election commissioner and the two election commissioners heard the allegations brought against 22 organisations through November 23-24," Asaduzzaman said. The EC decision said: "Feroz M Hasan was actively involved in founding LDP, later accepting its joint secretary general's chair. Subsequently, he resigned from LDP in 2007 and was re-elected FEMA president in August 2008." "As per RPO 91 C (1), Election Commission cannot ask any organisation linked with any political party to engage in election monitoring. Therefore, FEMA cannot be deployed as an election monitor." Asaduzzaman said FEMA pioneered election monitoring in Bangladesh and has been monitoring polls since 1996. "Awami League and BNP alleged that at least 20 election monitoring agencies are linked to different political parties. Besides, complaints were lodged against two more organisations at the personal level," he said. "The Election Commission dismissed allegations brought against 21 agencies after those were found baseless in the hearing. The FEMA chief's association with a political party disqualified the organisation as a monitoring agency." Asaduzzaman said 138 of the 319 monitoring agencies who had applied to observe the parliamentary elections were primarily selected. bdnews
