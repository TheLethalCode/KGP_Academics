<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  AK Khandaker, Awami League nominee for Pabna-2, says that the charge of loan default against him, for which his nomination was rejected, goes against banking laws. The convener of the Sector Commanders Forum, in a formal press conference on Sunday, claimed the case filed by IFIC Bank against him was illegal and based on partiality. "As I did not take any loan from IFIC Bank there is no legal basis to file such case against me. This goes against the Banking Companies Act 1991." "I was not even notified that the bank had filed a case against me. I was in the dark from the beginning to the end regarding the case. So I could not take any initiative to protect my interest," former air force chief Khandaker said. The Election Commission cancelled his nomination last week on grounds of loan default. In its decision, the commission said that Khandaker had taken loans from IFIC Bank's Motijheel branch when he was chairman of private airline Air Parabat and defaulted on payment of Tk 14 crorefor which the bank had filed a case against him. "The bank cannot put the financial burden of the share of other directors fully on me according to its wish," Khandaker told the press at Dhaka Reporters' Unity Sunday. He said that he had filed an appeal against the ruling of the Election Commission. "I will challenge the IFIC case in the court," Khandaker added. He said he was not involved in any other company since he resigned from private airline Air Parabot in 1998. Former Bangladesh Bank deputy governor and Bangladesh Krishi Bank chairman Ibrahim Khaled speaking on Khandaker's behalf, expressed concern that such a person could be harassed through charges of loan default. "Such a case cannot be filed under loan default laws. I think the issue should be sent to the central bankit can tell better in which circumstances loan default cases may be filed," he said. Sector commander and former army chief KM Shafiullah said that they suspected there was some ill-motive in cancelling the nomination of AK Khandaker. "We sector commanders have taken a move to try the war criminals. That's why suspicions are being raised through false allegations to tarnish the image of the convener of the forum," he said. Khandaker, on Saturday, had told reporters he gained the Air Parabat post through a 1.25 percent share in the airline. Before taking the position he told the company that he would not be involved in any financial activities, the former air force chief said. "Moreover, when Air Parabat applied for a loan, I resigned from the post, though there was some delay in my resignation letter being submitted to the bank " he said. But, he stressed: "I did not sign any financial documents of the organisation and did not become a party to any loan." "Apart from this, one does not take on the financial burden of an organisation if one owns less than 20 percent share," the SCF convenor said. bdnew
