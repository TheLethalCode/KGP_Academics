<TITLE> Sept 11 suspects bid for Guantanamo guilty pleas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GUANTANAMO BAY US NAVAL BASE, Cuba, Tue Dec 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The self-styled mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks and four co-defendants told a US military judge at Guantanamo on Monday that they wanted to confess and plead guilty to terrorism charges that could result in their execution. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has said he planned the attacks "from A to Z," and the other defendants wrote in a note to the judge that they made the decision on Nov. 4, the day Barack Obama was elected to become the next US president. Obama has said he will shut down the widely condemned Guantanamo prison camp and try detainees in the regular US civilian or military courts, rather than the special Guantanamo tribunals created by the Bush administration. The defendants, some of whom have previously said they welcomed martyrdom, did not explain their decision and the judge said he did not know whether the rules even allowed him to accept guilty pleas in a capital case. Ultimately, all five defendants decided to delay any pleas until after the judge determines whether guilty pleas would prevent their execution. That means the case against the highest-ranking al Qaeda suspects in US custody will not be resolved until after Obama takes office on Jan. 20. Even if they plead guilty before the Bush administration ends, the case would go through several automatic appeals, so any death sentence would likely not be carried out for years. The judge, Army Col. Stephen Henley, read from the defendants' note as the US military resumed pretrial hearings at the Guantanamo naval base, in a remote US-controlled corner of Cuba. NO TRUST IN LAWYERS "We all five have reached an agreement to request from the commission an immediate hearing session in order to announce our confessions ... with our earnest desire in this regard without being under any kind of pressure, threat, intimidations or promise from any party," they wrote. They said they wanted to drop all pending challenges filed by their military-appointed lawyers, whom they do not trust and tried to fire. "I am not trusting any Americans," Mohammed told the judge in English during the hearing. The judge asked the lawyers to research whether the law underpinning the trials allowed him to accept guilty pleas in capital cases, and whether doing so would prevent his imposing the death penalty. He gave them until Jan. 5 to submit briefs on the issue. The defendants said they would wait for that answer. They also said they did not want to enter pleas until after the judge decides whether all five can act as their own attorneys. Three already have permission to do so. "Our plea request was based on joint strategy and I would rather wait," explained defendant Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, who is Mohammed's nephew and accused of transferring money for al Qaeda and helping nine of the Sept. 11 hijackers travel to the United States. Human rights observers urged the judge to delay the proceedings until the Obama administration could move them into the regular U.S. courts and try them under time-tested rules. 'STARTING OVER' Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the confusion over the rules demonstrated that the Guantanamo tribunals don't work and "The only way to fix them is by scrapping them and starting over." The defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons before being sent to Guantanamo, and the CIA has acknowledged subjecting Mohammed to "waterboarding," a simulated drowning technique widely viewed as torture. Elisa Massimino, executive director of Human Rights First, said allowing the pleas to go forward in proceedings widely viewed as unjust would be a short-sighted victory that "would undermine the ability of the United States to obtain legitimate justice for the 9/11 attacks in our ordinary criminal courts." Mohammed, Ali and the other three -- Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi and Walid bin Attash -- are charged with conspiring to kill civilians. They face 2,973 counts of murder, one for each person killed when al Qaeda militants crashed hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. There is no chance the case would be ready for trial before Obama takes office. His transition team has met with officials from the Pentagon's Office of Military Commissions, which runs the Guantanamo tribunals, but details of the talks have not been made public. The Pentagon arranged for members of five families who lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 attacks to travel to Guantanamo for the proceedings. Alice Hoagland, whose son Mark Bingham died in the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, called the defendants' announcement "a real bombshell" and praised the judge for refusing to hastily accept guilty pleas. "I'm really proud the commission (tribunal) is not taking the bait and proceeding in its slow, thoughtful and deliberate way despite ... the histrionics of these guys," Hoagland said
