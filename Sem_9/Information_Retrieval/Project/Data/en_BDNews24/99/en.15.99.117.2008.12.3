 By Farhana Mirza Munshiganj, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  A ferry carrying around 300 people and 22 vehicles was reported to be out of trouble, after "starting to sink" in the river Padma, a BIWTC official said about 1am Wednesday. The 'MV Raipur' left Mawa at 5pm heading for Kaorakandi in Shariatpur, getting as far as Mangalmajhi char, some 16 kilometres from both points, where the ferry suddenly started taking on water, BIWTC Mawa manager Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com. Three passenger buses, five sedan cars and 14 trucks loaded with goods were on board the half-sunken ferry that met with trouble near the char (shoal) on the river. The BIWTC official said the ferry was surging ahead normally until about 7pm when a leak developed and water started gushing in. "Firefighters were summoned to salvage the ferry and save the souls on board," Islam said. Several emergency pumps were being used to drain out water, he added. The leak at the base of the ferry was growing, he said, and it was getting tough for the staff to cope with the situation. "Because of the long distance from the shore, rescue efforts were also delayed." Shariatpur deputy commissioner M Anisur Rahman, however, said that rescuers had reached the spot soon after 11pm. Islam said the leak was repaired and the ferry managed to make it to shore with all passengers on board around 1am. b
