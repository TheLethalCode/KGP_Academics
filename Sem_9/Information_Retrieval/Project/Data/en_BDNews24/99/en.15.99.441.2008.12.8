 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Jail authorities have arranged a separate congregation for VIP prisoners this Eid, though their number is very small and most are undergoing treatment at BSMMU Hospital. "There are a very few VIP prisoners in jail. Most of them were released on bail. The special congregation for the remaining VIP prisoners will be held at around 8:30 am," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com on Monday. Among the prominent prisoners include Nazmul Huda, Ruhul Kuddus Dulu, Habibur Rahman Molla, Giasuddin Al Mamun, Atikullah Khan Masud and Bahauddin Nasim. All of them except Nasim are being held in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital prison ward. The central jail, meanwhile, will hold three congregations for prisoners on Eid day Tuesday at 8 am, 9 am and 10 am respectively. Authorities do not allow sacrificing of animals inside the jail. But there will be special food arrangements for all prisoners, who will also be allowed to see their relatives and have food supplied from home. bdnew
