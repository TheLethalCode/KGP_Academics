 Gopalganj, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina told supporters in her home constituency Saturday that the AL-led alliance, if voted to power, would keep the prices of essentials within people's purchasing power through "good governance"though no further detail was forthcoming on how they would achieve this after two years of mounting inflation. Hasina is scheduled to roll out the AL manifesto, finalised earlier Saturday by the party's central working committee, on Dec 12. The fomer prime minister also called on all in her native Tungipara to play a conscientious role for a free, neutral and transparent election, addressing her supporters by 'video conference'. In the 30-minute video address, starting at 4:30pm, Hasina was pictured on two giant TV screens. She promised the people of her Gopalganj-3 (Kotalipara-Tungipara) constituency: "If voted to power we will keep commodity prices within the people's purchasing power by establishing good governance." Hasina, visiting the area to mourn the death of Tungipara AL president Laik Ali Biswas, also told her supporters: "I was in jail for 11 months and then had to go abroad for treatmentbut wherever I am, my heart stays with you." Hasina said she would begin her election campaign after performing Ziarat at the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal (R) at Sylhet on Dec. 11. Sheikh Hasina's political rival, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has said she would also start her campaign from the same place on Dec. 12 or 13 after performing the rite at the holy shrine. bdnews24.co
