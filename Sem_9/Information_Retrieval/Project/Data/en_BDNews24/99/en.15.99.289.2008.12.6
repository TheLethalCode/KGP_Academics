<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  A second-half brace from Jahid Hasan helped title contenders Brothers Union overcome giant-killer Rahmatganj MFS 2-1 in the Citycell B. League encounter on Saturday. Promising winger Jahid struck both goals inside three minutes while Nche Francis slammed the consolation goal for Rahmatganj in the day's entertaining match at Bangabandhu National Stadium. With the fourth win in nine matches, Brothers Union climbed up to the third position with 16 points, one and five points behind second-placed Sheikh Russel KC and reigning champions Abahani Limited, who Friday beat Sheikh Russel 3-0 to end their first-leg campaign on the top with an invincible 22 points from 10 outings. Brothers and Russel, however, have one first-leg match each in hands. Rahmatganj, who shocked both giants Abahani and Mohammedan SC, remained on 13 points from nine matches and will play their leg-last match against Sheikh Russel on Dec 20, two days after the league resumes on Dec 18 following a 11-day break for Eid-ul-Azha. Back to the match, Brothers returned to the spree with the back of 2-0 win over leaders Abahani and fought equally in the first half against Rahmatganj, who stunned Mohammedan 1-0 in their previous match, and had to wait for the opener till 59th minute as Jahid once again put up an impressive individual show. Brothers had the target on seven minutes, but striker Mehdi Hasan Tapu drove a Motiur Munna through pass wide from an advantage position before Rahmatganj came close to a lead in the 17th minute. Capitalising a clearance by Brothers Union goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman, Francis took a over-head shot, but a fellow defender salvaged Brothers clearing the ball in the last moment. Four minutes later, Rahmatganj defender Nurul Amin Shipon handled a Munna shot inside the box, but referee Hannan Miron ignored to award Brothers a penalty shot. Rahtmatganj were deprived of a goal nine minutes into the second half when a well-judged shot from Hanif Prodhan ricocheted off the Brothers crossbar. Four minutes later, Zahid, who struck a marvelous goal from a long-range dipping shot that found the back of the sky blues net with goalkeeper Biplob seemingly unable to realize, put Brothers ahead with a powerful right footer after Henry Quaye set him inside the danger zone. Afterwards, the tall winger converted a 12-yard shot to double the margin as this time referee did not hesitate to award Brothers a penalty shot following a hand-the-ball by Rahmatganj defender Nurul Amin in the 62nd minute. Rahmatganj finally had on the target in the stoppage time as Nigerian Francis cleverly lifted the ball over the head of Brothers goalkeeper Zia, who stood at the top of the box. bdnew
