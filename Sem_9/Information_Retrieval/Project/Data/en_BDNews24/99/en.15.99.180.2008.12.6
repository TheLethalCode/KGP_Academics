 MUMBAI,Dec 6(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India on Saturday slashed its key interest rates by 1 percentage point to boost growth and shore up investor confidence amid signs of economic slowdown and in the wake of deadly attacks in Mumbai. The decision came a day after the government cut state-set fuel prices for the first time in nearly two years and ahead of expected fiscal measures to keep Asia's third-largest economy expanding, just as manufacturing activity is slowing down. Following rate cuts across Asia, in the United Kingdom and the euro zone this week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its key lending rate, or repo rate, by 100 basis points to 6.5 percent, its lowest rate in two-and-a-half years. Economists said the cuts, which were in line with expectations, were a clear positive for the economy and for markets, which were shut on Saturday but have been pummelled by the global financial crisis . "For the economy to rev up we now need fiscal measures to focus on sector specific issues," Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank, said. The reverse repo rate , the rate at which the central bank absorbs excess cash from the system, falls to 5.0 percent from 6.0 percent, its lowest in more than three years. Both rate cuts take effect on Monday. The main lending rate has now been cut by 250 basis points since Oct. 20, when the RBI made its first rate cut in more than four years to shield India from the global turmoil. Expectations of rate reductions mounted ever since attacks in Mumbai on Nov. 26 in which gunmen brought the business district to a standstill as they holed up in two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, killing at least 171 people. RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao told a news conference on Saturday the economic impact of the attacks was hard to estimate. "I am hopeful and confident that we will be able to return to normalcy, make an adjustment and our business and industries will continue their regular activity notwithstanding the terrorist attack," Subbarao said. DECELERATING The benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 31 basis points to 6.76 percent last week ahead of the RBI's decision, which had been well flagged by government officials. India had hoped to avoid the worst of the global financial crisis, with demand largely domestic driven and growth an impressive 9 percent in the fiscal year which ended last March. But economists say expansion may slow to 7 percent this fiscal year and some even predict a drop below 6 percent in 2009/10, and the government wants to keep the economy buoyed as the country heads into national elections due by May. India's stock market has plunged 55 percent this year, the rupee has hit a record low and a survey shows manufacturing contracted in November, while vehicles sales are falling. Economists did not rule out further rate cuts in coming months, and Subbarao said the central bank would monitor global and domestic markets closely, vowing swift action if needed. "Industrial activity, particularly in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, is decelerating," he said. Services, which had been a prime growth engine in recent years, were also slowing, he said, repeating a recent comment that a period of painful economic adjustment was inevitable. Along with the rate cuts, the central bank took steps to boost credit delivery to small industries, tweaked regulations to improve lending to real estate and put a cap on the cost of some export credit. "The cumulative impact of the measures in today's package, together with earlier measures, should be to step up demand and arrest the growth moderation," Subbarao said. The RBI left its reserve requirement for banks' unchanged at 5.5 percent. The government is also expected to announce fiscal measures sometime in the next few days to give impetus to the economy, but the exact timing is not known.
