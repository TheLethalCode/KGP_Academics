 Abdur Rahim Harmachi, bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  At least 891, or over 35 percent, of those who submitted nominations to the Election Commission do not have tax identification numbers, an NBR investigation revealed on Sunday. "This is terrible that people outside the tax net will contest the national elections without a TIN certificate," National Board of Revenue chairman Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com. NBR member (tax administration) Ahmed Ali told bdnews24.com, "Field level tax officials found by 6pm on Sunday that 891 of the 2,362 contenders checked so far have no TIN certificates." A total of 2,456 prospective candidates filed nominations for the Dec 29 general election. "Investigations are still ongoing and, in the end, the number may rise," Ali said. Tax officials said the NBR started investigating into tax-related matters of prospective candidates when the list of nominees was made available. Nominees of Awami League, BNP, JP and independents were among those found without TINs, said tax officials. "NBR will take legal measures against such candidates," said NBR boss Majid. "Notices will be served on them. We will also summon them to hearings and actions will follow against those failing to give valid justifications," he said. Of the country's tax areas, Khulna tops the list of TIN-less nominees so far at 122, the NBR investigation found. Dhaka district tax area registered 22 nominees without without TINs, Dhaka (greater metropolitan) tax area-2 has 71, 24 from Dhaka tax area-3, Dhaka tax area-4 has 21, Dhaka tax area-5 has 27, Dhaka tax area-6 has 45, Dhaka tax area-7 has 26, the NBR sources added. Some 104 TIN-less nominees have been found in Chittagong tax area-1, four in Chittagong tax area-2, 79 in Chittagong tax area-3, 98 in Rajshahi tax area, 100 in Rangpur, 63 in Barisal and 59 in Sylhet. The NBR chief said, "It is astonishing that prospective candidates can have no TIN, because it is unbelievable that such a person's yearly income can be less than Tk 1,65,000." The 2008-9 fiscal budget set the income tax-free limit at Tk 1,65,000 (Tk 1,80,000 for the women and the aged). At present, the country has over 22 lakh TIN-certified taxpayers of whom 6.5 lakh have submitted tax returns this year, according to NBR figures. bdnews
