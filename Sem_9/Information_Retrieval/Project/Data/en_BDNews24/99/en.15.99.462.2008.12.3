<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  Two first-half strikes from Enamul Haque helped Farashganj Sporting Club record a 2-0 win over 10-man Muktijoddha Sangsad in the B. League encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Wednesday. With the third win in nine matches, Farashganj climbed up to the fifth position with 12 points while Muktijoddha Sangsad remained in the second position from the bottom with four points, also playing nine matches. Farashganj SC dominated over the falling giants from the beginning and should have scored at least four in the first half, but the Old Dhaka outfit went 2-0 ahead in the first half and could not widen the margin later in the one-sided affair. Enamul squandered an open-net opportunity early in the game when the striker surprisingly sent a Kalu Johnson cross over the Muktijoddha crossbar from eight yards, but he scored a fine goal in the 35th minute. Enamul drove a stunning left footer from the right that found the back of Muktijoddha net before kissing the far post. Few minutes later, Enamul saw his well-judged shot from the left to rattle the Muktjoddha crossbar, but moments later, he, snatching a ball from an opponent defender, turned around inside the danger zone and hammered a powerful left footer past goalkeeper Arifuzzaman Himel. Referee Tayeb Hasan gave marching order to Azmol Hossain Biddut of Muktijoddha in the dying moment due to his misconduct. bd
