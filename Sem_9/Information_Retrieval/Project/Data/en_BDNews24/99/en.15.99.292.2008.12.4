 Abdur Rahim Harmachi, bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Loan defaulters have found recourse in the law as before, in the form of court awarded stay orders, to qualify for election, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said on Wednesday. Some 42 prospective candidates, including those of Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Party and independents, initially classified as bank loan defaulters by the central bank have managed to 'declassify' themselves through the judicial system, the adviser said. Expressing helplessness at such a state of affairs, Mirza Aziz told bdnews24.com: "We can only bitterly regret that defaulters are escaping through court stay orders, but we the government can do nothing about it." Meanwhile, Bangladesh Bank credit information bureau (CIB) said a total of 312 classified borrowers secured stay orders until Dec. 3. "Some 42 defaulters obtained court orders staying their CIB classification over the last four days alone," a top CIB official said. Bangladesh Bank executive director, and CIB chief Khandaker Mazharul Haque told reporters on Wednesday that returning officers from all over the country sent a list of 2,447 candidates who filed nominations and CIB found 88 of them classified as loan defaulters until Tuesday late night. "We have sent letters to the EC and returning officers about them." Mazharul said, "The central bank will appeal to the court against the stay orders and senior lawyers have been appointed in this regard. Commercial banks have been instructed to follow suit." "The central bank has prepared a list of those who have defaulted over Tk50,000 and the list will also be sent to the Election Commission and the returning officers," he added. The finance adviser also told bdnews24.com that he had strongly urged the central and other banks to take measures to prevent defaulting borrowers from slipping through the legal loopholes. "As a citizen of the country I want to see defaulters out of the polls race." Asked to disclose the list of 88, BB executive director Mazharul Islam said banking law barred any such disclosure. Asked about lists appearing on the press, Mazharul said only: "There are dissimilarities with our list." bdnews
