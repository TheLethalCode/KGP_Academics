<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec. 4 (bdnews24.com)  Some extraordinary decisions are being made in cancelling nominations, due to new laws including 91(E) of the RPO, which gives the Election Commission power to veto candidacy, said a senior BNP leader on Thursday. "It is the first time elections are being held under a new law. This will create complexities and we made the EC aware of that," said BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan. "It is being seen in some cases that returning officers are making extraordinary decisions," Khan said at a press briefing in the chairperson Khaleda Zia's political office in Gulshan He gave the example: "The nomination paper of BNP nominee Rafiqul Islam, for Jhalakathi-1, was cancelled by returning officers for giving his assets and income and expenditure accounts in the wrong slots of the form." "The returning officer should have taken it under consideration, but he did not. He just cancelled the nomination. And there are more such cases of which we have informed the commission." Rafiqul Islam Jamal has appealed to the EC, Khan said, expressing hopes that the EC would consider the case with sympathy. Reiterating the need for withdrawal of emergency, he said, "There is no reason for keeping emergency in force in the present circumstances." In answer to a question, he said, "If the four-party alliance has no candidate in any constituency after finalising its list, they will support their friendly independent candidate, but no independent candidate will receive any four-party symbol." Nazrul Islam Khan, expressed condolence over the death of Ganotontree Party president Nurul Islam, who succumbed to severe burn injuries after a fire on Wednesday in which his son also died. Khaleda Zia's information cell chief Maruf Kamal Khan Sohel and media coordinator Mohiuddin Khan Mohon were present during the press conference,. bdnew
