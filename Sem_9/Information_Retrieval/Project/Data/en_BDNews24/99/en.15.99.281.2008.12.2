 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Tuesday postponed the admission process for one month to seven Dhaka University departments for the 2008-09 session. The bench of justice Mirza Hossain Haider and justice Shamim Hasnain gave the order following a writ petition by five madrasa-educated students challenging recent changes to admission criteria. The departments introduced the new rules earlier this year barring students from seeking admission who have failed to study English and Bangla for 100 + 100 mark exams at HSC or equivalent level. The rules affect madrasa students, who argue the criteria are discriminatory. On Oct. 26, the High Court asked the DU authorities to show cause as to why the disputed criteria should not be declared illegal, on the writ petition by the five admission seekers who secured GPA-5s in madrasa education board exams. An activist group under the banner "Madrasa Students Rights Protection Committee" has also been carrying out demonstrations to press home their demand to cancel the new admissions rules for the DU departments. The seven departments, under the arts and social sciences faculties, are Bangla, English, Economics, Mass Communication and Journalism, International Relations, Linguistics and Gender and Women Studies. bdnews
