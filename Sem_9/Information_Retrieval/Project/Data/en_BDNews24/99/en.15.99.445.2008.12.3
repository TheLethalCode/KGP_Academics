 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner said on Wednesday registered political parties must confirm their final candidates to returning officers by Dec. 4, but for alliances the deadline was being relaxed until Dec. 11. "There is no scope for independent candidates to get party nominations after filing," ATM Shamsul Huda said. Awami League, earlier in the day, approached the EC to allow political parties until Dec. 11, the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers, to finalise candidates. "There are some problems in finalising candidates before scrutiny," HT Imam, the party's election committee coordinator, said. "That's why we have asked the commission to give us time to finalise the candidates until the last date of withdrawal of nomination papers." The CEC, briefing reporters later on Wednesday, said: "In case of more than one nominee for a constituency, the party must tell the returning officers in writing the order of their preference and Dec. 4 is the last date for submitting the final list, according to the RPO." According to an EC notice sent to all returning officers last week, this applied to alliances too. But, the CEC said they had relaxed the criteria for alliance candidates, allowing them until Dec 11, the deadline for withdrawal. Asked if the AL demand was rejected, the CEC said, "It was a misunderstanding. The law says party candidates must be finalised before scrutiny of nominations started." "Scrutiny will be done on Dec. 3 and 4 and parties can finalise their candidates by that time." Huda said 'no' to a further change in the RPO, but noted that if there was a change the EC would act accordingly. The amended RPO stipulates that before scrutiny of nomination papers, the parties notify returning officers of final candidates. But there is provision of keeping a 'panel' or list in 'order of preference' of nominees for a constituency. According to the election schedule, hearing of objections against any EC decision on candidature will be held from Dec. 5-7. The last day for withdrawal of candidacy is Dec. 11. The deadline for submission of nomination papers was Nov. 30. bdnews
