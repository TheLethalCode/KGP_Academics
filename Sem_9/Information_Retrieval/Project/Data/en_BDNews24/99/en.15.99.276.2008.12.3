<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket's global governing body has dismissed reports the sub-continent could lose the 2011 World Cup due to safety fears following last week's militant attacks in Mumbai. "It is media speculation, no basis for those comments," an International Cricket Council (ICC) spokesman said on Wednesday. The one-day World Cup is due to be jointly hosted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in early 2011. Senior cricket officials in Pakistan, India and New Zealand had also made it clear such reports were premature, the spokesman added. "It is two-and-a half years before the tournament," he told Reuters from ICC's Dubai headquarters. "It is not an issue at this point in time and we look forward to a fantastic event." The siege in Mumbai, which killed 183 people, forcing the England squad to rush home after calling off the last two games in a one-day series. A security expert will advise the England board whether it should send the squad back for a two-test series starting on Dec. 11. Pakistan is already grappling with security concerns in the wake of a spate of suicide bomb attacks. The ICC postponed the September Champions Trophy to late next year after five of the eight teams threatened a boycott. The attacks in India's financial capital have also strained political ties between the two neighbours, dimming hopes India would allow its cricket team to tour Pakistan next month. Sri Lanka also has safety issues due to a resurgence of violence in its own ethnic conflict. "Obviously safety and security is paramount and that is the case for all our members," said the ICC spokesman. "(But) we also recognise the fact that cricket has the ability to build bridges. "When India toured Pakistan in 2004 after (almost) 15 years, look at the positive impact it had." He denied extra security would prove a financial burden. "Safety and security is regarded the same way as making sure the playing facilities are okay to make an event a success," he added. "Whatever cost there is, it is a necessity to bear the cost. Those costs are not to be saved on.
