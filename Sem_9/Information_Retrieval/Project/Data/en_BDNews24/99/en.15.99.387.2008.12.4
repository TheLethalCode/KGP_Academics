 COMPIEGNE, France, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A French aid worker held hostage in Afghanistan for a month has been released, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Wednesday. Daniel Egreteau, who was working for French aid agency Solidarite Laique, was kidnapped in Kabul on Nov. 3. "I am delighted about his release, which took place a few minutes ago," Sarkozy said during a visit to the town of Compiegne, north of Paris. "He is well, his family is being informed. He has to go through a few medical checks and we will bring him back to France late tomorrow," Sarkozy added. A videotape obtained by Reuters last week showed Egreteau pleading for his life as gunmen held assault rifles to his head. He said in the recording that he had been held in a small, dark room, blindfolded and chained for eight days. "We were very worried about him," Sarkozy said. Taliban insurgents, criminals and armed groups have kidnapped dozens of foreigners in Afghanistan in the past two years, Most have been freed unharmed, but a few have been killed. Three Turkish citizens who were kidnapped in August were released last week
