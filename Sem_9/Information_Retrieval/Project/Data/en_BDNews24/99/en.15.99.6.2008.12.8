<TITLE> Doubts reappear as Moeen contradicts EC: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)Doubts have reappeared over polls, after differing dates given by the Election Commission and the army chief for deployment of troops over the election period, says BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. Delwar also reiterated two conditions on which BNP and its allies "decided to go to election", speaking to reporters Mo0nday. "The four parties are willing to go to election, but the state of emergency must be lifted and section 91(E) of the RPO must be annulled by Dec 11, the last day for withdrawal of candidacy." "We decided to go to election on these two conditions." On the alleged 'confusion over polls', he said: "The EC announced that the army would be deployed on Dec 24. On the other hand, Moeen U Ahmed has said they will be deployed from Dec 20." "This creates confusion and doubt among the people," Delwar told reporters at the party's Naya Paltan office after a meeting of the four-party alliance. Following the deferment of parliamentary polls from Dec. 18 to Dec 29, election commissioner Mohammed Sohul Hussain said the army would patrol election areas, just as a 'show of force', from Dec. 24 to 31. However, army chief Moeen U Ahmed told reporters in Chittagong Saturday: "Army personnel will be in the field for the upcoming national elections, from Dec 20 not from Dec 24." Delwar criticised the army chief's separate announcement: "The army is supposed to assist the EC as a 'stand-by force', to hold a fair election. But the army chief's contradictory remarks have created doubts and confusion." Delwar had earlier chaired a meeting with Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote leaders on seat sharing. He said leaders of the alliance would meet at BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office later in the evening to settle seat allocations among the allied parties. bdnews
