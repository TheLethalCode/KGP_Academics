<TITLE> Rat race begins for political appointments </TITLE>

 Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)With less than six weeks to go before president-elect Barack Obama takes office on Jan 20, a rat race has begun in earnest among hundreds of thousands of Democratic supporters and activists vying for government jobs that are reserved for political appointees. "It's hard to find a parallel in modern times to this degree of enthusiasm for going into government," Michael Beschlos, a presidential historian, told the New York Times. So far, a staggering 300,000 people have applied for 3,300 positions that are going to be available with the departure of President Bush. This is perhaps the biggest number of job seekers ever recorded for an incoming administration. The equivalent number during the George W Bush transition eight years ago was about 90,000 applicants. Despite the flood of applicants, the Obama transition team appears unfazed. In its Washington transition office more than 50 aides have been working feverishly vetting every resume. Obama officials have said they might have more than double their current number of applications by Inauguration Day. "There are a lot of people who want to work in the administration," David Axelrod, a senior Obama aide, exulted to reporters this week. "That's great for the country." But not necessarily great for the job seekers because there are actually only about 3,300 positions an incoming administration gets to fill. That means that despite the appealing notion of hordes of eager newcomers swarming to change Washington, the vast majority of those seeking jobs will be disappointed. In fact, most of the job seekers were perhaps unaware that the percentage of politically appointed employees in the federal government is very small, a mere 0.17 percent of the civilian work force of 1.9 million. In all, there are about 1,000 senior positions in the federal agencies that require Senate confirmation. These are typically positions like assistant, deputy and under secretary. There are 8,000 senior bureaucrats in what is called the Senior Executive Service and by law, no more than 10 percent, or 800, of these managerial positions may be filled by political appointees. Finally, an incoming administration has some 1,500 jobs to fill, known as Schedule C slots, with salaries ranging from about $25,000 to $150,000. (That adds up to 3,300, not including hundreds of federal judges, diplomats and members of boards and commissions.) The situation for job seekers is further complicated by what seems to be the unresolved issue, chronic to many administrations, as to whether hiring decisions in federal departments will be made by the cabinet secretaries themselves or the White House. The long odds of landing a position have probably contributed to the frenzy of job seekers trying to gain whatever advantage they can. One advantage, of course, is if a job seeker knows his or her Senator or Congressman well enough, who would be willing to forward the resume to the transition office. No wonder, influential Democratic Congressional leaders are swamped with applications. One such leader is the New York Senator Charles Schumer. His aides said they had, so far, about 100 requests for jobs at all levels of government. Schumer himself added another explanation for the flood of job seekers: Democrats, he said, are more likely to believe in the power of government to improve things.
