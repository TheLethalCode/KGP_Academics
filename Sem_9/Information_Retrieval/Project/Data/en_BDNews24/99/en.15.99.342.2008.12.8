 MILAN, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani said he hopes David Beckham falls for the Serie A club during his short-term loan stint from Los Angeles Galaxy and decides to stay longer. "Let's hope he falls in love, the problem is that he has lots of advertising contracts," Galliani told Sky television. "Let's hope feelings prevail, although at the moment it seems unlikely because I've seen his advertising contracts and they are scary." The 33-year-old is moving to Milan to keep up his fitness during the United States close season and stay in contention for an England squad place. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti has said in the past that he would like to sign Beckham permanently. But Galaxy and the midfielder have said he will return to the U.S. in the spring for the start of the 2009 Major League Soccer season. Galliani said the player will arrive in Italy later this month. "He's coming on Saturday (Dec) 20, he'll do the medical examinations, the press conference and attend Milan v Udinese (on Dec 21)," Galliani was quoted as saying by Monday's La Gazzetta dello Sport. "He'll have seven days holiday and then this adventure will start in Dubai (at Milan's winter training camp). "I don't know how long it will last. At the moment, it's just for two and half, three months.
