 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)Liberation war hero A K Khandakar and at least four others had their nominations validated while former junior ministers Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and Lutfozzaman Babar failed to convince the EC as hearing on appeals continued on Monday. Khandakar, an Awami League nominee for Pabna-2, argued successfully that he was not a loan defaulter. Gias Uddin Quader Chowdhury, BNP candidate for Chittagong-5 (Raozan), Kazi Faruk Ahmed, Nagorik Andolon nominee for Khulna-2, Rafiqul Islam Khan, Jamaat-e-Islami choice for Sirajganj-4, Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, AL candidate for Feni-2, also won their battle for candidacy, their lawyers said. Former civil servant and AL state minister for planning Alamgir (Chandpur-2), former BNP state minister for home Babar (Netrokona-2) and BNP's Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan (Khagrachhari) failed to make it. "The allegations of loan default were proved false," a jubilant Khandakar told reporters at the EC in the evening. "The Commission has declared my candidature valid." On the third day of hearing on Monday, the EC disposed of 65 appeals until evening. The EC was yet to announce the official results of Monday's hearing. A K M Salimullah, an EC official, said a total of 128 petitions were to be cleared on the day. In the previous two days of hearing, the EC had validated 67 nominations after hearing of appeals. bdne
