<TITLE> Tigers back home </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh national cricket team returned home Tuesday night from South Africa after being beaten in both one-day internationals and Test series against the hosts last month. On arrival at the Zia International Airport, Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful Islam told reporters that his team could not perform, as well as they did against New Zealand in the home series, against South Africa since they were not used to the bouncy wicket. "We just took on hosts South Africa after playing against New Zealand at home, where we played on slow wickets, but the pitches in South Africa were so bouncy," said Ashraful. The Bangladesh captain said that they could not adapt to the fast and bouncy pitches causing batting debacle especially in Test matches. The captain also thought some decisions in the second Test went against them. Bangladesh lost both Tests by innings and runs as the second and final Test ended inside three days after the rain-hit first match rolled into four day. He said, "We were actually beaten by the pace though our game plans were sessions by sessions." The 24-year old top-0rder batsman demanded bouncy wickets at home. Ashraful, however, said that they played comparatively well in the lone Twenty20 match and the first two one-day internationals before the third match was washed out. "I am happy in the way the boys had played in the T20 and ODIs," said Ashraful adding that it was always tough for the team playing against South Africa in their home condition, but we tried our best to perform well. The youngest Test centurion said that he was enjoying leading the side from the front rather than to feel any pressure despite his poor performance in South Africa. Asked whether they missed the experienced batsmen who joined the ICL, Ashraful said that it was always fine to see the experienced batsmen in the fold, but we didn't play bad in South Africa. Ashraful said that they were now concentrating on the home against Sri Lanka this month and hoped to play better. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, suspended from bowling in international cricket for illegal bowling action, looked gloomy and hardly talked about it to the reporters. Razzak said that he felt nothing well. "I am confident that I will be able to come back though I still know no details of the analysis reports." bd
