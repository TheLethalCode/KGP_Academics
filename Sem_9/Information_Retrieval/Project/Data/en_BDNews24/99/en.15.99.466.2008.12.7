<TITLE> England players keen to play in India, says coach Moores </TITLE>

 ABU DHABI, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's cricketers are keen to return to India for a two-test series after their tour was suspended following last week's attacks in Mumbai, coach Peter Moores said on Saturday. "There's a strong feeling that we want to go and play these tests," Moores told the England and Wales Cricket Board website (www.ecb.co.uk). "There's a general will within the team to go and play these test matches. Because, one, people will be representing their country but also in the situation we find ourselves after what happened in Mumbai." The England team, along with nine members of the England Performance Squad, are training in Abu Dhabi as ECB security experts evaluate the situation at the test venues. A final decision on the tour will be made on Sunday night after the latest security reports. The first test starting on Thursday was moved to Chennai from Ahmedabad and the final test to Mohali (Dec. 19-23) from Mumbai. England returned home last week after the one-day series was cut short following the militant attacks in Mumbai that killed at least 171 people. "Everyone will have different opinions and if someone doesn't want to go we will respect that," Moores said. "Hopefully we can take our full-strength side there, compete, win the series and have a good Christmas." The team's preparations was affected by rain on Saturday, but Moores said it was important for his players to be mentally ready for the test series. "Mentally, everyone has to assume we are going," he said. "It's about (getting) your skills ready to go as a batter or a bowler. It's such a quick turnaround now, so the lads have got to get themselves (together) really quickly if they are going to be ready." "The practice has been compromised quite a lot, we are practising in the wrong country but the lads are in good spirits." England lost the curtailed seven-match one-day series 5-0. "It is more of a mental shift we need now, we have been playing one-day cricket for a long time and we need to get ready for test cricket, and the disciplines of the longer form of the game," Moores added. "We cannot use the compromise to practice as an excuse for poor performance.
