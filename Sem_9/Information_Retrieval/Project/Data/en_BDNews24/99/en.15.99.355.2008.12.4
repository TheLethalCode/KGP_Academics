<TITLE> Obama to uphold US Taiwan policy, says envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, Thu Dec 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -US President-elect Barack Obama will uphold Washington's stance on Taiwan, meaning strong informal ties with the island China claims as its own despite formal relations with Beijing, a US official said on Thursday. Obama, who takes office on Jan. 20, had voiced support for a $6.4 billion US arms package approved in October and indicated he would be open to a long-sought new round of high-level trade talks, said Stephen Young, director of Washington's de facto embassy in Taipei. Some analysts predict that Obama, a Democrat, will move closer to China and pull back from from Taiwan, which has traditionally drawn more support from US Republicans. China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's forces won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's KMT fled to Taiwan. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, recognising "one China", but is obliged by the Taiwan Relations Act to help defend the island. "On Taiwan, it's safe to say there will be a tremendous amount of continuity," Young said at an American Chamber of Commerce event. "In sum, I think our friends in Taiwan have nothing to worry about." Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou said on Wednesday he expected US-Taiwan ties to improve under Obama, whom he described as someone who is seen taking a "multilateral" instead of "unilateral" approach to foreign relations
