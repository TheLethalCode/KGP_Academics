The ordinary practice is for Muslim burials to be conducted quickly, within a few hours of death. "Just because you call yourself Musa, Azim or Rehman you don't become a Muslim. These people who carried out such attacks cannot be," said Syed Noori, another Muslim leader who attended Tuesday's meeting. Ten Islamist militants armed with AK-47s and grenades let loose on two of Mumbai's best-known luxury hotels and other landmarks across the city of 18 million during a 60-hour frenzy that ended when commandos killed the ninth gunmen. A 10th was arrested after a mob set upon him. India's minority Muslims, forming about 13 percent of the 1.1 billion population, have felt under siege every time Islamist militants launched an attack in the country. "We have even written to the government conveying our decision. Our Muslim brothers across the country are unanimous about it," he told Reuters.
