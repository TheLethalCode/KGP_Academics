 Rohan Ziad Business correspondent Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  The twin bourses of the country marked a hearty rise ahead of Eid after being in the red for almost two months. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark DGEN or general index, gained 85.18 points, or 3.46 percent over the week to end on 2,544.66 points. The DSI or all share price index finished at 2,103.79 points on the last trading day of the week, up by 68.37 points, or 3.36 percent. Most of the traded scrips rose throughout the week.

Total turnover on the DSE was Tk 9.19 billion from Tk 11.25 billion the previous week. The daily average turnover came down to Tk 1.83 billion from Tk 2.25 billion. The later part of the week witnessed a huge fall in prices as a mild nervousness struck retail investors over the World Bank's depressing growth projection of the economy. Business leaders and economists of the country, however, rejected the WB's claims. The Chittagong Stock Exchange also witnessed a rise over the previous week. The selective categories index or CSCX went up 3.5 percent to 5,131.32 points. The all share price index or CASPI also increased 3.42 points to 7,888.44 points. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the port city bourse by 120 to 28 and five scrips remained unchanged. A total of 2,33,14,942 shares worth Tk 1.93 billion changed hands while the previous week saw 1,54,06,463 traded shares worth Tk 1.75 billion . Meanwhile, the market regulator and the bourses were pretty much keen over the last week on measures to ease the situation. The Securities and Exchange Commission sat with merchant banks which resulted in outflows of supports to investors and with brokerage houses from merchant bankers ahead of the Eid holidays. The SEC also asked for central bank's intervention in expanding brokerage houses' lending capacity. Banks and other financial services witnessed considerable rise over the week while energy and power, ceramics, service and real estate emerged as top gainers Pharmaceuticals also gained considerably due to rise in majors like Square Pharma and Beximco Pharma. The week's major development included SEC's approval of draft rules on book building method, a market driven mechanism to set prices of IPOs (initial public offering) on Tuesday. The market regulator provisionally agreed to remove the limit on loan exposures of banks and NBFIs in a bid to tackle the liquidity crisis. Currently, banks and NBFIs are allowed to provide margin loans in portfolio investment to their clients up to five times their respective paid-up capital.
