<TITLE> My cancellation had no legal basis: AK Khandaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  AK Khandaker, the Awami League nominee for Pabna-2, has alleged that cancellation of his nomination had "no legal validity", but was done to tarnish his image. "I cannot be called a loan defaulter because no person or organisation has taken any loan through me," said the convenor of the Sector Commanders Forum and former air force chief. The Election Commission cancelled his nomination on Thursday on grounds of loan default. In its decision, the commission said that Khandaker had taken loans from IFIC Bank's Motijheel branch as chairman of private airline Air Parabat and defaulted on payment of Tk 14 crore. The bank had filed a case against him, the EC said. But Khandaker told reporters on Saturday: "There is no legal validity to cancel my nomination." He said that he had gained the director post through a 1.25 percent share in the airline. Before taking over the post he told the organisation that he would not be involved in any financial activities, Khandaker said. "Moreover, when Air Parabat applied for a loan, I resigned from the director post," he said. "But there was delay in my resignation letter being submitted to the bank," he added. "I did not sign any financial documents of the organisation and did not become a party to any loan." "Apart from this, one does not take on the financial burden of an organisation if one owns less than 20 percent share," Khandaker told reporters at the AL president's Dhanmondi office. bdnews
