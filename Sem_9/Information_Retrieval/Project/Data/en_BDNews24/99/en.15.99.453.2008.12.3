 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com) - A set of regulations to prevent and punish sexual harassment at higher educational institutions has been drafted and will be in force soon, the education adviser said on Wednesday. "The draft contains a broad spectrum of recommendations from 'warning to expulsion from academic institutions' against anyone involved in such activity," Hossain Zillur Rahman said. A sub-committee drafted the 'Regulations for Preventing Sexual Harassment and Repression 2008' to be submitted to the education ministry on Dec 7, the adviser said. Speaking to reporters after a meeting at the education ministry said the regulations will come into force soon after approval. The need to enforce regulations against sexual harassment came to the forefront after a number of such allegations in educational institutions and the sub-committee began its work after the most recent such scandal at Jahangirnagar University. According to the draft, university authorities will determine any punishment based on allegation and degree of crime, after investigation, said the education adviser. "They also suggest setting up a centre to prevent sexual harassment at each college and university," Hossain Zillur said. Each prevention centre will comprise representatives from the concerned educational institution, home ministry, education ministry, women and children affairs ministry and other concerned authorities, Zillur Rahman added. The draft regulation has recommended that four separate groups  teachers, students, officials and employees, and dormitory authorities  should launch a mass awareness campaign against sexual harassment and also take preventive measures. The regulations may be enforced at college-level institutions and other workplaces, the adviser added. Education secretary Mamatazul Islam and University Grants Commission chairman professor Nazrul Islam, both members of the sub-committee also attended the meeting among others. bdnews24.
