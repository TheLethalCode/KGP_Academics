 NEW DELHI, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's middle order batsman Yuvraj Singh was rewarded for his rich form in the one-day series with a recall on Thursday for the tests against England. The left-handed batsman hit successive match-winning hundreds in the first two games of last month's one-day series against England, which India clinched 5-0. England are due to resume their aborted India tour after calling off the last two one-day games and returning home following last week's attacks in Mumbai which killed 171 people. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) sent a security expert to address player safety concerns before announcing on Wednesday the squad would return provided the hosts implemented all suggested precautionary measures. The first test starts in Chennai next Thursday with the second in Mohali scheduled from Dec. 19 after India moved the matches from Ahmedabad and Mumbai to address England's safety concerns. Yuvraj, overlooked for the home test series against Australia which India won 2-0 last month, made his last test appearance in April, in the third and final match against South Africa in Kanpur. The attacking batsman, who hit 138 not out and 118 at the start of the England one-day series, is a strong contender for the middle-order slot vacated by former skipper Saurav Ganguly, who retired after the Australia series. The selectors dropped left-arm paceman Rudra Pratap Singh owing to poor form and included left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha. The 22-year-old, who has played five one-day internationals, will be the back up for off spinner Harbhajan Singh and leg spinner Amit Mishra. Squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Amit Mishra, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Subramaniam Badrinath, Munaf Patel, Murali Vijay, Pragyan Ojha
