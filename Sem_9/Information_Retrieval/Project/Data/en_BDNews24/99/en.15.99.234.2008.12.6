 Arshad Mahmud writes for bdnews24.com from Washington Washington DC, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Ostensibly inspired by the fairy tale story of Barack Obama's rise to American presidency, a wealthy African-American businessman has decided to open his heart and his purse for a group of underprivileged so that they can be part of the historic event that would officially inaugurate the president-elect on Jan 20. Earl Stafford, founder of a technology company in Virginia, has booked 300 rooms for three nights at the Marriott Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is close to the White House and where the main inaugural parade would be held. By most estimates, the inauguration of the 44th president will be the biggest in history. "We're hoping those who had no expectations of being a part of this can have one of the best seats, one of the best views of Washington," the 60-year-old good Samaritan told ABC News. Despite intense demand surrounding the inauguration, Stafford managed to buy the million-dollar "build your own ball" package the Marriott recently advertised, in hopes of bringing less-fortunate groups into the democratic process. "Those who are marginalised, those who are terminally ill, our wounded veterans and because we don't want to exclude our young people, we'll also have a 300-person youth ball," he said. At least a third of Stafford's guests will be from underprivileged communitiesthe homeless, victims of domestic violence, and Hurricane Katrina victims. The hotel's $1 million package also comes with $200,000 worth of food and exclusive use of the hotel's 12th floor balcony with great views of the inaugural parade. Inaugurations are times for parades and parties to salute a new president. With 10 or 12 inaugural balls this year, the lavish events to celebrate Obama's arrival are in high demand. District officials are preparing for a crowd of up to 4 million peopleonly a fraction of whom will be able to attend the events. But Stafford's guests will get the VIP treatment. On top of the $1 million package, Stafford has set aside another $600,000 for two more inaugural balls at the hotel and is even ready to provide tuxedos and ball gowns for his guests. "We believe that it is important for us to include those who are less fortunate, because, like Barack Obama, we, too, believe in the American dream," said Stafford. The entrepreneur says the event has evolved beyond his "wildest dreams." His wife, Amanda, hopes "our feeble effort to do good in America may be contagious and that other people and other organisations will look and say, 'Well, you know, things might be a little tough for us, but we can still give.'" But many wonder why anyone would give so much to strangers. Stafford, the son of a Baptist minister, said, "Someone once said if the Lord be your partner, make your plans large. "When you seek to bless others, then you're blessed." He is also encouraging other groups to focus on the people he is invitingnot his charitable gesture. Stafford's wife said that knowing they've made a difference in the lives of others is reward enough. "To see the look in someone's eyes who never dreamed that they could have this opportunityjust looking to see someone happy and to know that we've made a difference in someone's life," she said. "I will be just looking for those happy faces.
