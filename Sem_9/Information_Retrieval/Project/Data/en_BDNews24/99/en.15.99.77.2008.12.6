 MUMBAI, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The police said on Saturday that they had arrested two people suspected of acquiring mobile phone cards used by the Islamist gunmen who carried out the Mumbai attacks. Police in Kolkata said they had arrested two men they identified as Tausif Rehman and Sheikh Mukhtar on Friday. "We are questioning them about procurement of SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards used in Mumbai," Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of detectives in Kolkata, told Reuters. If the men are involved, it would be further evidence of Indian complicity in the three-day rampage New Delhi has blamed on Islamic militants from neighbouring Pakistan. In February police arrested an Indian citizen, Faim Ansari, who was carrying maps of Mumbai that highlighted several of the targets later hit in the attack. At least 171 people were killed in the attacks last week in which 10 gunmen struck two luxury hotels and other landmarks across India's financial capital. Airports in New Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai remained on high alert for a fourth day on Saturday, with extra security personnel deployed after the civil aviation authority said it had received intelligence that attacks could be planned
