 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)EU ambassador Stefan Frowein highlighted the freedom of media as a cornerstone in safeguarding human rights on Sunday, which marked 60 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. "We should never forget that journalists are also defenders of human rights," Frowein said Sunday at the inauguration of a human rights jamboree celebrating the anniversary. "The protection of media freedoms and avoidance of intimidation and harassment of journalists is also an important benchmark for human rights values," said the head of the European Commission delegation in Dhaka. "They are often in the frontline when it comes to voicing support for democratic values and reflecting an accurate picture of developments in a given country," said Forwein. Chairman of the newly formed National Human Rights Commission Amirul Kabir Chowdhury vowed to ensure human rights "without fear or favour", "without being influenced or intimidated", as he opened the jamboree at the Spectra Convention Centre in the city. He repeated a call to the interim government to lift the state of emergency to protect human rights. "Some sections of emergency power rules are against human rights. Therefore, the sooner the state of emergency is lifted the better for safeguarding human rights," said Chowdhury. "I can give you solemn assurance on behalf of the commission and two other members that the commission will discharge its duties without fear or favour." "We can assure you further that we shall try to face the challenges as far as possible with courage and determination without being influenced or intimidated," the chairman said. The National Human Rights Commission started functioning from Dec 1 this year. bdn
