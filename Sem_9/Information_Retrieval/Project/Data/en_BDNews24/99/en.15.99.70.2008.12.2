<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  A senior central bank official said on Tuesday 76 of the general election candidates defaulted on loan payment and 31 more were listed in SMA (special mentioned account). Bangladesh Bank executive director and credit information bureau (CIB) chief Khandaker Mazharul Haque told reporters that the Election Commission sent a list of 2,139 candidates who filed nomination and 76 of them were found to be loan defaulters. "We are probing the accounts of 31 more listed in the SMA." Mazharul said the CIB would finalise the total number of "loan defaulters" out of the list of 2,139 candidates sent by EC by 9pm on Tuesday. The central bank executive director declined to comment on a question about if there were anyone from the major political parties in the list. He, however, said some 35 defaulters got the court's stay orders and managed to declassify themselves over the last few days. bdnews24
