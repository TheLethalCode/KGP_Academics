 Narayanganj, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  Angry workers on Sunday night vandalised a knitwear factory, demanding their dues ahead of Eid, and blockaded the Dhaka-Chittagong highway causing homebound holiday-makers to be stuck in tailbacks. Workers of MSU Knitwear factory at Siddirganj set fire to a store of the factory, alleging that factory owner Shahidul Islam broke his promise to pay off 400 employees dues of two months' salaries and festival bonus, witnesses said. At least 20 people, including police and workers, sustained injuries when police tried to disperse the demonstrating workers, who in retaliation, pelted brickbats at the police. Additional police super of Narayanganj Masud Karim said police fired 41 shots of rubber bullets to bring the situation under control. The blockade on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, meanwhile, lasted for an hour with the protesting workers vandalising a number of vehicles causing a huge traffic jam on the highway, which added to woes of hundreds of homebound people of Chittagong, Sylhet and other destinations. Siddirganj police officer in-charge Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com at 10pm that traffic came back to normal. bdnews24.co
