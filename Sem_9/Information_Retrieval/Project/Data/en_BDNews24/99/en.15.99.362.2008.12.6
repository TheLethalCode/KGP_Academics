<TITLE> Failure to formulate a coal policy ruinous: Mirza Aziz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Saturday admitted that the interim government's failure to formulate a coal policy might be "disastrous", but cited "differences in opinion" as the cause. "It's bad luck that we couldn't formulate a coal policy to date," the adviser said. "For lack of a policy our country is faced with a disaster in terms of inability to fully utilise its resources," Aziz said. "We have some of the best quality coal, but we can't use it for lack of a policy; instead we have to consider importing coal from India for for our power plants." He requested the would-be government to formulate a patriotic policy on coal. The finance adviser was addressing a seminar on 'Maximising Growth for Bangladesh: A Private Sector Vision' held at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on Saturday. The FBCCI-organised seminar presented a 138-point charter of sector-wise proposals for the incoming government to achieve 8 percent GDP growth, placing emphasis on power and energy needs. Aziz also spoke of "grooming a skilled administration", saying it would be impossible to build such an administration if wages of the government officers and staff are not raised. "Once government personnel used to get the highest wages, but the situation is different now. If a non-government officer gets Tk 50,000-60,000 now, a government officer of the same qualification and skill gets only Tk 10,000-12,000," Aziz said. "If their wages are not increased to the expected level, a smart administration will not grow, you can bet." NBR chairman Abdul Majid, FBCCI president Anisul Huq, BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez and former advisers and economists professor Rehman Sobhan and Wahiduddin Mahmud, high officials, experts and politicians were among those who also spoke. They all asked for even distribution of growth, infrastructure development, power sector development, good economic governance, priority to the agriculture sector, prevention of corruption and a commitment from the politicians to rid the country of 'hartals'. bdnews
