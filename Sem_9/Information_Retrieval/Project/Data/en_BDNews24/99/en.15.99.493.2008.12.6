 MILAN, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news before this weekend's Serie A matches (all times GMT): Inter Milan strikers Adriano, 26, and Mario Balotelli, 18, have been left out of Jose Mourinho's squad for the trip to Lazio on Saturday (1930 GMT). Mourinho, whose side are six points clear at the top, has overlooked the pair on and off throughout the season having been frustrated by their levels of commitment. "Balotelli will play with the youth team tomorrow so that he understands the difference with Serie A," Mourinho told a news conference, adding that Adriano was under the weather. Catania coach Walter Zenga is banned from the touchline for Sunday's match at AC Milan (1400) after verbally abusing officials at last weekend's 1-1 draw with Lecce. Striker Giuseppe Mascara joked that the coach's absence may help the Sicilians against a Milan side who have not won in four games in all competitions. "At least we'll hear fewer insults from the bench," he told Gazzetta dello Sport. Midfielder Cristiano Zanetti, who has not featured for second-placed Juventus this season because of injury problems, could make the bench for Sunday's visit to Lecce (1400). Striker Mirko Vucinic is out of AS Roma's game at bottom side Chievo on Saturday (1700) because of a knee problem, the club's website said (www.asroma.it). Media reports say Torino coach Gianni De Biasi could lose his job if his struggling side lose at home to Fiorentina on Sunday (1400). Sampdoria playmaker Antonio Cassano, who came off the bench in Wednesday's 3-0 UEFA Cup defeat at Standard Liege, will return to the starting lineup for Sunday's city derby with Genoa (1930)
