 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Asian Development Bank's South Asia chief Kunio Senga on Thursday urged the next elected government to press on with the caretaker government's reforms in banking and economic sectors. "Bangladesh has already begun harvesting the positive outcome of those programmes taken over the last two years to maintain macroeconomic stability," Senga, director general of South Asian Department of the ADB, told reporters. He met with finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam at planning ministry in the city. "Bangladesh is on the right track, with a good condition of GDP, over six percent. The country's economy has been in good condition even in the ongoing economic crisis." "The government has managed everything well," Senga observed. The ADB assured the government of credits to face any negative impact of the global economic meltdown on the economy, he added. Mentioning that the ADB provided Bangladesh over $2 billion in last two years, Senga said its assistance will carry on in the future. Talking to reporters, Azizul also recommended that the next elected government continued with his government's economic reform programmes. "Personally, I also think it will have positive impacts on our economy if the reform programmes in banking and economic sectors are continued in the future," he observed. "I've assured the ADB director general by saying we hope the next government will continue with our reform programmes, as there is no basic difference among the political parties on economic issues." The ADB sought Bangladesh's contribution to increase its general capital to expand its credit-assistance programme, Azizul said. He said he feared the bank might be facing a capital crisis in the coming days. He, however, said he did not believe the global economic crisis might cause the potential general capital crisis. " Pakistan's appeal for a big amount of loan to face its economic crisis might be a reason behind it," the finance adviser said. On the ADB's probable capital crisis, Senga said, "The ADB may face the crisis by the end of 2009. So we've sought for Bangladeshi help to increase our capital." ADVISER, ARMY CHIEF MEET Earlier, the finance adviser had a meeting with the army chief General Moeen U Ahmed at the planning ministry to discuss "some financial issues of army". Asked about the agenda, a smiling Azizul said, "There is nothing to worry. The election or politics was not on the agenda." "We discussed some financial issues of army. Nothing else." bdn
