 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)City authorities are moving to ensure stricter security in the capital's diplomatic zone seen to be hampered by illegally parked vehicles, makeshift structures and erratic driving by residents in Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara. "Rajuk has been asked to get rid of all illegal structures raised indiscriminately in the city districts earmarked to be used by diplomats and diplomatic offices and institutions," said the public works secretary Wednesday. In the wake of the recent Mumbai disaster, the home and foreign ministries alerted the housing and public works ministry to clear the zones of all kinds of security threats, said secretary Rashidul Hai. "The public works ministry in turn issued relevant orders to Rajuk and other concerned city authorities." "Rajuk said it will soon undertake measures to dismantle all illegal constructions in the diplomatic zone, the directions were given at a meeting at the public works ministry Wednesday." Hai told reporters after the meeting that illegal and makeshift structures have cropped up everywhere in Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara diplomatic zones, posing a threat to the safety of residents. The presence of educational institutions in the zone also causes problematic traffic and parking conditions, he added. Hai also briefed reporters on a 'Detailed Area Plan' (DAP) developed to render Dhaka a more liveable city. The ministry had invited relevant opinions and complaints from the public on the draft plan. "About 15,000 citizens responded, based on which the DAP will be revised before placing it before the cabinet," said Hai. "Some 25 percent of the area under the plan has been allocated for roads, which when implemented should take care of the perennial traffic tailbacks." The DAP covers an area of about 1,528 sq km under Gazipur, Tongi, Narayanganj, Rupganj, Savar and Keraniganj for development. bdnews
