 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  Ganotontree Party president Nurul Islam was laid to rest at Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard at Mirpur on Friday after political leaders and activists paid their last tribute by showering flowers on his coffin at the Central Shaheed Minar. Islam's coffin was brought to the Minar from Dhaka Medical College Hospital at 11:45am. A stupefied Ruby Rahman, Islam's wife, stood by the coffin. She lost both her husband and only son while she had been away in the US. Islam, president of Bangladesh Trade Union Kendro, died on Thursday at the Combined Military Hospital, Dhaka from fatal burn wounds. A 14-party alliance nominee to contest the forthcoming polls from Noakhali-1, he had sustained serious burn injuries in a fire at his Lalmatia flat early Wednesday morning. First admitted to DMCH, he was transferred to the CMH. His son Tamohar Islam, 36, died in the accident. Islam's first namaj-e-janaza was held at Dhaka University central mosque after the juma prayers. The second funeral prayers took place at Hazaribagh Leather Technology College ground. Leaders and workers of Awami League, BNP, Communist Party, Workers Party and other organisations assembled at the Shaheed Minar and paid their last respects to the dead. The Ganotontree Party flag was flying at half mast beside the national flag and a black flag. The AL adjourned a meeting of the central working committee on Friday morning to pay respects to Islam. Awami League presidium members Abdur Razzak, Motia Chowdhury, BNP's joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and Mahbubul Alam Tara, Gano Forum president Kamal Hossain, Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, Dhaka University vice chancellor SMA Faiz, former VC AK Azad Chowdhury and many others were present at the Shaheed Minar. Earlier, as the coffin arrived at the Minar, a contingent of police gave the deceased a guard of honour, while 25 freedom fighters saluted the coffin of Islam who had fought the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. The Election Commission on Thursday postponed the elections to Noakhali-1 parliamentary constituency that Islam was to run for. bdnews24.c
