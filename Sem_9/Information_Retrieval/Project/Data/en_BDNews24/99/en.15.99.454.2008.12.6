 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)The leather industry has called for special government initiatives during the upcoming Eid to help the sector as it faces the fallout of the global economic crisis. "Due to the global economic hardship, international buyers have become more reserved in their expenditure and a lot of orders of leather products have been cancelled," Rezaul Karim, president of the leading leather goods association, said Saturday. "The leather sector is faced with bad times," Karim said at a press conference jointly organised by Bangladesh Finished Leather Goods and Footwear Exporters Association (BFLLFEA) and Bangladesh Tanners Association arranged The country still has unsold leather products costing about Tk 500 crore, Karim said. "The market has fallen by 40 to 5o per cent and the price of good leather has fallen by 50 per cent," the BFLLFEA president added. "If the government and the banks do not stand behind the leather business at this time, the whole industry faces jeopardy," he warned. The leather sector must have loans at low interest, cut in interest on previous loans, more time to pay back loans, and assurance of advance loans in view of Eid, the leather association chief said. The two associations and leather businessmen fixed the rate of animal skin for this season prior to the press conference. In Dhaka, the price of each square foot of animal hide has been priced between Tk25 and Tk30 while the rate is between Tk20 and Tk25 outside the city. "During Eid, animal skin is bought at a higher rate than us by certain quarters and, sometimes, they force skinners to sell to them," said Harun Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Tanner's Association. He stressed that the two associations had no link with such traders. "We have had discussions with the police, RAB and law enforcers to prevent such unscrupulous seasonal 'businessmen' from operating," said Chowdhury. bdnews
