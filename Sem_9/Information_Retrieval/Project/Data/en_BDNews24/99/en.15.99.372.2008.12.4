<TITLE> Fresh proposal on gas price hike soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com) Petrobangla will make a fresh proposal on hiking the price of gas, in line with an order of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), chairman of Petrobangla Jalal Ahmed said Thursday. "A new proposal will be made and sent this month,' he added. Petrobangla's proposal to raise the price of gas was dismissed by BERC on Nov 30. In a meeting BERC observed that the accounts of Petrobangla were not transparent and therefore the proposal to increase prices was not acceptable. The commission ordered Petrobangla to fix an average rate that could be made effective from July 1 next. BERC has observed that to ensure energy security in the country, gas price could be raised 10 to 15 per cent with the aim of forming a 'Gas Development Fund'. Petrobangla on June 23 proposed a massive 60 percent hike, however. The price of gas was last raised on Jan 1. Petrobangla has since made five proposals for price hikes which have been dismissed. bdnews
