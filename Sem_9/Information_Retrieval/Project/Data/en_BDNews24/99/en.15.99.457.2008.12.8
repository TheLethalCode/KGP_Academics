 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has apparently cleared the way for Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka to run for the parliament as it stayed on Monday a High Court ruling that had dismissed his writ petition against the Election Commission's decision to bar him. A special Appellate Division vacation chamber judge's court of justice Joynul Abedin passed the order upon a provisional 'leave to appeal' and stay petition of the mayor. Khoka's counsel Ruhul Quddus Kajal told bdnews24.com that the Appellate Division stayed for six weeks the HC order that had dismissed Khoka's writ petition on Election Commission decision that mayors of city corporations cannot contest any election until three years from the date of their resignation. "Now the Dhaka mayor will be able to contest the forthcoming parliamentary election," he said. Khoka's senior counsel Rafiq-ul-Huq submitted before the court that the post of mayors are not a post of profit, according to the new electoral laws, the mayors are eligible to contest the poll. He further argued that the High Court erred in law in upholding the EC's Nov. 17 decision. On Dec. 4, the High Court bench of justices Tarique-ul-Hakim and Farah Mahbub passed the judgment dismissing the writ appeal of Khoka. The court on Nov. 25 stayed for four weeks the Election Commission's restrictions on Khoka in contesting the general election. Khoka filed the writ petition on Nov. 23 challenging the decision. b
