<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has published a draft policy on the installation and operation of submarine cable by private firms, its chairman said on Thursday. "For the development of the information and communication technology of the country, we must have an unhindered place on the information highway," Monjurul Alam, a retired major general, said in a statement. "Once the alternative submarine cable is placed, the risk of being disconnected from the rest of the world will be minimal." If two more submarine cables are established then bandwidth will increase along with the speed on the Internet, he said and hoped that this would also create greater employment opportunities. The draft guidelines have been published on the BTRC website (www.btrc.gov.bd) to elicit opinions to finalise the guideline. Anyone can send opinion on the draft to submarine_cable.btrc.gov.bd by Dec. 18. According to the draft guidelines, two licences will be provided for the installation and operation of submarine cable for 20 years and the duration may be extended later Bangladesh is connected to the international SEA-ME-WOE-8 submarine cable, operated and maintained by Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd. The application fee for licence is Tk 50,000 and the licence fee will be decided through an open auction. Half the money has to be paid within 30 working days of getting the licence and the rest in one year, the policy says. Institutions that submitted proposals in the past can apply for the work of laying out submarine cable and also make new applications. Foreign companies having a consortium with a local organisation can also apply for licence but, in that case, the ownership of the foreign company cannot exceed 49 percent. The foreign investment has to be made in foreign currency, the draft policy says. bd
