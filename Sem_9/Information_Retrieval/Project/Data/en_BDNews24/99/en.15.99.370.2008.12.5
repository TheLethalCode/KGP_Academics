 Dhaka, Dec 5(bdnews24.com)  The media will face no restrictions in covering the forthcoming general election, said the chief election commissioner on Friday. "The code of conduct for the mass media would not be formulated since there is no time. The media would play the role in the election just as they had before," said ATM Shamsul Huda. The commission dropped the plan to formulate the code of conduct for the mass media after deliberating much on the issue, he said at a discussion styled "Ninth parliamentary elections: our mass media" in Dhaka University's Nabab Ali Chowdhury Senate Bhaban. UNESCO made a draft policy on the code of conduct after the EC on Nov. 11 took initiatives to devise the code for the media. The discussion was moderated by Prof Sheikh Abdus Salam, chairman, Department of Mass Communication and Journalism and organised by Dhaka University's Mass Communication and Journalism Alumni Association. Huda blamed loan defaulters and bill defaulters as barriers to the EC's efforts to create a level playing field for all. "Many influential loan and bill defaulters are taking part in the election through court stay orders. But other defaulters have not been able to do that. So discrimination among the candidates are there." He said they had little to do when the court issued stay orders. He added there was no more doubt about the election taking place on Dec. 29 JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu, BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah, daily Ittefaq editor Rahat Khan, Jatiya Party leader GM Quader, professor Sakhwat Ali Khan, professor Harun-ur Rashid, dean, Faculty of Social Science, Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique, Shwakat Mahmood, president of National Press Club, Abdul Kaiyum Mukul, also attended the discussion. bd
