 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) - Jail authorities on Sunday moved former BNP lawmaker Mossadeq Ali Falu in with the general prison population for seven days for breaching the jail code by holding a meeting with a political leader, jail authorities said. "The authorities also suspended the jail guard Mohammad Ali of Kashimpur Central Jail-1 in Gazipur for allowing Falu to hold the meeting," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said. Falu held a 45-minute meeting with former lawmaker and Islami Shashontantra Andolon amir Mufti Shahidul Islam on Saturday at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where the jail authorities had taken Falu for a check up. However, both Falu and Ali have denied the charges against them while interrogation during an investigation into the allegation, Shamsul Haider said. After cancellation of the division, Falu have been provided with essential utensils, two sets of clothing and three blankets, for living with common prisoners. Earlier, Falu was transferred to a jail in Lalmonirhat district on charge of talking over mobile phone while staying in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Medical University prison cell. bdnews
