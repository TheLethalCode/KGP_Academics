 Maruf Mallik, bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Power Division has ordered re-tenders for two proposed 450 MW power plants at Bibiana and Sirajganj, a top official said on Tuesday. He told bdnews24.com orders had been given to fast-track the implementation of the 150 megawatt power plant project in the coastal district of Bhola. Power Division officials have said Malaysia's Powertek Consortium was the only bidder for the 450 MW power plant at Bibiana in Habiganj. "The advisory committee on government purchase had to cancel the tender because of the overpriced quotation by Powertek and subsequently order the re-tender," a high official at the ministry of energy and mineral resources said. Powertek quoted 4.399 cents per kilowatt hour of sales against its previous offer of 4.53 cents, said the official, familiar with the matter. The Power Division primarily chose four bidders under technical selection but only Powertek Consortium, with its two associates Korean Electric Power Company (KEPCO) of South Korea and German Siemens, finally submitted the tender. For the Sirajganj 450 MW power plant Power Tech was also the lone bidder at the pre-bid meeting, with the other contenders backing off though the date of tender submission expires on Jan. 31. A senior official at the Power Division told bdnews24.com that Powertek was unwilling to join the final bid for the Sirajganj plant as it feared a possible recurrence of the Bibiana situation in this case. "The tender procedures could be easier the next time specially in case of the source of fund and technical aspects," the official, who asked not to be named, said. AES Corporation (USA), Powertek and KEPCO were selected for the Sirajganj plant at the pre-bid meeting. The ministry has constituted a five-member committee with Power Division director general Abdul Jalil as its head to finalise re-tender papers. The committee will finish the tasks in five days, the official said. bd
