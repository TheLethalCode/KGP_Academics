<TITLE> Army to be out for polls from Dec 20: Moeen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  The armed forces will be deployed countrywide from Dec 20, ahead of the national elections, army chief Moeen U Ahmed said on Saturday. "Army personnel will be in the field for the upcoming national elections, from Dec 20 not from Dec 24," Moeen told reporters in Chittagong. A top election official, however, had said just last week that the army would patrol election areas from Dec. 24 to 31. The period of deployment was being pushed back in line with deferment of the parliamentary polls from Dec. 18 to 29, election commissioner Mohammed Sohul Hussain said on Nov 29. "The army will patrol election areas two days prior and after Election Day just as a 'show of force'," the commissioner had said. The army chief on Saturday maintained that troops would be deployed from Dec 20, adding: "The army will carry out its duty properly in the elections, we will do exactly the jobs we will be assigned to." "We will not be in polling stations," he said. "But we will watch so that there are no criminal activities in the stations, and we will ensure that voters can turn out without any fear." The Election Commission has said the army will be deployed as a 'striking force' but army personnel will not be present inside voting centres. Only police, ansars and village defence parties will be deployed inside the centres to maintain law and order. Election officials have also decided against members of intelligence agencies being present in the EC 'control cells' which will be located at the home ministry and at the offices of each returning officer. On when the state of emergency would be lifted, Moeen said on Saturday: "You will see it lifted soon." bdnews
