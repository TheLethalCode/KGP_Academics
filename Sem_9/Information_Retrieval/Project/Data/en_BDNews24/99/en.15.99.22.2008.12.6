<TITLE> Points more important than record, says Chelsea's Scolari </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari is more concerned with getting Chelsea's title challenge back on track at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday (1500 GMT) than equalling the top-flight record for consecutive away wins. Maximum points at Bolton would give Chelsea 11 successive victories on the road in the Premier League, eclipsing Tottenham Hotspur's record from their 1960-61 double-winning season. "I don't think about this, only about the points we lost at home (to Arsenal last Sunday) and we need to recover these three points," Scolari told reporters. "Points are more important than the record." Second-placed Chelsea have 33 points from 15 matches, one point behind Liverpool but five ahead of Manchester United who have a game in hand in third spot. United host Sunderland on Saturday (1730), the first outing for the visitors since manager Roy Keane quit on Thursday, while Liverpool travel to lowly Blackburn Rovers and fourth-placed Arsenal host Wigan Athletic (both 1500). Aston Villa, in fifth, visit Everton on Sunday (1600)
