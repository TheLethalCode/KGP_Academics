 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone has earned the right to sponsor the upcoming one-day and Test series involving Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe beginning this month. The series includes two Tests between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, a tri-nation one-day international series involving Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, and a three-match ODI series between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. Marketing director of Grameenphone Rubaba Dowla Matin said at a press conference on Wednesday they had earned right at the cost of Tk 1.30 crore that included full title rights, prize money and rights to branding the two stadiums as well as the team buses. Bangladesh Cricket Board senior vice-president Mahbub Anam, media committee chairman Jalal Younus, marketing committee chairman and Grameenphone CEO Oddvar Hesjedal also spoke at the conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. "It is an exciting occasion for me and I am happy to announce Grameenphone's sponsorship, and we hope to hear the roar of Royal Bengal Tigers in upcoming series," said Oddvar, the chief of the country's largest mobile-phone operator by subscription. He highlighted Grameenphone's contributions to cricket, adding that the company had been sponsoring the national team since 2003. Anam, also chairman of the BCB working committee, thanked the mobile operator and said, "The previous ad-hoc committee completed the sponsorship deal and we have just took over the onus from them." Aziz Al Kaiser of the BCB said, "The amount of sponsorship money depends on team's performance, conditions of the state, the relationship. But, you know we just took over one day before and hope to overcome all gaps in coming days." The first Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will take place on Dec. 26-31 with a day's break on Dec. 29 because of the general election.
