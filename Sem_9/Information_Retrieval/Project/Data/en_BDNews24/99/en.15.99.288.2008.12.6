<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  The country's top trade body, presenting a comprehensive charter of sector-wise proposals for the incoming government to achieve 8 percent GDP growth, has placed most emphasis on power and energy needs. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry has asked the would-be government to implement the proposals, covering 37 sectors, in the first 100 days after taking power. "FBCCI on Nov. 15 had placed a 52-point recommendation cover 21 sectors for the incoming government in its first 100 days. Now we make it 138 points aiming at an eight percent GDP growth rate," said federation president Anisul Huq. Huq placed the proposals at a seminar on 'Maximising Growth for Bangladesh: A Private Sector Vision' held at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on Saturday. On refurbishing the energy sector the federation laid a short-term 8-point recommendation for more rental power plants (RPP), establishing additional 500 MW power plants and replacing machinery of 20-year old or more plants. The recommendations also included a BAPEX five-year work-plan with exploration and drilling in at least six wells. The business leaders demanded at least one well be drilled in the first 100 days of the new administration. "But there's no alternative to coal production," Huq said, adding the new government should finalise a coal policy if the incumbent interim administration failed to do it. The recommendations on 'financial management and banking' demanded setting up of an NRB council for the non-resident Bangladeshis along with forming a financial crisis management taskforce, comprising representatives from both public and private sectors. The demands also included cuts in service charges by 30 per cent, interest rates for project loans and working capital for 'productive industries' by two percentage points and rate spread to four percentage points. "Commissions for foreign exchange transaction should be decreased to one per cent while the exchange rate on export earnings and foreign remittances should rise," the FBCCI chief said. The would-be government in the first 100 days should announce a special economic zone for garments, ship-building, leather, plastic, information technology, light engineering and agro processing industries and finalise plans to develop infrastructure for an industrial village, the proposal said. On roads, the business community insisted that work on the four-lane expansion of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway must accelerate and new authorities must finalise plans and start work on an elevated expressway network to solve the capital's traffic congestion. The business leaders also urged formation of a national shipping infrastructure development council for easy and cheaper transportation of commodities. All industries and the ports must be kept immune from 'hartals,' a deep-sea port must be established, service standard of ports be upgraded and Mongla port be used in its full capacity, the proposal said. The FBCCI chief mentioned that Bangladesh, despite natural and political odds over the last five years, enjoyed more than six percent GDP growth. "The three advantages for local and foreign investors in Bangladesh are cheap labour, a huge market of 15 crore people and a gateway for the Asian market of 300 crore people," he said. "Bangladesh can easily achieve eight percent GDP growth if the recommendations are heeded properly," said Huq. Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, former advisers and economists Rehman Sobhan and Wahiduddin Mahmud were among the guest speakers. bdnews
