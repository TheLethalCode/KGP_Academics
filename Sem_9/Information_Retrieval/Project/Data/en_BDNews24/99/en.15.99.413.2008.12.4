 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Relatives of Ganotontree Party president Nurul Islam, in critical condition in hospital, have demanded a proper investigation into the fire that broke out early Wednesday at Islam's home. They also alleged in a press conference on Thursday that the fire at Islam's Lalmatia home, in which his son died, occurred "to foil the election". Islam, who sustained critical burns, lost son Tamohar Islam, 36, in the tragic incident. "We believe the incident occurred in a planned way as part of a conspiracy to foil the national election," said Islam's niece Nazma Kawsar, in a statement at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity. Mahfuza Khanom, sister of Islam's wife Ruby Rahman, said the family hoped to file a case in this connection by Thursday. She also demanded halting election to the Noakhali-1 constituency. Islam, in 1991, ran the general election from Noakhali-1 as a candidate of an Awami League-led eight-party alliance, and marginally lost to the BNP-led four-party alliance contestant. This time, Golam Quddus, general secretary of Sammilito Sanskritik Jote, had initially been nominated by the AL-led alliance for the seat in the run-up to the Dec 29 election. Following negotiations over seat-sharing by the allies, Islam was finally nominated to run from Noakhali-1, Ganotontree Party leaders said. The four-party ticket for the seat has gone to Mahbubuddin Khokon, lawyer of BNP chief Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman. bdnew
