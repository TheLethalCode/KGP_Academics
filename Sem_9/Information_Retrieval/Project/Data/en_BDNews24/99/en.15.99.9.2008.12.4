 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)Celebrity guests watched and dined Thursday as celebrity chef Tommy Miah showed off his skills in a live demonstration of recipes designed exclusively for readers of bdnews24.com. "This is really a dream come true for me. The world can know my recipes through bdnews24.com," Tommy Miah told his audience at a restaurant in the capital. "I want to say, without media, Tommy Miah does not exist." The country's only online newspaper in partnership with the renowned UK-based chef was celebrating the launch of the new culinary site (www.bdnews24.com/tommymiah) to promote "the best of Bangladesh" around the globe. "bdnews24.com has made its mark. I am very glad to be here to share a great celebration," said foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, before he pressed a button to launch the site flanked by Tommy Miah and bdnews24.com's chief editor. "Tommy Miah is not just a celebrity of Sylhet, not just in Bangladesh, not just in England but throughout the United Kingdom," said the adviser. "Today we know that Tandoori is a cuisine which bridges Britain and Bangladesh." "When we say Britain and Bangladesh share common values  that is the bridge that connects us, a hyphen that links us." Agriculture adviser CS Karim too had high praise for the venture: "You have done a great job here." He said: "Smart people connecting smart brands surround us tonight." "To promote Bangladesh around the world, we have to act in such a way as to show the Bangladesh flag in every sphere." Education adviser, Hossain Zillur Rahman, said: "I applaud bdnews24.com and Tommy Miah for two different celebrations." Mentioning their success in their respective fields, he said: "I really feel proud for the way we as a nation are trying to graduate ourselves. It is these smart people creating the new nation and creating the new sense of belonging. "bdnews24.com has done a sterling job of really bringing a new type of dimension to news gathering and making sure that responsible journalism is also a very important part of the contribution they are making." "And when young people will come to know that a chef commands world's respect, the young will also get enthused." Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, along with his spouse, came and congratulated Tommy Miah and bdnews24.com. The foreign adviser, referring to "one very big thing in common with Tommy", said: "It is a moment of great pride for me. Because some of you may know that I hail from the same place as Tommy Miah does which is Sylhet. "Sylhet is key to establishing these international linkages which will make Bangladesh an important actor in the international community," said the interim foreign minister. Tommy Miah, one of the foremost exponents of Asian cuisine, said: "Few people realise that around 90 percent of the 'Indian' restaurants in the UK are in fact Bangladeshi." "My recipes for bdnews24.com will include not only unique versions of traditional dishes but also examples of my 'fusion' cooking, which incorporates worldwide trends." He stressed that the recipes will only be available on bdnews24.com, not elsewhere. "Bangladeshi dishes are winning international acceptance through the efforts of thousands of cooks who have ventured from their homeland to establish highly-regarded restaurants around the world," pointed out Toufique Imrose Khalidi, bdnews24.com chief editor. "Edinburgh-based Tommy Miah is an outstanding example. Arriving in the UK at the age of 10 without a word of English or any catering background, he has established an enviable reputation in the hospitality business." Tommy Miah won entry into the Guinness Book of Records by cooking the world's biggest curry, started the International Indian Chef of the Year competition in 1991 to promote innovation and quality in ethnic cuisine, and has produced several cookery books for charity, including one with a foreword by Queen Elizabeth II. Despite being based in Scotland, he headed the Bangladesh catering team at the first SAARC Food Festival held in New Delhi. Other luminaries included former chief justice Mustafa Kamal, chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim, former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo, labour secretary Dr Mahfuzul Haque, NBR chairman M Abdul Mazid and his wife, Manavjamin chief editor Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, Bangladesh Today editor Mahmud ur Rahman Chowdhury, National Museum director general Samsuzzaman Khan, Women's Entrepreneurs Association (WEAB) president Nasreen Awal, freedom fighter Masud Sadique, FAO chief Ad Spjikers, Ambassador Tufail Karim Haider, Ambassador Ashfaqur Rahman, writer and researcher Raana Haider, Dilshad Rahman, Mamtaz Farooqui Chowhdury, Nazneen Azim, Hamdard managing director Hakim Yusuf Harun, Hamdard director Kazi Mansurul Haq, Adcomm deputy managing director Nazim Farhan Chowdhury, barrister Sanjana Sadique were among those attending the ceremony at the launch at Kasturi Restaurant in Gulshan in the city.
