 Dhaka, December 4 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury Thursday told reporters that her party would accept the results if the upcoming parliamentary election is free and fair. "We'll accept whatever the results of the election are if the polls are held in an environment which is free, fair and acceptable to all," said Motia Chowdhury. On US senator John McCain's call to all to accept both victory and defeat, she said: "Everybody here will accept the election results readily if the polls are held in the same spirit as the US has done." "But people will have to keep in mind how Al Gore was shown defeated in the polls there too." Inaugurating a training session organised for Jubo Mohila League polling agents at Awami League's central office, Motia also assured all that if voted to power this time, AL will ensure good governance across the country. The AL leader added that the executive council was expected to approve the party's election manifesto on Friday, after current amendments were completed. bdnews2
