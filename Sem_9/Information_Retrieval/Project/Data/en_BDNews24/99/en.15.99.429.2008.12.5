 NEW DELHI, Fri Dec 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -India's new home minister admitted on Friday there had been security lapses surrounding last week's Mumbai attacks, which New Delhi has blamed on militants from neighboring Pakistan. The ruling Congress party-led coalition has been under fire over what the opposition says is its weakness on security, after a series of bomb blasts this year in cities was capped by the three-day rampage by 10 Islamist gunmen in India's financial capital. "I would be less than truthful if I said there were no lapses," Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in Mumbai. "These are being looked into. We will address the causes that led to the lapses." Chidambaram took over the post on Sunday after predecessor Shivraj Patil quit. Elections are due by May and analysts say Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh must demonstrate decisive action to counter criticism over security. Underscoring the collective jitters after the attacks, gunshot-like sounds heard at New Delhi's international airport early on Friday sparked a security scare. Police said no one was hurt. Police and commandos closed down the area by the heavily guarded airport, while an SUV with a lone occupant sped away. Police gave chase but lost the vehicle, NDTV news channel said. The rampage in Mumbai killed at least 171 people. India has said nine militants were killed and one captured alive, but U.S. analysts said there could have been more who escaped. "I think there are more. My sources say (there were) at least 23 of the gunmen," said Farhana Ali, a former CIA and Rand Corp counter-terrorism analyst and expert on militant networks. "If that's true, that makes one wonder why we haven't seen more attacks. Are they lying low?" she said. "I think they (Indian authorities) are bracing themselves for more." David Kilcullen, who has served as a senior counterterrorism adviser to U.S. General David Petraeus and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said he agreed that were probably more attackers. "The Indians said there were 10 attackers, based on the fact that they captured one and killed nine -- you have to assume there are more out there," he said. Indian newspapers said the Pakistan military's spy agency ISI was involved in training the militants, who are said to belong to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group that has been blamed for earlier attacks in India. "The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) connection was clear and evident," the Times of India quoted Indian intelligence sources as saying. The Hindu newspaper said investigations into the Mumbai attack had led to the names of handlers and trainers of the Islamist gunmen and the locations where the training was held. These were believed to be military or ISI men. Pakistan has condemned the assault, denied any involvement by state agencies and vowed to help the Indian investigation, but it wants proof of Pakistani involvement. But the attacks have brought tension to ties between the nuclear-armed rivals and a four-year-old peace process is in danger of unraveling. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in both New Delhi and Islamabad this week, mediating between the old enemies, who have fought three wars since independence in 1947. "This was a terrible attack. It was a sophisticated attack, a level of sophistication that we haven't seen here on the subcontinent before," Rice told a news conference at a military airfield in Islamabad before departing. "That means that there is urgency to getting to the bottom of it. There is urgency to bringing the perpetrators to justice and there is urgency to ... disrupt and prevent further attacks." But she played down fear of a military response by India, saying the global struggle against terrorism needed cooperation. President Asif Ali Zardari, who had been trying to push forward a peace process with India, told Rice he had asked India to see this as a chance to work together rather than be at odds, saying: "I intend to do everything in my power." "The government will not only assist in investigations but also take strong action against any Pakistani elements found involved in the attack," a statement quoted Zardari as saying
