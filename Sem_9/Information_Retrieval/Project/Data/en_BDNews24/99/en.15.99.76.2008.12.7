 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  A visiting USAID official has sought to dispel worries that dwindling funds due to financial crisis will affect aid flows to countries such as Bangladesh. Margot Ellis, deputy assistant administrator for Asia, told journalists Sunday that she did not foresee any major change in development assistance towards Dhaka under the new US administration. She referred to president-elect Barack Obama's pledge to double development aid and said: "We really don't know at this moment, but we don't expect any major changes." "We are working closely in health, education and democracy," she said and described the US assistance to Bangladesh as "long term and robust". Ellis made her comments at a media roundtable at the American Club. Praising the country's Imam-awareness training programmes that she had also viewed in Indonesia, she said: "We hope to replicate it in other countries too." During her three-day tour of Dhaka, the number two at the Asia desk is scheduled to visit a USAID-funded clinic and HIV/AIDS programme, as well as meet with Imams involved in the social development programmes. Asked about Chevron's controversial seismic survey in Sylhet's Lauachera, country director of USAID Denise Rollins expressed her sympathy for the local people. "It was heartening to see them forming human chains," she said, adding that local residents had to make a stand to protect forests and other such delicate areas. She said USAID, working in association with locals, had reduced illegal activities in Lauachera. Admitting that there had been some adverse impact, she nevertheless said there has not been any great loss at Lauachera. Rollins pointed out that the gas company that has been charged with ecological damage worked there as part of an agreement with the government. bdnew
