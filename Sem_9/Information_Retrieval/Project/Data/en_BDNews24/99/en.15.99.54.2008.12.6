 Rangpur, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has asked the government officials to work together to ensure a free, fair and neutral election. "I sincerely hope that officials who are biased towards any specific party are not in charge of the polls," said the chief adviser while addressing government officials of the Rajshahi division at the RDRS auditorium in the city on Saturday. "The people of this country are waiting to select the candidate of their choice and therefore, we must resolve to present the nation with a neutral, free and acceptable election." Strict measures will be taken if there are allegations against any official, he said. Citing this election as an electoral model, he hoped that the people of this country would remember it in the days to come. He also made a call to ensure voting rights of women, indigenous communities, handicapped people, the elderly and the ethnic population. The acts of extremist underground organisation Jamaatul Mujahideen may threaten the election, he apprehended, but asked for ironing out such activities. "These anti-social elements should never be allowed to stand up again." The chief adviser also ordered Rajshahi divisional officials to ensure that terrorists in the hideout do not manage to come back and asked the BDR to maintain heightened vigilance near the border. Presided over by Rajshahi divisional commissioner Hafizur Rahman Bhuyan, the meeting was addressed among others by education adviser Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, home adviser Abdul Matin, cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz, home secretary Abdul Karim and field level officials of Rajshahi division. bdnews24.com/corres
