Abbas also appealed to the HC bench of justice Mirza Hossain Haider and justice Borhan Uddin for staying his conviction in the case. A trial court sentenced the BNP leader to 8 years imprisonment in the case. Advocate Ahshanul Karim moved the petition for Mirza Abbas, while attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed opposed it. A separate HC bench of justices Mir Hasmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain judged illegal the detention of former BNP lawmaker MAH Selim alias 'Silver Selim'. The court directed the government to set Selim at liberty if he is not wanted in any other case. Barrister Rafuque-ul-Haq represented Selim in the hearing.
