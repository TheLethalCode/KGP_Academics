<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Caroline Kennedy, daughter of slain President John F. Kennedy, is considering pursuing the New York Senate seat Hillary Clinton will vacate to become secretary of state, The New York Times reported on Friday. "I believe that she is considering it," the newspaper quoted Kennedy's cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as saying, adding he had spoken to her about the matter during the past week. "A lot of people the last couple of weeks have urged her to do it," added Kennedy, another member of the Kennedy Democratic political dynasty. He recently removed himself from consideration for the seat, once held by his father, Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 while running for president. New York Democratic Gov. David Paterson, who is responsible for choosing Clinton's replacement, told the newspaper he discussed the Senate seat on Wednesday with Caroline Kennedy, a 51-year-old lawyer. He characterized the conversation as "informational." "She did not express an interest in the Senate," the Times quoted Paterson as saying on its website. "But we talked about the Senate, so I got that she was just trying to get some information to determine whether or not she would like to have an interest in it." Paterson added he had not offered the job to anyone yet. Kennedy and her uncle, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, were influential supporters of Barack Obama's successful presidential campaign. Other candidates said to be possibilities for the anticipated vacancy include New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, several members of the state's congressional delegation and even former President Bill Clinton. The person appointed by Paterson would serve for two years and then face a special election in 2010
