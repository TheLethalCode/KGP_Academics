 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  The fuel prices may fall further this month, the special aide to the chief adviser on energy said on Sunday. "The energy ministry is observing the fluctuation of the price of fuel in the international market," M Tamim, special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of the ministry of energy, power and mineral resources, said. "We have to sustain the lower price of fuel for sometime and, for that, the market has to be observed for three months and then an average price has to be fixed," he said to reporters after a symposium arranged by Petrobangla on Bapex. "We cannot raise the price immediately after we reduce it because of the fluctuations in the international market." A three-month average price will be fixed for the next three months and that rate will remain even if the price of fuel escalates, Tamim said. "A big factor for reducing the price of fuel is the price of fuel in India. If we fix the rate at Tk 30 per litre and if that is Tk 50 in India then half of the fuel will be smuggled out to India," he observed. "Apart from the price of fuel in India, we also have to keep an eye on the international market." The government wants BAPEX, the state-owned oil and gas exploration company, to develop into a company of international standards, Tamim said. "Hopefully, with the government's seven-year plan, this will become a powerful organisation." At the programme, the main paper was presented by Imaduddin, managing director of BAPEX. "If everything goes according to plan, then BAPEX will be able to supply surplus gas worth Tk 600 crore by 2015," he said But, for that, an efficient workforce and an increased price of gas are needed, observed the managing director. Energy secretary Muhammad Mohsin and Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed spoke at the symposium. bd
