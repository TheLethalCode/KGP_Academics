 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League-led 14-party alliance has said the death of Gonotantree Party president Nurul Islam was nothing but a 'premeditated murder' and asked for a through investigation. A meeting of the alliance held on Thursday at the office of the AL president made the demand. "Attempts were made to kill Nurul Islam; this is not a natural death but a planned killing," said AL presidium member Abdur Razzak. Motia Chowdhury, another presidium member, also received a letter from banned militant outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), Razzak said. "The government is silently tolerating such acts of sedition." He also said that no conspiracy to foil the election will be tolerated. Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Syed Ashraful Islam of AL, Hasanul Huq Inu of JSD, Dilip Barua of Samyabadi Dal and others were present at the meeting. bd
