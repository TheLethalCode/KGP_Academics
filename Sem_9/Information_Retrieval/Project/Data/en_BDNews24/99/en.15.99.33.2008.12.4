<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh needs not worry about the global financial meltdown but it should not relax either, the finance adviser has said. "We should keep an eye on the whole situation and initiate corrective measures as needed," AB Mirza Azizul Islam said on Thursday. He made the remarks at a discussion on International Monetary Fund's recently published report "Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific" at Bangladesh Enterprise Institute in the city. He said balance of payment did not pose a threat. The adviser however said remittance may slow down in the future due to the recent downturn of developed economies. IMF resident representative Jonathan Dunn read out the key presentation at the discussion. He said Bangladesh needed to keep in mind that there was mounting evidence that trade financing is becoming harder to obtain in Asia. Dunn suggested that Bangladesh focused more on developing the capital market for trade financing. The discussion was chaired by BEI chairman Farooq Sobhan.
