<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed stressed the tourism sector's role in development, as he launched the new Parjatan-designed country brand'Beautiful Bangladesh'in a vibrant ceremony at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel on Saturday. With the right branding, Bangladesh's thousand years old history, heritage, and culture can reach across the globe, he said, as the much-anticipated new country brand logo was revealed through a dazzling laser show on stage. But, Fakhruddin also highlighted the need for an investment-friendly climate to achieve the country's 'branding' aims. "Branding, now-a-days, is a key factor for broadening the image of the country," said Mahbub Jamil, special assistant to the chief adviser for civil avaiation and tourism. He expressed optimism over the success of the branding process. "Bangladesh will, one day, be chosen by the people across the world for tourism, sports and its products. 'In Bangladesh' and 'From Bangladesh' will be popular all around," said Jamil. The Parjatan Corporation sees the tourism industry taking off through 'country branding', make Bangladesh and its attractions among the foremost destinations for holidaymakers to the subcontinent. "All countries of the world present their national heritage through branding but we have been unable to do that over the last 37 years," says Parjatan chairman Shafiq Alam Mehedi. "We are still a newcomer in this sector, but for us, tourism could be the main source of foreign currency," believes Shafiq. The country branding initiative has been jointly organised by Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation and non-government mobile operator Banglalink. Banglalink will carry on the local marketing. But Parjatan is looking for a suitable partner for overseas marketing. A special team of Abdullah Abu Sayeed of Biswa Sahitya Kendra, artist Hashem Khan, Syed Manjurul Islam, and Dhaka University professor and Parjatan Corporation chairman Shafiq Alam Mehedi, designed the logo and 'theme' for the Bangladesh brand. Parjatan says it will, however, take into account public reception and opinion of the branding to make any future changes. The government also has plans to establish a Department of Tourism along with formulation of tourism laws. Country brand Australia tops the global rating according to the most recenbt survey carried out by Future Brand, a branding advertising body. bdnews24
