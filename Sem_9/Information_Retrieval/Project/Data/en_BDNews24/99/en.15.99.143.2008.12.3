 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  US Senator John McCain has said Bangladesh's next parliamentary polls could possibly be "the fairest" in the world, but called on both ruling and the opposition parties to accept the election results and "work closely after the elections". "It seems to me that with the incredible registering of 80 million people, this has the possibility of being the fairest election, perhaps in the entire world," McCain told reporters at a press conference at ZIA before departing Dhaka Wednesday morning. "I am optimistic about the result of the election," said McCain, who has an adopted daughter of Bangladeshi origin. "We also understand the importance of the upcoming elections." He said there were many causes of division in Bangladesh. "I would like to repeat what my colleagues said, that it is important for everybody to respect the outcome of the election and come together as citizens of this great country after the election is over," he said. "My party is now in the opposition in the Senate, the House and the presidency. But we work and we will work very closely with the president as we, the United States, face the most grievous economic crises since anyone of us have been alive." "I hope after the elections here in Bangladesh that will also be the case with the opposition party that loses." McCain, leading a bipartisan team of US senators, along with Democrat senator Joseph Lieberman and Republican Lindsey Graham arrived in the capital from New Delhi Tuesday night. They left after an 11-hour visit. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury saw the three senators off at the airport at 9.00am Wednesday. McCain, the Republican hopeful who went up against Barack Obama in a historic White House battle this year, said democratic and prosperous Bangladesh was important for the region and the world. He said he hoped the political parties would follow the examples in the US, accept the polls and both ruling and the opposition parties would closely work after the elections. McCain thanked the caretaker government and the army for their "efforts to strengthen the foundation of democracy" through reforms. "And frankly we show our appreciation to the caretaker government and the army for the job they have done and the peaceful transition of power that will return to the elected government." "Their work is not yet done, and it is now time for an elected successor to continue the reform process already begun and to build democracy and enhance prosperity for Bangladesh's people," he added. On bilateral issues, McCain mentioned: "We certainly want to continue our effort towards free trade. "We know how important the textile industry is to employment here in Bangladesh and in providing opportunities to some young men and women,." Senator McCain said the Mumbai attacks made the world aware that everybody must work together to curb terrorism. He termed the attacks "unacceptable" and urged Islamabad to cooperate with India to bring the terrorists to justice. "Events at Mumbai, the outrageously and disgraceful attacks, are unacceptable in America and India and in the world. "We have stated in New Delhi [on Tuesday] that we expect soon the government of Pakistan will cooperate fully with transparency and efforts to track down and bring to justice the evil doers and those were behind this terrible tragedy and outrageous act of terrorism in Mumbai," he said. McCain said he along with the two US senators had gone to New Delhi to express solidarity with the people of India following last week's horrific attack. "In fact, we talked to officials of your government about the need for coordinated action to fight terrorism in the region," he said. McCain had an early morning meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Wednesday to discuss a number of issues including "Bangladesh's transition to democracy". They also met with the foreign adviser, military leaders and other officials of the government on fighting terrorism and Bangladesh's return to democracy. The senator also felt that the US should take a leading role to solve a global problem such as climate change. "The issue is complicated somewhat by our economic difficulties, but I am still guardedly optimistic we will pass legislation addressing climate change and we will endeavour to join into international agreements to address a global problem globally," he said. Democrat Joseph Lieberman expressed his surprise at the possible implication of the sea level rise on Bangladesh. "If sea level rises one metre, one-third of Bangladesh is under water. At least 30 million people will be displaced. That's unbelievable," Senator Joseph Liberman said referring to the discussion with the chief adviser. He stressed spending necessary money to avoid the consequences. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury had received the three senators, who landed at Zia International Airport around 10.25pm on Tuesday. McCain was elected to the US Senate from Arizona in 1986. Senator Joseph Lieberman has represented Connecticut in the Senate since 1988. He was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000. Senator Lindsey Graham has been US Senator for South Carolina since 2002. All three senators are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, with McCain serving as the ranking member. bdn
