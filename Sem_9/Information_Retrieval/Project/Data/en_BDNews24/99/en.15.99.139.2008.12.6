 LONDON, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United defender Patrice Evra was banned for four matches and fined 15,000 pounds ($22,010) by the Football Association (FA) on Friday for his part in a fracas at Chelsea in April. The FA's regulatory commission found the French international guilty of four charges of improper conduct after he clashed with Chelsea groundstaff member Sam Bethell during a warm-down on the pitch at the end of the Premier League match. Chelsea were fined 25,000 pounds for failing "in its responsibility to ensure Mr Bethell conducted himself in an orderly fashion". The FA also ruled Mr Bethell had been abusive and provocative but said it had no jurisdiction over him as an individual. The duo denied the charges and requested a personal hearing following the altercation after Chelsea's 2-1 win on April 26. "The Commission considered this was an incident of violent behaviour by Mr Evra which was therefore punished by a suspension for four first-team matches from Dec. 22," the FA said in a statement. "An allegation Mr Bethell had engaged in racist conduct or language was not proved." RACIST ALLEGATION Chelsea said they had always strenuously denied the racist allegation. "That position has been totally vindicated by the FA," the club said on their website (www.chelseafc.com). United said Evra's punishment was harsh. "Manchester United  is disappointed with the decision and in particular considers the sanctions against Patrice Evra excessive," the club said on their website (www.manutd.com). "Manchester United and Patrice will consider all options once there has been an opportunity to digest the full reasons for the decision." Evra will miss league games against Stoke City and Middlesbrough, the FA Cup third-round tie with Southampton and the first leg of the League Cup semi-finals. He will, though, be free to play in the home league match against Chelsea on Jan. 11
