 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party has confirmed candidates for 47 seats, out of the total 50 seats allocated to the party under the Awami League-led alliance, a senior JP figure said Tuesday. "We've finalised 47 candidacies. We'll announce the names of our candidates in all 50 constituencies in a couple of days," JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawladar told reporters after a meeting at AL president Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi office. "We hope Mr Ershad will be president if the alliance is voted to power," he said, replying to a query. Hawlader repeated JP's claim that according to a deal made prior to the cancelled Jan 22 2007 election, Ershad was promised the presidency if the AL-led alliance was voted to power. bdnews24.com/
