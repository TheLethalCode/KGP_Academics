 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has shelved polls to Noakhali-1, after Ganotantree Party president and the Awami League-led alliance's nominee Nurul Islam died on Thursday of critical burn injuries sustained in a fire at his home. He died at around 4:35pm, relative Mostofa Kamal Pasha told bdnews24.com. The EC said they have deferred elections to the Noakhali-1 seat for which Islam had been nominated and will announce a new date later. Sixty-eight-year old Islam, who also lost son Tamohar Islam, 36, to the fire that broke out early on Wednesday at his Lalmatia home, had suffered kidney failure earlier in the day. Islam's condition had remained critical since he was transferred to the CMH from Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Wednesday noon. The dead body was taken to the DMCH morgue from CMH Thursday evening, said Pasha After autopsy, it will be kept at the Central Shaheed Minar at 11am Friday for people to pay their last respect. His namaz-e-Janaza will be held at the Dhaka University mosque, added Pasha. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia, BNP general secretary Khandakar Delwar Hosain, former BNP general secretary Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, mayor of Dhaka Sadek Hossain Khoka and others have mourned the death of Nurul. RELATIVES DEMAND ENQUIRY Relatives of Islam have demanded a proper investigation into the fire at the Islam residence. They also alleged at a press conference on Thursday that the fire at Islam's Lalmatia home was instigated "to foil the election". "We believe the incident occurred in a planned way as part of a conspiracy to foil the national election," said Islam's niece Nazma Kawsar, in a statement at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity office. Mahfuza Khanom, sister of Islam's wife Ruby Rahman, said the family hoped to file a case by Thursday. The family also demanded halting election to the Noakhali-1 constituency. Islam, in 1991, ran the general election from the seat as a candidate of an Awami League-led eight-party alliance, and marginally lost to the BNP-led four-party alliance contestant. This time, Golam Quddus, general secretary of Sammilito Sanskritik Jote, had initially been nominated by the AL-led alliance for the seat in the run-up to the Dec 29 election. Following negotiations over seat-sharing by the allies, Islam was finally nominated to run from Noakhali-1, Ganotontree Party leaders said. The four-party ticket for the seat has gone to Mahbubuddin Khokon, lawyer of BNP chief Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman. bdnew
