<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com) - A Supreme Court lawyer, who had served a legal notice on the Election Commission to remove BNP chief Khaleda Zia from the voter list for providing 'false information', says she is taking the EC to court for not taking any legal measure. Lawyer Fazilatun Nessa Bappy said on Wednesday, in the notice sent on Nov. 30, she demanded the EC delete the name of Khaleda from the voter list within 24 hours, for what she said providing false and misleading information about her date of birth and educational qualifications. Her lawyer Md Motaher Hossain Saju had sent the notice to the Election Commission Secretariat, the chief election commissioner and the Dhaka district election officer, she said. "And we got confirmation that the three received the notice on Dec. 1," Bappy said. "But the authorities have not taken any steps to delete her name from the voter list. So we have decided to go to court after discussing with senior lawyers." On Nov. 30, Saju had told bdnews24.com that the notice was served as Khaleda had furnished "certain false and concocted particulars in the voter form". The notice stated it was evident from reports published in various newspapers, on Aug. 9 1997, that Khaleda had taken the matriculation examination in 1961 recording her date of birth as Sept. 5 1947 but did not pass the exam. The BNP chairperson enlisted as a voter on Nov. 29, 2008, recording her birth date as Aug. 15 1945, which contradicts the date of birth recorded in her matriculation examination form. The notice added that the former prime minister also applied for a passport on April 1, 1978, stating her date of birth as Sept. 1946 without mentioning a specific date, while in her marriage certificate, as wife of late president Major Ziaur Rahman, her date of birth was shown as Aug. 9 1947. bdnews
