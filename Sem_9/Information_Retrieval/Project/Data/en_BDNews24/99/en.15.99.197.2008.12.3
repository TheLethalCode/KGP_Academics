<TITLE> Holbrooke looks likely for key S Asia role: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington DC, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)Richard Holbrooke, former US ambassador to the United Nations, looks likely to be special envoy for South Asia for the incoming Obama administration, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. The choice of Holbrooke, a personal friend of secretary of state-designate Hillary Clinton, is intended to convey a clear message to South Asia about the growing importance of the region to the United States. The move would also put one of America's most prominent international troubleshooters in place to try and resolve the thorny and interrelated issues surrounding India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The appointment would reflect early recognition by Obama that the region poses perhaps the biggest foreign policy challenge for his incoming administration. Afghanistan has been beset by increasing violence, with a resurgent Taliban, and the president-elect has promised more attention and resources for the fight there. Many foreign policy experts point the finger at Pakistan for not doing enough to curb extremist activity along the shared border, contributing to increasing violence within Afghanistan. Meanwhile, long-standing tensions between Pakistan and India have come to a head after last week's terror attacks in Mumbai. Inside India, the attacks are widely blamed on Pakistan  unfairly so, according to the latter. The impending appointment of Holbrooke also represents another example of Obama's willingness to look beyond his circle of supporters to fill key posts. Holbrooke has been a long-time adviser and supporter of Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton. He also backed Clinton during her Democratic campaign, which observers say, could have landed him the top diplomatic job had she gone on to win the presidency. Holbrooke's hopes for a top job in the new Democratic administration had seemed frustrated, particularly as his aggressive diplomacy and bureaucratic maneouvering had alienated some of Obama's closest advisers over the years. But his star seemed to rise again after Obama settled on Clinton for secretary of state, giving her leeway to assemble her own team at the State Department. Holbrooke is perhaps best known as the broker of the Dayton accords, which ended the war in Bosnia in the 1990s, but he has long experience across the globe, having served as assistant secretary of state in charge of East Asia policy (during the Carter administration) and in charge of Europe policy (during the Clinton administration). In recent years, he has written extensively about the war and political plight in Afghanistan, which would be a key focus of the new job
