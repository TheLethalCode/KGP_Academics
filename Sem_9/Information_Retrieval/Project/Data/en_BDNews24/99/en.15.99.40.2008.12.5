 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  Trading of cattle starts at 12 makeshift markets on Saturday ahead of Eid-ul-Azha on Dec. 9, with some markets thrown up on the roads that will be closed to traffic until Tuesday next, said a DCC official on Friday. "In view of the public demand, we have permitted some cattle markets on the roads," said Mohammad Khalilur Rahman, chief property officer of Dhaka City Corporation to bdnews24.com. He also suggested people and bus owners to take the alternative routes. The markets will be set up on the roads from Chankarpool intersection via Bakshibazar to Hosseni Dalan, and on the link roads of Shahjalal and Ishan Khan that connect Azampur Government Primary School ground cattle market in Uttara. The official said they had slapped stricter stipulations on the lessees of the markets. Rahman said if any market erected outside the road blocked any road or bridge or hindered movement of people, the leaseholder's deposit would be confiscated. The markets are situated at Armanitola, Jhigatola-Hazaribagh field, Brothers' Union Field in Gopibagh, Meradia Bazar, Taltola, Agaragaon, Ward-85, Rahamatganj playground, Dhupkhola field and Banarupa Khilkhet. The chief property officer said law-enforcing agencies will take care of security in the cattle markets. DCC leased out the makeshift markets for Tk 5.42 crore, and Gabtoli market for Tk 6.21 crore for one year, he said. b
