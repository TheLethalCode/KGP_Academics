 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi joined leaders Barisal in the National Cricket Championship when the last year's runners-up handed a massive nine-wicket defeat to Dhaka in the eight round four-dayers on Thursday. The match between Barisal and Sylhet ended in an expected draw as bottom-placed Sylhet, who lost six outings, remained at an upper hand at the close of the day. Rajshahi and Barisal now have 88 points each from eight games while Dhaka, trailing the first innings in the eighth round, raised their points tally to 70, 20 points more than Sylhet. Khulna, who on Wednesday beat Chittagong, have 60 points, four points cushion of fifth-placed Chittagong. Dhaka vs Rajshah Rajshahi reached 117 in 24 overs with the loss of opener Hamidul Islam after Dhaka set the visitors to chase 116 to win at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Hamidul and Jahurul Islam put on 108 runs for the opening stand before Hamidul fell to Shamsur Rahman for 40 off 64 balls that included nine fours. Jahurul and Suhrawardi Shuvo (8) then took their side home easily as Jahurul struck unbeaten 68 off 74 balls studded with 11 fours and one six. Earlier, Dhaka having resumed the final day on 251 for seven, added just five runs for three wickets to finish at 256 as Delwar raised his wicket tally to five for 60. Barisal vs Sylhet Chasing an improbable target of 347 in two sessions, leaders Barisal were 178 for six in 53 overs at the close of the final day's game at the Sylhet Divisional Stadium. Barisal initially faced trouble losing two wickets for 21 runs before opener Rony Talukdar (48), Imran Ahmed (40 not out), Nasir Hossain (60) provided fine resistance to deny Sylhet their first ever victory. Earlier, Sylhet declared their second innings on 251 for seven, setting Barisal to chase 348 runs to win.
