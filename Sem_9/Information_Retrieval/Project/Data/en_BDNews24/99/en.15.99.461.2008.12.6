"I was within an inch of (joining Arsenal)," Ronaldo told France Football. "I have a lot of respect for (manager Arsene) Wenger, he is a very clever man." Ronaldo, who inspired United to the Champions League and Premier League double this year, was awarded the Ballon d'Or on Tuesday after a poll of 96 international journalists organised by France Football.

I have always achieved something more season after seasonI want more titles, more awards and another Ballon d'Or." Ronaldo also denied he was a diver. "You know Hercules?
