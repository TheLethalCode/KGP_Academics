 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Ganotontree Party president Nurul Islam, who had sustained critical burns on Wednesday in a fire incident, has suffered kidney failure, a party leader said on Thursday. A medical board, headed by brigadier general Rabiul Islam at the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka Cantonment, decided to do kidney dialysis, Gonotontree Party presidium member Haider Jahan Josho told bdnews24.com. The condition of Islam, who also lost son Tamohar Islam, 36, to a fire that broke out early on Wednesday at his Lalmatia home, has not improved since he was transferred to the CMH Wednesday noon. Josho had told reporters on Wednesday that Islam's conditions were still "risky". "What the doctors say and what the situation appears to be don't carry good sign." Islam, also chairman of Trade Union Kendro, got nomination from the Awami League-led 14-party alliance to run the polls from Noakhali-1 constituency. Md Kamruzzaman, sub-inspector at Mohammadpur Police Station, told bdnews24.com that the fire broke out in their fourth-floor flat at around 3am. "After I was nominated, unidentified Islamist militants had been intimidating me and my son over telephone, asking me not to contest the polls," Islam said to reporters at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. "Islam was being intimidated by outsiders for quite sometime. We demand that the government take steps to initiate an enquiry into the fire incident that occurred early Wednesday," Ganotontree Party president Azizul Islam Khan said to reporters at noon. "Simultaneously, we urge the government to halt the upcoming parliamentary polls at Noakhali-1 seat," he said. Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesher Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and other political leaders visited the Islam at DMCH. "Islam had made it known some days back that he was receiving threats over telephone. So, the fire incident should be looked into in-depth," Menon said to reporters. "To my knowledge, Nurul Islam has no personal enemy, but his ideals may have created enemies." There was none else in the house during the incident. Islam's wife poet Ruby Rahman is in the United States and due to return home on Dec 9. Islam in 1991 ran the general election from Noakhali-1 as an eight-party alliance candidate and marginally lost to the BNP-led four-party alliance contestant. Golam Quddus, general secretary of Sammilito Sanskritik Jote had initially got Awami League's nomination this year for Noakhali-1 seat. Following the final negotiations over seat-sharing by the allies, the 'grand alliance' finally agreed to nominate Islam to run from Noakhali-1, Ganotontree Party leaders said. Mahbubuddin Khokon, BNP chief Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman's lawyer, has got the four-party alliance ticket to contest the election from the same seat. b
