<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  The condition of Ganotontree Party president Nurul Islam, being treated at the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka Cantonment, is still critical, a party leader quoted a CMH physician as saying on Wednesday night. Islam, who suffered critical burns injuries and whose son Tamohar Islam, 36, died after a fire broke out early on Wednesday at his Lalmatia home, has not shown any improvement since he has been transferred to the CMH at noon. Gonotontree Party presidium member Haider Jahan Josho told bdnews24.com at 10pm that Islam's conditions were still "risky". Josho said, "What the docs say and what the situation appears to be doesn't carry any good sign." A party leader who preferred anonymity told bdnews24.com that Nurul Islam's wife poet Ruby Rahman and his daughter were expected to arrive in Dhaka from the USA at 2am on Thursday. Islam, also chairman of Trade Union Kendro, got nomination from the Awami League-led 14-party alliance to run the polls from Noakhali-1 constituency. Md Kamruzzaman, sub-inspector at Mohammadpur Police Station, told bdnews24.com that the fire broke out in their fourth-floor flat at around 3am. "After I was nominated, unidentified Islamist militants had been intimidating me and my son over telephone, asking me not to contest the polls," Islam said to reporters at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. "Islam was being intimidated by outsiders for quite sometime. We demand that the government take steps to initiate an enquiry into the fire incident that occured early Wednesday," Ganotontree Party president Azizul Islam Khan said to reporters at noon. "Simultaneously, we urge the government to halt the upcoming parliamentary polls at Noakhali-1 seat," he said. Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesher Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and other political leaders visited the Islam at DMCH. "Islam had made it known some days back that he was receiving threats over telephone. So, the fire incident should be looked into in-depth," Menon said to reporters. "To my knowledge, Nurul Islam has no personal enemy, but his ideals may have created enemies." There was none else in the house during the incident. Islam's wife poet Ruby Rahman is in the United States and due to return home on Dec 9. SI Kamruzzaman also said quoting Hasibul Hasan, a BBA student and resident of the flat above Islam's, at around 3am Hasib and two of his friends were busy with their computer when they heard something fall downstairs with a thud. Investigating, they found smoke billowing out of one of their windows too, heard someone yelling downstairs, "Fire! Please save us!" The three friends rushed downstairs, broke open the entrance to the flat, rescued seriously injured Islam and sent him to DMCH. The firefighters also arrived soon after. Hasan said the firefighters and local people doused the fire and discovered the body of Tamohar from the living room. The police officer said the drawing-cum-dining room looked totally ravaged. The electric fan, TV set, refrigerator and other gadgets were destroyed. The refrigerator's compressor might have exploded following the fire that broke out from electrical short-circuit, he said quoting the firemen. Islam in 1991 ran the general election from Noakhali-1 as an eight-party alliance candidate and marginally lost to the BNP-led four-party alliance contestant. Golam Quddus, general secretary of Sammilito Sanskritik Jote had initially got Awami League's nomination this year for Noakhali-1 seat. Following the final negotiations over seat sharing by the allies, the 'grand alliance' finally agreed to nominate Islam to run from Noakhali-1, Ganotontree Party leaders said. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon, BNP chief Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman's lawyer, has got the four-party alliance ticket to contest the election from the same seat. bdnews24
