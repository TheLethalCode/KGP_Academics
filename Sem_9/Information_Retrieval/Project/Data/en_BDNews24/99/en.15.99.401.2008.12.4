<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Former minister Nazmul Huda has secured bail for three months in two criminal cases from the High Court. Judges Tarique-ul-Hakim and Farah Mahbub granted his bail appeal on Thursday after the BNp leader had filed a writ petition challenging the legality of the extortion and embezzlement cases. The same judges on Dec. 1 stayed the proceedings of the two cases for six months. The extortion case was filed on July 5 last year with Dhanmondi Police Station while the funds embezzlement case was lodged on Sept. 25 the same year with Paltan Police Station. Adilur Rahman Khan and Ahsanul Karim represented the former minister in the hearing. Another High Court bench of justices Md Mozammel Hossain and Afzal Hossain granted Awami Swechhasebak League president Bahauddin Nasim two-month bail in a sedition case. The case was filed with Airport Police Station on March 11, 2002. The High Court ordered Orion Group chairman Obaidul Karim to appear in the court on Jan. 11 next year. The court also ordered authorities not to harass or arrest him by the time. The bench of justices Mir Hashmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain passed the order as Obaidul Karim in a petition challenged the four cases against him. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court upheld the HC order that stayed the bail of former lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu in two cases. A four-member Appellate Division bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin made the order rejecting Pintu's review appeal. The Supreme Court on Nov. 20 halted the High Court stay order in two cases involving the embezzlement of relief materials. b
