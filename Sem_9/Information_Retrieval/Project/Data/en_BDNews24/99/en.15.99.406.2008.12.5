<TITLE> North Korea knows what is needed for nuclear deal: US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Thu Dec 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top US nuclear diplomat Christopher Hill said on Friday he believed North Korea understood what was required to reach a deal on verifying Pyongyang's earlier declaration about its atomic activities. Hill will meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Kye-gwan for a second day of talks in Singapore on Friday aimed at minimizing differences before six-party discussions in Beijing next week. The two days of meetings in Singapore will set the tone for the talks in Beijing, one of the Bush administration's last chances to make progress on an initial disarmament deal with North Korea before President-elect Barack Obama takes office. "The issue is not the verification issue, it is how to express it in a piece of paper at a time so there are no misunderstandings," Hill told reporters before the talks at the US embassy. "I think they (North Korea) have a clear understanding of what we need in terms of how to go forward," added Hill, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asia. Under the disarmament agreement, Pyongyang has been offered fuel oil and other aid, as well as greater diplomatic standing, in return for shutting a key nuclear installation and handing over a list of its atomic activities. Many stumbling blocks have held up the disarmament agreement struck at the on-off negotiations between North and South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia. The latest is the North's reluctance to allow international inspectors to take nuclear samples out of the country for testing. Washington maintains that Pyongyang is obliged to allow such tests by understandings reached in October. In response to a question on whether sampling issues had been discussed in Singapore, Hill avoided using the word sampling, but said issues regarding "scientific procedure" were brought up in the talks on Thursday. China has not announced any date for the discussions in Beijing, although other countries in the multilateral group have said they would take place on December 8. Asked on Thursday why China had not announced the date, Hill said: "I don't know, we are expecting to be in Beijing ... I'm not sure when it will be officially announced." Pyongyang carried out a nuclear blast in October 2006, alarming the region and galvanizing the six-party negotiations that began in Beijing in 2003. Hill is expected to hold meetings in Seoul on Saturday, before heading to Beijing on Sunday
