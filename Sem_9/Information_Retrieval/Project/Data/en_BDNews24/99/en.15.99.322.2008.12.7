<TITLE> Harmison says will probably go to India if security okay </TITLE>

 LONDON, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Steve Harmison would probably return to India next week to play a two-test series if the latest security report was positive, he said on Sunday. "Though I've still got a load of questions about the rights and wrongs of going back, on the balance of probabilities I reckon I will if the security report is positive," Harmison wrote in a column for The Mail on Sunday. The tour was suspended and the England team returned home last week after the one-day series was cut short following the terror attacks in Mumbai that killed at least 171 people. The team, along with nine members of the England Performance Squad, are training in Abu Dhabi as ECB security experts evaluate the situation at the test venues. A final decision on the tour will be made on Sunday after the latest security reports. "Many questions remain unresolved and whatever we hear at our security briefing tonight in Abu Dhabi, I reserve the right to make my own decision to fly home on Monday if I feel it is the right thing to do," he added. "If you had asked me at the start of the week whether or not I would consider going back, my answer would have been 'no' -- and I wouldn't have been the only one. DEEPLY UNCERTAIN "As time has passed I have become more open-minded, but when it was put to me earlier in the week that a decision to fly to Abu Dhabi should go hand in hand with a choice to go to India if the security report said it was okay to do so, that was a commitment I was not prepared to give without more time and information," he added. "Now the time to make that commitment is imminent and I can honestly say I remain deeply uncertain about the right course of action. "On the one shoulder a voice has been telling me: 'Stuff the terrorists. Get in there, play the tests and give it your best shot'. "Then the man on my other shoulder pipes up: 'Think about this. You are going into a country some are describing as a war zone. You've got a family and four kids. Is it right to put yourself at risk?' "The questions come into my head about whether the Indians want us there while they are still in mourning, whether it is right for anyone to be playing cricket out there or trying to carry on as normal when 'normal' life has been so tragically disrupted." Harmison said his view that he will probably return to India if the security report is satisfactory "probably goes for everyone here but, in the end, it doesn't matter what anyone else says or anyone else thinks. "It is only right and fair that everyone makes up their own mind. And if I felt when the times comes it is the right decision for me to go, I will." The first test due to start on Thursday has been moved to Chennai from Ahmedabad and the final test from Dec. 19-23 to Mohali from Mumbai. England lost the curtailed seven-match one-day series 5-0
