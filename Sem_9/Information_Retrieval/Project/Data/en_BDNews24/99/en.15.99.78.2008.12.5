 By Arshad Mahmud, from Washington Washington, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  A mixture of optimism and gloom was expressed by panelists at a public hearing on Bangladesh's 'transformational election' in Washington on Thursday. The upcoming national election in Bangladesh is critically important for the country's peaceful transition to democracy and any attempt to subvert the process could put the country back down a dark road towards chaos and widespread poverty, they said. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a Congressionally-mandated agency, held the hearing to explore the prospects for free, fair, and peaceful elections in Bangladesh, the development of a stable democracy, the threat to democratic values posed by religious extremism, and strategies for the U.S. government to promote democracy and respect for human rights. In his opening remarks presented before the Commission, Ambassador James F Moriarty said, "In my view, other than last month's election in the U.S., there'll be no more transformational election in the world this year than the parliamentary elections scheduled for Dec. 29 in Bangladesh". Elaborating his remarks the suave, unobtrusive Moriarty said Bangladesh was a land of contrasts. "On one hand is the Bangladesh of recurring natural disasters, endemic corruption, growing intolerance, and a growing population, 86 percent of whom subsist on less than two dollars a day. On the other is the Bangladesh that is on the brink of a historic democratic transition which could make Bangladesh a model of governance for other moderate Muslim nations." He also praised Bangladesh's success in social and economic development, saying that the country had achieved more than 6 percent growth in the past few years despite all the odds. But what caught many in the audience by surprise was when he said that the average life expectancy for Bangladesh's 150 million people was considerably longer than that of Russian men. Ambassador Moriarty's elaborate testimony was apparently intended to convince the five commissioners led by Felice Gaer about why the United States should support Bangladesh in its effort to get out of the current mess. He said the U.S. interests in Bangladesh revolve around three mutually reinforcing principles, which he referred to as the "three D's": democracy, development, and the denial of space to terrorism. Congressman Joseph Crowley, chair of the Bangladesh Caucus, seemed very encouraged by the ambassador's upbeat assessment. In his brief remark, Crowley said he would do his best to ensure that the United States remain committed to Bangladesh's future progress by enhancing American development assistance and helping the country in its quest for better access to U.S. market. Other panelists who also testified before the Commission were professors Ali Riaz of Illinois State University, Shapan Adnan of Singapore National University, Sochi Dastidar of State University of New York, and Asif Saleh, executive director of Drishtipat, a U.S.-based human-rights organisation. In their written testimonies they gave detailed account about the rise of Islamic extremism, persecution of religious minorities, especially Hindus in Bangladesh, and the mistreatment of tribal people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. While they praised the industrious and hardworking Bangladeshi people, they blamed the politicians for all the ills that afflict the country. Prof Riaz said the changeover of 1/11 brought a sense of relief but the "euphoria of change and hope for a corruption-free politics has almost disappeared due to the absence of major, substantive institutional and structural changes in administration and politics". Two representatives of the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute also testified before the Commission. They gave brief description of their activities in Banglades
