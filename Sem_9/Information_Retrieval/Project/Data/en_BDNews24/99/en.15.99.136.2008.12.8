 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)The BNP-led four party alliance has again given a 48-hour deadline to the government to meet its 'two-point' demand for lifting emergency and suspending Section 91(E) of the RPO. "We request a definite announcement from the government and the Election Commission on meeting the two demands by Wednesday (Dec 10), or we will be forced to take a decision," said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. He was speaking to reporters after a four-party meeting on seat allocation at BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office. The meeting was adjourned until Dec 11, Delwar said. "We discussed in detail election preparation and the prevailing political situation." "Want to go to election. We have made our two-point demand twice already, but the government has failed to respond," said Delwar. On lifting the emergency, he asked the government to specify the "date and time" by Dec 10. "We hope that the government will meet our demands. Or else we must believe that the government is not willing to create conditions for a fair election." "We want the government to fulfil its role in holding a credible election by allowing the four-party alliance to participate fairly." On seat allocation among BNP and its allies, he said there was no problem. "We will finalise it on Dec 11." BNP chief chaired the meeting, attended by Delwar, Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami, Islami Oikya Jote chairman Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini, BJP secretary general Shamim Al-Mamum among others. bdnew
