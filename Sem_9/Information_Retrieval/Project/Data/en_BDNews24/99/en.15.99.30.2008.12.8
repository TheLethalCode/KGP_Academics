<TITLE> In state votes, Congress defies predictions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Mon Dec 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congress party appeared set to win two state elections and was leading in a third on Monday, defying predictions of a political battering after both an economic slowdown and the militant attacks on Mumbai. Counting went on for five state elections, mostly in central and west India. Final results were due by late Monday and the outcome could still change, with factors such as the need for winning parties to secure coalitions to govern. The votes come before national elections in early 2009 that will pit a ruling Congress-led coalition against an opposition alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Congress appeared to have held on to Delhi and was leading in Rajasthan, where the BJP was incumbent. Incumbents traditionally fare badly in Indian elections. Congress also was set to win in Mizoram, where it was fighting a regional party. The BJP won in Madhya Pradesh and looked close to returning to power in Chhattisgarh. If confirmed by official results due later on Monday, the outcome would be a boost for Congress, which has suffered a string of state election defeats against the BJP in the last year amid rising inflation and perceived weak leadership. It would be a blow for the BJP, which had hoped its policy of criticising Congress for being soft on terrorism would reap political dividends. "This is a reality check for the BJP," political analyst Swapan Dasgupta told CNN-IBN television. MATURING VOTERS The elections in Rajasthan and Delhi were held after the attacks in Mumbai by militants. But criticism of the government for security lapses appeared to have little impact on voters. "The BJP's terror plank hasn't worked. People have started to see through it. Ironically it backfired after the most horrific terror attacks," said political analyst Amulya Ganguli. Even before the blood had been mopped up from the three-day rampage in Mumbai, the BJP took out front-page advertisements slamming Congress as unable to defend the nation. Local governance issues may have trumped the economy and security this time around. "It shows the maturity of voters. They may not like Congress nationally but they have not been influenced by events like the attacks in Mumbai. They have voted for good local leaders," said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of C-voter polling agency. Whoever does best in the state elections may find it easier to secure alliances with regional parties before the national election, crucial to building a post-election coalition. If it does well, Congress could decide to call general elections in February rather than the end of May. But it is not all good news for Congress. The party failed to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Economists now expect the economy to grow at 7 percent this year, compared with 9 percent or more in recent years. On Sunday, the government said it planned $4 billion of extra spending to try to revive economic growth. Results for a sixth state election -- in the troubled Kashmir -- will be released near the end of December, after a month of polling ends
