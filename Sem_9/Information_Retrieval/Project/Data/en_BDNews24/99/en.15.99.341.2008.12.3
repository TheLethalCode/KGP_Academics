<TITLE> Pakistan not to blame for Mumbai attacks: Zardari </TITLE>

"The state of Pakistan is no way responsible," Zardari told CNN's "Larry King Live" program. Indian officials have said the 10 Islamist militants who killed nearly 200 people in a three-day rampage in Mumbai were from an anti-India group based in Pakistan. India has long said Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act against such groups. Azam Amir Kasav, the only gunmen not killed by Indian commandos, told investigators he is a Pakistani citizen, Mumbai police chief Hasan Gafoor said.

I very much doubt ... that he's a Pakistani," Zardari said. "The gunmen, plus the planners, whoever they are -- they are stateless actors who are holding hostage the whole world," he said. Zardari said if India produced evidence that a Pakistani group was behind the attacks, his government would take action against them.
