<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will officially declare its manifesto on Dec. 12, which will be followed by an 'Action Plan' of the AL-led alliance, said the party spokesman on Friday. Continuation of the anticorruption drive along with more predictable pledges such as a cut in the prices of commodities and subsidies to agriculture are likely to top the manifesto, key leaders have told bdnews24.com. AL will finalise its election manifesto at its central working committee meeting on Saturday, said party spokesperson and general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. Party chief Sheikh Hasina will formally roll out the manifesto at the Hotel Sheraton on Dec. 12, he told reporters after a daylong ALCWC meeting on Friday night. Ashraful added, "The alliance's 'Action Plan' will also be declared at a later date." The ALCWC meeting, beginning at 11am, was adjourned for some hours in the middle of the day in order to pay last tributes to Gonotantree Party president Nurul Islam. It resumed at 4pm and ended around 9pm. "Today's (Friday) was the second round discussion," Ashraful added. Asked about cancellation of AL candidatures, he said, "It is a temporary matter. Those who face nomination cancellation can appeal to the Election Commission." "After the appeals are held, we can finally say how many candidates have had nominations cancelled." bdnews
