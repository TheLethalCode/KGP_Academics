<TEXT>
 Dhaka, December 06 (bdnews24.com)  IT leaders have called upon the next elected government to take necessary steps to boost the existing ICT taskforce. "An allocation of five percent of the annual development programme and also cutback of the bandwidth fee is much needed for the information and communications technology sector," Habibullah N Karim, president of Bangladesh Association of Software & Information Services, said at a sponsorship deal signing ceremony between BASIS and Grameenphone in the city on Saturday. The theme of SOPTEXPO this year is "Linking people with Technology and Branding Bangladesh as the country with immense possibilities." Karim said BASIS was exporting IT products to more than 30 countries. "Highly renowned companies in the USA and the UK like Nokia are our clients, but we have failed to convince our local buyers." He attributed the failure to dire lack of faith on the local industry and talents. "Now it's the time to build confidence." The BASIS president said, according to the World Bank predictions, Bangladesh will earn more than 500 million dollars annually by exporting IT products between 2009 and 2014. "These predictions logical as many Bangladeshi engineers are working in high profile IT companies abroad." he explained. He hoped the upcoming elected government would take appropriate measures to energise the ICT taskforce as it was not so effective over the last eight years. GP marketing chief Rubaba Dowla said her company always wanted to be the country's development partner. "We have empowered the under privileged women through village phone in the rural area. Internet has been reached in the rural area by our EDGE technology." BASIS director MA Mubin Khan told the ceremony that he expected more than 200 exhibitors from home and abroad in this exposition. "Delegation from Denmark, the USA, the UK and Japan will join in this gala." The number of prospective visitors would be around 200,000, he added. The organizers hope to attract local and foreign investors to the possibilities of outsourcing work in Bangladesh ICT sector, thus creating an opportunity of skilled jobs. According to the agreement, Grameenphone (GP) will be the main sponsor of the upcoming BASIS SOFTEXPO 2009, to be held on Jan. 27-31 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre
