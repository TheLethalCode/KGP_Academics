 NEW DELHI, Fri Dec 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India acknowledged the Mumbai attacks had revealed security lapses but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Friday evidence showed the strike originated on the soil of a neighbour, a clear reference to Pakistan. The ruling Congress party-led coalition is under renewed criticism from the opposition that it is weak on security after the three-day rampage by 10 Islamist gunmen in India's financial capital last week capped a series of bomb blasts this year. "I would be less than truthful if I said there were no lapses," new Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in Mumbai. "These are being looked into. We will address the causes that led to the lapses." Chidambaram took over the post on Sunday after his predecessor Shivraj Patil quit in the wake of the attacks. Elections are due by May and analysts say Singh must demonstrate decisive action to counter criticism over security. "We have impressed upon all world leaders who called me that the people of India feel a sense of hurt and anger as never before," Singh said at a media conference with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who was on a scheduled trip to New Delhi. "We expect the world community to come to the same conclusion, that the territory of a neighbouring country has been used for this crime," he said. Pakistan has condemned the assault, denied state involvement and vowed to help the Indian probe. But it wants proof first. AIRPORT SCARE Underscoring the collective jitters after the attacks, gunshot-like sounds heard at New Delhi's international airport early on Friday sparked a scare. Police said no one was hurt and normal operations resumed after a search. The violence in Mumbai killed at least 171 people. India has said nine militants were killed and one captured alive. U.S. analysts said as many as 23 gunmen could have been involved. "Evidence from the CCTV footage and statements made by the surviving attacker point to the act being perpetrated by 10 terrorists. If there were others that had a role in the whole operation, I would not be able to say now," Chidambaram said. Indian newspapers reported the Pakistan military's spy agency ISI helped train the gunmen, said to belong to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group blamed for earlier attacks in India. LeT is on U.S. and Indian terrorist lists and Indian police say two of its operations leaders, who were designated terrorists by Washington in May, coordinated the Mumbai rampage. "There is ample evidence to show the source of the attacks were clearly linked to organisations which have in the past been identified as behind terrorist attacks in India," Chidambaram said when asked if ISI was involved. He did not name ISI. India has blamed ISI for using militant groups like LeT in earlier attacks and as proxies in the latter years of their 60-year conflict over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. The Mumbai rampage has threatened a four-year-old peace process between the nuclear-armed rivals, put in place after a 2001 attack on parliament blamed on LeT nearly set off a war. "Neither the Pakistani nation nor our Indian brothers want war. God willing, that won't happen," acting Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters. [nISL372908] Analysts say an escalation in tension would force Pakistan to move troops to its border with India, and threaten a US-led operation against al Qaeda and other militants on its western frontier with Afghanistan. ISI chief Lieutenant-General Ahmed Shujaa Pasha briefed Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani on security on Friday, a brief statement from Gilani's office said. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in both New Delhi and Islamabad this week, mediating between the old enemies who have fought three wars since independence in 1947. Rice told reporters before leaving Islamabad that the attacks showed "a level of sophistication that we haven't seen here on the subcontinent before". She played down fear of a military response by India, saying the global struggle against terrorism needed cooperation
