<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  The National Committee for Protection of Oil, Gas, Natural Resources, Power and Port asked on Wednesday for the eviction of Asia Energy from Bangladesh and the cancellation of all unfair production-sharing agreements. The demands were raised from a news conference held at the Mukta Bhaban in the city. Committee convenor engineer Md Shahidullah read out a written statement. "Asia Energy has to be ousted and the Fulbari agreement, made on August 30, 2006 implemented," he said. He demanded past agreements be presented before the public, assurance on energy under short- and long-term arrangements and an energy policy through a symbiosis of renewable and non-renewable energy resources. Demanding an increase in the national capacity to drill oil and gas, Shahidullah said national institutes like BAPEX and Petrobangla should be supplied with enough capital and equipment. Other demands include effective steps to counter cracks on buildings resulting from depression of land in the Barapukuria coal mine, expeditious establishment of a 125 megawatt power station, punishment of those who gave work to a weak multinational company and caused the Magurchhara, Tengratila disaster, realisation of compensation and, trial of those who handed over the ownership of Jalalabad gas field from Petrobangla to Unocal/Chevron for free. In Barapukuria, two 125 mw power plants need 2500 tonnes of coal, but the daily production is more than 4000 tonnes and, therefore, the new power station is necessary, stated the written statement. Professor Anu Muhammad, CPB leader Ruhin Hossian and others were present at the press conference. bdnew
