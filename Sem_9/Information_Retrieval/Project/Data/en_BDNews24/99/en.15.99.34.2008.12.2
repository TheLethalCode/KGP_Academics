 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  Time is running out for political parties and alliances who must declare their final candidates to the Election Commission "before scrutiny of nomination papers", which starts from Wednesday, election officials have said. Nominees cannot pass scrutiny without a "decision" from the respective parties or alliances, EC official Mihir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. Parties must provide "a signed certificate of final candidacy before scrutiny of nomination papers" to the Election Commission or returning officers, according to the RPO. This applies to alliances too, according to an EC notice sent to all returning officers last week. Many had believed the alliances would have until Dec 11, the deadline for withdrawal of candidacies, to finalise their seat allocations. But parties or alliances having nominated more than one candidate per constituency must declare their "order of preference" before scrutiny. "This should help them retain their candidates in case the preferred nominees fail to pass the scrutiny," one EC official explained. "If there is more than one nominee per seat, one candidacy must be finalised on direction from the party," said Sarwar, citing the RPO. In case of alliances, one of the parties assigned by other components will notify the EC about the final list of nominees and the order of preference, the EC said in its notice. The Awami League-led and BNP-led alliances have notified the EC of their electoral arrangements, but have not named the final alliance candidates, Sarwar pointed out. After scrutiny on Dec 3-4, returning officers will assign electoral logos to the candidates based on the parties' final lists. Hearing of objections against any EC decision on scrutiny will be held on the following three daysDec. 5-7. A total of 2,460 nomination papers have so far been filed from a total of 39 registered political parties for the coming general election. The largest number of nominations have been filed by independent candidates  391. Awami League has filed 333 nominations, BNP 310, Jatiya Party 258, and Jamaat-e-Islami 56. Islami Andolon has filed 183, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh for 82, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal for 75, Gano Forum 61, Communist Party of Bangladesh 41, Liberal Democratic Party 39, Workers Party of Bangladesh has filed 27, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish 16 and Islami Oikya Jote 8. Eight candidates have filed under the names of unregistered parties and therefore will automatically be disqualified, said Sarwar. Bangladesh Jatiya Party has filed the least number with just one nominee. EC DIRECTION ON SCRUTINY OF NOMINATIONS The Election Commission Secretariat sent directions to returning officers on Nov. 27 to finalise the candidacies for scrutiny. Section 12 [3a and b] of the RPO says: "Provided that any registered political party may primarily nominate more than one candidate  the name of one candidate shall be sent to the returning officer in writing before the scrutiny of nomination papers. The EC's Nov 27 directive, however, stated that the same condition applied in case of more than one nomination by an alliance. The final nomination of a candidate under a registered political party will have to be certified by the party's president or general secretary or equivalent post holder. The final nomination of a candidate under an alliance will have to be similarly certified by the designated party. An alliance candidate may use the main party's electoral logo, but in parliament he/she will represent his/her actual party. bdnews2
