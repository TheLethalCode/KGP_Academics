 CHIGWELL, England, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp is hoping for a warm reception when he returns to his former club West Ham United on Monday. "I have been back with Portsmouth a couple of times and got a fantastic reception and I would hate that to change because the club has always been close to my heart," said Redknapp. "I have got so many mates who are West Ham supporters. I have fond memories of going there at 15 (as a young player) and going back there as manager. It's a great club," he added. Tottenham, who have a strong London rivalry with West Ham, have been transformed since Redknapp took over from Spaniard Juande Ramos in late October but are still near the foot of the Premier League ahead of the trip to Upton Park. "It's such a tight division this year." said Redknapp. "It's going to go all the way (to the end of the season). It's a case of making sure we get enough points. If we hadn't had the run we've had we'd be in a severe situation." Spurs had just two points from eight matches when Redknapp took charge but have taken 13 points from their last seven games to haul themselves off the bottom of the standings. MAGIC TOUCH Redknapp's magic touch has lifted the Tottenham players and he has already steered the club into the League Cup semi-finals and the brink of qualification for the last 32 of the UEFA Cup. However, the number of competitions they are still in means he would like to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window and will be looking to sign a couple of players on loan. "We need to strengthen the squad because we have got so many games. We are involved in too many competitions in all honesty. If we get one or two loans in that could be vital," he said. In the meantime, Redknapp is hoping captain Ledley King will be fit to return on Monday after being rested for the League Cup quarter-final win at Watford in midweek and Croatia midfielder Luka Modric could also feature after a groin injury
