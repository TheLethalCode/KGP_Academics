<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - San Lorenzo and Tigre won on Sunday to go level on points at the top of the Argentine championship with Boca Juniors and set up a thrilling finale to the title race. Boca, who had started the weekend with a two-point lead, were held 0-0 at Gimnasia-La Plata. Unfashionable Tigre came from two goals behind to win 3-2 at Rosario Central and San Lorenzo thumped floundering Independiente 4-1. The trio each have 36 points from 18 games with one match to play. Lanus, two points behind in fourth place after a 2-0 win at Velez Sarsfield, also have an outside chance. Goal difference is not used to decide the title, so a playoff will be held if two teams are still level after next Sunday's final games and a three-way tournament will take place if all three sides finish on the same number of points. There could even be a four-way tie if Lanus beat San Martin-Tucuman and Boca, Tigre and San Lorenzo all draw. The biggest drama involved Tigre who were 2-0 down after only 11 minutes at Rosario Central following goals by Milton Caraglio and Ezequiel Gonzalez. But Carlos Luna struck twice to pull Tigre level by halftime, side-footing past Jorge Broun in the 29th minute and volleying in a rebound after Diego Castano headed against the post just before the break. Substitute Leandro Lazarro grabbed the winner in the 81st minute, scoring from near the penalty spot after Leonel Altobelli pulled the ball back. GOALLESS DRAW Boca were held to a dismal goalless draw and had Paraguay full back Claudio Morel sent off in the 64th minute for kicking Ignacio Piatti as the pair tussled for the ball. San Lorenzo cruised to their win against Indendiente as Pablo Barrientos headed them in front after 19 minutes from Aureliano Torres's free kick and former Real Madrid striker Santiago Solari scored from close range two minutes later. Independiente were in more trouble when Leonel Rios was sent off and central defender Gaston Aguirre added the third two minutes before halftime, leaving goalkeeper Fabian Assmann on the ground with a delightful touch before firing in at the near post. Barrientes claimed his second in the 57th minute after Torres found him unmarked with a raking crossfield pass before Lionel Nunez notched Independiente's consolation. Defending champions River Plate stayed bottom of the table after losing 2-1 at home to Godoy Cruz in another dismal performance
