 Dhaka, Dec 3(bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday began delivering judgement on a writ petition challenging opposition to bail, punishment and legality of trials under the emergency powers rules. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Huq and Md Abdul Hye began pronouncing the staggered verdict. "The High Court started giving judgement on the case and the judgement is expected to conclude on Thursday," the court's adviser AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik said to bdnews24.com. In the final hearing, barrister Amir-ul- Islam argued for the writ petitioner while attorney general Salauddin Ahmed stood for the government. Others who assisted the court were Dr M Zahir, former attorney general Mahmudul Islam, Azmalul Hussain QC, Shahdin Malik. On June 15 the court asked the government to explain why obstruction to bails and appeals under the emergency, fixing the period of punishment and inclusion of some previous cases that had happened before the emergency rule would not be declared extra-constitutional. On June 5, former caretaker adviser Sultana Kamal, New Age editor Nurul Kabir and associate professor of Dhaka University Hafizur Rahman filed the petition. The petition challenged some sections of the emergency power ordinance and the emergency powers rules that relate to obstruction to bails, punishment and trial process. bdne
