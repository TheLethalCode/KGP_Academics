 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has cancelled the clause of the emergency powers rules that bans bail for the convicts and prohibits a stay on the ruling while the trial court is hearing an appeal. The bench of justices of ABM Khairul Huq and Abdul Huq on Thursday also cancelled the clause that no order under the emergency power ordinance can be questioned. It has also passed a ruling that the Anticorruption Commission cannot change the trial court, on a writ petition that challenged the legality of a few clauses under the EPR. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, editor of the New Age daily Nurul Kabir and assistant professor of the Department of Law of Dhaka University Sheikh Hafizur Rahman Curzon filed the petition. In its orders, the High Court declared illegal and scrapped the Section 5 of the emergency powers ordinance and sections 11(3), 19(d).(e) of the EPR. The orders also partially scrapped the Section 18 (a) of the EPR. The court said that the state of emergency cannot go on for an indefinite period and the main laws of the constitution cannot be changed. Bangladesh is a people's republic and the fact has to be represented in all spheres. It's the parliament which has the power to formulate laws and though laws within a limited purview can be formulated, they cannot be used to deprive the people of their basic rights, the ruling observed. The case, on behalf of the writ petitioners, was argued by Amir-ul Islam while the state was represented by attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. The writ petitioners also made statements at court. b
