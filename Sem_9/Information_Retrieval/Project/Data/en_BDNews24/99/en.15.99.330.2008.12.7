 NEW DELHI, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England have selected uncapped fast bowler Amjad Khan to replace the injured Ryan Sidebottom for a proposed two-test series in India, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Sunday. In a statement on its website (www.ecb.co.uk) the ECB said the 28-year-old Danish-born bowler would replace Sidebottom who has been ruled out with a side strain. Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid will also travel with the squad for the series due to start in Chennai on Thursday. The England squad are in Abu Dhabi and will resume their aborted tour of India if a final ECB security assessment later on Sunday gives the clearance. England called off the final two games of a one-day series and returned home after at least 171 people were killed in a three-day militant siege in Mumbai. Khan received British citizenship in 2006 and was included in the England performance squad only to be sidelined last season following knee surgery. The second test will be played in Mohali from Dec. 19
