<TITLE> Don't declare Khandaker Mahbub Uddin ineligible: HC to EC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Wednesday ordered the Election Commission not to declare BNP's Advocate Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmed ineligible to contest the general election on the grounds of loan default. The bench of justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and justice Kamrul Islam Siddiqui also served a rule-nisi to authorities including Bangladesh Bank asking why Mahbub Uddin's inclusion in the bank's loan defaulter list should not be declared illegal. The orders came following Mahbub's writ petition after publication of newspaper reports on Wednesday, which included the BNP candidate for Dhaka-12 constituency in BB's defaulter list. Quoting the BB's Credit Information Bureau (CIB), a list of 76 loan defaulter candidates was published in different newspapers on Wednesday. In the hearing, his lawyer Barrister Ruhul Quddus Kajol said, "Mr Mahbub was surprised seeing his name in the loan defaulter list, as he never took a loan from any bank or was a guarantor for anyone's loan." "Mahbub contacted a responsible officer of CIB, who told him they did not include his name in the list," the lawyer added. The lawyer said, "Mahbub thinks some quarter must have got his name included in the loan defaulter list to tarnish his image." Meanwhile, legal expert Shahdin Malik said the guarantor of a loan defaulter should not be labelled directly as a defaulter. "None becomes a loan defaulter automatically for being a guarantor of a loan, there are records in the High Court," he observed. Those who are getting stay orders from the HC following writ petitions have not taken loans. They were loan guarantors, Shahdin said. "The HC is not delivering any protection to the real loan defaulters." bdnews24.
