<TITLE> Many eligible candidates left out for tough RPO: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, December 5 (bdnews24.com)  Many eligible candidates have been left out of the polls race because of the tough new electoral laws, the BNP secretary general has complained. "A number of otherwise competent candidates are being deprived of the chance to contest the polls as they're failing to meet the extremely stringent requirements laid down in the new Representation of the People Order," Khandakar Delwar Hossain said on Friday. He spoke to reporters as he was leaving his residence at the NAM flats block facing the Sangsad Bhaban for his constituency. "Under the circumstances, the Election Commission now must ensure that there shouldn't be any shortage of candidates in any constituency." "Because, it's the Election Commission who must ensure a properly participatory election." Replying to a query, he said, "We certainly won't be cowed down by the independent candidates." Commenting on sections of the new RPO, Delwar said, "The candidates wouldn't be facing any handicaps if the Election Commission would conduct the polls as it has done in the past. "Such anomalies as parties nominating two/three candidates for a seat wouldn't occur either." An optimistic Delwar, however, said, "We're going for the election hoping that the government will lift emergency as soon as the nomination withdrawal deadline expires. "We hope the caretaker government will not go back on its words." He said the party manifesto will be soon out too. Delwar is contesting the polls from Manikganj-1 constituency. bd
