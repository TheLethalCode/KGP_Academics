 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)The United Nations General Assembly for the first time adopted a Bangladesh-sponsored 'Culture of Peace' resolution recognising February 21 as International Mother Language Day. "[The Culture of Peace resolution] is an annual feature, but this year it was co-sponsored by 124 member states, the highest ever," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said in a press statement Sunday night. "This year's resolution was quite significant since this is the first time that a UN resolution included a reference to February 21st, the International Mother Language Day," the adviser said. "It also recognised the contribution of mother languages in promoting a Culture of Peace and cross-cultural dialogue," the statement said. Feb 21 was established as International Mother Day in 1998 by UNESCO.
