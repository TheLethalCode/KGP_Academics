 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The country's business community has laid out 52 recommendations for 21 sectors for the incoming government in the first 100 days of its term. They also made special requests for an accord through pre-election talks to formulate laws banning general strikes, barring children and minors from strikes and picketing, and forming a shadow government by opposition parties to boost public confidence. FBBCI president Annisul Huq presented the recommendations at a business forum titled "Macro-economic agenda" at Sonargaon Pan Pacific Hotel in the city on Saturday. Representatives of different business sectors from all over the country attended the event. "Even if the democratic government-to-be cannot finish the tasks in 100 days, it must start them for the sake of the nation's economic development," Annisul Huq told the forum. The recommendations include a BAPEX five-year work-plan with explorations and drilling in at least six wells. The business leaders demanded at least one well be drilled in the first 100 days of the new administration, also urging replacement of power plants over 20 years old. "There's no alternative to coal production," Anis said presenting the recommendations, adding the new government should finalise a coal policy if the incumbent interim administration failed to do it. With a view to overcoming power crises, the performance of the rented power plants should be evaluated and 500MW power plants be set up to meet summer power demands, the forum suggested. The recommendations on 'financial management and banking' included setting up of an NRB council for non-resident Bangladeshis along with forming a financial crisis management taskforce comprising representatives from both public and private sectors. The business leaders also pressed for a reduction in service charges for banking transactions by 30 per cent, a two point interest rate cut for project loans and working capital for productive industries and a further reduction on interest rate spread to four percentage points. "Commissions for foreign exchange transactions should be decreased to one per cent while the exchange rate on export earnings and foreign remittances should rise," the FBCCI chief said. The would-be government in the first 100 days should announce special economic zones for garments, ship-building, leather, plastic, information technology, light engineering and agro-processing industries, and finalise plans to develop infrastructure for an 'industrial village', the forum proposed. The recommendations on the transportation system say the four-lane expansion project of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway must accelerate, and the new authorities must finalise plans and start work on the elevated expressway network to solve the capital's traffic congestion. The business leaders also urged formation of a national shipping infrastructure development council for easy and cheaper transportation of commodities. All industries and the ports must be kept immune from hartals, it was stressed. A deep-sea port should established, service standard of the ports be upgraded and Mongla port be used in its full capacity, the recommendations said. The government must move for an export boost in coordination with the export promotion bureau, export development council, industries and export-based enterprises and Bangladesh missions abroad, Annisul Huq concluded. He said the recommendations would be handed to political parties. Stressing the need for a business-friendly bureaucracy, former adviser of the government and leading businessman Syed Manzur Elahi said, "The business community needs a pro-business democracy for economic development and a close tie with them." International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman said, "Development is possible if we can advance the Better Business Forum and Regulatory Reforms Commission." Calling upon the incoming government to focus on the country's physical and social infrastructure, former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo emphasised steps to rein in inflation, boost investment and materialise the fiscal policy and also ways to increase employment and growth and alleviate poverty. Another former FBCCI boss Mir Nasir Hossain dwelt on the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which included only input from donor agencies and bureaucrats while business people and stakeholders were ignored, he claimed. "We need an economic budget, not a political one," said Square Group chairman Samson H Chowdhury adding that nuclear power is now a must for the country's development. BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, former FBCCI president Yusuf Abdullah Harun, Bangladesh-British Chamber of Commerce & Industries president Shahgir Bakht Farooq and BKMEA president Fazlul Haque also spoke among others. bdnew
