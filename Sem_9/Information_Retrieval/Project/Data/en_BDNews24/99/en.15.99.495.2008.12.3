 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)-- Bangladesh can achieve Millennium Development Goals in health by 'scaling up' low cost programmes, says Fazle Hasan Abed, founder and chairperson of the country's largest NGO. "We will be able to achieve the MDGs in health related matters, especially in child and maternal mortality," the head of BRAC told reporters Wednesday after the inauguration of a conference on ' Scaling Up: An Essential Strategy to Attaining Good Health for All'. In the keynote speech, Abed stressed efficiency of health programmes to cover a wider population. "Do not go for innovation and small scale programmes, instead, go for effective and large scale models." 'Scaling up' refers to the effective, countrywide implementation of health programmes that have a standardised and low cost approach and the potential of reaching a vast majority, says NGO literature. The three-day conference, held at the BRAC Center for Development Management in Rajendrapur, is being attended by more than 120 international experts on health and development from 21 countries, said a statement by BRAC. "The conference id designed on scaling up and focusing the global community's efforts to assisting low-income countries to reach MDGs," it said. Speakers at the inaugural ceremony cited examples of successful 'scaling up' in Bangladesh in oral rehydration therapy, immunisation and treatment of tuberculosis. Less success has been reported in programmes to prevent maternal deaths, malaria and HIV/AIDS, the said. The most successful programmes have been based in rural areas, yet almost all future population growth will be in urban areas where there are a multiplicity of health providers and where communities may be less defined, the speakers said. Recommendations for using technologies such as mobile and the internet, to create new avenues for development of health programme, and capacity building, such as training health workers, were raised at the session. The ceremony, chaired by Dr Richard Cash of Harvard University, also heard from WHO's Dr Timothy Evans, Dr Stefan Nachuk of Rockefeller Foundation, Mary Taylor of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and BRAC executive director Dr AMR Chowdhury. bdnews
