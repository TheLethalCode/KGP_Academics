 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)Chairman of the newly formed Human Rights Commission Amirul Kabir Chowdhury vowed to ensure human rights "without fear or favour" as Sunday marked 60 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He repeated a call to the interim government to lift the state of emergency to protect human rights. "Some sections of emergency powers rules are against human rights." "Therefore, the sooner the state of emergency is lifted the better for safeguarding rights," said Chowdhury as he opened a human rights 'jamboree' in the capital to mark the anniversary. "I can give you solemn assurance on behalf of the commission and two other members that the commission will discharge its duties without fear or favour." "We can assure you further that we shall try to face the challenges as far as possible with courage and determination without being influenced or intimidated," said the chairman of the Rights Commission, which started functioning from Dec 1 this year. EU ambassador Stefan Frowein highlighted the freedom of media as a cornerstone in safeguarding human rights. "We should never forget that journalists are also defenders of human rights," Frowein said, addressing the jamboree at the Spectra Convention Centre. "The protection of media freedoms and avoidance of intimidation and harassment of journalists is also an important benchmark for human rights values," said the head of the European Commission delegation in Dhaka. "They are often in the frontline when it comes to voicing support for democratic values and reflecting an accurate picture of developments in a given country," said Frowein. bdn
