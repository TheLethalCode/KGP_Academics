Rangpur got off to a fine start with opener Salahuddin and one-down Al Amin contributing 41 and 42 runs before Mossaddik rattled the top order claiming three wickets for 35. Middle order batsmen Sujon Shahriar (30) and Sakib Sarkar (33) raised some hopes of reaching the target, but Kazi Sumon and Abu Zafor Siddique dashed Rangpur's hope wrecking the middle and tail to return two wickets each for 36 and 27 respectively.
