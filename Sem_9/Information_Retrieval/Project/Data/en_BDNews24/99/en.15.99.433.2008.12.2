 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com) The non-government primary school teachers have urged the political parties on Tuesday to include in their manifestoes the issue of putting the services of primary school teachers on the government service payroll. Leaders of one faction of the non-government primary school teachers association, led by its secretary general Md Mansur Ali, made the demand at a rally at the Central Shaheed Minar. Mansur Ali said, "We call upon all political parties to include in their manifestoes the issue of putting our jobs on the government service payroll when they come to power". Awami League, Bikalpadhara and other teacher leaders expressed solidarity with the demand. Prof AK Azad, former DU vice chancellor and chairman of Awami League sub-committee on education and human resources development, said, "If the government of the pro-liberation forces is formed in future, this demand will be considered."

Others who extended support are AL presidium member Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Bikalpadhara secretary general major (retd) Abdul Mannan, former general secretary of DU teachers' Samity Prof. Md Akhtaruzzaman and chief coordinator of national teacher-employee front Prof Kazi Faruq Ahmed.
