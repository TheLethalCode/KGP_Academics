<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) The government on Sunday appealed the Supreme Court to reverse the recent High Court ruling that cancelled key clauses of the emergency powers rules. The hearing may take place at the vacation bench of Appellate Division chamber judge Joynal Abedin, said the deputy attorney general. DAG Zahirul Islam Mukul told bdnews24.com that they had filed an appeal against the High Court ruling and also sought a freeze on the ruling. Amir-ul Islam will argue on behalf of the writ petitioners, while the state will be represented by attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. The High Court in its order overturned, among others, the clause of the EPR that bans bail for the convicts and prohibits a stay on the ruling while the trial court is hearing an appeal. The bench of justices of ABM Khairul Huq and Abdul Huq on Thursday also cancelled the clause that no order under the emergency powers ordinance can be challenged. It also passed a ruling that the Anticorruption Commission cannot change the trial court, on a writ petition that challenged the legality of the EPR. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, editor of the New Age daily Nurul Kabir and assistant professor of the Department of Law of the University of Dhaka Sheikh Hafizur Rahman Curzon filed the petition. In its orders, the High Court declared illegal and scrapped the Section 5 of the emergency powers ordinance and sections 11(3), 19(d).(e) of the EPR. The orders also partially scrapped the Section 18 (a) of the EPR. The court said that the state of emergency cannot go on for an indefinite period and the main laws of the constitution cannot be changed. Bangladesh was a people's republic and the fact had to be represented in all spheres, the ruling said. It is the parliament which has the power to formulate laws and though laws within a limited purview can be formulated, they cannot be used to deprive the people of their basic rights, the ruling observed. b
