 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  Seventeen 27th BCS agitators were arrested and detained after laying siege to the Public Service Commission office on Tuesday. Some 60 ex-candidates locked the main gate of the entrance and smashed windowpanes of the building at around 9am Tuesday morning, leaving the staffers stranded inside the building. The demonstrators, composed of first round 27th BCS exam qualifiers, who failed to pass in the second-round results, held a rally outside the building. Police came to the spot at around 1:30pm and detained a number of ex-candidates. The remaining demonstrators got into the police van voluntarily. Additional deputy commissioner of police Raqib Sarker told bdnews24.com that some 17 arrestees had been taken to Kafrul Police Station. "Necessary steps will be taken against the arrestees," Darkar had said, adding that of the 17, 12 were ex-candidates and five were supporters. Manjur Hossain, personal secretary to the PSC chairman, handed the reporters a handout that stated that a number of enraged ex-candidates, who failed to qualify in the 27th BCS retakes, filed a writ petition with the High Court against the government and the PSC. The commission said it would not make any statement as the petition was being considered by the court. It also hoped that all involved with the examinations would not deliver any statements or comments on the sub judice matter. The candidates started observing a fast-until-death demonstration at the Central Shaheed Minar from Nov. 1 demanding that authorities upheld the first-round results. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman broke their fasting on Nov. 20 and assured them of a logical solution. The advisory council committee on administrative reforms and good governance on Nov. 16 had been directed to formulate necessary recommendations to eliminate the complexities centering the 27th BCS exam results. The PSC had posted an advertisement on June 28, 2005 for the 27th BCS exams. As many as 1,36,105 people applied and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The PSC called 16,418 for the oral test, declared 3,567 candidates successful after the oral tests, and asked authorities to appoint them. However, allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism had marred the transparency of the 'first batch' results. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results on May 30, 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and establish transparency in the wake of allegations of irregularities. The new results were published on Sept. 23 after 16 months of dispute and legal wrangles. Some 10,412 examinees passed in the 'second batch' after fresh oral tests were taken. However, the government's decision to recall the original results triggered outrage among the first qualified batch, who had called for the removal of the PSC chairman and have been protesting since then. b
