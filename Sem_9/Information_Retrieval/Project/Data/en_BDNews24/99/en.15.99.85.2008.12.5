 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  Socio-cultural and political organisations are observing the 45th death anniversary of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, a champion of sub-continental democracy through various programmes on Friday. The famous politician died this day in 1963 in a Beirut hotel in rather mysterious circumstances. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed gave separate messages marking the day. The presidential message said: "Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy fought throughout his life for establishing democratic ways in our national life." The chief adviser said in his message, "Suhrawardy, a pioneering democratic leader of the Indian Muslims worked most courageously to establish the democratic rights of the downtrodden and backward regional Muslims." Jatiya Party, Bangabandhu Shangskritik Jote and other organisations observed the day by laying flowers at Suhrawardy's grave on the High Court premises and offering prayers. Cultural personalities like film producer Mirza Abdul Khaleque, actors ATM Shamsuzzaman and Falguni Hamid, Faruque Pathhan, Arun Sarkar Rana, KMR Manjur and others participated at a discussion held at the Gulshan office of Bangabandhu Shangskritik Jote on the occasion. bd
