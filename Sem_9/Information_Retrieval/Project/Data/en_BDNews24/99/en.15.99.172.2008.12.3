<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  A book that seeks to make understanding of the Constitution of Bangladesh easier for the people was launched Wednesday. Explanation of articles of the Constitution, its amendments and their original version have been included in the book, Golam Rabbani, a former Supreme Court judge who authored the book, said at a ceremony to launch the book's cover on Wednesday at the National Press Club. "All citizens of the country need to go over the Constitution to know and enjoy their rights secured by the plenary source of law of the country," former adviser to the caretaker government Sultana Kamal said as she welcomed the initiative. Kamal, who unveiled the book cover, said, "We had shed the religion-based nationality during the War of Independence. But later Islam was made the state religion and 'In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful' also added to the Constitution through amendment." Rabbani said one of the two military rulers in the country tweaked the 1972 Constitution in 1978 to delete secularism, one of the main pillars of the nation. On the debate of Bangalee nationality or Bangladeshi nationality, Rabbani said, "I've written it as 'Bangladeshi nationality' since the contribution of indigenous people to the Independence war should not be ignored by making it Bangalee nationality." Prof Hayat Mamud edited the book, published by Samunnoy, funded the non-profit Manusher Jonyo Foundation. President of the Samunnoy Prof Atiur Rahman said the people of Bangladesh fought for their economic, social and political freedom. The original Constitution could have helped realise much of the dreams of the people by ensuring their rights, he said. He said Rabbani's book can give a picture of the main goals of the Constitution had set out and how it stands today after the amendments. Columnist Syed Abul Moksud, Dhaka University law professor Mizanur Rahman, Jatiya Party leader GM Quader, among others, spoke on the occasion. bd
