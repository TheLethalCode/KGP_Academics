 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has turned down the government's petition to reverse the recent High Court ruling that cancelled key clauses of the emergency powers rules, a lawyer says. The vacation bench of Appellate Division chamber judge Joynal Abedin rejected the appeal on Monday. The court's adviser ( amicus curie ) AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the Appellate Division chamber judge had rejected the government appeal. The chamber judge did not stay the HC ruling and set Dec 15 for the next hearing to be held by a full bench, he added. Amir-ul Islam argued for the writ petitioners, while the state was represented by attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. The High Court in its order overturned, among others, the clause of the EPR that bans bail for the convicts and prohibits a stay on the ruling while the trial court is hearing an appeal. The bench of justices of ABM Khairul Huq and Abdul Huq on Dec. 4 also cancelled the clause that no order under the emergency powers ordinance can be challenged. It also passed a ruling that the Anticorruption Commission cannot change the trial court, on a writ petition that challenged the legality of the EPR. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, editor of the New Age daily Nurul Kabir and assistant professor of the Department of Law of the University of Dhaka Sheikh Hafizur Rahman Curzon filed the petition. In its orders, the High Court declared illegal and scrapped the Section 5 of the emergency powers ordinance and sections 11(3), 19(d).(e) of the EPR. The orders also partially scrapped the Section 18 (a) of the EPR. The court said the emergency rule cannot go on for an indefinite period and the main laws of the constitution cannot be changed. Bangladesh was a people's republic and the fact had to be represented in all spheres, the ruling said. It is the parliament which has the power to formulate laws and though laws within a limited purview can be formulated, they cannot be used to deprive the people of their basic rights, the ruling observed. b
