<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Diplomatic comment and intervention into the internal politics of Bangladesh, in contravention to the UN Vienna Convention, has increased ahead of the parliamentary electionand the media is a party to it, said a report published Saturday. "It's not right for our media people to ask questions about our own political issues to foreign diplomats," noted former BBC journalist Ataus Samad, at the launch of the report by the National Interest Group. "They should be asked questions about their own country." The report by the recently founded Dhaka-based research body has proposed 8 recommendations to overcome such unwarranted "interference". Recommendations for national action are: raising awareness among public and policy makers about diplomatic etiquette, cancellation of facilities of diplomats breaching the Vienna Convention, severance of relation between foreign missions and political parties, media blackout of comments on internal affairs by diplomats and ensuring a strong stance on the issue from the next elected government. The three recommendations for the diplomatic community are: strict adherence to diplomatic etiquette, a public record of diplomats' meetings with political figures and informing the home ministry before meeting any political figure. "Efforts are underway to install a pro-US government," alleged Mahmudur Rahman, NIG convenor. "But, if the election is fair, the result will be miraculous and beyond the expectations of a lot of people." NIG member Forhad Mazahar had strong words on the subject: "Interference by any diplomat in the internal affairs of another country is tantamount to declaring war." "They must go though the ministry of foreign affairs on any matters touching internal affairs," said the writer and columnist. NIG was formed in March this year, as "a non-political and non-profit making research center  and an institute of advocacy to ensure the liberty and sovereignty of Bangladesh", its website says. Among its aims are "to document all activities undertaken by diplomats residing in Bangladesh that are against the Vienna Convention and international protocols" and to publish a report every three months detailing such activities. Saturday's report, unveiled at the National Press Club, is its second to date. bdnew
