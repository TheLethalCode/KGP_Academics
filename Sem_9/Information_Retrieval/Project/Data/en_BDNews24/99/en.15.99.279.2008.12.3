 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League has asked the Election Commission to allow political parties until Dec. 11, the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers, to finalise candidates. "There are some problems in finalising candidates before scrutiny. That's why we have asked the commission to give us time to finalise the candidates until the last date of withdrawal of nomination papers," HT Imam, , the party's election committee coordinator said on Wednesday. He spoke to the media after a meeting with the chief election commissioner at the EC Secretariat. Imam said the EC had promised to bring amendments to the Representation of the People's Order to provide the political parties with opportunities. According to the schedule, the deadlines for scrutiny of nomination for the general election are Dec. 3 and 4 and withdrawal of nomination is on Dec. 11. The submission of nomination papers ended on Nov. 30. The amended RPO stipulates that before scrutiny of nomination papers the parties notify the returning officer of final candidates. But there is provision of keeping a 'panel' or list in 'order of preference' of nominees for a constituency. A BNP delegation is also set to meet with the EC in the afternoon. bd
