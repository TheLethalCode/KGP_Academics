 London, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com/BBC)- At least five England players are not prepared to return to India following the Mumbai terror attacks, according to former Test fast bowler Dominic Cork. The players are waiting for a security report before deciding whether to return to India for the Test series. But Cork told BBC Radio 5 Live, "I know of at least five or six players who are going to turn their backs on England. "Those I've spoken to are traumatised. What they saw on television was 10 times worse than what was shown here." Cork, who played in 37 Tests and 32 one-day internationals for England, refused to name the players involved but said the most important thing was that the squad stuck together. He added, "If one doesn't go, they all shouldn't go. They make a stand and say 'it's not safe for us to be there'." The two final one-day matches were cancelled after the attacks in Mumbai last week. The England players returned home but have been offered a revised schedule, with the first Test in Chennai from 11 December and the second starting in Mohali on 19 December. There may be a two-day warm-up match in Abu Dhabi - but that would mean the players making a quick decision. The England and Wales Cricket Board have stressed that regardless of the security report findings, the players would not be forced to go. Cork, who signed for Hampshire this summer after five years with Lancashire, added, "I am not sure about the captain (Kevin Pietersen). I know of certain players who are going to put their families first. "I've spoken to players and they are very upset and feel they wouldn't be able to go out and play cricket in India. "What is the point of England taking a diluted squad? You're going to India in their backyard. You have a big series against West Indies, and then Australia. It's not very good preparation. The guys will not be focused. "My issue is that the guys who are not brave enough to make a decision (not to go) are the ones who are not sure of their place. They will go out not wanting to be there." Courtesy : B
