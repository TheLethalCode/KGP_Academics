 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com24 correspondent Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  The scrutiny of nomination for the general election to 300 constituencies has left Awami league and BNP without candidate in 12 constituencies. "The Election Commission has nothing to say about why candidates could not pass the nomination since as it has been acting in line with the law," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters at his office on Friday. The EC found as 35 nominations of AL in 34 constituencies had been cancelled and the party had no replacements in seven constituencies. The constituencies are Pabna-2 (AK Khandker), Gaibandha-5 (Fazle Rabbi Miah), Potuakhali-2 (ASM Firoz), Feni-2 (Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury), Noakhali-6 (Mohammad Ali), Laksmipur-2 (Harunur Rashid) and Mymensingh-9 (Abdus Salam). As many as 52 nominations of BNP have been cancelled in 43 constituencies, leaving the party without representation in five constituencies. The constituencies are Chittagong-5 (Giasuddin Kader Chowdhury), Chittagong-16 (Mostafa Kamal Pasha), Sirajganj-5 (Monzur Kader and Golam Moula Khan Bablu), Jhalokathi-1 (Rafiqul Islam Jamal), and Dhaka-11 (Mohammad Shahabuddin). A total of 557 nominations for the ninth parliamentary election have flunked the scrutiny, with Dhaka seats seeing the most cancellations. After the final day of scrutiny on Thursday, 1,899 of a total of 2,456 nominations filed were valid, the EC Secretariat's joint secretary Rafiqul Islam said. Independent candidates have the largest number of 188 nominations annulled. HM Ershad-led Jatiya Party has 59 and Jamaat-e-Islami three nominations declared invalid. The nomination of Jamaat's candidate Rafiqul Islam Khan (Sirajganj-4) has been cancelled as he was found to have defaulted on bank loan payments. The EC cancelled those nominations due to loan and utility bill default, conviction of candidates, and misinformation in the affidavit, Khan said. Ninety-two nominations have been cancelled on the grounds of loan default, 44 for bill default, 12 for tax evasion, he added. The convicted candidates are Iqbal Hasan Mahmud (Sirajganj-2), Abdul Ghani (Meherpur-2), Shahidul Islam (Narail-2), Nurul Islam Moni (Barguna-2), Hafiz Ibrahim (Bhola-2), Lutfozzaman Babor (Netrokona-4), Wadud Bhuiyan (Khagracchari) and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir (Chandpur-1). However, the candidates can appeal the cancellation with the EC, he added. According to the election schedule, hearing of objections against any EC decision on candidature will be held from Dec. 5-7. But the EC Secretariat's deputy secretary, law, AKM Salimullah said the appeals be be heard from 9am on Saturday (Dec. 6). Until Friday evening, 116 applications have been filed for hearing, he added. AL spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam, asked about cancellation of AL candidatures, said, "It is a temporary matter. Those who face nomination cancellation can appeal to the Election Commission." "After the appeals are held, we can finally say how many candidates have had nominations cancelled." The last day for withdrawal of candidacy is Dec. 11. The deadline for submission of nomination papers was Nov. 30. bdn
