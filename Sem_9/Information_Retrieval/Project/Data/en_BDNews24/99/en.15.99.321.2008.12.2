 NEW DELHI, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The England and Wales cricket board (ECB) will send a security consultant to India before deciding whether to take part in this month's two-test series following the deadly attacks in Mumbai. The ECB tentatively agreed to play after the Indian authorities switched the venues to Chennai and Mohali, from Ahmedabad and Mumbai in the west. "The ECB will be sending their security consultant for discussions with the authorities in India before final clearance is given for the tour," Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement on Monday. "ECB has informed BCCI that England are agreeable to tour India and play two tests, the first at Chennai from Dec. 11 to 15 and the second at Mohali from Dec. 19 to 23. The three-day tour match has been cancelled." Doubt has hung over the tests since England flew home on Saturday, having called off the last two games in a seven-game one-day series. English media have reported some players are reluctant to return due to security concerns following the Mumbai attacks in which 10 Islamist gunmen killed 183 people, including 22 foreigners. Cancelling the three-day warmup game, scheduled from Friday in the Gujarat city of Baroda, would give the ECB more time to get security advice. The BCCI switched the tests from Mumbai, the original second venue, and Ahmedabad, the first venue and main city in the adjoining Gujarat state in India's western region. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has urged England to play in India if their safety concerns are addressed. Its chief Haroon Lorgat has pledged support to the two boards to ensure cricket was not disrupted. The ICC expressed concern in its statement on Sunday that violence could damage the game in its global commercial hub India, with teams already refusing to tour Pakistan over security fears. Indian organisers have already postponed the $6 million prizemoney Champions League Twenty20 tournament with eight teams from five countries, due to have started this week
