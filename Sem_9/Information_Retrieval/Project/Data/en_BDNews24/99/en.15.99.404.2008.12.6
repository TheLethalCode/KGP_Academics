 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com24 correspondent Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission started hearings on appeals against 132 out of 557 cancelled nominations among the objections received by the commission up to midday Saturday. The hearings began at around 11am at the conference room of the EC Secretariat. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and two other commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammed Sohul Hussain are present there. Some 132 appeals against cancellation of nominations as well as 11 appeals against the EC's validation of candidature had been submitted up to Saturday midday. Among the appellants, 15 had nominations cancelled on grounds of bill default. The commission had validated one nomination for Sylhet-2, of independent candidate Mohibur Rahman, up to midday. The verdicts were being handed down immediately after the appeals being heard in presence of the nominees. Prospective candidates whose nominations were rejected after scrutiny, or anyone objecting to nominations accepted by the EC, can appeal up to Dec 7. The hearings will continue till Dec 10, not including Eid day on Dec 9. According to the election schedule, hearing of objections against any EC decision on candidature was to be held from Dec. 5-7. The last day for withdrawal of candidacy is Dec. 11. The deadline for submission of nomination papers was Nov. 30. The scrutiny of nomination for the general election to 300 constituencies has left Awami league and BNP without candidate in 12 constituencies. "The Election Commission has nothing to say about why candidates could not pass the nomination since it has been acting in line with the law," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters at his office on Friday. Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam, asked about cancellations Friday, said, "It is a temporary matter. Those who face nomination cancellation are appealing to the Election Commission." "After the appeals are held, we can finally say how many candidates have had nominations cancelled." The EC found as many as 35 nominations of AL in 34 constituencies had been cancelled and the party had no replacements in seven constituencies. The constituencies are Pabna-2 (AK Khandker), Gaibandha-5 (Fazle Rabbi Miah), Potuakhali-2 (ASM Firoz), Feni-2 (Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury), Noakhali-6 (Mohammad Ali), Laksmipur-2 (Harunur Rashid) and Mymensingh-9 (Abdus Salam). As many as 52 nominations of BNP have been cancelled in 43 constituencies, leaving the party without representation in five constituencies. The constituencies are Chittagong-5 (Giasuddin Kader Chowdhury), Chittagong-16 (Mostafa Kamal Pasha), Sirajganj-5 (Monzur Kader and Golam Moula Khan Bablu), Jhalokathi-1 (Rafiqul Islam Jamal), and Dhaka-11 (Mohammad Shahabuddin). A total of 557 nominations for the ninth parliamentary election have flunked the scrutiny, with Dhaka seats seeing the most cancellations. After the final day of scrutiny on Thursday, 1,899 of a total of 2,456 nominations filed were found valid, the EC Secretariat's joint secretary Rafiqul Islam said. Independent candidates have the largest number of 188 nominations annulled. HM Ershad-led Jatiya Party has 59 and Jamaat-e-Islami three nominations declared invalid. The nomination of Jamaat's candidate Rafiqul Islam Khan (Sirajganj-4) has been cancelled as he was found to have defaulted on bank loan payments. A total of ninety-two nominations have been cancelled on the grounds of loan default, 44 for bill default, 12 for tax evasion, said Khan. The EC also cancelled seven nominations of convicted candidates, he added. The convicted candidates are Iqbal Hasan Mahmud (Sirajganj-2), Abdul Ghani (Meherpur-2), Shahidul Islam (Narail-2), Nurul Islam Moni (Barguna-2), Hafiz Ibrahim (Bhola-2), Lutfozzaman Babor (Netrokona-4), Wadud Bhuiyan (Khagracchari) and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir (Chandpur-1). However, the candidates may still appeal against the cancellations to the EC, said Khan. bdnews24.c
