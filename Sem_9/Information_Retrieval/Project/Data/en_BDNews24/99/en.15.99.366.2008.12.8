 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Business leaders have urged Awami League president Sheikh Hasina to tweak the party's election manifesto to the expectations of the businesses. A delegation of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry met with the AL chief at her Sudha Sadan home on Monday to pursue the major political party to make sure that their recommendations were reflected in the public declaration of intentions. The country's business community on Nov 15 laid out 52 recommendations for 21 sectors for the incoming government in the first 100 days of its term. They also made special requests for an accord to formulate laws banning general strikes, barring children and minors from strikes and picketing, and forming a shadow government by opposition parties to boost public confidence. Emerging from the meeting, FBCCI president Annisul Huq told reporters that it was 'a courtesy call' on the AL chief. "We have briefed Sheikh Hasina on the problems we are currently facing," he said. "We want Awami League to include our demands in its election manifesto." The delegation planned to organise a conference along with all business organisations across the country ahead of national elections. "We also came to invite Sheikh Hasina to the conference and she has accepted our invitation," he said. Asked whether they would invite BNP chief Khaleda Zia also he said that they had come to invite Hasina only. Later, AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Isalm told reporters that the party president had agreed to attend the conference. "The businessmen wanted to organise the conference with our leader only," he said. Among others, BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parzez, BKMEA president Fazlul Haque and AL commerce and industry affairs secretary Faruk Khan were present. bd
