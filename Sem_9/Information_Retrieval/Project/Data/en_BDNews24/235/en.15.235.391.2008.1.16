 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com) - The government is considering holding at least one cabinet meeting outside Dhaka every month in an attempt to build confidence in the caretaker administration, an official said Wednesday. "When we hold these meetings, specific problems from that district will be discussed, in addition to the usual proposals from different ministries," the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "The move will help solve major problems the district is suffering from more quickly," said Munaim following a council of advisers' discussion on the matter at a cabinet meeting Sunday. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "The matter of holding cabinet meetings outside Dhaka is being considered." "The initial thinking is to address any major problems of the district concerned," Rahman said. The adviser added that it was likely that the first meeting would be held in the most problematic district of the country, before moving on to other areas. The Awami League administration took an initiative to hold a cabinet meeting in Natore, while the BNP-led alliance sought to hold one in Chittagong, although they were both cancelled for security reasons. bdnews24.c
