<TITLE> Italian minister quits over wife's arrest, backs PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's justice minister quit on Wednesday over an arrest order for his politician wife but his party said it would not withdraw support for Prime Minister Romano Prodi, which could have brought down the government. "I am resigning because between love for my family and for power, I choose the former," Clemente Mastella told parliament in a sometimes tearful speech after a house arrest warrant for his wife was issued as part of a corruption investigation. The head of a small Catholic party in Prodi's centre-left coalition, Mastella said the warrant for the house arrest of his wife, who runs the council of the Campania region, was the latest in series of attempts to discredit him. Mastella controls three seats in the upper house or Senate, where Prodi clings to power with a majority of just two seats. With the fragile 19-month-old government facing collapse if Mastella's small Udeur party withdrew parliamentary support, the premier and his coalition allies urged the minister to stay on. Udeur Senator Tommaso Barbato said Mastella had declined but that the party would "absolutely not" abandon Prodi's alliance. Mastella has complicated Prodi's tenure by fighting with leftist allies and threatening to bring down the government, but without his senate support Prodi would have faced even more difficulty in passing key legislation than he already does. Even communists who have often clashed with Mastella, one of the more conservative forces in government, urged him to stay. "There will be facts to clarify but Mastella should be allowed to continue his good work," said Franco Giordano, head of the largest communist party in the ruling coalition. Mastella's wife, Sandra Lonardo, presides over the council of the region around Naples and faced a house arrest order on Wednesday in a corruption investigation. She portrayed her impending arrest as part of a campaign against her family. "I think this is the bitter price my husband and I are paying for our defence of Catholic values and the principles of moderation and tolerance against fanaticism and extremism," she was quoted as saying by ANSA news agency. A maverick, colourful figure in Italian politics, Mastella was given a cabinet post after the 2006 election in which Prodi ousted conservative Silvio Berlusconi to ensure the support of the Udeur, though that support has often wavered. Formerly a minister under Berlusconi, Mastella has courted controversy, not least by being best man at the wedding of a confessed Mafia associate in 20
