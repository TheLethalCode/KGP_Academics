 Oagadougou, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West African heads of state agreed on Friday to convene a regional summit to discuss instability in the Sahel, particularly the Tuareg uprisings in northern Mali and Niger. Weeks after the killing of four French tourists in Mauritania by al Qaeda, the 15 nations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) agreed to hold the conference in the Malian capital Bamako in the first quarter of 2008. The meeting will aim to "reduce the tensions in this part of the region and allow a debate on security issues, the circulation of light arms, drug trafficking and the development needs of the population," said a final statement on Friday at the ECOWAS summit in the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou. Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaore applauded efforts by his counterpart in Niger Mamadou Tandja and Malian leader Amadou Toumani Toure to resist a rebellion led by nomadic Tuareg peoples in the Sahara and the arid Sahel belt to the south. The uprising in Niger has been the more bloody, with at least 49 soldiers killed by the Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ) since it launched an insurrection in February. "In the Sahel area, the rebel movements which have appeared threaten the peace and security of the whole region," Compaore said. The killing of the French tourists on Christmas Eve and an attack on soldiers in Mauritania, both attributed to al Qaeda's North African branch, stirred concerns among foreign security agencies that the group is spreading its operations south. "It is obvious there is a security problem, in particular in the Sahara which has become a centre for all kinds of trafficking and could also shelter terrorist movements," said Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Djibril Bassolet.
