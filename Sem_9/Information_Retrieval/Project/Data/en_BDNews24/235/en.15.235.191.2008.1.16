 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest pubs company Punch Taverns Plc said trading over Christmas was subdued in a challenging period for the industry, sending its shares to a three-year low and hitting others in the sector. A double whammy of declining consumer confidence and the recent smoking ban in England and Wales led to a 0.8 percent fall in like-for-like profit at its 7,581-pub leased estate, a performance Punch said on Wednesday was satisfactory. Punch said like-for-like sales at its 869 managed pubs fell 2.2 percent, though food sales grew 1.0 percent to account for 39 percent of total sales. The company forecast 10 million pounds ($19.6 million) of additional savings in its current financial year from a reorganisation of field and central support teams. Morgan Stanley analysts, who have an "overweight" rating on Punch stock with a 1,360 pence target, said the update was disappointing as it signalled a reversal from the 2 percent like-for-like sales growth in leased pubs in the company's first eight weeks, when managed pubs like-for-like sales were flat. "This is largely a function of the weak beer market, hit by a weaker consumer and the smoking ban. A continuation of these trends could imply a 20 million pound EBITDA downgrade, mostly in managed pubs," the bank said, adding the extra cost savings and lower interest bill would mitigate the weaker trading. LONG-TERM POSITIVE Punch shares, which had underperformed the UK travel and leisure sector by 28 percent over the past year, were down 8.6 percent at 565 pence by 0915 GMT with the broader mid-cap sector down 2.0 percent The stock fell as low as 563-1/2p, its lowest since late 2004. In the same sector Enterprise Inns Plc, Mitchells & Butlers Plc, J.D. Wetherspoon Plc, Greene King Plc and Marstons Plc were down as much as 4.5 percent. Punch said it was too early to determine long-term trends following the smoking ban in England and Wales but still held the view that the ban would have a positive effect on the industry in the medium to long term. "This is being borne out in Scotland where the ban came into force in March 2006 and like-for-like profit in our Scottish leased estate over the 20 week period has grown by 1.6 percent." Merrill Lynch analysts, who rate Punch stock a "buy", said in a broker note: "It could have been a lot worse. It would be wrong to extrapolate recent trends for the rest of the year. "The big food-led managed houses in the Spirit estate are taking market share from the private sector and ... the leased estate is also outperforming and is insulated, at least in the medium term, from the harsher realities of the High Street (broader retail sector)."
