<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)Visitors have to pay an entry fee this year to visit the 'Ekushey Boi Mela', the yearly book fair held on the premises of the Bangla Academy. Bangla Academy Director general Syed Mohammad Shahed told bdnews24.com Wednesday that they had decided to put the entry rate at Tk 2. "The amount raised would be used for publications and research work of the academy," Prof Shahed added. The Bangla Academy chief said that research works of the academy had come to a standstill due to a shortage of funds. "It takes about Tk 100 to buy a book. There is no reason for the entry fee to have any impact on the visitors," he added. He also said that this year's fair would see a decreased number of stalls. "The decision was to facilitate visitors to move more freely on the fair premises. Other than that, there is also a construction job going on the academy premises which is taking up some space," Shahed said. He said that to avoid the hassles of long queues to collect entry passes, they would arrange more entry points this year. bdnews
