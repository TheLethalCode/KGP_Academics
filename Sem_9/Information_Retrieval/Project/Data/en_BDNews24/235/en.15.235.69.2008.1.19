 Chittagong, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) --The local government ministry is set to give Chittagong City Corporation Tk 4 crore to build two sluice gates on the city's Chaktai and Mohesh canals in a bid to solve the ongoing water logging problem. Local government, rural development and cooperatives adviser Anwarul Iqbal briefed reporters during a tour of Mohesh Khal Saturday. Acting city mayor M Manzoor Alam told reporters at the briefing that water logging during the monsoon season would be drastically reduced if the two sluice gates go into operation at the confluence of the Karnaphuli River. Anwarul pointed out however that permanent water logging had become a feature of low lying areas of the city because of the absence of urban planning. "The water logging problem can not be solved if the city's canals are not freed from land grabbers," said the adviser. "The CCC will have to work in co-operation with the Chittagong Development Authority, the Water Development Board and WASA to find a permanent solution to water logging," he said. "In working towards this, the city corporation will have to act as the main controller." "The city corporation must remove all illegal structures from both sides of all canals and drains, as an emergency measure before the rainy season," Anwarul added. The LGRD adviser told reporters that the ministry would try to allocate funds for the purpose. CCC secretary Khairul Alam said: "Road work has begun on both sides of the canals, which have already been freed from the land grabbers." bdnews24.
