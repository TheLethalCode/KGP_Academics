 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush prodded the Egyptian government on Wednesday to cede more freedom and applauded the work of journalists, bloggers and judges seeking independence from interference. On the final stop of a long Middle East tour, Bush said that such civil society voices had taken the lead in promoting freedom in the Arab world's most populous country. "Progress toward greater political openness is being led by the Egyptians themselves, by pioneering journalists ... bloggers or judges insisting on independence," he said in a statement at an appearance alongside Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "You (Egyptians) have taken steps towards ... democratic reform, and my hope is that the Egyptian government will build on these important steps and give the people of this proud nation a greater voice in your future," he added.

His main opponent in that race, liberal Ayman Nour, was later jailed on what he says are fabricated fraud charges. In parliamentary elections the same year the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won one fifth of the seats in parliament. Analysts said that after the strong Islamist showing, Washington stopped pressing Mubarak so hard on democracy.

The crackdown also put an end to a campaign by judges for more independence from the executive. Some of them had spoken out against abuses and irregularities in the elections, which they had a constitutional duty to supervise. The authorities have also targeted journalists, at least 11 of whom have been sentenced to jail terms since last September in connection with their writings. None of them are yet in jail because their cases have gone to appeal. The police have harassed several Egyptian bloggers, human rights groups say. One of them, Abdel Karim Suleiman, is serving a four-year jail term for insulting Mubarak and making blasphemous comments. Bush's stop in Egypt was one of the shortest of his tour, at less than three hours, and many Egyptians said the brevity reflected a decline in US interest in Egy
