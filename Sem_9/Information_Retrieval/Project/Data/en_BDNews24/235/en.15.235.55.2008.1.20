 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Khaleda Zia Saturday called on her party leaders and workers to pray for the country as she said it was going through a crisis. The detained BNP chief spoke to the waiting people on the way out of her Dhaka cantonment home where she had paid her last respects to mother Toyeba Majumdar. Many BNP adherents flocked to the cantonment to have a glimpse of their leader, who was arrested on Sept 3 last year along with her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco. Some BNP leaders enquired about her wellbeing. "You can well understand how I can be," Khaleda replied. The BNP chief said the prices of rice "shot up to Tk 40"an issue she was apparently concerned about. Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Coco also visited their cantonment home separately to see the body of their grandmother. Tarique was kept at Shahbagh Police Station and Coco at the Cantonment Police Station before they were taken to their home on Shaheed Mainul Road. Toyeba died late Friday in a hospital in the northern district of Dinajpur from a heart attack. She was 87. The body arrived in Dhaka Saturday afternoon by helicopter and was taken to Khaleda's home by ambulance from Kurmitola. Khaleda was led into the cantonment at 7.27pm after son Tarique Rahman left the place at 7.15pm. Khaleda was driven back to special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex at 9.45pm. Coco was the first to pay last respects to his grandmother. Arafat was in the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. Tarique in white punjabi arrived at the cantonment at 5.52pm, minutes after Coco left for the hospital. Tarique, senior joint secretary general of the BNP, took part in a namaz-e-janaza for Toyeba in the cantonment. Moulana Joynal Abedin led the janaza attended by about 150 people. A second janaza in Dhaka took place at Azad Mosque in Gulshan at about 9.00pm, Khaleda's lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told bdnews24.com. Toyeba's family was to take the body back to Dinajpur Saturday night by road. Another janaza will be held there around 11.00am Sunday before she is buried in Dinajpur town, next to the grave of her husband Iskander Majumdar. bdnews24.com
