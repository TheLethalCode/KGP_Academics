<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British sweets-to-DVDs retailer Woolworths Plc said that trading over the key Christmas period was "very challenging", knocking its shares, but it expected its retail unit to return to profitability this year. Woolworths, a fallen titan of the British high street with more than 800 stores, said on Wednesday its retail like-for-like sales fell 3.2 percent in the 49 weeks to Jan. 12, having fallen 0.4 percent in the 38 weeks to Oct. 27. The retailer said at the end of October it expected like-for-like sales growth to be "flattish" for the full year. "Christmas was a very challenging time for the group," Chief Executive Trevor Bish-Jones said in a trading update. "We are pleased that the progress made across the group through this year is expected to lead to an improvement in profitability, including Woolworths Retail returning to profit". Shares in Woolworths, which have underperformed the UK general retailers' index by around 50 percent in the past year, were down 16 percent at 8.4 pence at 1316 GMT, valuing the company at 122.5 million pounds ($239.9 million) . "Woolworths has unfortunately done little to alleviate the current High Street gloom," Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Richard Hunter said in a note. "Given the fiercely competitive environment in which they operate, along with a lacklustre consumer, their traditionally vital Christmas period has suffered from generally lower footfall," Hunter said, adding that Woolworths had joined other retailers in being extremely cautious about the rest of 2008. Woolworths, which traditionally relies on Christmas to turn a profit, said it remained concerned about the underlying level of consumer confidence in the year ahead. Credit Suisse said the cautious outlook was likely to lead to downgrades to profit forecasts for the next financial year. "While margin improvements and cost management offer a degree of self-help and will allow the retail business to post a small profit this year ... the long-running absence of turnover growth to drive positive operational gearing momentum remains an impediment to strong share price performance," they added. RETAIL BACK IN PROFIT "Returning the core chain to profitability is a significant achievement, owing much to management concentration on cost and margin control in a difficult trading environment," said Panmure Gordon analyst Christian Koefoed-Nielsen in a note, reiterating a 'Buy' rating and 12.5 pence target price. Woolworths said the fall in retail like-for-like sales reflected its strategy of focusing on profitable lines, with lower sales of electrical products, like flat screen TVs and computers, accounting for around half of the decline. "We had a strategy for Christmas that was about keeping costs under control ... We didn't chase sales and the net effect of that is the improvement in the underlying profitability of Woolworths Retail," Bish-Jones said on a conference call. The retailer reiterated that gross margins would rise by at least 100 basis points this year. "We have delivered a margin improvement for the past five years ... We know there are opportunities to develop the gross margin within the business," Bish-Jones added. Woolworths said total group sales increased by 11.2 percent in the period and that it expected annual profits to be within the range of current market expectations. The company is expected to report adjusted pretax profit of around 26.6 million pounds in the current year according to the average forecast of nine analysts given to Reuters Estimates, up from 21.8 million the previous year. Sales at 2entertain, Woolworths' joint venture with the BBC, increased 11.7 percent in the 49-week period -- versus growth of 14.5 percent in the first 38 weeks -- helped by strong DVD sales of the TV series "Planet Earth". The EUK entertainment wholesale business saw sales jump 46.7 percent in the period, driven by growth in the games mark
