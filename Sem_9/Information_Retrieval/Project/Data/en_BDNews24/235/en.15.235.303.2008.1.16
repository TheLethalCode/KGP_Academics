 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)Citigroup Inc, one of the leading global financial services companies, has reported a revenue of $ 81.7 billion for the full year 2007 along with a net after tax income of 3.62 billion , according to a report released Wednesday by the company. However, a net loss of $ 9.83 billion or $ 1.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 was also reported. In an accompanying statement, Citi CEO Vikram Pandit cited two factors for the poor performance of the company$ 18.1 billion in write downs and losses on sub-prime related direct exposures in fixed income markets, and a $ 4.1 billion surge in credit costs in the company's US consumer loan portfolio. "Looking beyond these two factors, revenues and volumes continued to grow strongly in a number of our franchises and we generated record results in international consumer, transaction services, wealth management, and advisory" Pandit said. He also highlighted the company's initiatives to ensure that it is well positioned to compete and win across franchises while effectively keeping a tight control over business risks. "We are taking several steps to strengthen our capital base, which includes an investment in Citi by several long-term sophisticated investors, dividend reset, and continued focus on divesting non-core assets and businesses," the Citi boss said. Pandit added that they were taking actions to enhance their risk management processes, improve expense productivity and a thorough review of their businesses. Citigroup established its presence in Bangladesh in 1987 by opening up a representative office and a full-service branch was opened in Dhaka in 1995. It now operates three branches in the country serving corporate and some individual customers. The company provides financial services including remittance services to the expatriate community across the globe, especially in Middle Eastern countries. The company's history dates back to the founding of Citibank in 1812.
