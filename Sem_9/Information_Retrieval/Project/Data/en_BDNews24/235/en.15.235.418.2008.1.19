<TEXT>
 Istanbul, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of protesters called on Saturday for all those behind the killing of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink to be brought to justice, a year after he was gunned down in a murder which shocked Turkey. An ultra-nationalist gunman shot Dink outside his office in Istanbul on Jan 19, 2007. The subsequent investigation has triggered claims police failed to act on warnings his life was in danger. Amid tight police security and mournful music, people laid red carnations at the spot in central Istanbul where he was killed. A huge photograph of Dink was hung from the office of his Armenian newspaper Agos for the commemoration ceremony. "We are at the pavement where they tried to clean his blood with soap," Dink's wife Rakel said in an emotionally-charged speech from the office balcony. "You are here for justice today. A scream for justice rises from your silence." Ankara has vowed to prosecute all those responsible for Dink's killing. Nineteen suspects are on trial. The next hearing is on Feb. 11. Amnesty International urged Turkey on Friday to widen the investigation into his death and the media called for the alleged complicity of security officials to be fully probed. "The killer state will be called to account," many in the crowd of several thousand chanted. "For Hrant, For Justice," said black-and-white placards, in Turkish, Armenian and other languages, held aloft by the crowd as they marked a minute's silence at the moment he was shot. "Despite the capture of those who killed Hrant, the powers behind them are still at large ... what is needed is a courageous political will. In short what is needed is Hrant's courage," journalist Oral Calislar told Reuters. "ROTTEN APPLES" Before his murder, Dink received death threats for his articles urging Turkey to accept responsibility for its part in mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks and Kurds in 1915. The murder was one in a series of attacks in recent years on Turkey's small Christian population, which includes Roman Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox. "I can see that justice has not been done and it makes me angry ... but I believe if we raise our voices justice will be achieved," said advertising executive Ulas Arikan, 50. According to the court indictment, one of the defendants in the Dink case acted as a police informer and told the police of plans to assassinate the editor in the months before the murder. Dink's writings brought him a suspended 6-month jail sentence under a law that makes it a crime to insult Turkish identity. Ankara has failed to amend or scrap the law, despite pressure from the European Union which calls it a major obstacle to free speech and to Turkey's goal of joining the bloc. The government has failed to learn the lessons of Dink's killing, according to Radikal columnist Murat Yetkin. "(Prime Minister Tayyip) Erdogan, who claims leadership of the Alliance of Civilisations, should sort out those who want to turn his country into a hell for non-Muslims," he said. "All the government's bodies associated with security, starting with the interior ministry, must root out the rotten apples within," he said.
