 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed has said the military has no intention to grab power and he does not "wish" to be president. In an interview broadcast on Channel i Wednesday night, the army chief said: "In this age, the world does not welcome a martial law." The TV station aired part of the interview for talk-show Tritio Matra in its prime news bulletin. "Everybody should perform their duties rested upon them," Moeen said. He has reassured that the country is going to hold the elections by the end of 2008. "If everybody makes an effort, it is even possible to hold the voting well ahead of December," he said. On the trial of war criminals, Moeen said it should have been settled in the past 36 years after independence but the previous governments did not do so. About the freedom of Dhaka University teachers, he said the court would decide. Asked if an adviser's statement that the teachers would be freed whatever the verdict might be went against the spirit of the rule of law, Moeen said: "The verdict will come from the court. Still, the government has the mandate to forgive." bdnews24.
