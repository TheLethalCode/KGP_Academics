<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed has said the army did not play any role in announcing a state of emergency in mid-January last year. Speaking of the background to the emergency rule in an interview aired on Channel i Saturday, Moeen said there was a compulsion within the government to go for it. The general compared the pre-1/11 situation with a derailed train and said: "The train that had derailed was back on track." "To drive the train now we need an efficient driver," he said. "And I believe the politicians are best placed to take that role, to take the train to its destination." The destination, he said when asked to define, was "a prosperous and developed Bangladesh". But he did not spare the politicians for their "failures" that led to the 1/11 changeover. "It's the failure of our leaders, failure of our political parties. If they had just put the country's interest above their own, things wouldn't have been so bad." Moeen referred to the killings on the streets of Dhaka on Oct 28, 2006. "In my lifetime, I've never seen an animal killed that way." "Had it (the anarchy) been allowed to go on, Bangladesh would have been a failed state. "The President (Iajuddin Ahmed) did the right thing (by declaring the state of emergency). He took the right decision at the right time." Moeen responded to criticism that both the Chief Adviser's Office and the cantonment were the power centres. "Never heard of itwe just do whatever we are told to do." Asked to comment on martial law rumours, Gen Moeen ruled out such a possibility. "I don't think such a situation exists that martial law is an option " On the present government's successes, Moeen said: "The identification of corruption as the foremost malaise and keeping it under control is the government's success." On the failure of the caretaker government, the army chief said: "I wouldn't call it failure. Prices increased due to floods, cyclone and higher prices on the international market." Emphasising food security, he said: "We have to increase production. We have to bring in hybrid seeds." Whether the government was monitoring corruption and nepotism by those within the government itself, the general said: "I'm sure the government is alert about it and won't allow that to happen." On the recent resignations of five advisers, Moeen said they had resigned for their "personal reasons". "The government wanted to bring dynamism to its activities." Asked why institutional changes had not occurred despite changes of personnel within different institutions he retorted: "How do you get reforms if you don't have a right person in the right place?" "First you have to place efficient people. Then they will bring in institutional reforms," Moeen said, citing the Election Commission as an example. bdnews24.com/m
