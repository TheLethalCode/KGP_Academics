 ATHENS, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A sketchbook believed to have been Vincent van Gogh's containing portraits similar to those in his most famous works has been found in Greece, its owner said on Wednesday. Taken by a Greek resistance fighter from a Nazi train, the sketchbook was discovered in storage boxes by his daughter, who is seeking to establish its authenticity with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. One art expert commissioned by Greek writer Doreta Peppa concluded the sketches were by the 19th century Dutch post-Impressionist artist. Foreign experts would soon examine the work to rule on its authenticity, she said. "Who would not be moved by such a discovery? This is van Gogh's soul," Peppa told Reuters.

"This sketchbook was my father's who was a Greek resistance fighter in World War Two," Peppa said holding up scanned pages of the booklet which she keeps in a bank deposit box. "According to his writings, he took it during an attack on a Nazi train retreating from Greece at the end of the German occupation," she said. "I am open for any serious scientist to examine the sketchbook," Peppa added. With a roughly estimated price tag of close to 4 million euros, the sketchbook, could fetch more at an auction, if genuine, but Peppa said she had no immediate plans to sell it.
