 IPSWICH, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man accused of killing five women during a spree at a rate unprecedented in Britain, carried out a deliberate campaign to murder prostitutes in the town of Ipswich, prosecutors said on Wednesday. Steve Wright, 49, denies killing Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls, whose naked bodies were found dumped at rural locations around the town within the space of just 10 days. Two of the victims were found with their bodies deliberately posed in a cruciform shape with their arms outstretched, the court heard, and Wright might have had an accomplice. The prosecution said the evidence indicated all the victims, who had been systematically selected, were asphyxiated while under the influence of hard drugs. "It is the prosecution case that either alone or in conjunction with another or others these deaths were the handiwork of the defendant," prosecutor Peter Wright said. "And for a period of six and a half weeks he had preyed upon the women working as prostitutes in and around Ipswich, killing five before his campaign was brought to an end by his arrest." The nature of the killings and the places where the bodies were dumped, which were isolated but easily accessible, showed that the killer had local knowledge, the prosecutor said. Wright lived in the red-light district, used prostitutes, which meant they would not suspect him, and had the opportunity and means to commit the murders, Ipswich Crown Court was told. All the victims were slightly built, slim, aged under 30. They were addicted to hard drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, and were working as prostitutes to fund their habit. "In each of their cases this decision was ultimately to prove fatal," Peter Wright said. Post-mortem tests clearly revealed the cause of death of just two of the women: Alderton, who had been asphyxiated, and Clenell, who died from compression of the neck by a forearm or crook of an elbow. But all had been found with hyper-inflated lungs which "was in keeping with some form of interference with the normal mechanism of breathing". All were thought to have been killed shortly after they vanished. People did not die of natural causes or by accident with such frequency only to turn up dumped naked, some of them posed, the jury were told. "It is the Crown's case that there was a common denominator in each of their untimely deaths and that was the defendant, Steve Gerald James Wright," the prosecutor said. The first victim was 19-year-old Tania Nicol, the court was told. The last possible sighting of her was a about 11 p.m. on Oct. 30 in the red light district of Ipswich, an area in the southwest of the town near its soccer stadium. However she was not the first to be found dead. The body of Gemma Adams, 25, who vanished late on Nov. 14, was discovered on Dec. 2 immersed in a brook near Hintlesham, to the southwest of Ipswich. Six days later police divers found Nicol's decomposing body in debris in the same brook, but a little further downstream. Post-mortems revealed the women had met their deaths soon after they vanished but particularly heavy rain at the time leading to flooding had meant that their bodies were only discovered when the water levels had fallen significantly. Anneli Alderton, 24, who disappeared on Dec. 3 was the next victim. She was found in woodland on Dec. 10 to the southeast of Ipswich, just off the main A14 road near Nacton, which the prosecution said was the killer's new dumping ground. On Dec. 12, police found the final two victims, Annette Nicholls, 29, and Paula Clenell, 24, within a few hundred yards of each other near the A14 between Nacton. and Levington. Nicholls had last been seen on Dec. 8 while Clenell had gone missing just two days earlier. Her body appeared to have been hurriedly dump
