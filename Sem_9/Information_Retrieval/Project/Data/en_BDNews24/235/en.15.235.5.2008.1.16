 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)Resolving the Dhaka University situation is a priority for the government, the new home affairs adviser MA Matin said Wednesday. "The January 18 deadline leaves almost no time to organise things," the adviser told reporters after taking charge at the home affairs ministry Wednesday. "I assure you that the government is trying to resolve the matter honourably, though it may not be possible to accomplish this so soon." "I'd ask all concerned to exercise patience and allow us a few more days," the adviser said, referring to the Jan 18 ultimatum in this connection. "The current DU stalemate will be taken care of soon," Matin repeated, adding that the legal processes involved were taking time but that the govt was not tarrying with the case verdict at all. Referring to the DU teachers' stand, the adviser said: "The teachers will not request a presidential pardon but the presidentthough he cannot punish anyonecan pardon any offender." "In this particular case, the government can take advantage of this opportunity," Matin said. The adviser reassured all that the government will take necessary steps to discuss the issues with all concerned quarters and resolve the problem. "At the moment, the most crucial matters for the government to handle and manage are controlling commodity price spirals, and quelling unrest prevailing in the RMG sector and the DU campus," Matin said. Reiterating that the government is trying its best to handle the issues, Matin said: "These are not very unusual problems though. The government will manage the cases with care, attaching due priority and find solutions." bdnews24.com
