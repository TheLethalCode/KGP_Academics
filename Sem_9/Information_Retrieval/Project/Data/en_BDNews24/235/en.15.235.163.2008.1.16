 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone (GP), the country's largest mobile phone operator, goes for a public offering by June, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said in a statement Wednesday. The announcement came following a meeting Wednesday between GP shareholders and the BTRC. Officials of GP's financial adviser Citibank NA were also present. BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam, observing a 'slow movement' of the GP's initial public offering process, stressed instant implementation while expressing eagerness to see a positive development straightaway in this regard. Per Eric Hyalland, vice president of GP's majority shareholder Telenor, said the process had already started with Citibank NA, which was assigned to complete all the formalities like arranging talks with the NBR, Bangladesh Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also said a roadmap on the process would be completed by next month. Ashraful Hassan, managing director of Grameen Telecom, the other shareholder of GP, expressed similar optimism on the long-awaited listing of Grameenphone on the local capital market. bdn
