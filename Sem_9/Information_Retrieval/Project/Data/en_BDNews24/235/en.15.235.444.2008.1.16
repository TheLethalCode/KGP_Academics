 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  AIMS of Bangladesh Wednesday submitted a draft prospectus to SEC to float a Tk 1.2 billion mutual fund, Grameen Two, the second scheme of Grameen Mutual Fund One. Yaweer Sayeed, CEO and managing director of AIMS of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com that AIMS as asset manger submitted the prospectus to the regulator upon authorisation from the sponsor Grameen Bank. With a paid-up capital of Tk1.2 billion and free float of Tk 350 million, 'Grameen Two' is poised to become by far the single largest listed mutual fund undertaking in Bangladesh. It would also be for the first time that a growth scheme was being launched on the local capital market. With a 15-year initial tenure, it is also a first that any mutual fund in Bangladesh is venturing to float multiple schemes with differentiated characteristics, according to the CEO of AIMS. "Provisions have been proposed in the draft prospectus for entitlement to 17 million units of Tk 10 each at par totalling Tk 170 million in Grameen Two for the existing unit holders of Grameen One," said Sayeed. The Grameen Mutual Fund One was established under the Trust Act 1882, and registered under the Registration Act 1908, on May 9, 2001. The Fund received SEC registration on August 27, 2001. 'Grameen One', the Tk 170 million first scheme of the Fund, published prospectus for public offer on June 26, 2005. The public offering for 5 million units of a total Tk 50 million was massively oversubscribed. The scheme was listed at a record pace with the bourses on Sep 4, 2005 within 13 days of conducting lottery and has since been trading at a premium price to its net asset value. At the close of its first full accounting year after listing on June 30, 2007, 'Grameen One' declared 29 percent cash dividend for all unit holders. Grameen Mutual Fund One was sponsored by Grameen Bank, founded by the microcredit pioneer and Nobel laureate professor Muhammad Yunus, to facilitate micro-savers to invest in the country's high-yielding capital market instruments. AIMS of Bangladesh, the only private asset managing company in the country, has been appointed the investment manager of the new mutual fund scheme. bdnews
