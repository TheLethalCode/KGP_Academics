 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) -- BUET students Saturday joined their Dhaka University counterparts in demanding the release of detained teachers and students. Students formed a human chain in front of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology cafeteria, demanding the release of those, detained since the widespread student unrest last August. Academic activities resumed Friday at the institution following the winter and semester vacation. Some 40 students gathered on the campus carrying placards inscribed with their demands. Many of those present at the demonstration said they were showing solidarity with Dhaka University, which was the only institution to suffer any arrests following the widespread unrest. A written statement from the group said: "If the teachers and students are not released in the near future, students from BUET will announce further programmes, along with other educational institutions across the country." The campaign on Dhaka University campus continued Saturday despite being closed for the Ashura holiday. Around 100 students carrying banners and placards silently marched around the campus in the morning, bringing the rally to a halt at the Aparajeyo Bangla intersection. bdnew
