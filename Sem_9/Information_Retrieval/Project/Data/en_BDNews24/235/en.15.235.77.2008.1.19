Delhi beat Uttar Pradesh by nine wickets with a day to spare in a low-scoring final to regain the coveted Ranji Trophy, the country's premier inter-state competition, after 16 years. India's one-day opener Gambhir hit 130 not out with 17 fours to help Delhi race to the target of 230 just after tea on day four. Opener Tanmay Srivastava scored a century (105) and Ravikant Shukla smashed 96 to help Uttar Pradesh, champions in 2005-06, post 342 after being asked to bat first. Uttar Pradesh medium-pacer Praveen Kumar took eight for 68 to restrict Delhi to 290 in the first innings after former test opener Akash Chopra (102) and Rajat Bhatia (139 not out) hit centuries.
