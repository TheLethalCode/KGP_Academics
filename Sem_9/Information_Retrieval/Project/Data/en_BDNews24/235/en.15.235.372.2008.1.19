 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Shaun Pollock belted South Africa to a four-wicket win over West Indies as he bowed out of Twenty20 internationals on Friday.

The South Africans bowled with discipline but were helped by the ill-considered strokes played by several batsmen. Darren Sammy's unbeaten 14 and Jerome Taylor's seven not out earned West Indies a valuable stand of 30 for the unbroken eighth wicket. South Africa's reply started in shaky fashion when fast bowler Taylor shattered Herschelle Gibbs's stumps without a run on the board with just the third ball of the innings. South Africa dwindled to 77-6 in the 14th over before Pollock and Morkel stood firm to turn the match in the home side's favour. Pollock announced his retirement after this month's third test victory against West Indies, ending a career of 108 tests in which he took 421 wickets -- the most by a South African.
