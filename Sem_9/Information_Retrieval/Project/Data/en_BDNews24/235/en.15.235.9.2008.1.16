 KISUMU, Kenya, Wed Jan 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan police fired in the air and used tear gas as hundreds of opposition protesters took to the streets on Wednesday in defiance of a ban on rallies against President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election. In the western opposition stronghold of Kisumu and the coastal town of Mombasa, crowds gathered from the morning, some burning tires, building roadblocks and singing slogans. Many Kenyans and expatriates stayed at home, shopkeepers nailed up windows, and traffic was thin in Nairobi, where some crowds were gathering from slums. Police have outlawed the rallies, which the Opposition Democratic Movement (ODM) has called for three days. More than 600 people have died and 250,000 been left homeless in the turmoil since Kibaki was sworn in after a December 27 vote that ODM leader Raila Odinga says was rigged. Firing tear gas and wielding batons, police dispersed some 150 youths in Mombasa, scattering them briefly before they attempted to regroup, witnesses said. In Kisumu, they fired in the air and also used tear gas to disperse about 1,000 demonstrators, some of whom threw stones. "We want Kibaki to resign and pave the way for our rightful President Raila Odinga," said demonstrator Joel Oduor, coughing and crying from tear-gas in a western suburb of Kisumu. Kenya's political crisis has caused a wave of violence, jeopardized its democratic credentials, angered donors, driven tourists away and hurt one of Africa's most promising economies. Fuelling doubt over Kibaki's win -- officially by 230,000 of 10 million votes cast -- a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday it was impossible to know who won the presidency. "We have done our own analysis. What it shows is that the result was extremely close and that whoever won probably won with no more than 100,000 votes at the most," Washington's ambassador to Kenya, Michael Ranneberger, told the Daily Nation. "It is really not possible to say with certainty who won because the process was not transparent." But he called for power-sharing rather than a new vote or re-count. GOVERNMENT CHALLENGES CRITICS Though Kibaki has solidified his position by naming a core cabinet and convening parliament, the opposition received a boost by winning the post of speaker in the assembly on Tuesday. "Yesterday marked a turning point," Odinga told reporters. "The terrible wrong done Kenyans on 27th of December will not be able to stand. This is an illegitimate presidency." Though ODM has the most legislators of any one party, it does not have enough to bring a no-confidence vote unless Kibaki-allied parties join it. Underscoring its narrow edge in parliament, ODM's choice for speaker won by just four votes against the government's choice. After a news conference, Odinga and other opposition leaders began heading in a convoy towards Nairobi's Uhuru Park, which was ringed by riot police to prevent protests. In Nairobi's Kibera slum, dozens of youths blocked a road with logs. Some nailed an effigy of Kibaki to a cross. In a statement, 13 nations, including the United States, threatened to withdraw direct aid to the government, and channel funds via other means, if its commitment to "good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights weakens". But the government challenged critics to provide proof. "You have publicly claimed that the presidential results were flawed. Can you provide tangible evidence?" said a state advert in local media. "Are you aware that your opinions have created tension? ... We are still waiting!" The opposition also stands accused of rigging and ballot-stuffing in its own heartlands on December 27. Police chiefs said they would not allow a repeat of violent scenes during previous opposition protests. Past rioting and looting have wrecked Kisumu, while Nairobi saw a day of running street-battles across the capital. In Mombasa, protesters accused authorities of using excessive force. "They are beating us up and using teargas against innocent people," said Khalid Hussein, of the local Muslims For Human Rights group. "Let them kill us but we will not sto
