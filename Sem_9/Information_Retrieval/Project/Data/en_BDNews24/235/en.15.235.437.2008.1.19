 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has asked financial institutions to back micro-entrepreneurs to foster their activities. "I request banking and non-banking institutes to come out of their traditional lending system to support the small entrepreneurs," Azizul said Saturday, speaking at a micro-entrepreneurship award ceremony at the Sheraton Hotel. The adviser said banks and other financial institutions do not give adequate backing to small and micro-entrepreneurs, who face a capital deficit in Bangladesh. "Micro-entrepreneurs need capital to overcome technical and marketing deficiencies," he said. "They have to be brought into the mainstream of the economy by financing their activities." Azizul cited the examples of Taiwan and Japan who have built their economy by developing small and medium enterprises. Citibank, NA in Bangladesh and local partner Shakti Foundation for Disadvantaged Women organised the award programme for the third consecutive year. Economist Wahiduddin Mahmud chaired the award's advisory council. The winners received prize money of Tk 300,000 each, sponsored by Citi Foundationthe philanthropic arm of Citigroup. The prize winners for the 2007 Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards in Bangladesh were: Barison Begum from Jessore as best microentrepreneur of the year, Rahima Begum from Shatkhira as best woman microentrepreneur of the year, Anwarul Islam from Jessore as best innovative microentrepreneur of the year and Ananyo Samaj Kallyan Sangostha from Pabna as best microfinance institution of the year. bd
