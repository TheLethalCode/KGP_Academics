<TITLE> Khaleda being mentally tortured: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday said party chairperson Khaleda Zia was being mentally tortured in the special jail. The Khaleda-nominated secretary general made the allegation at a press briefing at his home after jail authorities allegedly denied him, also a lawyer, and two others permission to see Khaleda at the same time. Delwar and the two other lawyers went to meet Khaleda in the jail on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises Wednesday afternoon. Jail authorities agreed to allow two lawyers in at one time but the lawyers demanded all three of them be allowed in together. On Jan 7, nine lawyers appealed to the court of additional metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani for permission to meet the former prime minister. The court asked jail authorities to let Delwar, Sanaullah Mia and Nawshad Zamir Sarkar meet her. Delwar alleged jail authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet Khaleda despite a court order. He said they would inform the court about the matter. "It's an unprecedented incident. The court order was disregarded. We'll inform the court," Delwar said. "In the jail, she was being tortured by leaving her friendless. It's not acceptable by any means." Delwar said he doubted whether Khaleda would get justice. "I'm worried whether my leader will get justice. We could not meet her even after taking permission from court to discuss her cases. Jail authorities' behaviour was influenced by the government," he said. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that Delwar was asked to apply to meet Khaleda, but he did not do it. "The other two were allowed to meet, but all three wanted to go inside together but it was not possible as per the jail code," he said. Siddiqui said the court did not order that three lawyers should be allowed to meet her on the same day. "Jail has some rules and regulations. We respect the court order and that was why we gave them the chance." Delwar also alleged that the government was plotting to hold a 'farcical' election excluding the BNP. bdnew
