 MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer continues his bid for a third consecutive Australian Open title when he takes on wily Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in the second round on Thursday. The world number one showed no ill-effects from the bout of food poisoning that hampered his preparations when he romped past Argentine Diego Hartfield in round one. Santoro, playing in his 62nd grand slam event, a record in the professional era, has beaten Federer twice in their 10 meetings. But the Swiss, who is just two grand slam titles behind Pete Sampras's record of 14, has won their last six matches, all without losing a set. "I've been pretty dominant against him the last few times we played," Federer said. "Of course, he's a tricky player to play against. Everybody knows that. He's got incredible experience. He's a great tactician. So you have to be very careful playing against him, but I really think I know how he plays." Former champion Marat Safin of Russia takes on 2006 runner-up Marcos Baghdatis in one of the most attractive second-round matches, while another former finalist, home hope Lleyton Hewitt, is also in action. Three of the tournament favourites on the women's side, Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, Serb Ana Ivanovic and American Venus Williams are also in action. Second seed Kuznetsova plays Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria, fourth seed Ivanovic takes on Italian Tathiana Garbin and former world number one Williams, seeded eighth, faces Camille Pin of France
