<TITLE> Australia fined for slow over rates </TITLE>

 PERTH, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's disappointment at losing the third test against India by 72 runs on Saturday was compounded when they were fined for slow over-rates. The International Cricket Council (ICC) ruled the home team were two overs short of the required rate, even after allowances were made. Each of the Australian players was fined 10 percent of his match fee while captain Ricky Ponting was fined 20 percent, in accordance with the ICC's code of conduct rules. Ponting told a news conference he made a mess of trying to rotate his bowlers and that contributed to his team's defeat. "I was forced to bowl part-timers at times when otherwise I may not have, just because of the over-rate," he said. "It would have been up to the referee to decide if I was suspended but as it states in the code of conduct if you are six or move overs behind you face the chance of a suspension." Australia went into the test with four pacemen but because of the stifling heat they took longer than normal to complete their overs. At one stage the hosts fell eight overs behind the required rate, risking the possibility of a suspension and forcing Ponting to bowl part-time spinners Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke in tandem. SCORE FREELY India's lower-order were able to score freely against the pair and extend their overall lead past 400 before the pacemen returned to polish off the last few second-innings wickets. Australia, set 413 to win, slipped to defeat and while Ponting said the over-rates were not a determining factor they did have an impact. "We probably misread the conditions leading into this game a bit," he said. "Anyone who had a look at the wicket leading up to the game might have thought it might have had a lot more pace and bounce in it than we did." Ponting said he would have preferred to stick with his pacemen when India's tail began to wag but had no choice because he needed to speed up the rates. "I had to be able to claw quite a few back to get back under six," he said. "We got a few more allowances as the day went on and with the spinners we dragged a lot of the overs back. "It was definitely a concern, with a test match on the line like it was, I wouldn't have been doing it as I was if it wasn't a legitimate concern.
