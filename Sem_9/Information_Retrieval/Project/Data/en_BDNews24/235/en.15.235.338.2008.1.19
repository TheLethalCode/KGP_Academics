 PERTH, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India beat Australia by 72 runs in the third test on Saturday, keeping alive their hopes of drawing the four-match series after handing the hosts their first loss since the 2005 Ashes series against England. India sealed their deserved victory in the final session of the fourth day when they bowled the Australians out for 340 after setting them an unlikely victory target of 413. Australia won the first two tests but the result means India can now draw the four-match series if they win the final contest starting in Adelaide next week. Australia had gone into the match as overwhelming favourites to set a new world record of 17 consecutive test wins but crashed to defeat with a day to spare, sparking wild celebrations from India's players and supporters. The last time the Australians lost any test was in the fourth Ashes match at Trent Bridge in Aug. 2005 and the last time they lost a test at home was against India at Adelaide in Dec. 2003. India also ended Australia's first 16-match winning streak when they beat them at Calcutta in 2001. Australia equalled that record with their controversial win in Sydney two weeks ago but failed to set a new mark. The Australians had started the fourth day on 65-2 and clinging to a hope that they could get the required runs on a WACA pitch that was still holding up well after four days baking in the sun. However, their chances suffered an early blow when captain Ricky Ponting fell for 45 in the morning session, caught by Rahul Dravid at first slip off Ishant Sharma, then the middle-order fell away after lunch. Mike Hussey went for 46 when he was trapped lbw by Rudra Pratap Singh then Andrew Symonds fell for 12 when New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden adjudged him lbw to spinner Anil Kumble. INSPIRED DECISION Kumble produced an inspired piece of captaincy when he threw the ball to India's opening batsman Virender Sehwag, who was recalled to the team for the first time in over a year, and the part-time spinner responded by claiming the next two wickets. He bowled the dangerous Adam Gilchrist around his legs for 15 then dismissed Brett Lee for duck, caught at silly mid off by Vangipurappu Laxman, to expose Australia's tailenders. Australia's last recognised batsmen Michael Clarke occupied the crease for almost three hours in making 81 but threw his wicket away when he danced down the pitch to Kumble and was stumped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. India's march to victory was stalled by an entertaining ninth wicket stand between Mitchell Johnson and Stuart Clark. The two paceman decided to chance their arm against the Indians and the tactic paid off as they piled on 73 runs in 55 minutes to get their team within 100 of winning. Their partnership ended when Clark was caught behind for 32 and India finished off the match when RP Singh bowled Shaun Tait for four, leaving Johnson stranded on 50 not out. India's victory has provided an extra twist to an already fascinating series that was in danger of being cancelled after the ugly fallout to the Sydney test. Kumble accused the Australians of breaching the spirit of cricket and the Indian board (BCCI) suspended the tour for two days in protest at the International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision to suspend Harbhajan Singh for racially abusing Symonds. The BCCI withdrew their threat to quit the tour after Harbhajan was cleared to continue playing until his appeal is heard after the Adelaide test and the ICC agreed to sack West Indian umpire. The two teams also called a truce to their feud when Ponting and Kumble met face to face to sort out their differences and vow to play the remaining matches in the right spiri
