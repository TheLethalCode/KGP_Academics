 ROME, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adrian Mutu earned two penalties, scoring the second himself, to give Fiorentina a 2-1 home win over Torino on Saturday that lifted them to fourth in Serie A. The Florence side went ahead on the stroke of halftime when Christian Vieri converted a spot-kick conceded for Marco Di Loreto's foul on Romania striker Mutu. Australian midfielder Vince Grella equalised with a splendid diagonal strike from the edge of the area in the 57th minute. But Mutu went down in the area again after a challenge by Salvatore Lanna and chipped home the winner in the 76th. Fiorentina have 34 points from 19 games, 12 behind leaders Inter Milan who host Parma on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, Genoa came from behind to beat unlucky Atalanta 2-1 at home and climb to seventh. Cristiano Doni slotted in a penalty in the 67th minute to give Atalanta the lead after Genoa's Abdoulay Konko cut down Sergio Floccari in the area. Striker Marco Borriello put the home side level in the 73rd and Luciano Figueroa headed the winner six minutes from time. Atalanta, who hit the woodwork three times and had a goal disallowed for a marginal offside, played in difficult circumstances, with club President Ivan Ruggeri critically ill in hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage on Wednesday
