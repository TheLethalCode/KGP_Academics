 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)Muslims in Bangladesh, especially the Shia community, observed the holy day of Ashura Sunday. The day of Ashura is on the 10th day of Muharram in the Islamic calendar and marks the climax of the remembrance of Muharram. The day is well-known for mourning the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Prophet Mohammad (SM) at the Battle of Karbala in the year 680 (CE). In Dhaka, Shia mourners observed a fast through the day, organised milad mahfil prayers at mosques, distributed food among the poor and brought out a tazia procession from Hossaini Dalaan, chanting "hai Hassan, hai Hossain" in their memory. President Iajuddin Ahmed in a message to the nation said Ashura would continue to inspire the oppressed to fight their oppressors. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his message of the day said the ultimate sacrifice of the Ashura martyrs would "always be among the brightest examples of establishing justice and truth in the face of wrongdoing for the Muslim Ummah". Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman and secretaries general of two BNP factions Khandaker Delwar Hossain and Hafizuddin Ahmed issued separate messages in observance of the holy day. Ashura was a public holiday. bdnews24.
