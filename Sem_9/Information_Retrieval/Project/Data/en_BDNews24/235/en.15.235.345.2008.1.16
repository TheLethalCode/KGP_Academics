<TITLE> No need for religious identity to be a voter: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner Mohammad Sohul Hossain said a person does not need any religious identity to be voter. His statement came at a news briefing as the Election Commission received a "show-cause" notice on the matter Tuesday. "The Election Commission is a constitutional body. There are directions in the constitution to make voters irrespective of caste and creed, male and female. So the electoral roll with photographs does not need any religious identity of a voter. But the matter of the national identity card is different," he said. "We have examined the previously used voter forms. There was no point of religious identity of a voter," he said. On the commission's stalled dialogue with the BNP, the commissioner said they were moving to seek a quick disposal of the legal course. An effort by the commission to sit with the BNP for electoral reforms talks has been thwarted as a legal course remains pending in the Supreme Court. Each of the two groups of the BNP claims to be the mainstream, forcing the matter into a lengthy legal process. Sohul explained "our lawyers have informed us that the matter was scrapped from the court's daily register because the opposite sides did not appear in the court". "Our lawyer Dr Kamal Hossain has been asked to file an appeal seeking quick disposal of the case," he said. On why the EC failed to file the appeal although it was supposed to do so a month ago, Sohul said the court set dates one after another to settle it quickly. "Moreover, it is no longer in our hands," he said. The commission was originally scheduled to sit in a dialogue with the BNP on Nov 22. bdnew
