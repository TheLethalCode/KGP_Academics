<TITLE> European shares drop as US worries hit banks, techs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday as growing fear of a US recession hit banks, while tech stocks recoiled after a grim outlook from Intel and a disappointing update from Dutch group ASML By 0914 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.05 percent at 1,380.69 points, having earlier hit its lowest level since September 2006 at 1,376.35, and is now showing a loss of nearly 9 percent for the year. The index lost 2.6 percent on Tuesday after US investment bank Citigroup posted a record $10 billion quarterly loss, cut its dividend and said it would receive a capital injection of $14.5 billion. A surprise fall in retail sales added to the view the US economy may be heading for recession. "It looks like markets are now realising that the credit crisis in the United States is far away from being over and there are further risks arising that are further down the chain," said Heino Ruland, a strategist at FrankfurtFinanz in Frankfurt. Declining issues on the FTSEurofirst 300 outnumbered advancers by about six to one. HSBC was once again the biggest negative weight on the index, falling 2.5 percent, while Commerzbank shed nearly 6 percent and Barclays fell 2.7 percent. Tech stocks came under pressure after earnings from Intel missed forecasts and the company issued a dour outlook on Tuesday, while in Europe, ASML -- which supplies most of the world's top chip makers -- fell by more than 10 percent after reporting a recovery in quarterly unit orders but an unexpected fall in order value. ASML was the biggest percentage loser in early trade and its shares were on course for their largest one-day fall since late December 2002. Volume equalled the average seen for a full day's trade over the past 30 days. Shares in Germany's Infineon fell 4.2 percent. MORE RESULTS COMING After Tuesday's twin bombshells of Citigroup's record loss and a shock fall in monthly U.S. retail sales, investor attention will be pinned on results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The data calendar includes consumer price inflation due at 1330 GMT and industrial production at 1415 GMT. "Like yesterday, the main focus in the market is likely to be on U.S. bank reports, with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reporting today, rather than the US data," wrote Bear Stearns analysts in a note. "What's more, the main data release today, the U.S. CPI, is not really a number that moves the currency market very much. Many will suggest that it is not going to be a number that moves the Fed either as the bank seems to be content to allow this rise in prices in its efforts to shore up growth," they said. Evidence of slowing economic growth outside the United States and beyond the housing market has raised fears that the credit crisis will have a broader impact than originally thought. The Baltic Exchange's major sea freight index for seaborne dry commodities trade on Tuesday showed its second-largest drop since records began in 1985. Many use this index as a gauge of global economic strength and its 34-percent decline in the past two months alone has added to concerns among investors that the weakness in the U.S. economy may snowball into a widerspread slowdown. In the commodities sector, shares in Rio Tinto shares fell nearly 4 percent after a trading update from the company, which is fighting a takover approach from rival BHP Billiton. Vedanta Resources lost 3 percent, while Antofagasta fell 3.2 percent and Xstrata fell 4.1 percent. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX dropped 1.0 percent and Paris' CAC 40 lost 1.1 percent. Defensive stocks were once again in positive territory, with utilities, drugmakers and food producers the top three positive influences on the broader market. Germany's E.ON was the top weighted gainer, rising 1.5 percent, while among the drugmakers Sanofi-Aventis, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline were all up between 0.5 and 2.2 percent. Food group Unilever was among the top ten positive weights, rising 1.9 perce
