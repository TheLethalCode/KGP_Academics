 MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pasted by Maria Sharapova in the second round of the Australian Open on Wednesday, comeback mum Lindsay Davenport said she knows she is better than that. "I'd like to think and I know I can play better than I did here this week," the former world number one said after her 6-1 6-3 thrashing. "Got to figure out a way to play better again at the bigger tournaments." Davenport had won 19 of her 20 matches since returning to the tour last September after a year off in which she gave birth to her first child. "Like I said, I'm disappointed. I put a lot of effort into playing well in this tournament. But, I mean, I still feel like I'm the luckiest girl in the world. "Unfortunately my son will be sleeping when I get home, so that's a little bit of a disappointment. "But, you know, I get to wake up with him tomorrow, and, you know, continue with this journey of trying to keep playing tennis and have my husband and my son in my life. "It's pretty great position to be in.
