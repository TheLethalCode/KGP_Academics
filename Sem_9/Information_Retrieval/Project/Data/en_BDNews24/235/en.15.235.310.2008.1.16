<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Just over a decade after her death in a Paris car crash, 11 jurors are hearing evidence at an inquest at the High Court so they can decide how Princess Diana and her lover Dodi al-Fayed met their deaths. Here are some key quotes and statements made or read out at the inquest so far. CORONER LORD JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER "It's his (Mohamed al-Fayed's) belief that a decision was taken to kill both Diana and Dodi. He places Prince Philip at the heart of the conspiracy. "You will have to listen carefully to the witnesses you hear to see whether there is any evidence to support this assertion." LETTER FROM PRINCE PHILIP TO DIANA "If invited, I will always do my utmost to help you and Charles to the best of my ability, but I am quite ready to concede that I have no talents as a marriage counsellor!!!" LETTER FROM DIANA TO PRINCE PHILIP "Dearest Pa, I was particularly touched by your most recent letter which proved to me, if I didn't already know it, that you really do care. "You are very modest about your marriage guidance skills and I disagree with you." SIMONE SIMMONS, A HEALER AND FRIEND OF DIANA "Diana read one out to me, because she was absolutely furious and she was actually imitating the voice of the Duke of Edinburgh at the time," she said about "nasty" and "derogatory" letters from Prince Philip. PAUL BURRELL, DIANA'S BUTLER "Prince Philip is not a nasty man. The princess was the mother of his grandchildren. Why would he want to harm her?" ROSA MONCKTON, A CLOSE FRIEND OF DIANA "She could not possibly have been pregnant. While we were on the boat, she had her period and that was just 10 days before she died. "It was clear to me that she was really missing (former lover) Hasnat Khan and that I think Dodi was a distraction from the hurt that she felt from the break-up of that relationship." PAUL BURRELL "The princess said he (Khan) was her soul mate. This was the man she loved more than any other. "She asked me if it was possible to arrange a private marriage between her and Hasnat Khan." RAINE, COUNTESS SPENCER, DIANA'S STEPMOTHER "Diana was madly in love (with Dodi). "She said she had never been so happy for years. That was the moment I really felt it was highly likely that she and Dodi would get engaged and then get married." PAUL BURRELL Said that in a telephone conversation he listened into, Diana's mother Shand Kydd, who died in 2004, "called the princess a whore and she said she was messing around with f-ing Muslim men and she was disgraceful". JEWELLER ALBERTO REPOSSI "I received a phone call from Dodi who told me that he needed this ring for end of August because, at the beginning of September, their engagement would be announced." LADY ANNABEL GOLDSMITH, FRIEND OF DIANA Diana told her: "Annabel, I need marriage like a rash on my face." SIMONE SIMMONS "She was terrified somebody was going to bump her off." Diana gave her a note which read "if something happens to me (security services) MI5/6 will have done it". KEN WHARFE, DIANA'S POLICE PROTECTION OFFICER "She did say to me on a number of occasions she felt that she and other members of the Royal Family were being monitored. Asked about the infamous "Squidgygate" recording of her intimate conversation with James Gilbey in 1989, he said: "I formed the impression that possibly in this case, it may well have been a loop from nearby Cheltenham, the GCHQ (government's listening spy station) there." "It's my belief that GCHQ at that particular time were perhaps monitoring members of the Royal Family because of a heightened IRA activity in the country." MAGGIE RAE, DIANA'S LAWYER "She believed what she said (about her life being in danger) but I thought it was unrealistic." FRENCH POLICEMAN SEBASTIEN DORZEE "She moved, her eyes were open, speaking to me in a foreign language. I think that she said 'My God' on seeing her boyfriend dying." PATHOLOGIST ROBERT CHAPMAN "No, I did not" - asked if he saw any sign of pregnancy when he carried out a post mortem. DANIEL EYRAUD, FRENCH ANAESTHETIST WHO TREATED DIANA "I personally believe we did everything possible to save the Princess with the appropriate means." FREDERIC MAILLIEZ, FRENCH DOCTOR AT SCENE OF CRASH "She was alive, she was moaning, but she was really weak. I do not remember any serious injury on her forehead. I just remember a few drops of blood." STEPHANE DARMON, A MOTORBIKE RIDER FOR PAPARAZZI "On a very personal note, I've got to say, my father was an alcoholic. When I saw Mr (Henri) Paul, he reminded me of my father, his eyes, the way he acted, that's what I thought. "Paul was very jolly and smiling. He was saying that Lady Di will be arriving in a quarter of an hour, in 10 minutes, trying to create a certain pressure, an atmosphere of anticipation. I had the impression he wanted to be centre stage." PAUL CARPENTER, DETECTIVE INSPECTOR WITH LONDON POLICE "You will see him (Henri Paul) raise his hand as if waving to the paparazzi across the road" -- describing CCTV footage shown to jury. "If you look at the paparazzi across the road you will see one of them raise his camera and what he's doing is focusing on the doorway and that is why Henri Paul waves." SEBASTIEN MASSERON, EYEWITNESS AT THE SCENE "I heard one photographer call over to a colleague who was on a scooter at the exit to the tunnel, and say: 'Come back, come back, she's alive.
