 KARACHI, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq said Australia were affected by the controversies from the second test when they lost to India in the third match of the series in Perth on Saturday. "I think the Australians were unnerved by the criticism they came under after the Sydney test. They were not at their best in this test," Inzamam told Reuters after India's 72-run win reduced their series deficit to 2-1. Inzamam, who retired last year after playing 120 tests and 378 one-dayers, said India deserved credit for bringing down captain Ricky Ponting's team at the WACA, one of the fastest pitches in the world. "I think what happened in Sydney, the poor umpiring decisions and the (alleged racial abuse) complaint against spinner Harbhajan Singh, united them and made them more determined to beat Australia," he said. "The final test in Adelaide (next week) will be a cliffhanger because the Indians have now smelt blood and know this Australian team is fallible." Pakistan's chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said Australia's first test defeat since they went down to England in 2005 was good for world cricket. "The domination of Australia was overwhelming and this result will make other teams, including Pakistan, believe the Australians are not invincible," he said. Pakistan are due to host the world's top-ranked team in three tests, five one-dayers and a Twenty20 match in March-April. Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said India's bowlers deserved a lot of credit. "They bowled superbly under pressure against a strong batting line-up," said Latif. "Australia missed the experience and confidence of Matthew Hayden, who scored hundreds in the first two tests." But former Pakistan captain and coach Intikhab Alam backed Ponting and his players to come back strongly. "They did so after their 2005 Ashes defeat and they can do it again," said Intikhab
