<TITLE> Rights issues to rise amid credit woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As companies struggle amid economic slowdown and increased borrowing costs, rescue rights issues are set to test investors' nerves. British mortgage lender Paragon set the ball rolling last week with plans to raise 287 million pounds ($564.2 million) through a deeply discounted cash call to repay debt it was unable to refinance. There is more of the same on the way. "We'll see an increase in the number of rights issues," said Jon Norton, director of structured finance at Burdale Financial, a debt restructuring boutique. "Investors are less tolerant of high leverage, if you don't have access to debt the only option is equity." Paragon's languishing shares show only too clearly the resultant pain for its owners. Having already lost over two thirds of their value since the middle of last year as the group's troubles grew, they slumped as much as 40 percent on Friday last week to their lowest in well over 10 years. Yet ailing companies may have only one way to survive. And plenty are expected to struggle to repay debt as borrowing costs rise and the credit crunch makes banks wary of lending cash they might prefer to hoard for the time being. After years of cheap credit that allowed companies to load up on debt, buy back shares and inflate their return on equity, the tide has turned and credit markets have dried up for anyone except the highest-rated borrowers. Big banks such as UBS AG have taken multi-billion pound losses linked to U.S. subprime mortgage loans and the industry as a whole has become risk averse, lifting the price they charge for lending. SEEKING A HANDOUT "Six months ago, if you had problems with (debt) covenants you just renegotiated them with your bankers -- now you can't renegotiate that easily so companies are looking into the equity market," said a banker who declined to be named. Equity investors, then, had better get used to companies seeking a handout to tide them over tough times. Unlike creditors, who are near the head of the queue for a company's assets after bankruptcy, holders of equity must either stump up or risk losing everything. Rights issuance is directly correlated to the number of companies defaulting on debt repayments. In Britain, the number of rights issues soared between 1999 and 2002 to almost fifty a year, according to data from the London Stock Exchange (LSE). During the same period, following the Internet bubble and the Russian debt default, corporate defaults increased to more than 10 percent, Moody's data shows. Will the same trends be repeated? Certainly it would be a significant reversal of recent conditions. Since 2003, defaults have fallen to historic lows of less than 1 percent, and at the same time, the number of rights issues in Britain has fallen every year since 1999, and more dramatically since 2002. There were only seven rights issues in 2007, LSE data shows. Britain's Redstone Telecom Plc, a once budding telecoms major fallen on hard times, conducted a dramatic rights issues in 2001 at 1 penny per share, after the stock had traded as high as 949 pence in 2000. Deeply discounted issues can leave the issuer's fortunes in hostile hands such as hedge funds or others looking for cheaply-rated takeover situations. "Heavily-discounted rights issues are a short-term solution," said Louise Verrill, a partner at Brown Rudnick, a law firm specialised in restructurings, adding that they may attract investors "whose main agenda may be different from the company's". But they are an opportunity for the brave. Redstone's one-penny investors have since had opportunities to cash in. The stock traded above a pound last year and at around 65 pence on Wednesd
