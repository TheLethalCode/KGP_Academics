<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government Wednesday highlighted the need for accurate and reliable information on the commodity market so that consumers can make more informed choices. Newly appointed commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman chaired a meeting at the commerce ministry where it was decided to make data on the global and domestic commodity market more available. "Accurate and timely information can improve market efficiency through more informed decision-making," Rahman told reporters after the meeting. Noted economist Wahiduddin Mahmud said: "Greater information can allow better prediction of market trends in addition to helping the government make their decisions." Fakhruddin Ahmed's caretaker administration has faced increasing criticism over its handling of inflation and ongoing price hikes since it assumed power in January last year. The government's move to involve the army and BDR in the market monitoring system has also so far failed to have a significant impact on the situation. The commerce adviser said the meeting focused on three issues including the availability of accurate commodity market data. Also discussed was best practice for defending the lowest income groups against price hikes, and the regular evaluation of governmental measures used to monitor the market. "We paid particular attention to providing accurate data on the market, so that price issues and future trends can be better predicted," Rahman said. "Availability of information will strengthen market behaviour," Rahman said. "Some governmental agencies, including the Bangladesh Bank, NBR, Trading Corporation of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics currently provide data on the market." "However, these agencies must be coordinated to ensure a better system," Rahman said. bd
