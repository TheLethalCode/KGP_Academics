<TITLE> Taiwan's economic woes hit the middle class </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The downfall of Alexander, Taiwan's largest health club chain, speaks volumes about the island's quietly ailing economy. Candy Tang, who started the chain 25 years ago, told reporters last month that annual revenues had tumbled to T$80 million ($7.7 million) from T$250 million in just two years. Membership plunged as the economy foundered, she said. The club's woes reflect a broader malaise among Taiwan's middle class, who have cut back on extras like gym memberships, travel and movies as wages stagnate and jobs move to China. The populace drove home its discontent in Jan. 12 elections, when it gave the ruling party just a quarter of the seats in the new legislature, while the main opposition won most of the rest. "Consumption of mid-level items is definitely decreasing dramatically, which is a direct result of the weakening purchasing power of Taiwan's middle class," said Jeff Lin, a professor in Taiwan University's economics department. "So even though Taiwan's overall economic growth looks good, the average person has no way to enjoy those benefits." Hsu Wen-shen, a masseur with a shop in downtown Taipei, said his standard of living has deteriorated in the last year, as people forgo treats like massages amid rising prices and an uncertain job outlook. "I used to go on vacation once a year, but now I don't go at all," he said, adding that business in his own shop was down 10-20 percent in the second half of last year. "Now I also don't dare to drive my car because of high gas prices. I used to drive it a lot, but now I ride my motorcycle instead." Indeed, sales of new cars fell to just 326,770 last year, the lowest total since 1987. More business are shutting their doors as consumption flags. Closures reached 40,800 in the first 11 months of 2007, more than the total for any other entire year since records have been kept, government data shows. YOUTHFUL WOES The ailing of Taiwan's middle class is largely a hidden phenomenon to outsiders, masked by figures showing that the overall economy has grown 4-6 percent annually in recent years with unemployment rates around 4 percent, enviable rates compared with regions like Europe. But, as is also the case in the United States, the benefits of growth are going disproportionately to the wealthy, leaving average folk with wages that have stagnated. Adding to the uncertainty is the regular flow of jobs to China -- now home to 1 million of Taiwan's 23 million people -- following investment there by Taiwan firms that analysts estimate has totalled as much as $100 billion since 1991. "The level of inequality in Taiwan... has been on a rising trend," economists at Citigroup said in a recent report. Among those hardest hit are Taiwan's youth, the future of its labour force. A recent JPMorgan report showed that average household wages in Taiwan are in danger of starting to shrink and average graduate starting salaries already appear to be contracting. Thomson Wu, manager of Globair Travel Services Ltd, said a youth club that is one of his major clients had halved the number of trips it offers in the last two years. "This customer has been ours for the last 10 years," he said. "For eight of those they did 12 tours each year. But these last two years they only did six tours. This year they'll have six tour groups again at the most." The movie business is also suffering. Joe Chang, president of Ambassador Theatres, one of Taiwan's top chains, said ticket sales for films that are not blockbusters were down 20-25 percent last year. "People will say, 'Why should I pay so much money for mediocre movies if I can get them on DVD?'" he said. Many blame the problems on politics, as Taiwan's two major parties focus more on squabbling than addressing economic issues -- something many hope will change with the opposition's landslide legislative win and presidential polls set for March. "Hopefully it will change with the next president," said Hsu, the masseur. "Now the politicians aren't paying much attention to people's livelihood
