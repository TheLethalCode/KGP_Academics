 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears of a US recession following weak US data and corporate news kept a stranglehold on global markets on Wednesday, hammering stocks and the dollar, but giving safe-haven government bonds a fillip. Losses looked set to deepen on Wall Street after JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a worse-than-expected 24 percent fall in quarterly profit and a day after disappointing results and outlook from technology bellwether Intel Corp. . The closely watched US consumer price inflation data, which was mostly in line with expectations, did little to shake expectations for more US rate cuts. December core CPI rose 0.2 percent as expected, while the headline figure climbed 0.3 percent, slightly ahead of a forecast 0.2 percent rise. "This report should not change expectations of a 50 basis points rate cut," said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Indeed, with expectations of hefty rate cuts from the Federal Reserve running high, the dollar sank to a record low of about 1.0839 Swiss franc and a 2-1/2 year trough of 105.93 yen . The euro was little changed near $1.48 , pausing after a recent string of gains. MSCI's key world equity index shed 1.4 percent to levels last seen in mid-August, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell more than 1 percent to trade near its lowest since September 2006. Adding to worries was news that Britain's housing market may already be lurching from boom to bust and a survey suggesting France was no exception to a region-wide growth slowdown at the end of 2007.

"Stock markets seem to be almost pricing in a recession scenario for the U.S., and it's also on most economists' radars even if they haven't taken it into their forecasts yet." Earlier, Japan's Nikkei ended at a fresh two-year low, closing down 3.4 percent at 13,504.51, while MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets slid nearly 4 percent. Commodity prices also took a hit with U.S. crude sliding below $91 a barrel to four-week lows, while copper prices plumbed 1-week lows on fears the bleak global outlook will crimp demand. BONDS FIRM Weakness in equities helped boost demand for safe-haven government bonds, driving yields lower. Among euro zone bonds, the 10-year Bund yield fell below 4 percent for the first time since March 2007. The benchmark 10-year yield for US Treasuries fell to 3.67 percent, but was off a low of about 3.62 percent -- the lowest since mid-2003 -- in the wake of the CPI data. "We think Treasuries might still rally if ever we see a 50 basis point intermeeting rate cut," said Societe Generale fixed income strategists in a note. Interest rate futures expect an almost 50-50 chance of a 75 basis points cut this month in U.S. benchmark interest rates, from 4.25 percent. Gold , usually seen as a safe-haven play, fell victim to profit-taking after failing to break the record high of $914 an ounce set on Monday. Spot gold was trading around $888 an ounce, although further downside was seen limited by a struggling dollar and buying from jewelle
