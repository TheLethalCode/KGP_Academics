But Karlovic and Isner's towering presence did little to help their on-court fortunes as they were felled 7-6 6-3 by the 1.83 metre tall Calleri and 1.77 metre tall Brzezicki. "It was a lot of fun," Karlovic said. "We will win together next time." Isner said he'd had the idea to team up with Karlovic last year but his ranking was too low to get into the main draw of tournaments. "I thought of it again some time around December and got in touch with (Karlovic)," he added.
