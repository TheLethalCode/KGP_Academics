<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Valencia are building a wall around their training ground at Paterna to keep out prying eyes after Ronald Koeman complained he needed more privacy when coaching the team, Spanish media reported on Saturday. "It seems every day I do something bad," the Dutchman was quoted as saying. "But if I get out of the car or come out of the changing room I've got eight cameras in my face. "The press are almost coming into the changing room." Valencia have been engulfed in controversy since Koeman sidelined club stalwarts David Albelda, Santiago Canizares and Miguel Angel Angulo soon after taking charge in November. Koeman's side are seventh in the Primera Liga and are without a victory in seven league matches. Spain coach Luis Aragones said Albelda would struggle to make his Euro 2008 squad unless he started playing again soon. "There isn't much time left in the case of Albelda," Aragones told Spanish media. "If he doesn't start playing regularly it will be difficult for him to make the European Championship." Koeman has said the midfielder, who has won 50 caps for Spain, will not play for the club again this season
