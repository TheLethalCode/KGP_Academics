 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka University vice chancellor SMA Faiz said Saturday a legal course would settle controversial cases against teachers and students in one week. Faiz said he had been assured of full cooperation from the government to end the stalemate but a legal course was the right way to a solution. The VC said: "I hope it will be acceptable to all." He made the comment to reporters on his return to the Dhaka University campus after a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office in the afternoon. Advisers to the ministries of law, education, foreign affairs and home; the army chief, the inspector general of police, and directors general of NSI and DGFI also attended the meeting, Faiz said. "All the aspects of the situation came up at the meeting," Faiz said. On if the charges will be withdrawn, Faiz said: "The education adviser will elaborate everything on Jan 21 (Monday)." "The government has promised the fullest cooperation," he said. Monday is the day when a Dhaka court is expected to deliver its verdict in one of the cases against four teachers and a student. He said the government has taken into account that the academic activities suffered much because of the chaos, and "now it wants to quickly fix everything to help recover the losses". He said the government was well aware of the developments on the campus. Both teachers and students of the university separately launched fresh but peaceful protest plans with calls for freedom of the teachers. The accused have pleaded innocent in court and demanded fair justice. bdnews24.com
