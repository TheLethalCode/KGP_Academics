<TITLE> US tightens squeeze on Iran as friends join in </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tough talk on Iran has captured the headlines on President George W Bush's Middle East tour, but it is the quiet tightening of US-led economic pressure that poses the greater challenge for Tehran. Even as Bush steps up the rhetoric, calling Iran a threat to international security and the world's top state sponsor of terrorism, there are tangible signs that the squeeze on Iran's oil-based economy is intensifying. There are also signs Iran is rising to the challenge and some analysts remain sceptical that sanctions can be effective. The United States has slapped its own sanctions on Iran and will press for a third set of punitive UN measures when world powers meet in Berlin next week to discuss Tehran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment. But beyond the blacklisting of individuals, groups and businesses it suspects of involvement in terrorism or illicit nuclear work, Washington is also leaning on allies around the world to impose a broader economic isolation on Tehran. In the latest sign that its pressure is yielding results, Bahrain's biggest lender, Ahli United Bank, has suspended business with the Islamic Republic, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Late last year, Indian oil refiner Reliance halted sales of gasoline and diesel to Tehran after French banks BNP Paribas and Calyon stopped offering letters of credit, a standard payment guarantee in international trade. "It is today impossible more or less in Europe, with a couple of exceptions, to get a letter of credit" for trade with Iran, said a senior German banking and finance consultant. Financial sources in the Gulf told Reuters this week that banks in the United Arab Emirates have also stopped issuing letters of credit to Iranian companies. While that has made business more difficult for Tehran, it has found ways to circumvent the restrictions such as opening credit lines settled in euros to finance fuel imports as opposed to dollars. INTELLIGENCE REPORT Iran experts said the stranglehold on Tehran was still tightening, despite a U.S. intelligence report last month that judged it had halted its alleged nuclear weapons programme under Western pressure in 2003 -- a conclusion that effectively lifted the threat of U.S. military action. They said the logic for intensifying the squeeze was Iran's continued defiance of U.N. demands to halt uranium enrichment, and the assessment in the intelligence report that a firm, united Western line can influence Tehran's behaviour. "In some ways it justifies a tougher sanctions policy and tougher political pressure," said Ali Ansari of the University of St Andrews in Scotland. "The intelligence assessment was principally to stop the momentum towards war in the United States. The rest of it is still in place. All these sanctions will still be tightening." Shannon Kile of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said Iran's greatest concern is "debilitating sanctions that would affect the ordinary guy on the street". Both analysts said the withdrawal of credit lines by French banks was significant, and linked it to France's more hawkish line on Iran since President Nicolas Sarkozy took office last year. "Sarkozy has really become more Bush than Bush in terms of pushing for tightened sanctions against Iran," Kile said. A senior US Treasury official told Reuters last week there had been a "very dramatic change" in the willingness of foreign banks to deal with Iranian counterparts. Iranian banks "are now feeling an avalanche of concern and with every bank that cuts them off, it leaves the few remaining banks wondering: 'Do we really want to be among the few who are doing this business?'" he said. Yet there is scepticism in some quarters -- including, ironically, in the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of the US Congress -- as to the effectiveness of sanctions. A new GAO report said the impact of sanctions was "difficult to determine", and noted that Iran had signed about $20 billion of energy contracts with foreign firms since 2003. One Middle Eastern banker said he had no doubt Iran would find ways around the restrictions. "I believe there are some other ways, like for example using intermediaries, establishing front companies," the banker said. "Sanctions are not something new to Ira
