<TITLE> Arab League chief in Syria over Lebanon crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Damascus, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Arab League has made progress toward solving the political crisis in Lebanon, although it has yet to achieve a breakthrough, the league's Secretary General Amr Moussa said on Saturday. "We're advancing step by step, but I cannot say at this stage whether I am optimistic or pessimistic, and prefer to keep details away from the media," Moussa said after meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. "My talks in Damascus were totally positive ... It is important that I go to Riyadh," he said. Moussa is seeking agreement on implementing an Arab plan to set up a power-sharing government which would balance the competing demands of the guerrilla group and political party Hezbollah and those of an anti-Syrian coalition led by Saad al-Hariri. Hizbollah is backed by Iran and Syria, while Hariri has the support of the United States and its ally, Saudi Arabia. The plan is based on electing Lebanese army commander General Michel Suleiman as a compromise president. Moussa said he would then favour a power-sharing coalition which would give Hariri's group more than half the ministers while not giving the Hezbollah-led group enough ministers to have veto power. The balance would be held by ministers named by Suleiman. Moussa came from Beirut, where he arranged a meeting between majority and opposition politicians. He is due back in the Lebanese capital later on Saturday after attending a ceremony marking Damascus as the 2008 Arab capital of culture.
