 MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An aching Jelena Jankovic used an injury time out to refocus her energy and reach the Australian Open third round with a 6-2 7-5 victory over Romania's Edina Gallovits on Wednesday. Jankovic, who needed over three hours to dispatch Austria's Tamira Paszek in the first round, flexed her right shoulder contiuously early in the second set against Gallovits before taking an injury time out to receive courtside treatment. "I feel very tired for some reason. I feel very, very exhausted," the third seed told reporters. "I hurt (and have a) little bit of shoulder stiffness. "I don't know, for some reason this year I had so many injuries and so many parts of my body are hurting. But I'm trying to get back in shape, so hopefully it will go away." The 22-year-old Serb, who suffered a hamstring strain at the Hopman Cup, said she had fully recovered from that injury. "Other parts of my body are suffering. Maybe everything else is compensating because of that muscle...I've been having sore muscles all over my body." Jankovic raced through the first set but had problems with the swirling wind that buffeted the Margaret Court Arena. "The conditions were quite tough. It was very windy and very difficult to place the balls where you want them," she added. "She's a very crafty player. She gives a lot of jerk on the ball and doesn't give you much pace." The world number four meets Virginie Razzano in the third round. "It will be a tough match. I have to play better than in my first two matches," said Jankovic
