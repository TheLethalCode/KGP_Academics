 MADRID, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's conservative opposition has refused to allow Madrid's popular mayor run as a candidate for a March parliamentary election, snubbing a centrist figure who is seen as a magnet for swing votes in a close-run race. In a brief communique on Tuesday night, the Popular Party said it had turned down the request by Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, a telegenic moderate, to run as a candidate on March 9 in what some analysts called a victory for the PP's conservative wing. Gallardon's public rejection means the PP has ditched its only prominent leader with a track record of appealing to moderate swing voters at a time when it trails the ruling Socialists by 2-4 percentage points in opinion polls. With Spain's economy showing signs of slowing down after a decade of strong growth fuelled by soaring house prices, the economy has become an increasingly important electoral issue. "In politics sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, and this time I have been defeated," said Gallardon on Wednesday. Party bosses told him to stay in his job at Madrid city hall but newspapers reported he would leave politics after the vote. As a social liberal in a party dominated by Catholic conservatives, Gallardon consolidated Madrid as a PP stronghold. But he has bitter rivals, who both dislike his permissive attitudes that allowed him to preside over a gay marriage and saw him as a threat in any future leadership contest. Instead of Gallardon, the PP chose Manuel Pizarro, a tough business leader who made a fortune while running electricity company Endesa, as a high-profile candidate for Madrid. "The PP's strategy now is to maintain its core vote .... and on top of that try to win over swing voters worried about the economy," said Juan Carlos Rodriguez, of consultancy Analistas Socio-Politicos, adding that much depended on how the party managed the aftermath of the Gallardon episode. "Discord within a party is always good for your adversaries. The question is how long that image of discord lasts," said Rodriguez, who doubted that a worsening economy would be enough to swing the elections. The issues which have traditionally mobilised the core voters of the PP, which was founded by former supporters of dictator Francisco Franco, are the defence of Spanish national unity and the traditional family. The Socialists were quick to celebrate Gallardon's rejection. They accused the PP of veering to the far right under leader Mariano Rajoy, who has spent much of his time since the last elections in 2004 attacking the government over its failed attempt to negotiate with Basque separatists. "In the morning he appoints Pizarro, his businessman. In the afternoon, he kicks out Gallardon, the moderate," said Socialist Party secretary Jose Blanco, adding that PP heavyweights were positioning themselves for a post-defeat leadership battle. An anonymous comment on the Web site of pro-PP newspaper El Mundo made a similar point about Rajoy's treatment of Madrid's mayor. "Thank you Mariano, for serving us the elections on a plate -- signed, A Socialis
