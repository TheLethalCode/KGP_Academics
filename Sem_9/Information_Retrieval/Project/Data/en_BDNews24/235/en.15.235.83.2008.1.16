 TOKYO, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan, heavily dependent on food imports, will make its own checks on the safety of cloned animals as food, deemed safe by US regulators, but it is in no hurry to start, a government official said on Wednesday. Authorities in South Korea and Taiwan also said they would study the issue, although they believe it will be years before the United States is ready to export food from cloned animals. The US government ruled on Tuesday that food from cloned cattle, hogs and goats and their offspring is as safe as other food, opening the door to bringing meat and milk from cloned animals into the food supply. The final risk assessment by the US Food and Drug Administration confirmed preliminary findings from 2006. A Japanese Agriculture Ministry official, who declined to be named, said the ministry would first have to gather information. "We will have to review the issue, starting by collecting all the available information from the United States," he said. The ministry will act with other relevant Japanese authorities, he said, although nothing specific was planned so far. "At this point, I don't think the situation calls for any quick action," he said. U.S. industry sources say it could take four or five years before consumers are able to buy clone-derived food on a wide scale as animals are cloned, mature and give birth to progeny used for food. The more pressing farm issue for Tokyo is deadlocked talks with Washington on U.S. beef exports. Japan currently only allows meat from cattle aged 20 months or younger, a condition it set when it agreed to resume buying U.S. beef, initially banned in 2003 after the United States discovered its first case of mad cow disease. The United States wants all age restrictions removed. Japan, the largest overseas market for U.S. beef in value terms in 2003, potentially remains a key market for the meat, which in the future could include beef from cloned cattle. Meat industry officials said Japanese consumers were almost certain to be slow in accepting cloned meat, given their conservative palates and their strict views on food safety. "My initial reaction is that it would not be easy, I don't think," said a foreign beef industry official who declined to be identified. "I'm sure that if it was to happen, people would want it to be marked as such," he said. ASIA LOW-KEY Asia, the destination of some 55 percent of all U.S. beef exports in 2003, remains a lucrative market for the meat, although some countries, including South Korea, have kept a trade ban it imposed after the U.S. case of mad cow disease. Most regulators and industry officials said it was too soon to discuss the implications of the latest development. "It's too early to determine what this might mean," said Steve Martyn, national processing director for the Australian Meat Industry Council. "We need to look at the science behind this and then at the commercial applications," he said. Authorities in South Korea, the third-biggest foreign market for U.S. beef before the ban, said they would make a study. "We may start to discuss the issue, including whether to allow imports of cloned meat-producing animals," said Wu Man-su, assistant director of South Korea's National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service. "But the science involved in cloning animals is relatively new, so we don't expect floods of the products any time soon." Food safety remains a priority in other parts of Asia. "Our main concern is safety," said Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director of the health ministry's food safety department in Taiwan, which allows US beef imports under certain conditions including that it only come from cattle younger than 30 months. "We need to first understand the process by which it is produced and we will first observe how this is received internationally," he sa
