<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Youths erected roadblocks, shopkeepers nailed up windows and Kenyan riot police guarded streets before nationwide opposition protests planned for Wednesday against President Mwai Kibaki's re-election. Police have banned the rallies, scheduled for midday (0900 GMT), and many Kenyans were staying at home for fear of trouble. More than 600 people have died, and 250,000 been left homeless, in unrest since the Dec. 27 vote that opposition leader Raila Odinga says was rigged. Previous opposition protests have turned Nairobi and other major towns across the east African nation into battlegrounds. "People are anticipating chaos and many of them will go to the rallies," said one resident of Nairobi's Mathare slum, where police battled protesters last week. But there were no crowds gathering early, according to Reuters reporters across the nation. Kenya's political crisis has jeopardised its democratic credentials, angered donors, driven tourists away and hurt one of Africa's most promising economies. Kibaki's win was officially by just 230,000 of about 10 million votes cast, and a senior U.S. official was quoted as saying on Wednesday it was impossible to say who won the presidency. "We have done our own analyhsis. What it shows is that the result was extremely close and that whoever won probably won with no more than 100,000 votes at the most," Washington's ambassador to Kenya, Michael Ranneberger, told the Daily Nation. "It is really not possible to say with certainty who won because the process was not transparent." He called for power-sharing rather than a fresh vote or re-count. Since declaring Kibaki the winner on Dec. 30, the head of Kenya's electoral board, Samuel Kivuiti, has also told media he does not know who won the election. OPPOSITION PARLIAMENT BOOST Though Kibaki has been quick to entrench himself by naming a core cabinet and convening parliament, the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) received a boost when their candidate won the post of speaker in the assembly late on Tuesday. Opposition members cheered and hugged each other when Kenneth Marende was named the winner after a close vote in the first sitting of the house since Kibaki's win. In the western opposition stronghold of Kisumu, Odinga supporters in crowded bars toasted the parliamentary victory while they watched televised proceedings that spilled into the early hours of Wednesday. "We are very happy," said David Otieno, who rides a bicycle taxi. "We are drinking and eating meat and getting ready to pour into town for a massive peace rally." Reflecting the opposition's bitterness over last month's presidential vote, one of their legislators swore allegiance to "President Odinga" before being ordered to retake the oath. Western powers and Kenya's east African neighbours have complained of irregularities in the presidential vote count. In a statement on Tuesday, 13 foreign nations, plus the United Nations, threatened to withdraw direct aid to the government if its commitment to "good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights weakens". In a blow to prospects for ending the political deadlock, former UN chief Kofi Annan, who was expected to start mediation on Wednesday, delayed his mission due to illness. "Now we do not know what will happen because we were expecting Kofi Annan to come. The opposition, especially, they wanted to show him what people are undergoing. Who are they going to show now?" said taxi-driver Peter Chege, 43. The opposition pledged to continue its anti-Kibaki struggle through international mediation, parliament, where it holds a narrow majority, and peaceful mass action. Fearing more clashes, Kenyans packed supermarkets for supplies of milk and bread before rushing home. In a Nairobi slum, opposition supporters taunted police patrolling the area. In Kisumu, a taxi driver said his car window was smashed by youths manning a makeshift roadblo
