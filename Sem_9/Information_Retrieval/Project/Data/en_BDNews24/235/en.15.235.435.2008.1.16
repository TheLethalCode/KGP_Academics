 TOULOUSE, France, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus posted 1,341 net aircraft orders in 2007, trailing the 1,413 planes sold by Boeing in a record year at both companies, Airbus said on Wednesday. Airbus said it took in 1,458 gross orders before cancellations, compared with a gross order tally of 1,423 aircraft at Boeing, which a source familiar with the matter told Reuters was set to announce more delays to its 787 Dreamliner. The Airbus orders were valued at $157.1 billion at catalogue prices and brought the European company's backlog to 3,421 planes or six years of production. "These are enormous numbers; it was a staggering year. Now it becomes a question of how we manage the backlog," Airbus chief Tom Enders told journalists in Toulouse, France, where Airbus is based. EADS shares were 2.3 percent lower at 18.15 euros by 0943 GMT in Paris, paring earlier losses. The planemaker, a subsidiary of European aerospace group EADS, kept its lead as the world's largest producer of large commercial aircraft in 2007, but lost to Boeing in the race for new orders for the second year running. In 2006, Airbus sold 790 aircraft compared with 1,044 net orders for Boeing. Airbus said its 2007 deliveries reached a record of 453 aircraft, topping its published forecast of 440 to 450 planes. For 2008, Enders predicted deliveries above 470 aircraft and an order intake down from last year's peak, but above the level of deliveries. The delivery race is set to be a close contest in 2008 as Boeing delays first deliveries of the Dreamliner and Airbus pulls out all the stops to prevent a repeat of production problems which have delayed its A380 superjumbo. The Airbus 2007 order tally does not include 160 aircraft provisionally sold to China during a state visit by French President Nicolas Sarkozy last October, a deal which has yet to be finalised. Airbus had 117 order cancellations in 2007 as cargo carriers walked away from a freight version of the A380 superjumbo and airlines began switching to a redesigned vesion of its next model, the A350, trading up from an earlier proposed model. Airbus received 290 orders in 2007 for the redesigned A350 XWB, a challenger to Boeing's 787. That brought total orders for the mid-sized twinjet to 292 aircraft. Airbus said it had exceeded its targets in the first year of a four-year restructuring and cost-saving programme, called Power8, delivering cost savings of more than 300 million euros ($445 millio
