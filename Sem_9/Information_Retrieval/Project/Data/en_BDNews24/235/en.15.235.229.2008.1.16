<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury Wednesday said the demand for freedom of party chief Sheikh Hasina from jail would top the agenda during any dialogue with the government. "We want Sheikh Hasina to be freed before the polls. We want to take part in the election together with her," Motia told reporters at her Ramna home in Dhaka. Motia emphasised that the dialogue would also focus on the 31-point charter of demands made by the 14-party alliance. The senior AL leader's comment came a day after health and family welfare adviser AMM Shawkat Ali phoned her to seek opinions about the probable dialogue. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his address to the nation on Jan 12 promised to start dialogue with political parties soon. Besides, the five new advisers in separate reactions to the media said they were keen on dialogue with the political parties. bdn
