 BERLIN, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany believes a new UN resolution imposing sanctions against Iran is needed and has invited other major powers to a meeting next Tuesday in Berlin to discuss the matter, a foreign ministry spokesman said. "We believe such a resolution is necessary," spokesman Martin Jaeger told a regular government news conference.

A senior diplomat accredited to the agency said ElBaradei was likely to convey "his positive assessment" that Iran was helping resolve lingering issues. Iran said late last year after starting to answer questions, following years of stonewalling, that broader sanctions could cause it to stop cooperating.

China and Russia have been balking at further sanctions resolutions against Iran, particularly after a US intelligence estimate last month said Tehran had given up its nuclear weapons programme in 2003.
