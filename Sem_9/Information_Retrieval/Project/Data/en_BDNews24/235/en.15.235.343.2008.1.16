<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixth seed Andy Roddick survived a minor third-set hiccup and romped to a 6-2 6-2 6-4 victory over Germany's Michael Berrer in the Australian Open second round on Wednesday. Roddick raced away with the first two sets with two breaks in each while his own overpowering service game was again to the fore with the German not given a single opportunity to break. The third set, however, was a different story with the 54th-ranked lefthander racing out a 3-0 lead. Roddick clawed his way back into the set, however, and reeled off the next five games with the opportunity to seal victory on Berrer's serve. Roddick, down 40-15, then produced a series of audacious chips and lobs to get to deuce where he held three match points -- none of which he could convert. The 2003 U.S. Open champion made no mistake in the next game, though, and served out. "It's a little bit cold and I knew the ball wouldn't go through the court so much," Roddick said in a courtside interview. "I was content to hit it around and let him try and bully the ball." He will meet Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in the next round
