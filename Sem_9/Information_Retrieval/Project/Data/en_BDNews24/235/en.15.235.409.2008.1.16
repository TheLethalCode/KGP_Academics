 PALERMO, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian police have arrested 29 suspected mobsters in Sicily including the son of a former Cosa Nostra boss, in what police hailed as another blow to the Mafia, officials said on Wednesday. "There are still islands under Mafia control, but the Cosa Nostra's power overall is in crisis," the chief prosecutor in Palermo, Francesco Messineo, told reporters. The operation follows a series of high-profile sweeps targeting the Sicilian Mafia, including November's arrest of "boss of bosses" Salvatore Lo Piccolo after nearly a quarter century on the run. Magistrates believe Lo Piccolo assumed command of the Cosa Nostra following the capture in 2006 of Bernardo Provenzano. The latest operation, which netted the arrest of Lo Piccolo's son, Calogero, targeted the former mob boss's support network. Police were still searching for three suspects.
