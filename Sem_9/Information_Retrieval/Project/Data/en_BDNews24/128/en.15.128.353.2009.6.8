 LOS ANGELES, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The family of late actor David Carradine is "profoundly disturbed" by photos published in Thailand that are said to be of Carradine's naked body hanging in his Bangkok hotel room, according to family attorney Mark Geragos. Geragos said a statement from the actor's brother, Keith Carradine, shows that the family will take legal action against people or media outlets that publish the photos "for invasion of privacy and causing severe emotional distress." The Thai-language newspaper Thai Rath published photos that show the body of Carradine, who died on June 3 in Bangkok where he was filming a new movie called "Stretch." Mystery has surrounded his death following initial reports that he had committed suicide -- claims his family has denied repeatedly. On Saturday, Geragos said Carradine's family had asked the FBI to look into the death. The family has hired a forensics pathologist to examine the actor's body when it is returned to the United States. Thai newspapers said the body left Bangkok on Saturday, which Geragos confirmed at the time. The body is expected to arrive in Los Angeles as early as Sunday. A maid found Carradine hanging in the closet of his hotel suite at Bangkok's plush Swissotel Nai Lert Park hotel. With coroners awaiting results of toxicology tests, Thai media pointed to suicide or accidental autoerotic asphyxiation as possible causes of death. Thai officials have said it could take several weeks before the results of an autopsy performed in Bangkok are released. Carradine starred in the mid-1970s US television show "Kung Fu" and the more recent "Kill Bill" movies
