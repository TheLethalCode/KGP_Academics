<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  Sports minister Ahad Ali Sarker on Wednesday once again cleared the government's stance on the Bangabandhu National Stadium saying the government had no plans on holding the 2011 ICC World Cup matches at the venue. "An unscheduled meeting of the prime minister, members of the parliamentary standing committee on the youth and sports ministry as well as my ministry has taken an unofficial decision that there will be no matches of the ICC World Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, which will only stage the opening ceremony," said Sarker. The sports minister made the issue clear to the reporters while watching the final of the National School Football Championship at the BNS on Wednesday. Asked whether the prime minister had any desire with the BNS, Sarker said that she had no wish with the venue beyond the opening ceremony. After having talked with the high-ups of both Bangladesh Football Federation and Bangladesh Cricket Board, the parliamentary standing committee on the youth and sports had earlier declared that the BNS would stage the World Cup opening ceremony while the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and Narayanganj Fatullah Stadium would host the matches. But, the BNS issue was raised last month when the directors meeting of the BCB on May 24 expressed their desire of holding one or two matches at the country's premier venue citing the emotional attachment to the BNS. Co-hosts Bangladesh have been allotted to host eight World Cup matches as well as the opening ceremony of the cricket extravaganza. The sports minister also said that the decision on holding matches at the BNS was a thinking of the cricket board and they could make it, but it would not be wise to do politics regarding the BNS. Sarker said the BNS was being used regularly for football, which was also a main game. The NSC chairman, Sarkar, also informed that he had a meeting with the BOA and NSC officials and was informed about the progress of the preparation of the 2010 South Asian (SA) Games in Bangladesh. bd
