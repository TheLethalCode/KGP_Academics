 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)BNP general secretary Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Tuesday demanded unconditional release of former lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, detained by police in the BDR mutiny case on charges of aiding mutineers to escape during the Feb 25-26 massacre. Delwar said in a statement that the arrest of Pintu was "motivated". "The government's arrest of Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu in the horrifying BDR killings is a conspiracy. It is a part of the government's control mechanism." "His brother-in-law (Mainur Rahman Opu) has also been arrested in the fake drive of the government," said Delwar. He warned, "The autocratic stance adopted by the coalition government to stay in power will bring no good result." He said the government had also dishonoured the High Court by allowing police to pick Pintu up from the court premises. Delwar also stated that the government was trying to harass Pintu's family and relatives in various ways. bd
