 HAVANA, Jun 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Saturday called charges that a former US State Department official and his wife spied for the Cuban government for nearly 30 years "ridiculous" and described the case as an "espionage comic strip." Castro neither confirmed nor denied the veracity of the spy charges brought by US authorities against Walter Kendall Myers, 72, and Gwendolyn Myers, 71, or the US Justice Department's assertion that Kendall Myers used his top-secret security clearance to give classified information to Havana.

"Those who in one form or another have helped to protect the Cuban people from the terrorist plans and assassination plots organized by various US administrations have done so at the initiative of their own conscience and are deserving, in my judgment, of all the honors in the world," he added. He did not elaborate but suggested that the "strange" spy case may have been cooked up with a view toward scuttling recent "contacts between the United States and Cuban government over important matters of mutual interest." Those contacts, and President Barack Obama's easing of the 47-year-old US trade embargo against Cuba, have kindled hopes that the countries might be ready to end years of hosti
