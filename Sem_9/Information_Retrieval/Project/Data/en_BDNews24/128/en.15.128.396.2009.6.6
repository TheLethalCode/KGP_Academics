 MEXICO CITY, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fire at a daycare center in northern Mexico on Friday killed at least 29 children and injured others, the government said. The victims died of mostly from smoke inhalation, Sonora state Justice Department spokesman Jose Larrinaga said on Milenio television. "They are various ages, from 3 or 4 months up to 2 or 3 years old," he said, adding several more children had been rushed to hospital where they were being treated for smoke inhalation. He said it was unclear where or how the fire started at the daycare center in the city of Hermosillo, although Mexican media reported it may have broken out in a nearby warehouse or a tire shop.
