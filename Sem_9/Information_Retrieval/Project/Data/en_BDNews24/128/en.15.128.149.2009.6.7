 Chittagong, June 7 (bdnews24.com)Infighting among National Security Intelligence officials may be responsible for the 'tip-off' that led to the sensational seizure of ten truckloads of weapons in Chittagong in 2004, say CID officials investigating the case. Former NSI director general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury and deputy director Liakat Hossain during lengthy interrogations have continued to deny any links to the arms consignment, said investigators on Sunday. Special superintendent of CID in Chittagong, Md Muslim, told bdnews24.com that the two former NSI officials will be produced in court again on Monday. Rezzakul and Liakat were sent back to Chittagong on Sunday after six days of questioning by the Task Force for Interrogation in Dhaka, during which they both pointed the finger squarely at co-accused, former NSI director Sahabuddin. Internal power struggles among NSI officials in the port city at the time apparently ended up bringing the arms consignment to the notice of law enforcers. Sahab informed police about the consignment to "falsely implicate other NSI officials", Rezzakul has said during interrogation. Investigators did not say whether Sahabuddin would be remanded for a third time for further interrogation. A CID official said Liakat had agreed to give a confessional statement in court, whereas Rezzak, who revealed a great deal of information during interrogation, refused to give a recorded statement. bdnews
