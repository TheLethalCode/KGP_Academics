 BELGRADE, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia coach Radomir Antic was as unimpressed as the 50,000 home fans with his team's overall performance in the World Cup 1-0 qualifying win over Austria on Saturday. Serbia tightened their grip on Europe's Group Seven and lead with 15 points from six matches, five more than France who have a game in hand. The Serbians are away to the Faroe Islands on Wednesday and, although Antic will miss several players through injury and suspension, he was boosted by the three points which edge his team closer to next year's finals in South Africa. "The importance of the match subdued us while it inspired the Austrians and we won thanks to very good defending because our usual free-flowing game was disrupted," he told reporters. "It was absolutely vital to win, to keep up our good run and stay in the driving seat, so we can't complain because we overpowered a fit and aggressive opponent. "The bad news is that we will miss some regular starters on Wednesday but we have enough depth in the squad to get the job done against the Faroes." Defender Nemanja Vidic limped off with an ankle injury at halftime and is very likely to miss the trip to Torshavn, while captain Dejan Stankovic and Bosko Jankovic are suspended. Left back Ivan Obradovic sat out the Austria game with a hamstring injury, but Antic will welcome back suspended striker Nikola Zigic, who should add bite up front. Serbia were below par and looked a pale shadow of the side that beat Austria 3-1 in Vienna last year, while some of their players were stunned by the opposition's improved quality. "Quite frankly, I am shocked how well they played and the only thing we can be happy about is that we got another three points in the bag," said winger Milan Jovanovic. "We were fortunate but we are also exhausted after a long, hard season so we won't lose too much sleep over it." Austria strikers Stefan Maierhofer and Marc Janko missed two good chances each and Paul Scahrner also came close for the Austrians, after Nenad Milijas had steered in an early penalty for the home side. Jankovic also hit the woodowrk with a curling free kick for Serbia but the vociferous home crowd went silent in the closing stages as the home side held on desperately
