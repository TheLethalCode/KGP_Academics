 bdnews24.com's Ahasan Lenin writes Dhaka, June 08 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka's air pollution poses a serious health hazard to the city's residents with rising respiratory illnesses causing more than 15,000 deaths a year, says the Department for Environment. Dust, smoke and deadly chemicals spewed by cars and factories and rotting garbage piled in the streets are saturating the air with poisons. Car emissions alone are adding around 3,700 tonnes of suspended particulate matter (spm) or fine particles in the air. The size of these easily inhaled particles is less than 10 microns. A DoE survey shows, on average, around 100 kilogrammes of lead, 60 tonnes of carbon monoxide, 16 tonnes of nitrogen oxide, one and a half tonnes sulphur dioxide, one tonne of hydrocarbons and three and a half tonne of other particles are being emitted by vehicles in the city every day. "Air pollution went down by one third after banning two-stroke auto rickshaws at the start of the decade but now the situation has reverted again," said Dr Nasir Uddin, director of air quality management at the DoE. An evaluation report by the World Bank says between $132-583 million is spent in a year to treat air pollution-related diseases in Dhaka and $200-800 million in the four other major cities, totalling 0.7 to 0.3 percent of the total GDP. Around $25 million were saved in health costs after the banning of the polluting two-stroke auto rickshaw engines and introducing CNG-run ones in their place, says the report. Rising numbers of cars and smoke-belching trucks and buses, however, are undoing the good work. Tens of thousands of pedestrians, roadside homes, businesses and shops, thousands of car drivers and traffic police are the front line victims of traffic pollution. Statistics show 70 to 80 percent of running cars in Dhaka are emitting poisonous particles due to faulty engines. CNG-run auto rickshaws and other cars are adding deadly carbon monoxide and benzene to the air. Toxic carbon monoxide is being produced from CNG as the gas is only partially combusted in faulty and badly maintained engines. Sulphur and lead mixed petrol and adulterated fuel release more harmful particles. Traffic is just part of the problem Floating ash and aerosols also adds to air pollution, while unplanned road-digging and construction has turned the city into a kingdom of dust that raises respiratory problems and traps the sun's heat causing temperature to climb. According to the DoE, air pollution is killing more than 15,000 people and causing another 100,000 to suffer various respiratory diseases every year. Children are the most vulnerable victims, with childhood asthma cases soaring, said paediatrician Dr Mahbubul Hasan. "Mothers are also giving birth prematurely, or to babies with deformities, because of toxins inhaled from the air," said Hasan. Among adults, bronchitis, pneumonia, heart and lung diseases are on the rise, he said. Most health experts say air pollution is also a major reason for increasing cases of cancer among city dwellers. The maximum acceptable level of carbon emissions is 290 to 300 parts per million (ppm) for a big city; in Dhaka the level has reached 350 ppm, up four percent in recent years as car numbers have risen unchecked, says the department. According to environmental laws, from 2007 smoke emissions were supposed to be reduced to 70 hartridge smoke units (hsu) in Dhaka, and from January 1, 2009, it was targeted to come down to 65 hsu. But the level remains at over 100 hsu. "One main reason is the black smoke spewed by the brick kilns growing around the city," said Billal Hossain, acting director at the DoE. "Besides, vehicles emissions, dust, unplanned construction activities and dumping wastes in open places all add to the pollution," he said. "And, DCC (Dhaka City Corporation) dumping garbage in the open and carrying it in uncovered vans adds to the health hazards," said Hossain. "Carbon gases are also emitted from special kinds of darkened glass increasingly used in shopping malls, high-rise office blocks and apartments," said Dr Zahir Alam, head of civil and environmental engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. "Many people do not even know that carbon is emitted from this glass," he said. "It also raises air temperature by reflecting heat in the air," he added. Use of this kind of glass is controlled in developed countries, said Alam. Delicate balance There is another major impact of air pollution, said Dr Shahnaz Haque Hussain, dean of the earth and environment department of Dhaka University. "Increasing emissions and dust are harming the natural growth of trees and plants and destroying the ecological balance," she said. "Pollution is hampering annual precipitation." "And the process of photosynthesis is hampered when dust smothers the leaves," she said. The concrete jungle with its poisoned air is slowly suffocating its plant life and its inhabitants, she said. bdnews2
