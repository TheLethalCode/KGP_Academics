 BUENOS AIRES, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A relieved Argentina remained on course for a 2010 World Cup berth when defender Daniel Diaz's second-half strike earned them a 1-0 win over Colombia in their qualifier on Saturday. The result helped ease the pressure on Argentina coach Diego Maradona after his team crashed 6-1 in Bolivia in April, although Saturday's performance was far from convincing. Colombia, who have scored only six goals in 13 qualifiers, dominated the first half and squandered a superb chance to equalise shortly after Diaz's goal, his first for his country. The win kept Argentina in the top four of the 10-team South American group with 22 points from 13 games and five to play. Colombia have 14 and their chances of qualifying for their first World Cup since 1998 are increasingly remote. The top four teams qualify directly and the fifth plays off against the fourth-placed CONCACAF team for a another place. The visitors began brightly and Wason Renteria squandered their first chance in the 15th minute when he shot weakly at Mariano Andujar after Vladimir Marin had dispossessed Fernando Gago to set up the chance. Argentina created a half-chance when Lionel Messi chipped a dangerous ball into the penalty area but goalkeeper David Ospina managed to turn it away. Colombian threatened again in the 36th minute when Radamel Falcao Garcia's dipping shot from the edge of the penalty area was fisted away by Andujar. Maradona replaced Gago with Javier Zanetti at halftime and the move paid off within 10 minutes when Diaz volleyed in at the far post after Veron's corner was headed on at the far post. Colombia should have levelled shortly afterwards but Falcao failed to make contact with Renteria's low cross in front of an open goal. An incident in the last 10 minutes is bound to raise more questions about Maradona's coaching credentials. With Mascherano limping badly, Maradona used up his last substitution by replacing Carlos Tevez with Nicolas Burdisso, forcing the stricken Liverpool player to stay on the pitch
