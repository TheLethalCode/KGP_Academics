 SOFIA, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Bulgaria will have to rely on their opponents falling by the wayside if they are to qualify for next year's World Cup. Saturday's 1-1 home draw with Ireland left Bulgaria in third place in Group Eight with eight points from six matches. Italy top the standings with 14 points, followed by Ireland, who played one game more, on 13. The top three teams are still undefeated. "Nothing is in our hands anymore in this group," said coach Stanimir Stoilov. "From now on we have to win all matches and we have to wait our rivals to slump." Stoilov has replaced Plamen Markov, who was sacked in February after three draws in the first three matches in the group with Bulgaria desperate to avoid a third consecutive failure to reach a major tournament's finals. Little has changed since, though, with Bulgaria drawing twice against Ireland and beating Cyprus at home. However, Stoilov said he was still hoping that Bulgaria could progress citing the famous goal from Emil Kostadinov that broke French hearts in Paris 16 years ago. "I do believe in miracles like the one that in all matches and we have to wait our rivals to slump," he said. Kostadinov's last-minute strike gave Bulgaria a 2-1 win over hosts France to guarantee the Balkan country's team a place at the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States. "We still have slim chances to qualify, so we'll be fighting to the very end," he said. "It's obvious that our team is going in the right direction," added the 34-year-old Radostin Kishishev, the most experienced Bulgaria player. "We have the strength to win our remaining matches in the group.
