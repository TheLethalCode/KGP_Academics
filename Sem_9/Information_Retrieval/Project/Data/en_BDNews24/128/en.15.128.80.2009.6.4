 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)Business confidence was on a high after the new government took office but has since fallen, said a report out Thursday. The quarterly index from January to March shows that business confidence is on a downturn, said the current issue of the Bangladesh Economic Outlook published by NGO Samunnay . Dr Selim Raihan, associate professor of Dhaka University, presented the summary of the Outlook at a programme at the CIRDAP auditorium on Thursday. He said the business confidence index, based on a survey of business entities, plummeted for the three months to March this year compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. It also fell compared with the previous three months to December last year. Business confidence registered 51.44 points on the index through January-March this year compared to 63.62 points over the same time last year. He said confidence rose over the last months of the past caretaker government and during the first month of the newly elected government, but has fallen or remained static since. But, Dr Raihan said, "It cannot be said that it has happened due to government policies because the government has only passed a few months in office." Since coming to power, the new government has had to contend with the effects of global recession and recent turbulent events at home, including the BDR mutiny. Former finance minister M Saiduzzaman said the main challenge for the government now was to maintain economic balance with the upcoming budget of the next fiscal year. "It will be a difficult task for the new government to enhance revenue in the current economic recession." "In this situation, the budget deficit has to be kept at an acceptable level. If need be, the government has to increase its money receipts from foreign sources." He said the ADP target was ambitious but can be implemented. He stressed increased investment proportionate to deposits, food stock at the governmental level and strengthening the distribution system. Former Bangladesh Bank deputy governor Khondakar Ibrahim Khaled, who chaired the programme, said business confidence was lowest before the election "It rose after the election, but has fallen again as businessmen did not get the kind of facilities they expected of the elected government," he said. "People with undisclosed money expected that they would be able to use their money after election but they could not," he said. "There is a huge amount of black money in the country. This has to be brought into the mainstream of the economy subject to reasonable taxation." He advocated legalising the black money given the current situation. BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque said the perceived business confidence was right. Important infrastructure like electricity and gas was too inadequate and the government cannot assure the businesses of resolving the crises. Global economic recession is another cause for uncertainty in international trade, he added. Samunnay coordinator AKM Muksudul Alam Murshed was also present. bdnews
