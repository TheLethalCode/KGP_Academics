 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com) - Speaker Abdul Hamid has reiterated that it would not be possible to give any more than one additional front row seat to BNP. "With this, the opposition will have five out of a total 27 front bench seats in the House," he told reporters on Saturday at a workshop for women MPs. The main opposition BNP was allocated four front row seats during parliament's last session, including that of chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. One more was offered ahead of the second session. Awami League has maintained that this is more than proportionally fair considering BNP holds only a tenth of the 300 seats in the House. The BNP, demanding a 'respectable' number of front bench seats, has refused to attend parliament except for a few occasions since January. The speaker said he nevertheless hoped that the opposition party would take part in the crucial budget session that began on June 4 to make it effective. At the workshop earlier, he called on all to work together to give shape to democracy in the country. "The ninth parliament has than 18 percent women MPs. This parliament can be extremely effective if the government and the opposition works in unison," he said. Women MPs from the opposition and the treasury bench participated in the workshop, jointly hosted by the Speaker's office, the US-founded National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) and the Bangladesh Alliance for Women's Leadership, in which chief whip Abdus Shahid and others took part. The speaker requested Shahid to include more women MPs as members of parliamentary standing committee in the current session. bdnew
