 Dhaka, June 04 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has instructed her party MPs to be present and "contribute in the true sense" to the the House's discussions on the budget to be presented on June 11. Her directive came on Thursday at a meeting of the Awami League Parliamentary Party (ALPP) the parliament building. "We have many young MPs. So, the Leader of the House has asked all to take part in the budget discussion and contribute to the process in true sense," Abdus Shahid, chief whip, told reporters at a press briefing after the meeting. The prime minister gave the guidelines since most MPs veer off from analysis of the proposed budget while others MPs say nothing on the subject. They heap praises on the party leaders, try to assassinate others' characters and talk about the problems of their constituencies, as seen in previous parliamentary proceedings. "She also suggested the MPs be present in parliament in time," said Shahid. The chief whip said the meeting discussed the situation in the cyclone Aila-hit areas. The MPs observed that there was no crisis of relief materials in affected areas. "One MP said there were cases where relief materials reached affected areas before the MPs had asked for them," Shahid added. He said a large number of MPs addressing the meeting said some areas neglected during the BNP rule must get priority in terms of development grants. "[Hasina] also stressed the need for equal distribution of resources in all areas," said Shahid. As many as 232 MPs attended the two-hour meeting presided over by Hasina.
