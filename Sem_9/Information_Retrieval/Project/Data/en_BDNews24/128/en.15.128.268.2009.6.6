 Dhaka, June 06 (bdnews24.com)  A 'national service' job scheme for young people will be tested with allocation in the new budget, giving those who pass HSCs the opportunity to work in the public sphere for two years, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Saturday. Work will be arranged for the young people at different government ministries, departments and organisations for the two years, which includes six months' training. "After that, he or she will decide whether they want to continue the job or their studies," said Muhith in a pre-budget press conference at the NEC auditorium. At the initial stage, the scheme will be undertaken in two or three upazilas as a pilot project, said the minister. "Gradually, it will be replicated across the country," he said. Asked about the financial allocation to the project the minister asked the reporters to see for themselves on June 11 when the budget is announced. "It was a part of our election pledge," he added. Muhith said he took the final decision on the project while putting the last touches to the budget during his three days abroad to attend the 34th conference of Islami Development Bank in Turkmenistan. bd
