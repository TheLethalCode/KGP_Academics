 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The second and final four-day match between Bangladesh A and visiting Maharastra Cricket Association also ended in a draw after as many as 16 wickets fell on the fourth and the final day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. The hosts were very close to victory after picking up seven wickets, but the match eventually ended in a draw. Maharastra, chasing a winning target of 229 in the last session, reached 103-7 before the bails were removed on the final day. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Jr rattled the top order to claim three for 39 while Suhrwardi Shuvo, also a left-arm spinner, broke the middle order also taking three wickets for 29, but they hadn't had enough time to clean the tail after Bangladesh A declared their second innings on 170-9 at tea. Bangladesh A took a slim 58-run lead in the first innings after bowling the visitors out for 299. The hosts made 357 in the first innings. Back to the day's innings, Bangladesh A, having resumed the day on 18 for no loss, lost overnight batsman Imrul Kayes (24), but Nafis Iqbal showed temperament to convert his score of 13 to 50 before becoming one of Kiran Adhav's victims, who returned with an impressive 6-66. Nafis struck six fours and one six in his 96-ball stay while Kayes' 24-run innings was studded two boundaries. After both openers fell the hosts lost wickets at regular intervals, but Suhrawardi Shuvo kept cool to rescue the situation with 43 off 95 balls that included five fours. bd
