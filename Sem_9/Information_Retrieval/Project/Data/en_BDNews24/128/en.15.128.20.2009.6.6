<TEXT>
 Faridpur, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  An investigation committee has not found any evidence that children fell seriously ill last week after taking combined doses of Vitamin and deworming tablets in Faridpur, the civil surgeon said on Saturday as more than 20 million children were administered the two drugs across the country in an annual Vitamin A+ campaign. "Some were affected with mild diarrhoea in two villages in Chabhadrashan," civil surgeon Dr Bashirul Alam told bdnews24.com, quoting the probe report that he received on Saturday. The report said also said some children that were not administered the Vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets also suffered from diarrhoea on the day. The doctor added: "Deworming tablets may cause upsets if they are taken on an empty stomach." The medicines have been sent to Dhaka for chemical tests, he added. Mixed reports Some reported from the district last Thursday that over 100 children began vomiting and suffered diarrhoea as union health workers went house to house at Char Shalipur and Char Hazar Bigha villages from 8am to 4pm with the vitamin capsules and worming tablets (Albodozol). Dr Abu Faisal Hossain of Faridpur general hospital told bdnews24.com on the day, "Some 13 children were admitted to the hospital. Six of them are being treated in the emergency." Upazila medical officer Jahid Hasan had said nearly 2,500 children were given Vitamin A and worming medicine and among them "some fell ill." "Heat could be a reason. None of such patient has come to upazila health complex yet," he added at the time. Civil surgeon Bashirul Islam said, "Some children may get sick if given worming tablets during heat." Felony The investigation report also observed that it is a felony to administer the medicines to children ahead of a scheduled campaign. The probe committee recommended punitive measures for those who started administering medicines on Thursday, two days ahead of time, said Dr Alam. "The findings of the report have been sent to the director general of the directorate general of health services (DGHS) and steps will be taken against the guilty," he said. The investigation committee was formed soon after reports of children falling ill came out of Chabhadrashan in Faridpur. The three-member committee was headed by Dr Sanjay Saha of Faridpur General Hospital. Countrywide drive Meanwhile, more than two crore children, aged 1 to 5, were administered a high-powered vitamin A capsule and around 1.9 crore children, aged from 2 to 5, fed an extra anthelmintic tablet on Saturday. Some 120,000 permanent centres and 20,000 mobile centres at bus stands, rail stations, airports, launch terminals and toll plazas of big bridges were deployed to ensure that not a single child was left out, said a joint statement by the government and UNICEF. The campaign was scheduled from 8am to 4pm but local authorities kept it going after 4pm where required. Health and nutrition workers also went door to door to dispense nutrition knowledge to mothers and relatives of the children. bdn
