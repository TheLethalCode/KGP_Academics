<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 4 (bdnews24.com)The government on Thursday told the High Court that it will take at least a year to stop pollution and illegal encroachment of rivers in the capital and on its fringes. Director general of the Department of Environment Md Belal Hossain, land survey department director general Aslam Alam and the Bangladesh Inland Transport Authority chairman Abdul Mannan appeared before the High Court. They told a two-judge bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Md Mamotaj Uddin Ahmed that the government needed one year to stop river pollution, grabbing and filling. They described the steps taken so far to save the rivers and said there were some hindrances to implement the High Court directions. The same bench had ordered the government on May 24 to take effective steps to stop encroachment on the rivers Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakhya. The High Court on Wednesday ordered the government to report on what steps were being taken to stop illegal encroachment of rivers in and around Dhaka. Hearing of the writ petition on the issue has been adjourned until June 22. On a public interest writ petition of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, the bench had ordered the government on the day to explain within a week why directives were not issued to evict illegal structures along the rivers. The court on Thursday also summoned the deputy commissioners of Dhaka, Naryanganj, Munshiganj and Gazipur districts and asked them about measures taken. They verbally ordered the chief administrators of the districts to appear before the court on June 8 and tell it how much more time they needed to implement the steps to save the rivers. bd
