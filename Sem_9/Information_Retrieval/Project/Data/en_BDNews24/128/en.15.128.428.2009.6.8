 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange soared to an unprecedented high of over Tk 780 crore on Sunday, with indices also peaking on optimism ahead of the new budget, said market observers. The market surge was powered by banks, insurance, financial institutions and power sector issues, with investors chasing "sound fundamentals". "Investors are very hopeful," Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Ziaul Haque Khandakar told reporters. He said a greater influx of shares into the capital market was very important while the market was buoyant. DSE president Raqibur Rahman said investors were competing to buy up quality stocks with sound fundamentals in order to gain a good foothold in the market. "They believe this government is investment and capital market friendly." "They are expecting the budget will have something good for the market," he said. This optimism is driving the market, he added. Rahman also had a tip for small investors: "They should sell off their shares as soon as they make a rational gain. It's risky to wait for the 'highest profit'." "And, if everybody did that, it would interfere with supply and demand and destroy market balance," he added. Turnover, indices soar At Tk 781.68 crore, Sunday's DSE turnover surged past the previous record of Tk 672 crore that was set just last trading day (Thursday). Turnover on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also climbed to a new peak of Tk 83 crore on Sunday. The DGEN or general index surged 55 points within five minutes of the opening bell, to close a total of 107 points up at 2790. The blue chip DSE-20 index soared 123 points to close at 2,216. The DSI or all share price index gained 84 points to end on 2,318. Of the traded issues, 148 gained, 90 lost and five remained unchanged. Eight banks and two insurance companies made up the ten top performing shares. The CSE's CASPI or all share price index ended on 9502, up 367 points. The blue chip CSE-30 closed at 6176, rising 539 points. Of 159 traded issues, 97 gained and 58 lost. bdn
