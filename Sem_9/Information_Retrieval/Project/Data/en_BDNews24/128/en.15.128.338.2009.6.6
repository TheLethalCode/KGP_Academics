 MILAN, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ciro Ferrara became the latest inexperienced coach to land a top European job when he was confirmed as the permanent manager of Juventus on Friday. Ferrara took over as caretaker coach after the sacking of Claudio Ranieri last month and won his two games in charge to help Juve finish second in Serie A and clinch an automatic Champions League place. "He is a man linked to Juventus and to our story of success," a club statement said, adding he had signed a two-year deal.

Under Ranieri, twice European champions Juve finished third in Serie A in 2008 in their first season back in the top flight following their demotion for match-fixing. They made a good start to the season just gone, beating Real Madrid home and away in the Champions League, but an alarming dip in form towards the end of the campaign threatened their place in Europe's top competition and Ranieri was sacked. "The bitterness remains but it is all part of the game of football," Ranieri told Sky television earlier on Friday in his first public comments since his dismissal. "I didn't expect it from a club like Juventus." Juve have already recruited their former defender Fabio Cannavaro from Real Madrid and Brazilian playmaker Diego from Werder Bremen for next season, with other signings likely
