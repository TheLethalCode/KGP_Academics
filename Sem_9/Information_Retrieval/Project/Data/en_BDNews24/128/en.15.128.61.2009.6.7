<TITLE> European poll set to add to UK Brown's woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sun Jun 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown was braced on Sunday for further damaging election results, heaping more pressure on him after six senior ministers quit government last week, one calling for him to step down. Media reports said the ruling Labour Party could come third or even fourth in the European election, the results of which are to be published on Sunday evening. It would follow a drubbing in Thursday's local elections when the party lost control of all the English county councils it was defending. Voter anger at lavish expense claims by members of parliament during one of the worst recessions in decades could see the far-right British National Party (BNP) gain its first seat in the European Parliament, analysts say. Peter Hain, appointed Welsh Secretary in Friday's reshuffle, told Sky News the results are going to be "terrible" -- for all mainstream parties. Labour could trail the Conservatives, the anti-European UK Independence Party (UKip) and the Liberal Democrats. Poor results were expected to provide further ammunition for Labour Party rebels who fear that unless Brown resigns they will lose the parliamentary election that must be held within a year. Last week sterling was hit by speculation over Brown's future and if Brown manages to survive the current crisis, it looks likely he will wait for as long as possible before calling the next election. Critics say the party lacks a coherent policy agenda and Brown is indecisive and a poor communicator, adding he appears to be unable to transfer his confidence on the world economic stage to domestic politics. Labour's Charles Falconer, a former senior Labour minister, told the BBC Brown may be too divisive a figure. "Can we get unity under the current leadership? I am not sure that we can and I think we need to debate it urgently and I think probably it will need a change in leader," he said. The Parliamentary Labour Party is due to hold an important meeting on Monday, and some members may be tempted to sign an email which media reports said calls on Brown Minister to quit. The main opposition Conservative Party, with a commanding lead in opinion polls, has called for an early election, which could see it return to power for the first time since 1997. Brown still receives backing from some key Labour figures, including Alan Johnson, the man tipped to succeed if he goes. Jon Cruddas, who has strong union support, wrote in the Labour-leaning Sunday Mirror tabloid: "Everyone knows our government is in trouble. Serious trouble. But to suggest that we'll tackle those problems simply by chucking Gordon Brown overboard is madness." Brown's position is bolstered by an apparent lack of an organized plot to oust him, despite the resignations last week. "It would require somebody to stand against him, somebody who is raising their standard and saying that they could do a better job and we don't have that person," said Peter Mandelson, the ex-EU Commissioner appointed by Brown as business minister. A change of Labour leader would raise the prospect of a snap election. Brown has not faced the electorate since he took over as prime minister from Tony Blair two years
