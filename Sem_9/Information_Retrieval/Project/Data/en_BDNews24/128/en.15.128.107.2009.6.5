<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June5 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury on Friday accused late president Ziaur Rahman of somewhat spelling capital Dhaka's environment disaster by felling big trees indiscriminately. "That he had links to the assassination of Bangabandhu (independence hero and the first head of state Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) is now proven. He feared that somebody may shoot him dead from trees. It was out of this fear that he felled in large scale. He was not killed from trees but in the circuit house room, Matia said at a discussion organised by forest and environment affairs sub-committee of Awami Leauge marking the 'World Environment Day'. "BNP means a party that cuts trees, kills people. They don't care about the environment." She said concerted efforts at public-private level should be taken to preserve the natural environment. Otherwise a great environmental disaster will befall upon the country. local government and rural development minister Syed Ashraful Islam said people would have to work together to ward off environmental disaster. Ashraful narrated the horrible pollution of the rivers flowing by the capital city. "The rivers are so polluted that it is not being possible to make river waters drinkable," he said "Water level is going down gradually as 85 percent of drinking water now comes from underground." The minister cautioned that if the use of underground water continued, no-one would be able to save Dhaka from massive disaster. Ashraful was unhappy with the officials for their failure to launch effective drive against encroachment of rivers. "You have started the drive against illegal occupation of rivers after publication of reports in the dailies. Why have you been so long?" The deputy leader of the parliament, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, criticised the BNP-led four coalition government for 'plotting and looting' and failing to protect the environment. "But we have taken initiatives to preserve the environment as before." b
