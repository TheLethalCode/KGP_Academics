<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The absence of main opposition party BNP in parliament was a major cause for concern at a meeting of the ruling party's central working committee, said Awami League spokesman and cabinet member Syed Ashraful Islam on Saturday. "The government wants to make parliament effective by working with the opposition," Ashraful told reporters after the meeting. The opposition party on Thursday skipped the opening day of parliament's second session, the crucial budget session, due to a seating dispute that has remained unresolved since the new parliament convened in January. "The issue was much discussed in the meeting, and we request BNP to return," he said. Speaker repeats: only one more Speaker Abdul Hamid, meanwhile, reiterated that only one more front row seat would be available to BNP. "With this, the opposition will have five out of a total 27 front bench seats in the House," he told reporters after a workshop for women MPs. The main opposition BNP was allocated four front row seats during parliament's last session, including that of chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. One more was offered ahead of the second session. Awami League has maintained that this is more than proportionally fair considering BNP holds only a tenth of the 300 seats in the House. But BNP, demanding a 'respectable' number of front bench seats, has refused to attend parliament except for a few occasions since January. The speaker said he nevertheless hoped that the opposition party would take part in the budget session to make it effective. He called on all to work together to give a shape to democracy in the country. Long meeting Ashraful, meanwhile, speaking to reporters after the CWC's four-hour meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina at the party's Dhanmondi office, said it touched on the many issues that arose during the AL-led government's first five months in power. Asked about the much-highlighted Tipaimukh Dam issue, the minister said decisions would be based upon opinions from water resources experts and recommendations of the standing committee on the water resources ministry. Ashraful also quoted the prime minister as saying trial of the BDR mutineers would start very soon. He also mentioned that the party's 60th founding anniversary falls on June 23. bdn
