 PARIS, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Svetlana Kuznetsova's parents taught her to be strong and the Russian did just that when she survived a three-set thriller to beat Serena Williams to reach the semi-finals of the French Open on Wednesday. The seventh seed had her ups and downs but prevailed 7-6 5-7 7-5 despite twisting her ankle while leading by a set and 4-2. "In the game where I twisted my ankle, I was more focused on my foot. Thinking about it I lost my serve, and she started to play better," Kuznetsova, a Roland Garros runner-up in 2006, told reporters. The Russian, however, did not feel sorry for herself and recovered from 3-1 down in the decider to clinch victory and set up a meeting with Australian 30th seed Samantha Stosur. Kuznetsova, the 2004 U.S. Open champion, said mental toughness had been instilled in her from an early age. "They teach their kids to be strong. We always have difficult moments in Russia when we grow up, and we always learn to be strong. I think this is one of the keys," she said. Although an all-Russian final is on the cards in Paris between Kuznetsova and top seed Dinara Safina, who will take on Slovak Dominika Cibulkova in her semi-final, the world number seven did not want to get too carried away. "On Saturday, if we are not in the final, or one of us is not in the final, I am going to look like an idiot here. I'm sitting here talking about an all-Russian final that maybe won't happen," she said
