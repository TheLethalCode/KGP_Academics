<TEXT>
 MILAN, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic would welcome a move to Barcelona, his agent said on Friday following reports the clubs were discussing a deal. Inter president Massimo Moratti held a budget meeting with coach Jose Mourinho on Thursday and was later spotted dining with Barca counterpart Joan Laporta at a hotel in the Spanish city. Sweden's Ibrahimovic, Serie A's top scorer last term, has expressed his frustration at champions Inter and would like a new challenge. Moratti and Mourinho had previously said they expected their inspirational forward to stay. "I only know that if the two clubs find an agreement we would not have trouble agreeing with Barcelona," agent Mino Raiola told reporters. There has also been media speculation about a possible swap deal with European champions Barca involving striker Samuel Eto'o. If Ibrahimovic were to leave for Spain, it would be another huge blow to Italy's top flight with AC Milan's Kaka on the brink of signing for Real Madrid
