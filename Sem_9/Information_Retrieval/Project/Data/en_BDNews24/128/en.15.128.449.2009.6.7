<TEXT>
 MONTEVIDEO, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil capitalised on an early blunder by goalkeeper Sebastian Viera to thrash Uruguay 4-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday and claim their first away win against their smaller neighbours for 33 years. Daniel Alves scored early when his speculative 40-metre shot bounced around six metres in front of goal, was completely misjudged by Viera and flew into the net. Juan headed a second before halftime and Luis Fabiano fired the third early in the second half but was later sent off. Kaka completed the rout when he won and converted a penalty. The win kept Brazil well on course for South Africa, taking them level on 24 points with South American group leaders Paraguay who were hosting Chile later on Saturday. Uruguay's chances of qualifying directly took a severe blow as they remained fifth, outside the top four who go straight to South Africa from the 10-team group. The fifth team plays off over two legs against the fourth side from CONCACAF. Uruguay have 17 points and five games to play. The hosts dominated the first half but Brazil went in 2-0 ahead. Brazil scored with their first shot as the hapless Viera appeared to try and control Alves's shot with his chest. Sebastian Eguren headed narrowly wide and Luis Suarez had a free kick fisted away by Julio Cesar as Uruguay dominated possession but Brazil snatched a second goal. Viera saved Juan's header from a corner but the ball was picked up on the right by Elano whose curling cross was met with another Juan header. Alvaro Pereira should have pulled one back immediately but shot wide with only Julio Cesar to beat, then Suarez had a shot charged down by the Inter Milan goalkeeper. KAKA SCORES Brazil increased their lead five minutes into the second half with a deadly counter-attack which finished with Luis Fabiano firing into the roof of the net for his seventh goal of the qualifiers. Luis Fabiano had a shot saved by Viera on the break but was sent off in the 70th minute after being given a second yellow card for diving. Despite being a man down, Brazil still looked dangerous and added a fourth when Diego Godin crashed into Kaka, who converted the resulting penalty himself. Uruguay had Maximiliano Pereira sent off in the 86th minute for a wild tackle on Ramires as they lost at home to Brazil for the first time since 1976
