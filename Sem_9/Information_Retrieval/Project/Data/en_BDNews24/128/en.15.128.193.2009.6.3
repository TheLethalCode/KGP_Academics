 PARIS, June 3 (bdnews24.com)- Pace bowler Mitchell Johnson took four wickets as Australia beat New Zealand by seven wickets in Tuesday's warm-up at the Oval. England and West Indies also warmed up well with easy victories. The hosts beat Scotland by 6 wickets and West Indies thrashed Ireland by 9 wickets in the day's other warm up matches. At the Oval, left-armer Johnson ensured the Black Caps were unable to post a sizeable total with a devastating spell at the start before returning to stem a batting recovery. Australia captain Ricky Ponting made sure his team took advantage of Johnson's efforts with a half-century in reply. Shane Watson (16) and David Warner (10) made a steady start for Australia, in pursuit of 148, before James Franklin made an impressive entrance into the attack with a double-wicket maiden to remove both openers. Australia required 88 from the last 10 overs as Ponting and Michael Clarke advanced initially at a run-a-ball before upping the ante. Thirty four were needed off the last five overs and Ponting saw his team to within sight of their target before he holed out to long-off against Daniel Vettori for 56 off 40 balls. Clarke (49 off 38 balls) was then assisted by Andrew Symonds (17 off 11 balls) to see their team to victory with four balls to spare. New Zealand had earlier made a good recovery after a disastrous top-order collapse saw them slip to 21-5. Johnson and Brett Lee terrorised the batsmen with aggressive opening spells and the former even found time to effect a run out at the nadir of the Black Caps' innings. By the time Jacob Oram was run out, without facing a ball, by Johnson from his mid-off position it seemed the point of no return had come for New Zealand. That was to ignore the length of the batting order, however, as Scott Styris (42 off 28 balls) and Peter McGlashan (49 off 35 balls) combined in a sixth-wicket stand of 71 as they found the going much easier against the other Australian bowlers. Lee had begun the rot from the third ball when Brendon McCullum was caught behind and Johnson carried on the onslaught when he removed Jesse Ryder and Martin Guptill in his first over. Johnson then returned to end the brave resistance of Styris when he edged a wide delivery to Brad Haddin behind the wicket. The left-arm pace bowler ended his spell in appropriate fashion to remove Nathan McCullum with his last ball to end with figures of 4-0-2
