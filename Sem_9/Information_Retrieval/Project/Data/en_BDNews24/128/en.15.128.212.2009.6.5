 ALMATY, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England midfielder Frank Lampard turned his attention from this weekend's World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan to the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti as Chelsea's new manager saying he was delighted with his appointment. Lampard, talking to the media before Saturday's game, said he and his Chelsea team mates in the England squad, John Terry and Ashley Cole, were very excited about the club's future under the 49-year-old Italian who is moving to London from AC Milan. "Everything that has come back about him has been completely positive, as a man and as a manager," Lampard said. "I've seen that from afar and it's nice to hear that from everyone, all us Chelsea lads here are very excited about the future." "In the last two years we've been very close to things but not quite winning them. We've got a very strong group at Chelsea anyway. I don't want to go into individuals but to see us linked with names and the quality of player, the intention seems there from Chelsea and from the manager," he added. England, who lead Group Six with five wins from their opening five qualifiers, are favourites to beat Kazakhstan who are second from bottom with just one win from their five games. Lampard said the mood in the England squad was upbeat, adding: "You learn to switch off from club football to country football as soon as you get here. "We're together and confident and that's the main thing at the moment. Everyone is fit and fresh and whether they have won or lost cup finals with their club teams they are very focused." England beat Kazakhstan 5-1 at Wembley last October and a victory on Saturday plus another win over Andorra at Wembley next Wednesday will take England within three points of qualifying for the finals with three matches remaining. "If we can get six points in these two games we know we will take a huge step towards qualification for next summer's finals," Lampard said
