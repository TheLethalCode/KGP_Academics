 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's defeat by Netherlands in the opening game of the Twenty20 World Cup was branded "the ultimate humiliation" by British newspapers on Saturday. England lost by four wickets against the 500-1 outsiders to the embarrassment of players and fans alike at Lord's on Friday with The Times praising "Dutch courage" for the shock win. The Daily Express said: "England have had some embarrassing moments in World Cup cricket but none as embarrassing as this, coming on their most famous of grounds..." "Clogs 1 Clots 0" was the headline in The Sun which said England bowler Stuart Broad, who missed with a throw at the stumps to hand the Dutch victory off the final ball, "was made to look a total lemon by the orange men of Holland..." The Daily Star noted: "The rank outsiders gave Paul Collingwood's side a lesson with bat, ball and in the field. And the hosts could have absolutely no argument..." The Times added: "Fluffing your lines against the likes of Australia or India is one thing, but England played like headless chickens in the closing two overs..." The Telegraph's verdict was just as damning with the newspaper telling readers that England had lost to "a rag-tag assortment of Dutch cricketers made up of downhill skier, a debt collector and a 37-year-old advertising executive. "It's lucky the Dutch didn't pick Burger King employee Mudassar Bukhari or England could have made even more of a dog's dinner of their World Twenty20 campaign." England must beat Pakistan on Sunday to avoid a first-round exit, while the Netherlands will clinch a second-round spot if they produce another upset against Pakistan next Tuesday
