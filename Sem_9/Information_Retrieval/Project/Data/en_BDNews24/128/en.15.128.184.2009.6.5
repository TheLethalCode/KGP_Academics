<TITLE> Jittery Federer steps closer to Paris crown </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - From the moment Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the French Open on Sunday, Roger Federer has been on the most nerve-jangling journey of his career and the jitters are likely to get much worse over the next few days. With an elusive French Open title and a record-equalling 14th grand slam dangling tantalisingly within his reach, the Swiss knows the stakes could not get higher as he prepares to take on Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro in the semi-finals. "We're all nervous at this stage of the competition. I felt it. Yesterday I felt it, and I felt it again today before the match. I was tired, I was nervous, and I didn't feel really good," the world number two said after beating Frenchman Gael Monfils in Wednesday's quarter-finals. Since 2005, four-times champion Nadal has assumed the role of being Federer's personal tormenter at the Open, beating the Swiss four times in Paris, including in the last three finals. Each time the Swiss arrived hoping to become only the sixth man to have won all four majors in their careers and each time the Spaniard sucked the life-blood out of himas was evident in last year's final when Federer won a measly four games. But with his nemesis having been taken care of by Sweden's Robin Soderling in the fourth round, Federer knows he may never again have another golden opportunity to lift the Musketeers' Cup, especially since his aggregate win-loss record against the three remaining men in the semis stands at 26-1. Del Potro has never managed to win a set off Federer in five meetings but the Swiss did not want to undermine the 20-year-old's challenge. 'GOOD RECORD' "He's improved in incredible ways since one year ago. I think he was only ranked 50 in the world this time last year. Just shows how quickly things can change in tennis," said Federer, who will be contesting his 20th consecutive grand slam semi-final. "I expect a very difficult match against Juan Martin. I have a lot of respect for him. I have a good record against him, but it doesn't mean a thing right now because it's too big of a match, too dangerous, and he's playing too well at this tournament to underestimate him." Del Porto has capitalised on the clay playing more like a hardcourt this year to reach his first major semi and realises he could turn out to be the ultimate villain if he beats Federer on Friday. "We all feel the pressure of the fans, everybody wants Roger to win this tournament but when I play Roger, I'll have to play my game. Otherwise I'll never achieve anything." Nadal's conqueror Soderling will face Chilean 12th seed Fernando Gonzalez in the other semi-final and both realise their match is likely to be just a sideshow to the main act on Friday. Soderling is hoping to become the first Swede to reach the final here since his coach Magnus Norman achieved the feat in 2000. The 24-year-old is delighted he is able to pick the brains of someone who has travelled the same road. "What is most important is that he has been through all this before. It really helps to have a coach like that and I can always ask him 'What did you do in a situation like this?'" said Soderling, who had never advance beyond the third round of a slam before this week. Instead of exploiting his opponents' weaknesses, Soderling has opted is to blunt their strengths. If by chance someone had never seen Nadal play before Sunday, they would not have guessed just how lethal the Spaniard's forehands can be. Soderling's high-risk strategy has so far paid off as he has claimed the scalps of David Ferrer (seeded 14th), Nadal and Nikolay Davydenko (10) and will have no doubt put some questions into Gonzalez's head, since the Chilean also has a game built around a big forehand
