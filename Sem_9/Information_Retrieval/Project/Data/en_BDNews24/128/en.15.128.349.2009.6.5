 PARIS, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Robin Soderling kept his wits about him in a heated 6-3 7-5 5-7 4-6 6-4 win over Chilean 12th seed Fernando Gonzalez on Friday to reach the French Open final. The conqueror of champion Rafa Nadal withstood a fierce Gonzalez fightback to march into his first grand slam final, where he will face either world number two Roger Federer or Argentine fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro on Sunday. Gonzalez was unlucky during the last two sets as many close calls went against him. Despite the setbacks, a fired up Gonzalez looked to have one foot in the final when he led 4-1 in the deciding set but was finally undone by a ripped forehand winner after three hours and 28 minutes of nail-biting action
