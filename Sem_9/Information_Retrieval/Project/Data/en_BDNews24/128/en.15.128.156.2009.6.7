 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain John Terry believes the best is yet to come from his team under coach Fabio Capello following the 4-0 win over Kazakhstan in Saturday's World Cup qualifier. England, who failed to qualify for Euro 2008, recorded a sixth consecutive qualifying victory in Group Six and are now seven points clear of Croatia with four matches to play, starting at home to Andorra on Wednesday. While Saturday's performance was far from fluent, particularly in a torrid opening half hour, Terry said England were beginning to gel. "I can assure you have not seen anything yet, there is far more to come from this team," Terry told reporters after the victory in the Central Stadium. "We are really relishing these games. There is a confidence about the side, a confidence that we are looking to maintain." Importantly, Terry believes the English public are finally back on board after a strained relationship with their national team during the ill-fated reign of Steve McClaren. "There were times when people were on our back a little bit and we took a lot of criticism, but we have ridden that out now and the fans are showing the appreciation of the football we are playing," Terry said. There is certainly a business-like look to England these days. Gone is the light-hearted training ground atmosphere often witnessed under McClaren and his predecessor Sven-Goran Eriksson. Capello, judging by his angry demeanour for much of the first half, is a far harder taskmaster and England's millionaire players seem to like his style. "The boss has stressed the importance of maintaining the high standard that we have set," Terry said. "We are working extremely hard, but we are not there yet. "We're in a good position, but taking nothing for granted. We've got Andorra at home, and they can sit back and make it difficult. If we can get the seventh win out of seven, it will be fantastic." Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard, who set up the first two goals in Almaty, said there is no danger of England getting complacent with qualification not yet sealed. "What we are all conscious about is qualifying for the World Cup. Missing out on the European championship was a massive blow," he told the FA's website. "It took the players a long time to get over it. "What we need to do is pay the fans back and qualify for the World Cup.
