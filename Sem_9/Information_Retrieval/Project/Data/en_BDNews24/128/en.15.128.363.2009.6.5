<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Dinara Safina moved one step closer to a maiden grand slam title on Thursday as she reached the French Open final with a 6-3 6-3 error-strewn victory over Slovak Dominika Cibulkova. The Russian, a finalist at Roland Garros last year, set up a showdown with compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova, the only player to have beaten her on clay this season. Safina struggled to find her range with her forehand against the 20th seed, but proved more efficient on the key points of the match, prevailing in most of the long rallies. The 23-year-old, who like her brother Marat has a tendency to lose her temper, kept her composure during most of the match barring a couple of minor outbursts. In a scrappy display she committed 24 unforced errors. However, Cibulkova did not seize her chances and failed to convert seven of her eight break opportunities. Now only one victory away from her first major title, Safina said she was getting nervous. "It was not an easy match, I struggled at the start. But it was good enough to win in two sets," said the Russian, who has had a sore throat for two days. "I was tense because I wanted to win so badly. Instead of dominating from the first point, I waited until (Cibulkova started to) dominate to start playing. I must change that." MORE TENSE "It's getting closer to the end and I really want to win it. I am more and more tense. I want to give everything I have inside myself." Cibulkova said she simply panicked on Centre Court. "I think I got nervous, I made a couple mistakes and then I got in a panic. "I would say that from my side it was really nervous tennis. It was really tough to play today out there. I wanted to play good tennis, but today I didn't make it mentally or tactically," the 20-year-old said. Cibulkova started confidently, breaking in the opening game as Safina sent a backhand long and followed it up on serve. Safina then won five games in a row, stealing her opponent's serve twice. She wasted three set points in the eighth game by hitting forehands long but bagged the first set on her serve on the fifth attempt when Cibulkova failed to control Safina's ripped forehand after 49 minutes. The Slovak, who has yet to win a singles title on the WTA tour, had two break points in the second game of the second set but threw them away with a forehand long and a backhand into the net. Safina blew a few opportunities in the third game and after a quick dispute with the umpire over a point, swore at herself and repeatedly tapped her head with her finger as she was changing ends. In the following game, as Cibulkova approached the net to check a mark, the Russian drew a large triangle around it with her racket. However, she broke decisively in the fifth when Cibulkova netted a backhand and then saved three more break points in the following game. Safina wrapped it up on the Slovak's serve on her second match point as Cibulkova sent another backhand into the net
