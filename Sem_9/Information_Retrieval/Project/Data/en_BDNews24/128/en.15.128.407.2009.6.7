<TITLE> Kuznetsova high on life after 'birth' of second slam </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Svetlana Kuznetsova wears the glow of a proud parent after securing her second grand slam title with a convincing French Open victory on Saturday. Five years after capturing the U.S. Open crown, the Russian was elated that she was able to push herself to win a second major but retains strong memories of her breakthrough success. "I can't compare because it's like parents having a second baby. One baby you are happy and second baby you are even more happier. It's just unbelievable," Kuznetsova told a couple of invited journalists after her straight sets win over fellow Russian Dinara Safina in the Roland Garros final. Luckily for Kuznetsova, her 'babies' will not give her any sleepless nights and neither will her lack of success at the All England Club. Despite enjoying a purple patch of form, Kuznetsova dismissed her chances of doing well at Wimbledon, which starts in just over two weeks. She has made it through to the quarter-finals in three of her six visits but said she did not feel at home on the slick surface. "I'm going to try and enjoy Wimbledon. I don't want to put any pressure on myself. I play great on clay, I can play good on grass but haven't done that," said Kuznetsova, who will turn 24 during the first week of the grasscourt major. "For me, adjusting is the most difficult thing. That's why I have to force myself and go and play at Eastbourne (the week before Wimbledon)." While her latest victim stands atop of the rankings despite not having won a slam, Kuznetsova said she had too much going on in her life to chase after the number one spot. "It's great if I achieve it but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't. I've won two grand slams and that's big. I'm just happy with my life, to enjoy it. I live a good life, I do my job which is my passion.
