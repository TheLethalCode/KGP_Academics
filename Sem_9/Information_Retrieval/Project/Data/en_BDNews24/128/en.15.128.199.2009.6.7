<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)Parliament's budget session resumed Sunday evening after a two-day break, with BNP continuing to abstain after a series of "unfruitful" meetings between the speaker and opposition chief whip. "We are not going today," BNP chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque told bdnews24.com before the House convened at 7.45pm. "BNP's parliamentary committee meeting next week will decide if we join during the budget session," he said. Farroque was speaking after two rounds of meetings with speaker Abdul Hamid on Sunday with a view to convincing the latter to give BNP two more front row seats on the left of the speaker, officials of the speaker's office said. The opposition chief whip said the meetings were "inconclusive". "They ended without any fruitful result," Farroque told reporters afterwards. "I urged [the speaker] again today to reconsider his decision and give us a respectable number of front row seats", he said. But he did not define "respectable number". Farroque said he would inform the BNP's parliamentary board meeting, which will take place some time this week. "You can assume that we are not going," Farroque said in reply to a question whether they would stay away from all parliamentary proceedings until the meeting was held. Speaker Hamid, meanwhile, had already made it clear that he would not be in a position to increase the BNP's front row seats by more than one, to give them five out of nine on the front bench to the left of the speaker's chair. But BNP has been holding out for seven front seats, a demand rejected by the ruling Awami League who say this would not be a proportional representation on the front benches as the main opposition party won only 30 of 300 seats in parliament. The budget session of the ninth parliament started on Thursday with the speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. The speaker adjourned the House on the same day following a condolence message at the death Sunamganj-1 MP Begum Mamotaj Iqbal. Finance minister AMA Muhith will place the budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year on June 11. The first session of the ninth parliament began on Jan 25. bdnews24.
