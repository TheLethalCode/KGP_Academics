<TITLE> Pakistan's comment on war crimes trials uncalled for: Shafiq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Trial of 1971 war crimes is an internal matter and Pakistan should refrain from negative comment, law minister Shafiq Ahmed said Sunday in a reaction to an observation from Islamabad that the trials may lead to a cooling of ties between the two countries. Such a comment by Pakistan violates norms of international relations, the law minister said. Masood Khalid, the additional secretary for Asia Pacific, told visiting Bangladeshi media in Islamabad on Saturday that war crimes trials in Bangladesh could "hamper ties" and "cast a shadow between the countries". "We should not remain frozen in time but should look forward," said Khalid, speaking on his country's reaction to Dhaka's latest move to try the crimes against humanity during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The law minister replied Sunday, "Each state has the right to try criminals on its own territory. We urge other countries not to interfere with our internal matters." "The Bangladesh government will try its own citizens, who committed crimes against humanity in 1971 in this country." "Pakistan has no say about this. They can't make any observation." The ruling Awami League, which led the independence war, has moved swiftly to try the Bangladeshi perpetrators of war crimes since they came to power in January. It has also demanded an apology for the killing of three million Bangladeshis and rape of 300,000 women by the Pakistan army during the bloody nine-month war. Foreign minister Dipu Moni told Pakistan high commissioner Alamgir Bashar Khan Babar on May 12 that his country must resolve the issue of an apology. But Pakistan does not acknowledge the scale of the killings and rapes. Its former president Gen Parvez Musharraf during his trip to Dhaka in July 2002 apologised to Bangladesh for "developments in 1971". Bangladesh on May 15 reiterated that Pakistan must apologise for the genocide it had committed in 1971, a day after a Pakistan foreign ministry official urged Dhaka to "let bygones be bygones". b
