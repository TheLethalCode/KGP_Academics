 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal has every reason to look forward to his side's opening Twenty20 World Cup match against defending champions India at 11pm BdST on Saturday. Tamim's 51 off 53 deliveries in Trinidad set up the run chase which eliminated India from the 2007 World Cup. His innings came just three days before his 18th birthday. Since then Tamim has consolidated his position in the team while knowing there should be more to come. In 50 overs internationals he has scored one century and eight fifties with a top score of 32 in nine Twenty20s. "I'm getting the starts but I need to go on and continue my innings longer," Tamim told Reuters. "I'm feeling confident and if I can bat for 15 overs against India I know it will be good for our team." Tamim, born and raised in Chittagong, will get all the support he requires from his family which has an impressive sporting pedigree. His father played professional soccer, his older brother Nafees has played test cricket for Bangladesh as has his uncle, Akram Khan, who was a batsman in the inaugural Bangladesh test side in 2000. Akram is one of the three national selectors and assisted with team practice session in Nottingham on Thursday. Positive Impact "Our family stayed together in the same building in Chittagong and I have watched Tamim develop since he was a kid," Akram told Reuters. "From age seven he was interested in (Sri Lanka's Sanath) Jayasuriya and tried to hit the ball like Jayasuriya, who was his hero. And as they are both left-handers the local guys used to compare them." Tamim's ambition to emulate Sri Lanka's highest-scoring and most aggressive batsman had a positive impact. His uncle saw him score 188 in a 50 overs competition, the sort of form that last month made him the highest earner in the domestic Twenty20 competition, banking $10,000 per match. The family's sporting culture was a significant factor in Tamim's development, Akram said, as they were always playing soccer or cricket. "Our home atmosphere is all about sports," Akram explained. "At midnight we may still be playing cricket outside under the lights on the balcony where we live. We stay close to Chittagong Stadium so when we get time we also go there to play sports." With fearlessness his trademark, it is little surprise that Tamim has lofty aspirations for his team in the World Twenty20, starting with India. He believes Bangladesh can cause an upset and achieve their target of making the semi-finals. "You shouldn't fear anyone in international cricket," he said. "If you fear an international team you cannot play this game. If we can play well and do what our plans demand, we can beat India. "We know we beat them at the last World Cup and that is a positive thing for us and will be in our min
