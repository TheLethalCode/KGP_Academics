<TITLE> Murray's clay dream crushed by Gonzalez </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Third seed Andy Murray was outclassed on his least favourite surface by Chile's Fernando Gonzalez on Tuesday, losing 6-3 3-6 6-0 6-4 in the French Open quarter-finals. Gonzalez tormented the Briton with his devastating forehand and was helped by Murray's easy misses as he booked a semi-final against Robin Soderling, the Swede who knocked out four-times champion and world number one Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. "I guess he's a better clay court player," Murray told a news conference. "But I still think I had my chances and didn't take them, and he came up with some big shots when he needed to. That's why he won, and he deserved to." Gonzalez said his more extensive claycourt experience had given him the upper hand. "Andy, I mean, he's a great player. But he doesn't have enough experience maybe playing five sets on clay courts," said the Chilean, who has won eight of his 11 titles on clay. "There is one thing I've always been convinced about, is that I win my matches with my serve and with my forehand. I can play well, but I win with those two shots, and that's what's happening at the moment." BEST FOREHAND The 12th-seeded Gonzalez broke in the eighth game before serving out the set and claiming it with one of his many forehand winners on his fourth set point. Murray said Gonzalez had the best forehand around. "His forehand is the biggest," he said. "He can hit huge forehand returns. He hits it great on the run. He can hit his forehand from anywhere on the court. "That's why it's very dangerous." Murray, who has never won a title on clay and was appearing in the Roland Garros last eight for the first time, levelled the match when the Chilean sent a forehand long, dropping his first set at these championships. The world number three, who has enjoyed his best claycourt season, seemed to lose concentration in the 24-minute third and gifted Gonzalez the set when he slammed a routine smash into the net. Gonzalez won on his first match point in the fourth when Murray's forehand hit the top of the net and the ball seemed to waver a second as if deciding which way to go before bouncing back towards him. Like everyone else in his quarter of the draw, Gonzalez had thought he would have to face Nadal in the semi-final before Soderling knocked the top seed out in the fourth round. "We all know Soderling, how he plays. Had someone told me I would reach the semi-final of a grand slam and I would have to play him, I don't know if I would have believed it," said Gonzalez
