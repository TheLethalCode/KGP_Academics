 PARIS, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A partisan crowd and a pumped-up opponent stand in the way of world number two Roger Federer and a fifth successive French Open semi-final on Wednesday. Local favourite Gael Monfils, gunning to become the first Frenchman to reach the final at Roland Garros since Henri Leconte in 1988, has been in impressive form despite a sore knee as he showed in a three-set dismantling of Andy Roddick in the fourth round.

Romanian teenager Sorana Cirstea will be first on Centre Court against Australian 30th seed Samantha Stosur. The women's quarter-final of the day will feature Russian seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova against American second seed Serena Williams, who is on a 18-match winning streak in grand slams. Argentine fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro takes on Spanish 16th seed Tommy Robredo in an all Latin quarter-fi
