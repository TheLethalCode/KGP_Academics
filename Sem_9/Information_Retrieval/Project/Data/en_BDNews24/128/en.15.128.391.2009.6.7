<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com)Food and disaster minister Abdur Razzaq on Sunday told parliament that the farmers were not getting fair prices of paddy. "I admit that the farmers are not getting fair prices. The middlemen are eating up a portion of the price we provide to the farmers," Razzaq told the House, replying to a question from a ruling party MP. The minister, however, contradicted Dabirul Islam who alleged that paddy was sold at Tk 360 per maund (35 kgs). "As per our information, it is about Tk 420, but it not up to our expectation," said the minister. He said the government procure paddy from the millers, not directly from the farmers due to its policy. "At this moment, we don't have any solution to this," he said. The minister said if the government could increase the capacity of the government silos, it would help farmers get better prices for their produces.
