<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has suggested passage of a bill that will require the finance minister to brief the parliament on budget implementation every three months. The parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry at a meeting on Sunday recommended the passage of the bill styled "Public Finance and Budget Management Bill, 2009". A H M Mustafa Kamal, chairman of the standing committee, said the bill would also make a provision for the finance minister to place budget projection for the next two fiscal years. "This is for the first time we are going to make such a provision to review the budget implementation," Kamal told reporters after the meeting. "The bill will be tabled and passed in the budget session," said Kamal, better known as Lotus Kamal. He said the finance ministry had sent the draft bill to the law ministry to examine whether it would contradict the constitution. "According to the new bill, the finance minister will have to make budget projections parliament for the next two fiscal years," said Kamal, a businessman turned MP. He, however, said this particular provision would come into effect from next fiscal year. The military-installed interim government of Fakhruddin Ahmed earlier made an ordinance having similar provisions. The ordinance was placed in parliament on Jan 25 as per the constitutional guidelines. But the government then decided not to pass the ordinance into law.
