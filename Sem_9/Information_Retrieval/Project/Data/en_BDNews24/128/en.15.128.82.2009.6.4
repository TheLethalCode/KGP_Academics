 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile phone users in the cyclone-prone district of Cox's Bazaar and flood-prone Sirajganj will receive advance disaster warnings over the next six months, in a pilot project that could be expanded countrywide. TeleTalk and Grameenphone subscribers in the two districts will see the alerts flashing automatically on their screens warning, said food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak on Thursday. He said, once introduced, the advance warning system would be a milestone in combating disaster in Bangladesh. The pilot project agreement was signed Thursday between the Disaster Management Bureau, state-owned TeleTalk and private operator Grameenphone. The minister commended the two companies for enacting corporate social responsibility in helping disadvantaged communities living in remote areas, who are most vulnerable to disasters. He encouraged all concerned to make the pilot project a success and expand the service countrywide. The Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme will eventually take up the project for expansion. Farhaduddin, director general of the Disaster Management Bureau, Raihan Shamsi, chief corporate officer of Grameenphone and Mojibar Rahman, managing director of TeleTalk, signed the MoUs for the pilot project. Food and disaster management secretary Mokhlesur Rahman and Grameenphone CEO Oddver Hesjedal were also present on the occasion. b
