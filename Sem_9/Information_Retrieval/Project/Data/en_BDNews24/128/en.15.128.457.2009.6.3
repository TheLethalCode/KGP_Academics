 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has ordered the government to report on what steps are being taken to stop illegal encroachment of rivers in and around Dhaka. The director generals of the department of environment and department of land and survey, and the BIWTA chairman, were asked to appear before the bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Mohammad Momtaz Uddin Ahmed on Thursday. The same bench had ordered the government on May 24 to take effective steps to stop encroachment of the rivers Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakhha. On a public interest writ petition of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, the bench ordered the government on the day to explain within a week why directives were not issued to evict illegal structures along the rivers. The secretaries of planning, environment, finance, local government, shipping and water resources, director generals of the department of environment and department of land and survey, chairman of BIWTA and deputy commissioners of Narayanganj and Gazipur were made respondents to the order. The High Court included Bangladesh Environment Lawyers' Association as a party in the hearing of the petition. Advocate Manzil Murshid appeared for the petitioner, while deputy attorney general Mustafa Zaman Islam represented the government. Drive on at Turag Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority did begin removing illegal structures on Wednesday, along the banks of the Turag. The clean-up aims to knock down around one hundred illegal structures, mostly built for commercial purposes, along an eight-kilometre stretch from Ashulia bridge to Tongi Bazar that are choking the river. "Fifty-nine structures were identified in Tongi Bazar alone through a survey done over the last one year," said Mahmudul Alam Alam, BIWTA director, carrying out the drive with Gazipur district administration. It will go on until the riverbank is rid of all illegal structures, he added. A two-storey mosque-based market and a three-storey fish market of Tongi municipality were razed to the ground while other buildings were partly demolished so that they cannot be rebuilt. People evacuated the buildings in orderly fashion, while owners did not put up any protest, with the issue of illegal encroachment of rivers being much highlighted in the media. Meheruddin, president of Tongi Bazar traders association, admitted that the mosque market was an illegal structure. The BIWTA director and Gazipur deputy commissioner Kamal Uddin Talukdar were at the scene. b
