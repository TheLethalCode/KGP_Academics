 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Tuesday asked the education ministry to ensure all madrasas play the national anthem, observe national days with due honour and hang portraits of Bangladesh's independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The parliamentary standing committee on the education ministry made the recommendations as some members pointed out that madrasas have a huge political influence on Islamic parties, many of which opposed Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971, said committee chairman Rashed Khan Menon. Besides, there have also been reports in the media that many madrasas do not observe national days such as Bangladesh's independence and victory days. Ministry officials told a meeting of the committee that there were over 16,270 madrasas or religion-based educational institutions in Bangladesh. The government provides them financial support for their administration including salaries and allowances. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid strongly supported the committee's recommendations and assured the watchdog that his ministry would strictly implement them, said Menon. He said committee member Abdul Wahab claimed only one out of 13 madrasas in his Keshobpur constituency played the national anthem. Chairman of the Madrasa Education Board Md Yousuf, also present at the meeting, said his board had already ordered all madrasas to play the national anthem regularly and observe national days or face tough action from the government. "But, as I have told the committee members, some madrasas do not follow the order." "Therefore, we have asked the local administration to give us a list of default madrasas so that the government can take action against them," Yousuf told bdnews24.com after the meeting. bd
