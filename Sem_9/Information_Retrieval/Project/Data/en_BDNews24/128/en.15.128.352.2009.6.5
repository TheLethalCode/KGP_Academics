<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 05 (bdnews24.com)The World Food Programme has said the high-protein biscuits manufactured for Bangladeshi children are "safe" for consumption. The WFP in a statement on Friday said the biscuits were safe "according to initial laboratory tests carried out by the Institute of Food Science and Technology, part of the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research". Last week over 400 school children in Khagrachhari district fell sick after eating the high-protein biscuits. The UN agency temporarily suspended the biscuit feeding programme after the reported sickness. "The test results were conducted on batches of high energy biscuits distributed to schools in Khagrachhari district on June 1 as part of the WFP's school feeding programme," said the statement. "The biscuit is not the cause of sickness," M Emamul Haque, the WFP's external relations head, told bdnews24.com on Friday. "The WFP experts at the organisation's Rome headquarters have therefore concluded that there is nothing to suggest that the fortified biscuits could have been harmful for school age children," the statement said. The WFP started its school-feeding programme in 2002 to supplement the protein shortage among the school children. The programme now goes on in 11 districts, according to Haque.
