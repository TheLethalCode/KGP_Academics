 Ahasan Lenin, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, June 05 (bdnews24.com)Toxic formalin to keep fishes and vegetables fresh, cadmium in rice, arsenic in water, insecticides in soft drinks and caustic soda in edible oil are some chemicals people of Dhaka consume. But sound pollution is another menace eating into them. Though there is a law to curb it, its implementation is scarcely visible. According to doctors, sound pollution causes deafness, heart disease, high blood pressure, headache and lack of concentration in children. Not only that, pregnant women exposed to a high level of sound pollution are also giving birth to abnormal infants. Children are the most affected and 95 percent of them are school-goers, according to statistics. According to experts, a three-year-old child may lose hearing ability if exposed to 100 decibels (unit of measuring the intensity of sound) of sound for over 30 minutes. Besides, high-decibel sound may cause heart attack. "The government alone cannot stop it. We will have to create social awareness through different activities in educational institutions," said Dr Shahnaz Haque Hussain, chairman of the Earth and Environmental Department of Dhaka University. Law-enforcing agencies should become aware to lessen the level of sound pollution in front of schools, colleges and hospitals, he said. Though the intensity of sound pollution is a bit less than before, it was still very high at places like Mohakhali and Farmgate, he added. According to the scale of Department of Environment, the acceptable levels of sound in silent zones are 45 decibels during the day and 35 decibels at night. In residential areas, the acceptable levels are 50 decibels during the day and 40 at night, in commercial areas, 60 and 50 decibels, and in mills and factories, it is 75 decibels during day and 70 at night. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the acceptable levels are, 30 to 40 decibels in office and classrooms, 20 to 35 decibels in hospitals, 40 to 60 decibels in restaurants and 45 decibels in urban areas. More than 60 decibels of sound makes sound pollution in an area, says WHO. It was revealed in a survey of Work for Better Bangladesh (WBB) that the maximum and minimum levels of sound in the city's Sayedabad Bus Terminal are 103 and 82 decibels, 105 to 76 decibels at Sadarghat, 105 to 88 decibels in Farmgate and 98 to 71 decibels in Viqarunnessa Noon School area. Another WBB survey shows the sound level is 104 decibels at Sonargaon Hotel, 103 in Mohakhali crossing, Mogbazar and Mouchak areas, 102 at Gabtoli, 100 in Jatrabari, 97 in Mirpur and Tejgaon industrial areas, 90 at Gulistan, 89 in Motijheel, 81 in BIRDEM Hospital area and 69 to 72 decibels in Shishu Hospital area. The survey did not find an area with less than 60 decibels of sound level in the city. "All the silent zones or residential areas of Dhaka have a sound level over 80 decibels and the main reason is car horn," said Naznin Kabir, a project officer at WBB. Car drivers, students and traffic personnel are the direct victims, she said. Though there are sets of laws to prevent sound pollution people do not know about them because of indifference and continue to suffer from freshly imported hydraulic horns. According to law-enforcing personnel, drivers commit the crime of unnecessary honking time and again as the level of fine is very low, Tk 100 to 500, prescribed in the automobile ordinance 1983. And the fact that the owners have to pay the fine makes the drivers hardly care. The other laws are environmental conservation law 1997 and Dhaka Metropolitan Police Law 1976. Meanwhile, government has forbidden honking in the 'VIP roads' of the city. The traffic department is executing the order by hanging big notice boards on these roads but drivers take little notice if any. Many do not even know there are such laws. The traffic department has banned use of all sorts of horns in a small area for experimentation. If it succeeds it will be replicated gradually in the entire city. At present, it is forbidden to honk from Shahbagh to Shaheed Jahangir Gate. Flaws in the drivers' registration process and lack of stern punishment are some reasons, said president of Poribesh Bachao Andolon Abu Naser Khan. Not only laws, awareness can lessen the sound pollution, he added. b
