 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand romped to a seven-wicket victory over Scotland in a rain-shortened Twenty20 World Cup group D match at the Oval on Saturday. The match was reduced to seven overs a side after steady morning rain and Scotland gave the Kiwis some anxious moments while compiling a competitive 89 for four. However, a flurry of sixes in the penultimate over from Jan Stander, two from successive balls by Ross Taylor (21 not out) and one from Scott Styris (eight not out), gave the New Zealanders victory with an over to spare. Brendon McCullum, captaining the side in place of Daniel Vettori who withdrew with an injured shoulder, slashed 18 from seven deliveries before he was run out to his obvious disgust after a mixup with Taylor Zimbabwe-born Ryan Watson (27 from 10 balls) got Scotland away to a flying start, hooking Ian O'Brien off the outside edge over the wicketkeeper for four. He took three further boundaries off the last three balls of the over. James Franklin went for 12 from his only over and even the accurate Jacob Oram conceded 21 from his two overs. Man-of-the-match Ian Butler finally brought some control to the bowling, with three for 19 from his two overs including two wickets from three balls
