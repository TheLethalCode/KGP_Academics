 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com) - The new admissions policy for SSC and equivalent examinees to colleges will be made final in the next week, the education minister said on Tuesday. The draft policy will be finalised with input from college principals, said Nurul Islam Nahid. He was speaking at a meeting with college principals at the National Academy of Education Management in the capital. Opinions were being elicited from principals at the meeting, and those who could not attend can send their opinions to ministry of education. The new policy will be based upon these, said Nahid. The draft policy retains the existing GPA-based admissions criteria for students applying to college, the minister had said on May 26 as SSC results were publsihed. But many college principals at Tuesday's meeting disagreed with continuing GPA-based admissions. Dr Siraj Uddin, principal of Dhaka College, said admissions should be made on the basis of marks instead of grades. Principal of Uttara Rajuk Model College ASM Mushfiqur Rahman said admissions could be made on the basis of entry tests as well as GPA. The Secondary School Certificate and equivalent exam results were published on May 26. The combined pass rate for ten boards was 70.89 percent. Some 62,307 students achieved GPA-5. b
