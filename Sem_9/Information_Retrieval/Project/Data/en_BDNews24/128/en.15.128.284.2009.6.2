Aila struck Bangladesh's coast on May 25, killing over 150 and causing huge losses to property and land. The southwest, where shrimp farmingone of Bangladesh's biggest earning industriesis concentrated, was hardest hit. In separate circulars Tuesday, Bangladesh Bank also ordered suspension of agro-loan recovery from farmers for the next year and wider expansion of corporate social responsibility by banks and financial firms. The three circulars were sent to chief executives of all government, private, and specialised banks, non-bank financial institutions as well as the chief of the Bangladesh Rural Development Board. The central bank said, in view of the devastation wrought by Aila, all banks have been directed to ensure smooth and timely disbursement of farm loans and all necessary action to prevent cyclone-affected farmers from being unduly harassed for repayments.
