<TITLE> Tigers face must-win situation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will want to overlook their 2007 World Cup setback against Ireland when they take on the Irish in a must-win Group A final encounter of the ICC World Twenty20 at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on Monday. After a 25-run drubbing against India, the Tigers have to ensure nothing goes wrong against Ireland, a team comprising of county cricketers to keep their Super Eight hopes alive. Remembering that nightmare at Barbados, Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful said, "It was a match we were too anxious to win I guess because we thought that if we didn't then all our good work in that tournament will be ruined." Bangladesh suffered a massive 74-run defeat against the Irish, chasing a competitive 243-7 and the Bangladesh captain thinks the situation is not the same here and the players are very confident. "We brought pressure on ourselves with the fear of losing to a team below us. But that's not the case here. The players are very confident and I have not seen the fear-factor in this side on this trip. They have good players, people with county cricket experience but we are up for anything," Ashraful was quoted as saying by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. The Tigers kept the momentum against India until Yuvraj Singh came in the middle to blaze an 18-ball 41 to take the match away from Bangladesh, who were also in pace until Junaed Siddique and Shakib Al Hasan fell to Pragyan Ojha in an over of the eighth over. Ashraful believed that Bangladesh had a genuine chance of beating India, but little mistakes by them turned the game in favour of India. "There were little mistakes we made that turned the game in India's favour. We always thought that 181 was gettable on that track but we lost too many wickets inside the first 10 overs. "We don't have power hitters in the middle and later order like India and therefore the start was important. We did get the start but when I got out and Shakib (Al Hasan) and Junaed followed it was a difficult chase from there on," said Ashraful, who, however, was pleased with the fielding and bowling except one over each from Naeem Islam and Rubel Hossain. Shakib, world's number one all-rounder, also echoed the sentiments of his captain. "We just needed one of the top four batters to carry on after we got the platform. I thought the turning points in the game was the stumping chance missed when Yuvraj Singh was on naught and then in batting when I got out and Zunaed (Siddique) also fell in the same over," said Shakib. The left-handed batsman is also confident to make it to the Super Eights. "I have no doubt that if we play our natural game then we should not have any problems beating Ireland." Coach Jamie Siddons rued the missed opportunity against India. "When Ashraful and Zunaed were batting we only needed 8 an over. But we still went for sixes and got out. We could have pushed them even harder," said Siddons. Bangladesh have an injury worry over left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who did not make the team against India. Razzak, who had suffered a back strain during a gym session on Saturday, was feeling much better according to Tigers physio Michael Henry. And, Bangladesh may bring one change in the squad that played against India with Razzak likely to replace pacer Shahadat Hossain. The weather has not got only gloomier in Nottingham and it had rained continuously since last evening. The forecast is for a clearer sky on Monday but locals here are keeping their fingers crossed, according to tigercricket.com. The Bangladesh team could not train outdoors at Lady Bay because of the wet conditions and instead opted for practice at the National Cricket Academy's indoor facilities at Loughborough which is the largest such centre in the world. The match is scheduled to start at 1:30pm local time (6:30pm Bangladesh Standard Time). bd
