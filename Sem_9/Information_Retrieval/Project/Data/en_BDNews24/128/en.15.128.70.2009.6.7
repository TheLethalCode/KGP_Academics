<TITLE> New army chief Mubeen to get 4 stars </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com)Lieutenant general Md Abdul Mubeen, appointed new army chief, will be promoted to the rank of general with effect from June 15 when he takes office, the defence ministry said in a statement Sunday. Mubeen's three-year tenure succeeds that of General Moeen U Ahmed, who goes on retirement from June 15 on completion of an extended term, said the ministry. A former GOC in Jessore and Chittagong, Mubeen was made Principal Staff Officer to the Armed Forces Division a year ago, on June 4 2008, in a major reshuffle of top army posts. He also came to the fore giving a well-received televised statement on the night of Feb 27 to clarify that the government's announcement of a 'general amnesty' during the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny did not mean that mutineers involved in killings, arson and other crimes would go unpunished. Moeen U Ahmed is widely regarded as having had a key role in the '1/11 takeover' and formation of the new caretaker government after a state of emergency was imposed Jan 1 2007 during a period of extreme political turmoil. On April 6 last year, Moeen's term was extended by another year. The extension took effect from June 15 that year. Mubeen, meanwhile, served as the coordinator of the national coordination committee against corruption during the caretaker government's antigraft drive against top politicians and businessmen.
