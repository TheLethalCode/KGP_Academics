The 19-year-old Romanian seemed more daunted by the occasion than Stosur and failed to find a breakthrough despite finding herself 0-40 on Stosur's serve in the second game of the second set. Her chance missed, the world number 41 dropped her serve the following game and Stosur held her nerve to set up a last-four date either with world number two Serena Williams or Russian seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova
