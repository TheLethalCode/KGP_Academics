<TITLE> Bashar, Mashud make case for Tigers' victory </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Former Bangladesh captains Habibul Bashar and Khaled Mashud believe it is not wrong for Bangladesh to assume a place in the Super Eights is unachievable. And they are confident the Tigers can take a giant step by upsetting defending ICC World Twenty20 champions India on Saturday. Bashar and Mashud's simple argument is that by definition anything can happen in a Twenty20 match so that will suit Bangladesh who are capable of beating top rated side on their day. "It seems an uneven battle between Bangladesh and India, but we all saw what happened in the 2007 World Cup. The Twenty20 format strongly suggests no such uneven battle that is why Bangladesh have the ability to beat champions India this time too," said Bashar, who led Bangladesh in that 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Mashud, however, thinks the Indians have gained much confidence after the IPL, but the format of newest version game really went with Bangladesh. "Look, why we are going down in international cricket? It is only for lack of patience as the batsmen likes to play more shots instead of leaving the ball and the Twenty20 format needs no such patience. So it is possible to beat India," said the former wicketkeeper. Mashud thinks the batsmen have to lay the foundation so that the bowlers could find something to bowl at. "If the batsmen can do well, Bangladesh will win. I want to especially mention the spinners, who have the ability to seal a victory if they are given a good total on the board to defend it," said Mashud. "I think it would not be wise to play eight batsmen because it is a Twenty20 game so the lower-order batsmen hardly get to bat and that's why genuine bowlers are needed in the starting line-up." Bashar suggests shrugging off the pressure before taking to the field. "I am impressed in the way the guys played in the warm-up games and I will suggest them to show same mentality in Saturday's match and they should remember we can beat India," said Bangladesh's most successful batsman in Test cricket. Both captains, however, thought that putting on 160-170 runs on the board would be enough to defend it as well as it would be easier to reach the target if India were restricted to 150. They also opined that it would be wise to bat first after winning the toss if there was no movement as well as gloomy weather in Nottingham. bd
