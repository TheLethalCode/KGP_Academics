 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) - After fighting it out boldly in two serious practice games against Australia and Sri Lanka in Nottingham the confidence is high in the Bangladesh camp as they prepare for the first match of the ICC World T20 against India on June 6. Faced with the mammoth task of making 220 against Australia the Tigers were on course halfway through the chase before the asking rate got too stiff. Tuesday they had Sri Lanka in trouble following an inspired spell of bowling before going down with two balls to spare. "Our preparation has gone well so far I think. We have beaten the sides below us (Holland and Scotland) and we ran New Zealand, Australia and Sri Lanka very close. We fought all the way and created winning situations. This has boosted our confidence," said all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan who called for a better effort in the field. "Against Sri Lanka we did not bat well but the bowling brought us back in the game. We were in fine batting form against Australia and were going at 10 an over for most part. Our fielding has not been up to the mark yet so we need to work on that. It is a bit windy in England and we I think we have to adjust to that when we field," Shakib was quoted as saying by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Shakib had fantastic bowling figures of 4-0-18-2 against Sri Lanka which pulled the game back for Bangladesh and had been quite consistent with the bat so far. But the world's number one all-rounder in ODIs wasn't prepared to sit on laurels. "Twenty20 is still a new format for me and I have not played that many games. I have done well in ODIs but we'll see how it goes in this tournament. The practice matches give us indication of where we are and I have made a few runs and taken wickets. So I am going into this tournament very confident," said Shakib who also thought the competition provided a good opportunity for players in the Bangladesh side to show their worth. "You can say that we don't receive as much attention as players of some other countries but I never think in that line. For me every game is a chance to show the world what you can do. We have some exciting talents in this squad and good performances for the team will raise their profile. That is an incentive." Meeting India in the first match of the group would surely bring back memories of the 2007 World Cup game at Port of Spain where Bangladesh won by 5 wickets and subsequently knocked India out of the competition but Shakib was more focused on getting the process right for the clash. "Yes, we do talk about that match and it lifts us no doubt. However, this is a totally different format and conditions are different. We have to field well to win matches and get the batting and bowling plan right. How we prepare is very important." The Bangladesh team had no cricket practice today. The players signed bats and appeared for the profile recording for the official broadcasters in the morning before heading for a gym session.
