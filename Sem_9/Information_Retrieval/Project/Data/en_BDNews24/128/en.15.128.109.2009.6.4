 Dhaka, June 04 (bdnews24.com)--The main opposition BNP has hinted at their absence from the House on the first day of the budget session, set to start at 3pm Thursday, as the dispute over front bench seats remains unresolved after four months. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque told reporters Thursday noon, "We will decide at BNP's parliamentary board meeting which will take place any day next week." "We hope the speaker will take necessary measures to implement his previous pledge of a respectable number of seats for the opposition on the front row," he said. "You can figure it out," Farroque said when asked whether the BNP was staying away from Thursday's opening session. BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain has accused the government of 'dangling a carrot' in the ongoing seat dispute in parliament. "The ruling party is saying that another seat 'may' be given to the opposition," said Delwar on Wednesday. "They are only dangling a carrot in the name of solving the seat distribution problem." "In fact, they do not want the opposition in parliament," claimed Delwar. Only one more Speaker Abdul Hamid has made it clear that the BNP will get only one more front-row seat in parliament, two fewer than the main opposition party requested. With this BNP would have five front-row seats although the party has demanded seven out of the total nine on the front row to the left of the speaker's chairknown as the 'opposition bench'. "I cannot give them more than one seat in the front row," Hamid told reporters on Wednesday at his office. Dispute drags on The ruling Awami League and the main opposition BNP have been unable to settle the seat row since the new parliament convened in January. At present, the BNP has four front row seats on the row facing the treasury bench, the Liberal Democratic Party has one, and the others on the row belong to the AL-led ruling coalition members.
