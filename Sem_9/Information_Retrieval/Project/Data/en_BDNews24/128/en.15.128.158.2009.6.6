<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Police are set to question Brahmanbaria municipal mayor Hafizur Rahman Mollah for aiding Indian fugitive Abdur Rauf Merchant, caught hiding out in the district last month, to obtain a false passport. The Detective Branch police will seek seven more days to grill Abdur Rauf, better known as Dawood Merchant, to delve deeper into possible links between Bangladesh and the Mumbai underworld, said a police official on Saturday. Abdur Rauf, along with associates Zahid Sheikh and Kamal Miah will be produced in court on Sunday, Mahbub Alam, DB additional deputy police commissioner, told bdnews24.com. "Much crucial information has been extracted from them during their eight-day remand that ends tomorrow (Sunday)," he said. "We need more time to interrogate them further on the basis of these pieces of information." Merchant was remanded into police custody on May 29 following his arrest in Brahmanbaria. Fellow Indian Zahid was arrested from the capital's Adabor area and Bangladeshi Kamal in Brahmanbaria, under the Foreigners Act and Passport Act for sheltering the Indian fugitive and furnishing him with a false passport. Police say Merchant, convicted in 2001 for the murder of music mogul Gulshan Kumar, came to Bangladesh on orders from Mumbai 'mafia don' Daud Ibrahim. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner ASM Shahidul Islam told reporters after the arrest last month that Ibrahim had sent Merchant to Bangladesh to extend his criminal network beyond India. Alam said on Saturday names of Bangladeshi contacts had been extracted from them in questioning. "Some of these contacts may have developed ties with Daud Ibrahim in Mumbai through them," he said. "Most have now gone into hiding," he added. "However, we believe we are closing in one or two who will be arrested within a very short time," the deputy police commissioner said. Police have also questioned four other people in connection with Merchant's arrest, including a woman friend of Zahid and a Brahmanbaria municipal councillor. Brahmanbaria municipal mayor Hafizur Rahman Mollah will also be questioned on Monday. On the councillor's recommendations, the mayor certified Merchant for procuring a Bangladeshi passport. Merchant began serving his sentence in 2002. After serving eight years and four months, he was released in April this year on a 14-day furlough to see his ailing mother, in Mumbra, a small town about 40 km from Mumbai, but was reported absconding by Indian police earlier this month. Merchant has denied any link with Ibrahim. He told reporters at his remand hearing that he had fled his country fearing he would be shot dead in an 'encounter' with Indian law enforcers. He also claimed he was innocent and had no role in the 1997 murder of Kumar. He said he had been falsely implicated and 'trapped' in the case. Gulshan Kumar, renowned owner of Indian music company T-series, was shot dead on the streets of Mumbai on Aug 12, 1997. He was believed to have been murdered by contract after refusing to pay extortion money to gangsters. b
