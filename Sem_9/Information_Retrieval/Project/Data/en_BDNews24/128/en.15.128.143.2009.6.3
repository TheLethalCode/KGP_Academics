 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)A proposed new TV channel to air all parliamentary proceedings live has been approved for launch, said speaker Abdul Hamid on Wednesday. "The proposal has been approved by the parliament commission," Hamid told reporters after the commission met. "Anyone, including private TV channels, will be able to record parliamentary footage from the channel," said Hamid. The parliament secretariat made the proposal as private TV stations are not allowed in to the building to film. The speaker said the new channel would have terrestrial facilities so that all people across the country could view parliament live. He said the state-run BTV would provide technical support to launch the new channel. "We will start the process as soon as possible," he said. Hamid presided over the commission meeting attended by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, ministers and a representative from the main opposition BNP. The parliament commission approves all spending by parliament.
