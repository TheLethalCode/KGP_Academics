 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu was detained by police on Tuesday, being accused of helping BDR mutineers to flee the scene during the Feb 25-26 armed uprising. He was picked up as he emerged from the High Court after seeking a 'no arrest or harassment' order in the mutiny case. The BNP leader appeared before the bench of justices Tarikul Hakim and Azizul Haq at 3pm. The hearing ended around 4pm, and he was arrested about an hour later as he tried to leave by the High Court mazar gate, rather than the front entrance. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner AKM Shahidul Haq said Pintu was arrested by Detective Branch police on charges of abetting mutineers to escape from the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. "He will be handed over to Criminal Investigation Department as CID is investigating the case," said Haq. Pintu had submitted a petition to the court after his name appeared in the national enquiry committee's report on the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The probe report stated: "Some civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river." Thousands of border guards, guilty and innocent among them, fled the Peelkhana compound in the chaos of the mutiny and its aftermath. While most reported back to duty in the days that followed, authorities have spent months rounding up fugitives. After the government made its report public at the end of May, Pintu, fearing he would be taken into custody in connection with the case, petitioned the High Court for a 'no arrest or harassment' order. The bench gave no ruling on the plea Tuesday. 'Motivated' BNP termed Pintu's detention 'motivated' and demanded his unconditional release. "The government's arrest of Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu in the horrifying BDR killings is a conspiracy. It is a part of the government's control mechanism," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said in a statement Tuesday evening. He said the government had dishonoured the High Court by allowing police to pick Pintu up from the court premises. "His brother-in-law (Mainur Rahman Opu) has also been arrested under the false pretenses of the government," said Delwar. He claimed that the government was trying to harass Pintu's family and relatives in various ways. "The autocratic stance adopted by the coalition government to stay in power will bring no good result," said the BNP leader. bdne
