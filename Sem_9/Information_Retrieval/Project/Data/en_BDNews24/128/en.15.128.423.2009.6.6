 PARIS, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer said experience helped him survive the second five-set thriller of his 2009 French Open campaign as he battled past Argentine Juan Martin del Porto in the semi-finals on Friday. The Swiss was one set from defeat when he rediscovered his touch to beat the fifth seed 3-6 7-6 2-6 6-1 6-4 and set up a final against Sweden's surprise package Robin Soderling. The 20-year-old Del Potro, who dictated the play early in the match with his devastating forehand, eventually crumbled under relentless pressure from the world number two. "I definitely feel more confident against a younger player," the 27-year-old Federer told a news conference. "I remember when I was younger going to a fifth set is always a bit uneasy, just because you haven't been there that much. You're hoping so much to play well, and I think in a fifth set you can't just start hitting crazy shots. "There are much more mental and physical things that come into a match like this. Obviously, at this age I do feel better going into a fifth set than I did before," he added. MORE INFORMATION Before this year, Federer had not been pushed to a fifth set at Roland Garros since he edged out Armenia's Sargis Sargsian 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 9-7 in the second round in 2001. He has since matured and knows how to weather the storms. "Today with experience, I'm older, I've got more information, I know what I can do physically and mentally. "So it's simpler for me today than in the past, even though of course it is a fight," said the Swiss, who now has a 15-12 record in five-set encounters. "A five-set match is a test. When there are tough moments, quarter-finals, semi-finals, finals, when it's a five-set match, that's when you can find the answers you need to find." Del Potro appeared lost on Centre Court as his first serve percentage dropped in the closing stages of the contest. "It was the whole match that fell upon my shoulders. I was feeling tired and tense. That's why I didn't put those first serves in," a dejected Del Potro said. "If it had been in the best of three sets, I would have won and I would have come out of that court satisfied. "Right now, I don't have enough words to explain what I feel. That match just escaped me.
