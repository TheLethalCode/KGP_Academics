 NEW DELHI, Wed Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said on Wednesday it was looking to normalise relations with Islamabad through diplomatic channels and was closely monitoring developments in Pakistan, a day after angrily reacting to the release of a militant leader. "India will work through the diplomatic channels to pursue the objective of bringing about normalcy in our relationship with Pakistan," Foreign Minister Somanahalli Mallaiah Krishna told reporters in New Delhi. The release of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the founder of an outlawed militant group Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) charity, accused of an assault on the Indian city of Mumbai in November, had angered India on Tuesday.

"India would probably have begun talking to Pakistan sooner, if Saeed was not released," Amulya Ganguli, a political commentator, said in New Delhi. "One must understand that there is also huge pressure on India from the United States to resume the dialogue," he told Reuters. India's mammoth April/May general election also diverted politicians from attention to the Pakistan issue. "What the foreign minister said today was expected, ever since the election got over, the Indian side has been looking to review their whole Pakistan policy," said Siddharth Varadarajan, strategic affairs editor of the Hindu newspaper. "The longer you suspend the dialogue, the greater are chances of pressure on you, rather than Pakis
