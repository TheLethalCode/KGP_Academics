 ALMATY, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's 7,000-mile round journey to Kazakhstan produced an emphatic 4-0 victory on Saturday to leave Fabio Capello's side in sight of qualifying for next year's World Cup finals in South Africa. The trip was ultimately a comfortable one although England endured a scary ride before goals from Gareth Barry and Emile Heskey just before halftime settled their nerves. A 2-0 interval lead flattered the visitors but they improved after the break with Wayne Rooney's hooked shot and Frank Lampard's penalty finishing off their lowly-ranked opponents who arguably played the game's better football. England's victory means they have won six out of six in Group Six, topping the table comfortably with 18 points from Croatia (11), Belarus (9) and Ukraine (8). Victory over the group's whipping boys Andorra at Wembley on Wednesday will sign off an encouraging season for Capello's England before they return in the autumn to put what they hope will be the finishing touches to their qualification campaign with games against Croatia, Ukraine and Belarus. "It wasn't easy to play here, the pitch wasn't fast like English pitches and it made passing very hard," Capello told Setanta Sport. "They started strong, pressed a lot, and for us it was difficult, but that's sometimes what happens when you play against a team who aren't at the same level. It's another big step forward to qualification." LITTLE JUSTICE England beat Kazakhstan 5-1 at Wembley in October, a scoreline that did little justice to the relative newcomers to the European football family. For 40 minutes in the Central Stadium on Saturday they again matched a side 126 places higher up the FIFA rankings. They could have taken a shock lead after 20 seconds when England right back Glenn Johnson was caught out and Sergey Ostapenko was inches away from converting a low cross. After 17 minutes Ostapenko, who went off injured before halftime, rose to power a header into the net from a free kick but England were saved by a marginal offside flag. England had barely got out of first gear and it was something of a surprise when Barry headed a Steven Gerrard cross into the net five minutes before the break for the softest of opening goals. Kazakhstan's sense of injustice increased in first-half stoppage time when a lofted ball from Gerrard was misjudged by home keeper Alexandr Mokin and he could only palm it to the waiting Heskey who punished his error. The Kazakhs were less of a threat after the break and Rooney hooked a third goal over his shoulder after 73 minutes after Mokin had stopped the Manchester United striker's first effort with a great save. Lampard then lashed England's fourth from the spot after Heskey had been pulled down in the area. "Normally when you lost 4-0 against England you are a little bit disappointed. But now I am satisfied with the game, with my team," Kazakhstan's German coach Bernd Storck said. David Beckham came on for a late cameo performance to the delight of the 20,000 crowd but the only remaining talking point was a Kazakh pitch invader who was wrestled to the ground by four policemen inside England's area
