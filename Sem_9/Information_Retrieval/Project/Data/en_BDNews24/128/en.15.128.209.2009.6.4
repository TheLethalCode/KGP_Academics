<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 04 (bdnews24.com)  The government is moving to close legal loopholes in order to shift the toxic tannery industry out of Hazaribagh in the heart of the city, said state minister for environment Mostafizur Rahman on Thursday. "We are facing obstacles due to weak spots in environmental laws," said Rahman at a press conference on the eve of World Environment Day. The government has committed Tk 500 crore to moving the sprawl of tannery houses, which daily dump gallons of lethal chemicals into the Buriganga river, to a regulated industrial zone beyond the city. But factory owners are obstructing the process by filing spurious cases in court, he said. "The government will take effective steps after amending the law," said the minister. Environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumder said the proposed amendments had already been submitted to the law ministry. Director general of the Department of Environment Mizanur Rahman was also present at the press conference. 'Your planet needs you' World Environment Day, with the slogan 'Your Planet Needs You: Unite to Combat Climate Change', will be observed across the country on Friday (June 5). With Bangladesh being one of the most vulnerable countries in the face of climate change, four separate environmental awards for conservation, prevention of pollution, research and technology and awareness building will be given on the day. "The awards will be distributed to encourage public and private institutes and individuals to work for protecting the environment," said Rahman. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will hand out the awards at the Osmani Auditorium at the start of a two-day environmental programme. The programme includes a rally and special radio and television broadcasts. b
