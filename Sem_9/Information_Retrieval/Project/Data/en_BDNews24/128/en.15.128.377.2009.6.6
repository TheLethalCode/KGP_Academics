 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha claimed four scalps to steer India to a convincing 25-run victory over Bangladesh in the ICC World Twenty20 Group A opener at Trent Bridge in Nottingham on Saturday. Bangladesh ended up with 155-8, chasing India's challenging total of 180-5 mainly due to an 18-ball 41-run knock from Yuvraj Singh. The Tigers, with hopes of ensuring the Super Eight berths in the first match, had started on the wrong foot when opener Tamim Iqbal went down the wicket against Yusuf Pathan in the third over to see Mahendra Singh Dhoni break the stumps for 15. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful (11) cover drove Ishant Sharma only to see Gautam Gambhir took an unbelievable low catch to make Bangladesh to 55-2 in 5.2 overs. Ojha then had started to wave his magic to claim four batsmen  Shakib Al Hasan (8), Junaed Siddique (41 off 22 balls), Mahmudullah Riad (8) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (11)  in a row to reduce Bangladesh to 111-6 in 14.4 overs. Later, Roqibul Hasan and Naeem Islam chipped in with 16 and 28 respectively to just reduce the margin. Naeem struck three sixes in his 17-ball knock. Earlier, a late blitz from Yuvraj helped India recover from a slow start to post a competitive total on the board. Yuvraj's smacked 41 off 18 balls studded with four sixes and three fours after Gambhir struck a well-composed 50 off 46 balls with the help of four boundaries. After struggling against Shakib in the 16th over, Yuvraj cut loose on Naeem Islam with his seemingly effortless shots that included three sixes and in the next over the left-handed batsman blunted quick Rubel Hossain to have smashed 6, 4 and 4 before holing out at mid-off to Shakib off Shahadat Hossain. Without explosive opener Virender Sehwag, India got off to a fine start with Gambhir and Rohit Sharma adding 59 runs in 7.2 overs before Shakib made the first breakthrough for Bangladesh in his first over. Rohit was looking dangerous when Shakib thought he had him stumped with his first ball but wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahman missed the opportunity. However the left-arm spinner picked Rohit up with the next delivery. Rohit blazed a 23-ball 36 that included three fours and two sixes. However, Bangladesh had to pay the price for dropping Gambhir, who was dropped on 13 by Roqibul Hasan at backward point off Shahadat first delivery and the left-handed opener finally struck a fifty. Dhoni played a 21-ball 26 before being bowled by Naeem Islam who returned 2-32 in three overs while Shakib, Rubel and Shahadat took one wicket apiece. Bangladesh will face Ireland in their group final match on Monday. bd
