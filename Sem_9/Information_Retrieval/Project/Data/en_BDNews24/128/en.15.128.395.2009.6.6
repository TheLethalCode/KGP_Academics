 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The absence of the main opposition party in parliament was a major cause for concern at a meeting of the ruling party's central working committee, said Awami League spokesman and cabinet member Syed Ashraful Islam on Saturday. "The government wants to make parliament effective by working with the opposition," said Ashraful. "The issue was much discussed in the meeting, and we request BNP to return," he said. The opposition party on Thursday skipped the opening day of parliament's second session, the crucial budget session, due to a seating dispute that has remained unresolved since the new parliament convened in January. Ashraful was speaking to reporters after the CWC's four-hour meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, at the party's Dhanmondi office. Asked about the much-highlighted Tipaimukh Dam issue, the minister said decisions would be based upon opinions from water resources experts and recommendations of the standing committee on the water resources ministry. Ashraful also quoted the prime minister as saying trial of the BDR mutineers would start very soon. He said the meeting touched on the many issues that arose during the AL-led government's first five months in power. He also mentioned that the party's 60th founding anniversary falls on June 30. bdn
