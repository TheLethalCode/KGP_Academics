 PARIS, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If Slovak Dominika Cibulvoka is counting on world number one Dinara Safina to lose her cool during their French Open semi-final on Friday, she could be in for a big surprise. The Russian whacked the geranium display on Roland Garros's Centre Court with her racket several times last year but she has since matured, as she showed by keeping her composure when under pressure in her quarter-final match against Victoria Azarenka. Safina is favourite to set up an all-Russian final against seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, who will face Australian Samantha Stosur in the second semi-final, and credited a change of attitude for her success. "It's good that I managed to change it. I knew this was my weakness, and I dealt with it. That's why I managed such a big jump," last year's finalist Safina told reporters after overcoming the Belarussian's challenge. Kuznetsova, the only player to have beaten Safina on clay this season, dismissed claims she would be the favourite against Australia's Stosur. "I give her the advantage as she had short match today," the Russian said referring to Stosur's 6-1 6-3 win over Romanian teenager Sorana Cirstea. "I'm looking forward to playing Sam. She plays good. She wouldn't have any pressure tomorrow because she has nothing to lose. But I don't want to put myself as the favourite.
