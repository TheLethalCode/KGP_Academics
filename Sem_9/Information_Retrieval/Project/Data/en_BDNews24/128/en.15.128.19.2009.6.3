 RIYADH, Wed Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks with King Abdullah on Wednesday on the eve of a much-anticipated speech in Cairo the US leader hopes will help repair America's damaged image in the Islamic world. After an airport welcome in Riyadh, Obama traveled to King Abdullah's farm where the two men were to hold talks expected to cover the Arab-Israeli conflict, US overtures to Iran and oil.

Obama cautioned against expecting too much from the speech, which he said was just the first step in opening a broader dialogue with the Muslim world. "After all, one speech is not going to transform very real policy differences and some very difficult issues surrounding the Middle East and the relationship between Islam and the west," Obama said. Washington hopes Saudi Arabia will play a moderating role in OPEC against price hawks such as Iran after oil prices hit a seventh-month high, threatening prospects of global economic recovery. Saudi Arabia and the United States have a near 60-year-old relationship based on guaranteeing oil supplies in return for US protection for the Saudi monarchy.
