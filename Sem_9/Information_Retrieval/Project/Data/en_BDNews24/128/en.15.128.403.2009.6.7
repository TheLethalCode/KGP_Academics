 SAN SALVADOR, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico's World Cup hopes were dealt another crushing blow with a 2-1 defeat in El Salvador on Saturday, a late penalty ruining Javier Aguirre's second debut as coach for the visitors. Salvadorean playmaker Eliseo Quintanilla fired home the 86th minute spot-kick that relegated Mexico to fifth place in the six-team final stage of CONCACAF qualifiers. Earlier, recalled striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco, persuaded to return by Aguirre after announcing his international retirement under previous coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, had given Mexico hope with an equaliser from another penalty. The Mexicans have three points from four games although four of their final six fixtures are at home. El Salvador, whose last World Cup appearance was in 1982, moved up to third on five points. The top three teams qualify directly for South Africa and the fourth plays off against the fifth South American team for another place. Former Atletico Madrid coach Aguirre pulled Mexico out of a similar predicament during his first stint in charge of the team in 2001. Aguirre had promised a new attitude to improve on Mexico's dismal away record and they made a promising start as Andres Guardado's header forced an early save from Miguel Montes and Fernando Arce fired over from a good position. But El Salvador went ahead in the 11th minute when Rodolfo Zelaya's cross found Julio Martinez, who drilled the ball past Oscar Perez. Both goalkeepers were called into action before Mexico equalised in the 71st minute. Guillermo Franco was judged to have been pushed in the penalty area and Blanco, who said he was quitting Mexico after last year's 2-1 win over Canada, stepped up to equalise. Mexico's relief was short-lived as Oscar Rojas was judged to have handled in the penalty area and Quintanilla gave El Salvador a memorable win
