 Mymensingh, June 05 (bdnews24.com)A bomb went off at Binnakuri of Muktagachha Upazila early on Friday, injuring a woman and her son. Zarina Khatun, 35, and son Zahid Hasan, 9, were admitted to Mymensingh Medical College with wounds in the lower parts of their legs. Zarina said she was sleeping along with her two sons and suddenly woke up at the sound of a blast at around 3am to see the entire room filled with smoke. Hearing her scream, other people of the house rescued them. The other son was fine, she added. "We are trying to find out whether they themselves detonated the bomb or some other people attacked them," Major Amin of RAB-9 told bdnews24.com. On Mar 6, 2006, Siddiqul Islam Bangla Bhai, the military commander of banned Islamist group Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, was arrested from that area of Muktagachha. bdnews
