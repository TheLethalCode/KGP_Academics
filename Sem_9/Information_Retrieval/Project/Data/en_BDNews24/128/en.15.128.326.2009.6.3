 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Work has started to repair Aila-hit embankments, food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq said on Tuesday. A committee of army, Water Development Board and local officials has begun work on the hundreds of kilometers of damaged flood-protection structures along the coast that was hit by cyclone last week, said the minister. The government has allocated Tk 116 crore in the first phase of repair work, estimating the total cost at Tk 430 crore, said Razzaq. It has also identified illegal lifting of sand through dredging under embankments as a reason for weakening of embankments. Steps will be taken against those engaged in such activities, the minister said. More cyclone shelters "We are also undertaking to double the number of cyclone centres in coastal areas, now about 2,200," said the minister. The undertaking would need foreign assistance to the tune of about Tk 4000 crore. "Along with immediate aid, the government is working to collect this money. A meeting will be held with donors on June 4 in this regard," he said. Food aid Authorities have also released 25,000 tonnes of rice worth Tk 75 crore for food aid in the cyclone-hit south, said Razzaq. Every cyclone-hit family is getting 20 kg rice. Besides, Tk 5,000 would be given to reconstruct houses at the preliminary stage of the rehabilitation programme. As regards irregularities in relief distribution, the minister said, "The responsibility of relief distribution lies with the representatives of the local government." "Some irregularities may take place. But the government has been working to minimise them." In the meantime, the cabinet has given four advisers and ministers the responsibility to oversee relief distribution, reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes, he said. "One official of the disaster management ministry will work with each of them". bd
