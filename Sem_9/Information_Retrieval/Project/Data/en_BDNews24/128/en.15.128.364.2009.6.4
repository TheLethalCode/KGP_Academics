<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)The budget for the coming year will prove critical for the government in terms of the worldwide recession and delivering on poll pledges, predicts ADB in its latest quarterly report. The Asian Development Bank said the ongoing global economic recession had very little impact on Bangladesh at its initial stage as the Bangladesh economy was cushioned by few direct links to the world economy. Export earnings and remittance flow are up to expectation till now and GDP growth for FY 2008-09 looked to be satisfactory, the lending agency observed. But FY 2009-10 would be "very critical" for Bangladesh, said the report presented by ADB country director Paul Heytens and country division chief economist Hossain. 'High expectations' Asked why, ADB economist M Zahid Hossain replied, "It will be the first budget of the incumbent government. So public expectations will naturally be high." He said the government must take steps to fulfill its electoral pledges through this budget. The government has planned to develop different sectors through public-private partnership, which is a relatively new idea in the Bangladesh perspective, he said Revenue earnings might also slow down in the wake of low commodity prices on the international market, said Hossain. ADB's Jan-Mar quarterly report on Bangladesh was unveiled at the ADB Dhaka office. Heytens said Bangladesh could experience the impact of global slowdown in the next year though it was cushioned during the first phase of the recession. Export earnings and remittance flow might slow down, he warned. ADB, in its two earlier quarterly reports, projected GDP growth to be no more than 5.5 percent for the current year. The third quarterly report did not give its own forecast but instead quoted Bangladesh Statistics Bureau, which says GDP growth will hit 5.9 percent. Heytens said, "We made our previous predictions in view of global recession, but BBS has projected GDP growth to be 5.9 percent which might be possible on back of bumper production of crops." The report has recommended the government continue with current reform programmes and investment in infrastructure to boost economic growth on long term. It also recommended the government make extensive reforms in the revenue sector to meet necessary expenditure. ADB's Jan-Mar quarterly report on Bangladesh was unveiled at the ADB Dhaka office. bd
