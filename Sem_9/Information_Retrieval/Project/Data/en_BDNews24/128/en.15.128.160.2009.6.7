<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Sun Jun 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies are looking to defeat Lebanon's ruling US-backed coalition in a tightly contested general election on Sunday. Polling stations opened at 0400 GMT and some 50,000 members of the security forces fanned out over the 26 electoral districts to guard against violence, focusing on areas where competition is expected to be tightest. "Democracy is a blessing that we must preserve, a blessing that distinguishes Lebanon in the Middle East," President Michel Suleiman told reporters after voting in his hometown in Jbeil district, north of Beirut. He urged Lebanese to vote, calling it "an important act that should be done calmly and with joy so that afterwards we can start to build Lebanon". The election will shape the government for the next four years. Christians are seen as the deciding voters as the community is split and backs rival groups. Armoured personnel carriers dotted the streets of Beirut's Christian Ashrafiyeh district. "This time it is really going to matter," Charbel Nakouzi, 40, a London-based trader, told Reuters outside a polling station in the mainly Christian district of Metn. Long queues formed outside many polling stations in Beirut and other areas. Supporters of rivals, wearing t-shirts in their party colours, handed out candidate lists and urged voters to cast their ballot. Interior Minister Ziad Baroud said the election was proceeding peacefully and turnout appeared high. The election is a tight contest between coalitions at odds over issues including the fate of Hezbollah's powerful guerrilla army and relations with neighbouring Syria, which dominated Lebanon until 2005. The United States, which lists Hezbollah as a terrorist group, has linked future aid to Lebanon to the shape and policies of the government that replaces the current national unity cabinet. Hezbollah is part of the present government. The "March 14" majority coalition, led by Sunni politician Saad al-Hariri, has enjoyed firm backing from the United States and other countries including Saudi Arabia. It opposes the influence of Syria which dominated Lebanon until 2005. RESULTS MUST BE ACCEPTED The alliance won elections that followed the assassination of Hariri's father, Rafik, in 2005, but struggled to govern in the face of a paralysing and sometimes violent power struggle with Hezbollah and its allies. Former US President Jimmy Carter, who heads a team of international observers, urged Lebanese parties and their foreign backers to accept the result of the vote. "I don't have any concerns over the conduct of the elections. I have concerns over the acceptance of the results by all the major parties," Carter said after visiting a polling station in Beirut. "All the international observers hope and encourage all the parties to accept the result of the election whether they win or lose." Aoun, a former army commander, faces Christian rivals in the shape of the Phalange Party of former President Amin Gemayel and the Lebanese Forces of Samir Geagea. Much of the election campaigning has focused on Hezbollah's guerrilla wing, which is stronger than the army. Opponents say Hezbollah's weapons undermine the state, while the group and its allies see them as crucial to defending Lebanon against Israel. Tensions in Lebanon have mostly been kept in check by leaders whose rivalries pushed the country to the brink of civil war last year. A thaw in ties between Saudi Arabia and Syria has also helped maintain stability in Lebanon in recent mo
