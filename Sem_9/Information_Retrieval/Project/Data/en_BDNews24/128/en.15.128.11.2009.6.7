<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Boosting flagging investment will be the major challenge facing the government in the upcoming fiscal year, said an economic report by private think-tank Centre for Policy Dialogue published on Saturday. "Investment in industry is not just at a standstill but in the negative region, said CPD fellow and former executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya unveiling the report. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman said reviving flagging investment was crucial for GDP growth to recover from a five-year low. Replying to a query, Debapriya said: "Public, private and foreign investments are all declining." Debapriya said public spending was critical for encouraging private and foreign investment. It is tougher to secure one taka of investment than one taka in tax, he added. CPD found that gross investment as a percentage of GDP has declined for the third consecutive year. The disbursement of working capital, however, increased by 15.5 percent meaning that expansion is taking place, though no new investments are being made. Private investment, which accounts for four-fifths of total investment, also crept up to 19.55 percent of GDP from 19.25 percent the previous year. But public investment fell to a historic low rate of 4.63 percent of GDP this fiscal year. CPD reports the annual development programme will see implementation of just Tk 19,500 crore of its revised Tk 23,000 crore budget for the current fiscal, which amounts to only 3.20 percent of total GDP, the lowest ever. The last fiscal saw ADP implementation at 3.39 percent of GDP. Mustafizur expressed concern over excess liquidity and fall in term loan disbursement as signs of low investment and stalled industrial growth. According to the report, excess liquidity of scheduled banks stood at Tk 21,752 crore at the end of February, while the average excess liquidity was just Tk 12,932 crore for FY 2007-08. Term loan disbursements were down by 9.6 percent in July-March of the current fiscal year from the same period the previous year. Mustafizur, citing Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, said GDP growth is forecast to hit a five-year low of 5.88 percent this fiscal year, against the targeted growth of 6.5 per cent. Bhattacharya, however, termed the projected near-six percent growth satisfactory in the backdrop of the global recession. The report also pointed out that adverse conditions informing macroeconomic performance led at times to extremely gloomy GDP growth projections in FY 2008-09 of around five percent or less from many quarters, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank. But bumper harvests, resilience of the service sector, maintaining export growth and sustained high levels of remittance had helped the economy to attain the near-six per cent growth rate in FY 2008-09 and per capita income to rise to $621. On top of the investment challenge, CPD's State of the Bangladesh Economy report for FY 2008-09 identifies four other challenges that lie ahead  consolidating agriculture, protecting the external sector, strengthening public finance and reviving administrative development and reform. The report was based on two surveys carried out by the CPD, on agriculture and on 90 industrial houses, and on consultations with economists. It recommended expansionary monetary policy, using the low inflation ratedown from 7.7 in April 2008 to 5.36 per cent in April 2009to focus on expansion of credit to 'productive sectors' and further cutting interest rates. bd
