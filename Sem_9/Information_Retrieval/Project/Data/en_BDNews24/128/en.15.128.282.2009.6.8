 Munshiganj, June 8 (bdnews24.com)Another body was recovered Monday morning, taking the toll to 12 dead after a bus lost control on the Dhaka-Mawa highway and overturned into a water-filled ditch in Munshiganj the previous night. Srinagar police chief Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com that the body had been retrieved from inside the submerged bus, which was salvaged from under the water at around 5am. The body was taken to Shologhar Health Complex. Eleven people were initially reported killed and over a dozen seriously injured as the Saudia Paribahan bus hit a motorcycle at Chanbari in Srinagar Upazila at around 11:30pm, and lost control skidding into the roadside ditch filled with rainwater. The motorcyclist, 27 year-old Srinagar Chhatra League president Zakirul Haque Kusum, and his friend 25 year-old 'Ripon' were killed on the spot, said Hossain. Among the dead bus passengers, nine were recovered from the submerged vehicle immediately after the crash, but could not be immediately identified, said Hossain. The fire service was working to rescue passengers or recover more bodies trapped in the submerged bus into the early hours of Monday, said Hossain. Divers and a crane were sent from Dhaka to help, though the work was being hampered now because of the rain, he added. Munshiganj deputy commissioner Mosharraf Hossain and local MP Sukumar Ranjan Ghose visited the scene. bdnews
