 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday ordered the government and Biman Bangladesh Airlines to reinstate another 20 officials of the national flag carrier within a month. The HC bench of justices Tarique ul Haquim and Azizul Haque passed the orders, declaring illegal the termination of 20 officials including Captain Imran Ahmed. The verdict came after hearing of petitions submitted by the terminated employees. The HC also ordered the payment of all dues and benefits to the 20 officials who were discharged in 2006 and 2007. The officers filed petitions challenging their termination in 2008. In a previous hearing the High Court had issued a rule nisi to Biman to explain why the terminations should not be declared illegal and why the officials should not be reinstated. The High Court in recent months has ordered reinstatement of hundreds of entrenched Biman employees. Tuesday's hearing on behalf of the petitioners was carried out by Mansurul Haque and advocate Salauddin Dolon. Advocate Jainal Abedin appeared for Biman. bd
