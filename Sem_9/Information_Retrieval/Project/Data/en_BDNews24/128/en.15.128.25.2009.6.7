 GENEVA, Sat Jun 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN International Labour Organisation told Myanmar on Saturday to end forced labour, saying the action it had taken so far was "totally inadequate". But the ILO's committee on labour standards stopped short of referring Myanmar to the International Court of Justice, the top UN tribunal, as worker representatives demanded. The ILO has been at odds with the former Burma for more than a decade over what it says is a widespread practice of forcing villagers to work on infrastructure projects or as porters for the army. The committee said Myanmar's military government had taken some steps to tackle underage recruitment into the military, and to publicise a temporary complaints mechanism, which was extended for one year. "The Committee was however of the view that these steps are totally inadequate," it said in the conclusions of its meeting.

Several workers' representatives called for disinvestment from Myanmar, which is rich in oil, gas, timber and gems, and was once a major rice producer. But Myanmar drew support from China, which values Myanmar as a source of raw materials and route to the Indian Ocean, and from India, which has recently toned down criticism of its neighbour for fear of allowing Chinese influence to grow. "We are glad to notice that ... the two sides have been conducting close cooperation, taking substantive actions with substantive achievements made," the Chinese representative said. India also said Myanmar and the ILO had made tangible progress in tackling forced labour. Myanmar also got backing from fellow members of the Southeast Asian grouping ASEAN. Singapore urged it to redouble efforts to end forced labour, but criticised speakers who raised the case of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader currently on trial after years of house arrest, or referred to Myanmar as B
