<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com)After months of desperate search, retired air commodore Zakiul Islam has been named new CEO and MD of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, a top official of the national flag carrier said on Sunday. Biman director (administration) Aminul Haque told bdnews24.com that the board selected Islam, himself a former director (engineering), on Saturday. Haque said the new chief will join office soon, replacing Biman finance director, AM Mosaddique Ahmed, who has been acting chief since Apr 5 following the resignation of Zahed Kuddus, a former regulatory official. On May 17, the civil aviation minister had suggested Biman authorities re-advertise the position, as the authorities were struggling to find an "experienced" person for the job. "We're searching for someone with knowledge of the airlines business. I've told the board of directors you can re-advertise if necessary to find an experienced CEO," GM Quader had told bdnews24.com on that day. But no new advertisement was run. A prior advertisement for the positions in early April invited applications from people with 15 years' experience in the aviation industry and some 25 applications were submitted. It also asked for five years' experience in management and airlines marketing. bdn
