 NASSAU, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA's attempt to bring players' agents under control through a licensing scheme has failed with just a quarter of transfers being carried out by officially-sanctioned dealers, the body said on Wednesday.

FIFA's congress also voted on plans to tighten up the outlawing of international transfers for under-18 players which includes registration of all players in academies or soccer schools - whether run by a club or a private entity. So-called 'training fees' - transfer fees paid for young players - will be increased as a deterrent to 'poachers' of teenage talent. "We have to protect those clubs investing in training young players as opposed to those buying off the shelf," said Geoff Thompson of the English FA.

FIFA's executive had favoured changing from the current under-23 format to under-21 but rather than a vote, FIFA asked a task force to look into the best format
