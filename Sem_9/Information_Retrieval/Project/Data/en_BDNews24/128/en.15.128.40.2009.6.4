 BERLIN, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian midfielder Ze Roberto has decided to leave Bayern Munich after they failed to offer him a two-year contract extension, the Bundesliga club said on Wednesday. "Ze was offered an extension until June 30, 2010, but unfortunately he did not accept it," Bayern general director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on the club website (www.fcbayern.de). The 34-year-old Brazilian played six years for the club, winning the championship and Cup double four times. He played from 2002-06 before returning in the 2007 after a brief spell back in Brazil with Santos. He also played for Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid, winning the Spanish championship in 2007. Bayern have been reluctant to offer longer contracts recently with even captain Mark van Bommel, who is 32, having to accept a one-year deal
