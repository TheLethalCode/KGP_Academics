 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies' captain Chris Gayle smashed the Australian bowlers to all parts of the Oval on Saturday to lead his team to a seven wicket victory in their opening Twenty20 World Cup group C match. Gayle struck 88 with six sixes and six fours from 50 deliveries as West Indies overhauled Australia's 169 for seven with 4.1 overs to spare. Andre Fletcher proved an excellent foil, scoring 53 from 32 balls in an opening partnership of 133. Gayle launched an audacious attack on Brett Lee, bowling in excess of 145 kms an hour, in the fifth over of the innings. He clubbed the Australian fast bowler over long-on into the street and struck another huge six over mid-wicket. Twenty-seven came from the over. Australia captain Ricky Ponting turned to David Hussey's gentle slow-medium and Gayle responded by lofting two more sixes into the crowd. Jerome Taylor had set West Indies on the victory path by dismissing Shane Watson and Australia captain Ricky Ponting for ducks in the opening over of the match. Australia, reduced to 15 for three after 3.3 overs, did well to reach their eventual total. Diminutive left-handed opener David Warner anchored the innings with 63 from 53 balls and Brad Haddin (24), David Hussey (27) and Michael Hussey (28) made useful contributions down the order
