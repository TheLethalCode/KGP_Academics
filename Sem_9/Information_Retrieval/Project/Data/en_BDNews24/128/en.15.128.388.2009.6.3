 RIO DE JANEIRO, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga told his players on Tuesday to forget transfer speculation and concentrate on the World Cup qualifiers against Uruguay and Paraguay. "They are experienced and professional players, who know that their time with the national team is short and they are focused on these two games," he told reporters at the team's training camp in Teresopolis. "They know that their lives are not going to be decided right now and they have people helping them. "I've spoken to some of them and asked them to think exclusively in Brazil. Afterwards, they will have time to decide everything else." Brazil, second in the 10-team South American qualifying group with 21 points from 12 games, play Uruguay in Montevideo on Saturday and host Paraguay in Recife Wednesday. A number of the squad are involved in speculation about moves to new clubs. The most publicised case involves playmaker Kaka who has been linked with a possible move from AC Milan to Real Madrid. Kaka declined to discuss his future with reporters at the training camp
