 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)The detention and remand of former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu in connection with the BDR mutiny was by the book, said Faruque Khan, minister in charge of post-mutiny affairs, on Thursday. "Anybody under suspicion can be interrogated," he told reporters at his office on his return from Turkey where he attended a trade conference. BNP has said in a statement that Pintu's detention in the case was "motivated". Faruque said: "He has been legally taken into remand. I do not see any wrong in it." A Dhaka court has given investigators five days to grill Pintu, accused of helping BDR mutineers to flee the scene during the Feb 25-26 armed uprising. Pintu was picked up by police from the High Court gates on Tuesday as he was seeking a 'no arrest or harrassment' order after his name appeared in the government's mutiny probe report. The probe report stated: "Some civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river."

"The criminal investigation has taken some time because there is so much evidence to sift." He also said work on reorganisation of the border force is going on. b
