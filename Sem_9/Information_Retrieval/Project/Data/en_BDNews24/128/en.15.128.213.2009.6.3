 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)An expert committee tasked with recommending corrections for 'distorted history' in primary school textbooks has said Sheikh Mujibur Rahman should be recognised as the country's "greatest" leader. It said, among other renowned historical figures, AK Fazlul Haque, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, General MAG Osmani and Ziaur Rahman must also be given proper recognition as "independence heroes". "In the 64-page report, we've identified the distortions of Liberation War history in primary level textbooks and suggested corrections," Prof Mamotaj Uddin Patwary, a member of the nine-member committee, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday after submitting the report to the education minister. The Awami League, which led the nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan in 1971, has long claimed distortion of that history by the previous BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition coalition government. Prof Mamotaj said they had divided the independence leadership into two parts, recommending Mujib be referred to as "great leader", while Fazlul Haque, Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, General Osmani and Zia will be known as "independence heroes". He said Sheikh Mujib had previously been "poorly" represented. He also mentioned the declaration of independence as another example of "distorted history", with BNP claiming Ziaur Rahman made the declarartion. "There is only a little information on the government-in-exile during the Liberation War and rather a long description has been given on Ziaur Rahman's leadership," Prof Mamotaj said. "We've suggested correction of these things." Mamotaj said, "Initiatives will be taken to correct the distorted history from next year (2010) in line with recommendations of the committee." Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said, "The history of the Liberation War and the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman have been presented in a distorted fashion in the past." "The committee has acted, rising above any partisanship, and next year primary textbooks will contain right history," Nahid said. bdnews
