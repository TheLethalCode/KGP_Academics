<TITLE> Chittagong's Karnaphuli river choked </TITLE>

 Ruhul Amin Rana Chittagong correspondent Chittagong, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Unchecked contamination, encroachment and shipping pollution, are engulfing Chittagong's Karnaphuli river, the lifeline of the nation's major port, threatening its very existence. Tonnes of industrial effluence from hundreds of factories and waste of passing ships flow into the river every day through 15 canals, while illegal encroachment has choked many mooring sites causing them to be abandoned by vessels. A vast area of the city is inundated during the rainy season as the increasingly choked and sluggish river has lost its capacity to take up and drain away the flood waters. Prof Muhammad Idris Ali, of Chittagong College's chemistry department, said 62 types of harmful chemicals are dumped in the river from 730 factories along the 88km stretch of river from the Kaptai Dam to the estuary. He said some 150 separate industries are responsible for the toxic chemical output, include paper mills, fertilisers, tanneries, textiles, oil refineries and soap manufacturing. Idris Ali, who has been studying pollution in the river, reveals that the waste of the Karnaphuli Paper Mill is the most polluting of these. "It has been causing industrial pollution of the river unchecked since its establishment in 1949," Ali said. The KPM authorities have recently moved to treat its effluence before it goes into the river, but implementation will take time, said a mill official, preferring not to be named. The mill is dumping 10 tonnes of liquid and solid chemical wastes into the river every day, he said. Abdul Malek, an inhabitant of Omar Ali Ghat told bdnews24.com that illegal encroachment on banks and chars was growing with the rise in land prices. Illegal structures are going up every day on the hundreds of acres of land of Haldar Char, Nazir Char, Gurar Char, Hamid Char and Bakalia Char. The river is becoming narrower and shallower with navigability rapidly decreasing. Ferry and trawler pilots say their boats cannot anchor at the ghats as easily as they could just two or three decades ago. Head of Chittagong division's environment directorate, Mohammad Abdus Sobhan, blamed the factories for the plight of the Karnaphuli. He also said city authorities were to blame for improper drainage during the monsoon. Sobhan, on June 1, stated publicly that treatment of waste would be made mandatory for all factories and industries to reduce the pollution in the river. "All active steps will be taken to save the Karnaphuli from encroachment and pollution," he said. The workings of the country's key port are also wholly reliant on the river. Over 1,500 ships and 10,000 registered and unregistered vessels ply the river each month for port related activities. Their untreated oil seepage, emissions and waste are also a major pollution-factor. Chittagong Port Authority chairman RU Ahmed told bdnews24.com that steps are being taken to increase navigability and protect the river banks through capital dredging. "We will start the project at a cost of Tk 400 crore as soon as we get the approval from the ministry," he said. If it is implemented a 2.5 km stretch, from Sadarghat to Karnaphuli Bridge, will also be freed from encroachment, he said. "We are in the process of procuring two specialised ships to clean up oil pollution and other ship waste." A mobile court will also start work in preventing pollution, said the CPA chief. Idris Ali said the Karnaphuli survives only because it is a river influenced by tide and ebb. "Otherwise we would have lost this crucial river by now." bdnews
