 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has made it clear that the BNP will get one more front-row seat in parliament, two fewer than the main opposition party asked for. But with the second session, popularly known as the budget session, starting Thursday, the main opposition is yet to decide whether it would join the session with demands unmet. "I cannot give them more than one seat in the front row," Hamid told reporters on Wednesday at his office. With this BNP would have five front-row seats although the party has demanded seven out of the total nine on the front row to the left of the speaker's chairknown as the 'opposition bench'. The speaker said he could offer the BNP an additional seat as Zillur Rahman's became vacant after his election as president. "BNP's Moudud Ahmed and Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar will sit on the front bench while Mofazzel Hossain Kaykobad will have to go behind," said Hamid. "In addition, one Jatiya Party MPHM Ershad, GM Quader or Mojibor Rahmanwill have to go behind since I am thinking of giving Roushan Ershad a front-row seat," he said. However, the main opposition is yet to decide whether it would join the session with demands unmet. The party is expected to decide at its parliamentary party meeting this week, to be chaired by opposition leader Khaleda Zia, according to chief whip of opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque. Hamid on Tuesday night met chief whip Abdus Shahid and Farroque to settle the dispute over the seating arrangements but it ended inconclusively. The ruling Awami League did not agree giving to the BNP more than five front-row seats. The party started parliament boycott since Jan 28the second day of the ninth parliamentas the speaker cut their front-row seats to four from eight given by Hamid's predecessor Sircar. BNP returned to parliament on Feb 23 as speaker Hamid promised them an "honourable" number of seats for the budget session. Farroque on Tuesday night told bdnews24.com that speaker's proposal was not "honourable".
