 JERUSALEM, Sun Jun 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he would strive for `maximum understanding' with Washington on peace issues but gave no sign he intends to bow to its demand to halt settlement expansion. Under pressure from US President Barack Obama over settlements in the occupied West Bank and Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu has not endorsed, the Israeli leader said he would set out his policies in a major speech later this month. "I want to make clear, it is our intention to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with the countries of the Arab world while attempting to reach maximum understanding with the United States and our friends in the world," Netanyahu said. "I aspire to a stable peace based on the solid foundations of the security of the state of Israel and its citizens," he told his right-wing cabinet at its weekly meeting. His comments, which stopped short of a pledge to end all differences with the United States on peacemaking, left open the possibility of an ongoing rift between Israel and its main ally over issues central to an Israeli-Palestinian accord. Obama's Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, is to begin a visit to Israel and the West Bank on Monday. Western and Israeli officials said the White House was formulating a blueprint for a renewed peace process that could be presented early next month. Without citing a precise date, Netanyahu said: "Next week, I will make a major diplomatic speech in which I will present to the citizens of Israel our principles for achieving peace and security." A spokesman said Netanyahu was referring to the Israeli work week starting on Sunday, June 14.

In a speech on Thursday to Muslims, Obama said Washington "does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements" and said their expansion undermines efforts to achieve peace. Israeli officials said Netanyahu has no intention of freezing all settlement activity which would risk the collapse of his coalition. They said he would try to ease friction with the United States by removing West Bank roadblocks that hinder Palestinians and small Jewish outposts that are not authorized by the government. Defense Minister Ehud Barak, head of the center-left Labour Party in Netanyahu's government, held out the possibility of a softening in Israel's position on Palestinian statehood in return for an easing of US pressure over settlements. Referring to a 2003, US-endorsed peace plan, Barak told reporters the government should declare it is "committed to all previous agreements signed by previous governments, including the 'road map', whose goal is two states for two peop
