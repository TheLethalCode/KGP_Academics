 PISA, Italy, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World champions Italy crushed Northern Ireland 3-0 in a friendly on Saturday thanks to fine maiden international goals by forwards Giuseppe Rossi, Pasquale Foggia and Sergio Pellissier. Rossi struck in the 20th minute of the match, in which both nations fielded experimental sides with lots of debutants, driving in a splendid left-footed shot from outside the box. Lazio's Foggia dribbled past a marker and coolly chipped in eight minutes into the second half before fellow substitute Pellissier wrapped things up shortly after coming off the bench for his debut. Keeper Jonathan Tuffey saved a Giampaolo Pazzini penalty with help of the post for the visitors, who posed little threat, with the score at 2-0. The Azzurri were solid in the first half and then stepped on the gas after the break when Gaetano D'Agostino hit the post with a corner after Foggia's goal and Pazzini's missed penalty. Chievo Verona's Pellissier controlled the ball and acrobatically spin around to score in the 72nd minute but missed a second when he had a one-on-one with substitute keeper Alan Mannus 10 minutes from time. Italy coach Marcello Lippi was delighted to see AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso give a solid display before coming off at halftime after having only just returned from knee surgery. "It was a good night of football," he told Rai television. "This match was useful for me to get Gattuso to do some work. He showed himself to be the usual warrior. It wasn't worth the risk of playing him any longer." Italy fly out to South Africa for the Confederations Cup late on Sunday when 13 regulars will come into the squad with many of those in action on Saturday dropping out, including Foggia and Pellissier
