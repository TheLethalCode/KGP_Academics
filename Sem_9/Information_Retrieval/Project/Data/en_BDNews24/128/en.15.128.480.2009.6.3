<TEXT>
 CHISINAU, Wed Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Moldovan Prime Minister Zinaida Greceanii, an ally of outgoing leader Vladimir Voronin, fell one vote short of securing election in a ballot for president in parliament on Wednesday, triggering a new general election. Parliament's Election Commission said Greceanii, a communist like Voronin, had won 60 votes in the second and final ballot for president as opposition parties stuck to a boycott. A total of 61 votes had been needed in the 101-member assembly to win office. Voronin, who cannot run for a third term, had hoped to keep the reins of power in his new job of parliament speaker. But he must now dissolve the assembly and call a general election in Moldova, an ex-Soviet republic of about 4.5 million people, wedged between Ukraine and European Union member Romania. "We take note that there are now circumstances for dissolving parliament," Voronin told deputies after the result was announced. The last election in April led to violent protests in which young demonstrators, angry at continued rule by the communist party, ransacked public buildings. Voronin first took office in 2001 and cannot run for a third consecutive term. Voronin's Communists hold 60 seats and Greceanii's first bid for the presidency fell one vote short -- as it did in the new ballot on Wednesday. OPPOSITION BOYCOTT The opposition had vowed to maintain its boycott of the vote to torpedo her chances and force a new parliamentary election. "All lines of communication between the Communists and the opposition are broken. I see no technical way of electing a president," said Igor Munteanu of the IDIS Viitorul think tank before the ballot. "If the election does go through it will be a result of some legal irregularity -- corruption on the part of one or more opposition members. That cannot be ruled out completely." A second token candidate, Moldova's ambassador to Russia, was also on the ballot to give it a more competitive appearance. Voronin hoped the election to the presidency of the compliant premier would allow him to retain the reins of power. Three opposition parties, liberal and pro-European in outlook, hold a combined total of 41 seats and had vowed to maintain the boycott to frustrate Greceanii's candidacy. Voronin has overseen economic stability but the world crisis has hit Moldova hard, reducing by one third remittances sent home by hundreds of thousands of its nationals working abroad. Voronin first allied himself with Moscow but then alleged the Kremlin was abetting separatists who control Moldova's Russian-speaking Transdniestria region. He turned to Romania which shares a historical and linguistic heritage with Moldova but then accused it of trying to swallow up Moldova and fomenting post-election viol
