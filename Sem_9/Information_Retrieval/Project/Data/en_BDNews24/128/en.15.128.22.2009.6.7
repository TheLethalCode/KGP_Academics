 TOKYO, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan coach Takeshi Okada has targeted a semi-final spot at the 2010 World Cup after his team secured their place at the South Africa tournament. "I want my players to fight hard and aim to reach the semi-finals," the 52-year-old told a news conference in Yokohama on Sunday after the team's triumphant return from Uzbekistan. "The final whistle last night sounded the start of a new challenge for Japan. Once the (World Cup) draw is made we will look to set up a maximum of four games against top sides." Japan's 1-0 win in Tashkent on Saturday gives the "Blue Samurai" the chance to exorcise the demons of the 2006 World Cup when they exited in the first round with barely a whimper. "We've qualified for the World Cup but it's just a stepping stone," said Celtic midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura. "We have to get ourselves back up for the real challenge ahead." Japan's soccer chief Motoaki Inukai echoed Okada's sentiments about reaching the last four of the World Cup. "With the help of the passionate support of the Japan fans we've cleared the first big step," the Japan Football Association president said. "It's a relief to qualify. Now we have a year to prepare thoroughly to take aim at the World Cup semi-finals." Japan reached the last 16 of the 2002 World Cup under Frenchman Philippe Troussier. They were overshadowed by tournament co-hosts South Korea, who became the first Asian country to reach the last four under the stewardship of Dutchman Guus Hiddink. Japan flopped under Brazilian Zico at the 2006 finals in Germany, bowing out after two defeats and a draw in the group stage. Australia and South Korea also booked their places at the World Cup on Saturday, leaving just one further automatic Asian qualifying spot up for grabs
