 Dhaka, June 06 (bdnews24.com)  Land officials took a drubbing from ministers on Saturday, who said land offices up and down the country were seen as a "hub of corruption", and proposed the land survey department be dissolved as their surveys were in fact "a system to churn out bribes". Finance minister AMA Muhith said submission of fees and taxes for land registration will become a 'one-stop service' from Sept 1, in a major move to lessen corruption and reduce anomalies. "This is being undertaken to ensure a smooth service and lessen the hassle of land registration," Muhith told a meeting of land officials and registrars organised by the law ministry at the BIAM auditorium. "The government is moving to digitalise the entire land management system. Once complete, people will be able to collect land documents within 15 days," said the minister. "But some time will be needed to amend the related laws and the current system," he added. Talking of "corruption and anomalies" in land offices, the minister said around 75 percent of civil cases in courts countrywide were land-related. "And these cases go on for decades." He proposed to dissolve the land survey department. "The survey that is done every 10 years is in fact a system to churn out bribes," he said. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed, also present at the meeting, rejected the possibility of transferring the land registration office from the law ministry to the land ministry because of the judicial aspect of the work. He urged land registrars to work for the people and asked them not to succumb to any "external pressures". He also assured 278 vacant posts of the land registration office would be filled soon. Land minister Rezaul Karim Heera said effective steps were being taken to curb corruption at land registration and management offices in dealing with taxes, rents and mutations. "People think land registration offices are a hub of corruption and anomalies. We will have to come out of this situation," said state minister for law Kamrul Islam. The ministers sought the cooperation of all to eliminate corruption and anomalies and to "uphold the lost glory of the land registrars". The meeting was presided over by law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal. Additional secretary Shahidul Haque presented a paper. Acting inspector general for the registration authority Munshi Nazrul Islam spoke among others. b
