 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com)Parliamentary committees placed recommendations for passage of three bills Sunday, including a speedy trial bill that has met with controversy in the past. The Law and Order Infringement (Speedy Trial) (Amendment) Bill 2009 received the green light. Of the other two, the Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill 2009 was also given the go ahead, while the report on the Local Government (Municipalities) Bill 2009 suggested further amendments. Abdus Salam, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on home ministry, placed the report proposing passage of the speedy trial bill for a two-year extension of the law. Home minister Sahara Khatun tabled the bill in the House in March, seeking the extension in a bid to combating crimes such as mugging, extortion, terrorism and vandalism on the streets. The BNP-led government introduced the speedy trial law in 2002, with provision for extension every two years, amid protest by the then opposition Awami League, which is now proposing its extension. The controversial law has seen its two-year term extended four times in the past, including one through an ordinance by the previous caretaker government. The government said that a total of 159 cases were under investigation while 1,246 others were under trial up to March 3 2009 under the law. In this circumstance, the home minister sought extension of two more years to keep the law in effect until April 6 2010. Committee suggests amendments to municipalities bill Rahamat Ali, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the local government, rural development and cooperatives ministry submitted its report on the Local Government (Municipalities) Bill 2009 after scrutiny. The committee asked the government to go for a number of amendments onto the original bill placed in parliament by the LGRD and Cooperatives Minister Syed Ashraful Islam on March 3, 2009 in line with an ordinance promulgated by the military-backed government. The committee suggested provision for two deputy mayors, one of whom will be a woman, in each municipality. The deputy mayors would also be elected by popular vote. Among others, it also suggested that local MPs would act as advisers to the municipality councils, but their advice would not be mandatory. Public procurement bill gets go ahead Oli Ahmed, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on planning ministry placed the report on Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill 2009. The bill sought supremacy of the public procurement law in case of any agreement with a foreign country, development partner or any international agency in terms of any loan, donation or service under any agreement. Planning minister A K Khandaker placed the bill in the House on March 29, 2009. The committee suggested passage of the bill as it was placed.
