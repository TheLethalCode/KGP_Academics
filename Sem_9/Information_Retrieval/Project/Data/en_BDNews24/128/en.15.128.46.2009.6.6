 ALMATY, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England manager Fabio Capello will wait until the morning of the match to make a final decision on who will replace injured goalkeeper David James for Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan. West Ham's Robert Green, former first choice Paul Robinson of Blackburn Rovers and West Bromwich Albion's Scott Carson are the keepers in the squad for the Group Six match. "I have more or less decided but tomorrow morning will be the last decision," Capello told a news conference on Friday. "All the goalkeepers that we have here are fit." Group leaders England have won all five of their matches and a victory in Almaty and then against Andorra at Wembley on Wednesday would leave them needing just three points from their last three qualifiers to secure a place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. "For me these two games will be very important," said Italian Capello. "I think they are the biggest steps to South Africa." The Kazakhs have won only one of their five games and were beaten 5-1 by Belarus last time out but England captain John Terry said his team would have to guard against what they expect to be a rejuvenated home side. "I think they will start very quickly," Terry said. "Their season is just beginning so they are going to be very fit and very sharp. "The game is going to be difficult," added Terry, who missed the 5-1 win over Kazakhstan at Wembley last October with a back injury. He said a number of players had found it difficult to sleep following the nine-hour flight from London to one of European soccer's furthest flung outposts, but all of them were fit and ready for the game. "We are prepared for the unexpected because it's going to be difficult tomorrow," he said. "We are really looking forward to these two games. We have got ourselves into a good position in the groupbut this game is going to be a tough one and all the players are feeling the same.
