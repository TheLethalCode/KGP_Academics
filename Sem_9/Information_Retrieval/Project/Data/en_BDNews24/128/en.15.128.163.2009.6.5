 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has called on Bangladeshis to prepare to live with the gradually changing climate regime. She also urged all to engage in environment-friendly activities only in everyday life. Hasina made the call when she addressed a programme convened by the Department Of Environment, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, at Osmani memorial hall in observance of the World Environment Day 2009. "All our rivers today have lost the free flows of the past due to heavy silt deposition. We are frantically knocking at people's door everywhere seeking assistance to dredge those silt deposits," the prime minister said. "Once the rivers are given back their original beds, the frequent overflowing will cease, reducing the negative impacts of the global climate change in our region." She stressed the need for raising green belts all across the country and especially along the coasts. Prime minister Hasina said, "We all must plant trees and nurture green belts to protect our people and resources against natural disasters such as the recurrent cyclonic storms and tidal surges." On the other hand, she pointed out, there is scarcity of water in the capital and other arid zones such as the north-western regions. "We happen to have a lot of rainfall across the country, which means we can harvest huge volumes of fresh water and use it for all necessary and productive purposes including agriculture." The rivers have been losing their water-retention capacity due to heavy siltation and unbridled encroachment, she said and called on all to resolve to do their best to save the dying rivers. She said her administration received good responses from international agencies after knocking at other nations' doors for assistance, All the rivers will be brought under the project, she said, starting with work on the river Jamuna. She stressed dredging, river training and adopting erosion countering measures to save the rivers. "We must ensure food security for all despite the fact that our population is growing and we will be visited by floods, cyclones, pest attacks etc." "Arrangements must be in place to raise a buffer stock good enough to meet the nation's need through two-three years. We'll do it through increasing food production." She said, due to the changing climate, agriculture dependent Bangladesh has of late been recurrently ravaged by cyclones, floods, storm surges and other natural disasters. She emphasised the need for appropriate researches into innovating and developing newer species and breeds of crops suiting the gradually changing climate regimes in different regions of the country. "Our scientists must work in unison to find ways and modes in helping the nation cope with the changing climes, survive and uplift quality of life simultaneously." She urged all concerned to find ways of practising agriculture shunning chemicalspesticides and manuresand highlight their negative impacts. "Along with extensive use of chemicals in farming, unplanned industrialisation and untreated waste dumping in the open water have resulted in grievous deterioration of the health of our rivers around Dhaka and other major metropolitan townships." Steps to make all the environment-polluting industries environmentally friendly are being taken by the government and any lack of cooperation here will be seriously dealt with, she warned. The prime minister handed out environment medals awarded to recipients in four branchesenvironment conservation, environmental pollution control, environmental research and technology innovation, and environmental education and campaign. Three individuals and one organisation received the awards. "This incentive has been introduced to raise environmental awareness among people and to encourage them to undertake environment friendly actions." She next inaugurated a two-day environment fair organised by the ministry. The message of the World Environment Day 2009 is: Your mother earth wants you to combat and cope with climate change. b
