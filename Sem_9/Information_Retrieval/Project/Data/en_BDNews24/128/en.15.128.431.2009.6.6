<TITLE> Federer's pulsating win keeps dream alive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tennis fans demanded it and Roger Federer obligedbut only justas the Swiss rode a wave of emotional support on Friday to move within one win of an elusive French Open crown. Federer kept the 15,000 crowd on the edge of their seats for three hours 29 minutes before they exploded into a roar of deafening cheers when his forehand winner finally subdued Argentine warrior Juan Martin del Potro 3-6 7-6 2-6 6-1 6-4. Just in case the message had not already been hammered home, as Federer walked off court, a male voice boomed out from the crowd: "Roger you have got to win on Sunday! Please!" Standing in Federer's path to glory, and a record-equalling 14th grand slam title, will be 23rd seed Robin Soderling. "I can't remember a five set match that I've played that was so moving," second seed Federer told reporters after matching Ivan Lendl's record of reaching 19 major finals. "It feels great coming through tough matches like this. It's more emotional. It's more satisfaction it's this incredible feeling to win this match." Swedish giant-killer Soderling, having already knocked out four-time champion Rafael Nadal and 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, sank to his knees when he outlasted Chilean Fernando Gonzalez 6-3 7-5 5-7 4-6 6-4 to reach his first grand slam final. If he dares to reproduce the same form on Sunday, Soderling will turn out to be the ultimate villain. SLAM COLLECTION Only one victory now separates Federer from completing his collection of grand slam trophies and if he achieves the feat, the Swiss will become only the sixth man to have won all four majors in their careers. Having contested 18 grand slam finals before this weekend, Sunday's showpiece might look like an easy ride for the number two seed since he will come up against a man who has never ventured this far on the big stage. But this will be no ordinary Sunday and Federer did not want to tempt fate by talking up his chances. "There are no easy grand slam finals," he said. "It's very simple, because the one who is on the other side of the net has also won six matches and is definitely in the shape of his life," added Federer, who will take a 9-0 record over the Swede into the final. With Nadal having wrecked his dreams in the last three finals, one thing Federer was sure of was that "it's nice to see someone else for a change in the French Open finals". From the moment Soderling took care of his nemesis Nadal last Sunday, Federer has been on the most jittery journey of his career and on Friday fifth seed Del Potro sent the 27-year-old's pulse racing when he took a two-sets-to-one lead. PREGNANT WIFE If it was bad enough for Federer, one can only guess at the palpitations felt by his pregnant wife Mirka, who watched on in agony as her husband's dreams were left blowing in the wind when he limply surrendered the third set. It was not what the fans had expected, and definitely not what Federer anticipated because Del Potro had never taken a set off him in five previous meetings. As the chills started to set in on Centre Court, Federer turned the heat on Del Potro and left the Argentine flat-footed. He streaked through seven games en route to taking a 3-1 lead in the fifth. But just when it seemed Del Potro was fading into the twilight zone, he summoned enough energy to level at 3-3. From there the 20-year-old's challenge faded. "If it had been in the best of three sets, I would have won that match just escaped me," said a dejected Del Potro. While Federer's win warmed French hearts, Soderling found an oasis of calm to become the first Swede to reach the final here since his coach Magnus Norman achieved the feat in 2000. Soderling's defeat of Nadal ensured the Spaniard would continue to share the record of winning four Paris titles in a row with another Swede Bjorn Borg. It was only fitting that the great champion was among the capacity crowd to witness the 24-year-old's greatest moment. "It's a great feeling (being in the) final of a grand slam," Soderling said. "The biggest tournament in the world, and on clay. If you'd asked me a couple of years ago which grand slam I'd play a final in 2009, I wouldn't have said Roland Garros." "I always knew before that when I play well, when I play my best tennis, I can beat anybody. I feel like I've played very, good tennis for many, many matches in a row, which is great.
