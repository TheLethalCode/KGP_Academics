<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)The government has set a new scale to gauge the examination results, integrating the current grading system adopted only years back and the discarded 'division system'. A set of standards has been determined for the examinees who took the SSC and equivalent examinations during 2001-2003, and HSC and equivalent examinations in 2003, according to an education ministry order circulated on Tuesday. Another set has been developed for those appearing in the same examinations from 2004 onward. According to the new formula, starting with 2004, for all streams of both SSC and HSC, the previously awarded 'first divisions' have been equated with GPA-4 and above up to GPA-5 mark. The second divisions have been equated with GPA-3 and above up to just under the GPA-4 mark. The third divisions will be deemed equal to GPA-1 and above up to just under the GPA-3 limit. Those who secured first division in the SSC and equivalent examinations in 2001-03 and HSC and equivalent examinations in 2003 will be considered as having scored GPA-3.50 or above. The second division equals the GPA-2.50 or above but under 3.50 and the third division has been equated with all the GPA-1 or above scorers up to just under 2.50. Najmul Hossain, who passed the SSC exams in 2001, told bdnews24.com, "The government circular has fulfilled what we had demanded." "But now the government has also to ensure that both the government and private employers adhere to the new grade equations and reset the eligibility criteria accordingly," he said, reacting to the newly announced equations. As per new policy, in case of university level CGPAs, students securing 60 percent or above marks will be considered as having first division, the 45 percent or above up to just under 60 will be second division marks, and 33 and above but under 45 as third division. The gradings, however, should vary with the scales a university might decide upon. For example, a student securing GPA-3 in scale 4 (where the uppermost limit is 4) would be equated with a first divisioner, which in scale 5 should be equal to second division. The government on May 13 had formed this committee to synthesise examination results, with Mainuddin Khandaker, joint secretary (college), education ministry as its head. bdne
