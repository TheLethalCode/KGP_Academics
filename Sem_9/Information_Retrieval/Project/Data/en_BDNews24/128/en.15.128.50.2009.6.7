"We have to do away with the notion that against Brazil, teams have to play hard and kick us. Our players showed strength, determination and technique," Dunga told reporters after his team's first away win over their neighbours for 33 years. "Football's not just about kicking and committing nasty fouls all the time. Today, we suffered a lot of fouls, including fouls off the ball." Uruguay dominated the first half and created more chances but found themselves 2-0 down at halftime, a scoreline that Dunga said was a fair reflection of the game. "It was a fair result, eleven against eleven, one ball and two goals. You have to put the ball in the net," he said. Forward Robinho added: "If we can match our opponents' determination and will to win, then our technique will shine through. That's what happened today."
