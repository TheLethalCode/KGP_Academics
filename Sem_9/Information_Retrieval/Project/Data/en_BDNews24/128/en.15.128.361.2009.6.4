 MILAN, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Selling playmaker Kaka would make economic sense for AC Milan but no other top player will be allowed to leave, chief executive Adriano Galliani has said. Galliani was in Spain earlier this week to meet returning Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and media reports say the man who created the Galacticos has made a huge bid for Kaka. In the closest anyone at Milan has to come to saying the Brazilian is leaving, Galliani told Thursday's Gazzetta dello Sport that the club had little option. "The reasons for the departure of Kaka are solely economic," he said. "Even a great heart must confront the situation and make choices. Milan can not go on losing 70 million euros ($99 million) a year." Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi has not sanctioned any move yet and has said he will talk to Kaka on Monday before making a decision. Chelsea, coached by former Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti, denied on Wednesday that they had bid for the 27-year-old. Reports have also linked the Premier League club with Milan's Alexandre Pato and Andrea Pirlo, but Galliani was adamant they were not leaving. "We're not falling apart. The other big players are not for sale. Now a great attacker will arrive," he said. Milan have long been interested in Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor. Kaka, the 2007 world player of the year, was linked with Manchester City in January for a world record fee in excess of 100 million euros ($142 million), far more than Real are reported to have offered. "In January, Kaka didn't want to go to Manchester City," Galliani added. "Instead he would go to Madrid.
