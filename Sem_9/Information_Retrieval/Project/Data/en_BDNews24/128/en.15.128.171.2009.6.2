 LONDON, Tue Jun 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Prince Charles will attend a ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings after French officials failed to invite Queen Elizabeth, causing a brief diplomatic spat. A spokeswoman for Charles confirmed he would attend the June 6 commemoration as a guest of President Nicolas Sarkozy. US President Barack Obama will also attend the anniversary.

Some 73,000 US troops and 83,000 British, Canadian and Commonwealth forces landed in France on June 6, 1944 in the largest amphibious attack in history. The assault led to the liberation of Nazi-occupied France and the war ended a year later. The main event at the anniversary takes place in a US war cemetery, land which is officially owned by the United States. A French official last week pointed to that fact as a reason why it was not up to Paris to invite the queen to the anniversary but Washington. French media have reported that Sarkozy pushed to get Obama to attend the commemoration after failing to persuade him to visit Paris after a NATO sumit in eastern France in A
