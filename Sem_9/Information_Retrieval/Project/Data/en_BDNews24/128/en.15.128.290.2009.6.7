 LARNACA, Cyprus, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus were held to a 2-2 draw by Montenegro in a World Cup group eight qualifier on Saturday after second half substitute Dejan Damjanovic struck twice for the visitors. Cyprus opened the scoring with a header by Michael Konstantinou in the 13th minute and made it 2-0 from the penalty spot on the stroke of halftime through Chrysostomos Michail. But Damjanovic, brought on as a sub for Nikola Drincic, scored after a scramble outside the Cypriots' goal in the 65th minute and equalised 12 minutes later with a well-placed shot. Montenegro captain Mirko Vucinic should have secured all three points in the 75th minute but his penalty bounced off goalkeeper Michael Morphis. Both teams continue to struggle near the foot of the group with Cyprus on five points and Montenegro on four, well behind leaders Italy on 14. The group winners qualify for the finals while the best eight runners-up from the nine groups go through to a playoff
