<TITLE> UK's Labour Party suffers big losses in local polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's governing Labour Party suffered a heavy setback in local council elections on Friday, giving up seats to the opposition Conservatives and losing control of regions once considered strongholds. The results, in line with expectations given popular discontent with the 12-year-old government and following a parliamentary expenses scandal, suggest Labour will do poorly when parliamentary elections are held in the next year. The local elections were held on Thursday together with elections for the European Parliament. Results of the European elections will be released on Sunday and were also expected to show Labour's popularity has suffered with voters. In the local elections, Labour suffered a huge defeat in Staffordshire, a region that had been under its control since 1981, losing 29 seats as the Conservatives romped home. Local councillor Derek Davis described it as a "complete wipe-out". "I've been a member of the Labour party since 1963 and I've never known it as bad as this," said Davis. "This is the lowest ebb I have ever known." Based on provisional results, the BBC calculated Labour's projected share of the national vote had fallen to 23 percent, behind the Conservatives on 38 percent and the Liberal Democrats on 28 percent. If early results were repeated at a general election the Conservatives would win with a double digit seat majority in the 646-seat parliament, Sky News said. "These are very bad results," Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell told BBC television. The results came on the same day Prime Minister Gordon Brown reshuffled his cabinet in an effort to shore up his authority, silence critics calling for him to go, and stave off the worst crisis of his two-year leadership. Six senior ministers have quit Brown's cabinet in the past four days, putting the prime minister under intense pressure. However, Brown looks likely to ride out the storm, at least for the time being. He does not have to call parliamentary elections until next June and, given the ructions in his government and the latest drubbing in the polls, he is not expected to go to the polls much sooner.
