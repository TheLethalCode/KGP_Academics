<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swede Robin Soderling built on the momentum that allowed him to beat Rafael Nadal and reached the Roland Garros semi-finals on Tuesday with a 6-1 6-3 6-1 drubbing of Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko. Soderling, who created one of the biggest upsets in tennis when he knocked out four-times champion Nadal in the fourth round, will play his first grand slam semi-final against Chilean 12th seed Fernando Gonzalez. The 23rd-seeded Swede, who had never been considered a claycourt specialist, said he was starting to enjoy himself on the slowest surface. "If you'd ask me like four years ago, I'd say I will never reach a semi-final in Paris," he told a news conference. "But every year, I play better and better on clay. Actually, I like to play on all surfaces. There's no surface that I don't like. "Maybe so far I had my best results indoors but then I think clay is my next best surface, actually." Thanks to his victory over Nadal, he has acquired some famous fans. "It was very big for me to receive an SMS from Bjorn (Borg) He's maybe the best player of all time," said Soderling, whose defeat of Nadal ensured the Spaniard would continue to share the record of winning four Paris titles in a row with Borg. "He said thank you for not letting Nadal break my record. I think he will be down here maybe tomorrow." BLUDGEONING FOREHAND After shrugging off a couple of break points, Soderling raced through the first set in 23 minutes, with Davydenko, whom he beat in their two previous encounters on clay, claiming only 10 points. In the second set, the Swede earned the first break for 3-1 with a bludgeoning forehand, the very same weapon that helped him against Nadal. With Davydenko, who turned 28 on Tuesday, constantly running from side to side chasing after Soderling's winners it was barely surprising when he dropped his serve again to lose the second set. The Swede continued to step confidently into the court in the third and was barely bothered on his service games by a clueless Davydenko. Soderling, who held serve throughout, wrapped up the win with his fourth ace after one hour 41 minutes. He kept his feet on the ground afterwards. "As I said after the match against Nadal I won a great match, and this is maybe the happiest match day in my career," the 24-year-old said. "But I have another match to concentrate on. I feel the same way today. I don't want to be too happy, because I have another match coming up.
