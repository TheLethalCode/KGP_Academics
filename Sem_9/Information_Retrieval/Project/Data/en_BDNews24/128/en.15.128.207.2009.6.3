 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)A metropolitan court on Wednesday gave police five days to question former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu arrested on charges of helping BDR mutineers to flee the scene during the Feb 25-26 armed uprising. Amid strict security, the CID produced Pintu in the court of metropolitan magistrate Mominul Hasan requesting 10 days' remand. Pintu was represented in court by advocates Sanaullah Miah, Jainal Abedin Mesbah and over 50 lawyers who petitioned the court to cancel his remand and grant him bail. Ratan Sheikh, sub-inspector of police, opposed the bail move. Pintu was picked up on Tuesday as he emerged from the High Court after seeking a 'no arrest or harassment' order in the mutiny case. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner AKM Shahidul Haq said Pintu was arrested by Detective Branch police on charges of abetting mutineers to escape from the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. He was later handed over to Criminal Investigation Department that is investigating the case. Pintu had submitted a petition to the court after his name appeared in the national enquiry committee's report on the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The probe report stated: "Some civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river." Thousands of border guards, guilty and innocent among them, fled the Peelkhana compound in the chaos of the mutiny and its aftermath. While most reported back to duty in the days that followed, authorities have spent months rounding up fugitives. After the government made its report public at the end of May, Pintu, fearing he would be taken into custody in connection with the case, petitioned the High Court for a 'no arrest or harassment' order. The bench gave no ruling on the plea Tuesday
