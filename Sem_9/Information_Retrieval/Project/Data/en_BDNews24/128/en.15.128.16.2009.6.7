 BELGRADE, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia beat Austria 1-0 with a Nenad Milijas penalty in their Group Seven World Cup qualifier on Saturday to stay firmly on course for next year's finals. However, their win was marred by an ankle injury to defender Nemanja Vidic who hobbled off at halftime. Serbia reinforced their hold on the group after the early spot kick settled an uncomfortable evening for the home side, who were under pressure in the closing stages. Serbia are top with 15 points from six matches, five more than France who are second with a game in hand. Third-placed Lithuania, who have nine points from seven games, lost ground after a 1-0 home defeat by Romania, who are level on seven points with Austria. The group winners qualify for the finals directly while the best eight runners-up from the nine groups go through to a playoff. BRIGHTER START The Austrians had made the brighter start with Manuel Ortlechner racing clear and shooting wide from a good position in the second minute. But their early initiative ended abruptly five minutes later when goalkeeper Michael Gspurning precipitated a comedy of errors that led to the penalty. Gspurning brought down Marko Pantelic after giving the ball away with a poor clearance from a back-pass and midfielder Milijas steered his spot kick past the hapless Austria keeper. Yasin Pehlivan then came close with a deflected effort for the visitors before Serbia's Bosko Jankovic hit the woodwork with a swerving free kick at the other end. The passionate 50,000 home fans held their breath late in the game as substitute Marc Janko missed Austria's best two chances to snatch an equaliser. The towering striker rattled the bar with a venomous 25-metre volley in the 76th minute before Vladimir Stojkovic denied him with a late save from close range. Serbia coach Radomir Antic said Vidic was unlikely to play any part in Wednesday's match in the Faroe Islands. "It doesn't look good and the chances that Vidic will be fit for the Wednesday game are very slim to say the least," he told a post-match news conference. "There is a huge swelling, he will go for a scan but the early signs are not encouraging at all," Antic added
