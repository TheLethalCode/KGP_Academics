<TITLE> Complacency and bad judgment derail England </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Complacency succeeded by poor judgment played a large role in England's shock loss to the Netherlands in the opening game of the Twenty20 World Cup. England lacked any real urgency after Ravi Bopara and Luke Wright had given them a perfect platform at Lord's on Friday evening with an opening stand of 102. Their batsmen failed to clear the boundary once, a failing noted by the 1,000 or so Dutch spectators clad in bright orange. The Dutch batsmen hit four sixes. The running between the wickets was also indifferent and several batsmen, including captain Paul Collingwood, perished to poor shots. A final score of 162 for five when 180 had looked probable and 200 possible did not frighten the Dutch who went for their shots from the start. "Their batting did surprise us," said Collingwood. "Every time we got a wicket we thought, right, we're on top of them here, but every batsman seemed to score boundaries from ball one." England, who took the field without their most dangerous batsman Kevin Pietersen, who had suffered a recurrence of his achilles tendon injury, opted to play leg-spinner Adil Rashid ahead of their number one spinner Graeme Swann. Rashid did not bowl badly, taking one for 36 from his four overs. But he did not bowl particularly well either and, bewilderingly, Collingwood turned to him in the vital middle overs with light rain falling. Predictably, Rashid found the ball difficult to control and the Dutch could not believe their luck, scoring freely without having to take undue chances. They were also able to keep the scoreboard ticking over with singles to a field which seemed to be set too deep. Collingwood unwittingly betrayed the assumptions of an easy victory which had under-pinned the England selection at the post-match news conference. "We were taking a bit of a gamble with Adil today," he said. "He's not played a lot but we thought that exposure would do him the world of good." As soon as he had opened his mouth, Collingwood realised he had said the wrong thing. "I probably used the wrong word there, if I could take that back I would," he said. "We took a gamble on his experience, not on the skills he can produce." There will be no more gambles on Sunday when England must beat Pakistan at the Oval (1630 GMT) or make an inglorious exit from the tournament
