 LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan, Thu Jun 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British troops in Afghanistan face a tough summer of fighting even as they welcome some 10,000 US Marines to reinforce their efforts to stabilise violent Helmand province, Britain's ambassador said. About 8,000 British troops are deployed in southern Helmand, a third of which is under Taliban control, according to provincial officials. A total of 166 British soldiers have been killed in fighting in Afghanistan since 2001. "The situation in the south has been extremely tough in the past few years, violence has gone up and up. There are some indications that it might be peaking, but it's too early to say and we are in for a tough fighting season this year," ambassador Mark Sedwill told Reuters. "We are in for a tough summer, anyone who doesn't welcome the inflow of a substantial US military presence is completely misreading the situation." Violence has grown even as the number of foreign troops has increased to almost 80,000 this year, reaching its worst levels since US-led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban's Islamist government in late 2001. Britain has said it will temporarily increase its forces in Afghanistan by 700 and direct more aid to border areas of Pakistan to counter a growing Taliban threat there. Sedwill said the influx of US military and civilian personnel, which has started and will continue into August, will not overshadow Britain's work in the province so far. "It's always easy for people to say if we've got a bigger American effort here that just means everyone else isn't playing their part. That's just silly. It is a NATO operation," Sedwill told Reuters on the sidelines of a ceremony on Wednesday marking the opening of Helmand's first civilian air field. The proportion of US troops from the influx who will be in combat units will be slightly smaller than Britain's existing combat contribution in Helmand, which is under 4,000, he said. "(The US military) will bring in a huge amount of helicopters, which we don't have enough of, and they will bring in a huge number of resources into the airfield in Bastion and into the airfield in Kandahar for instance," Sedwill added. As part of its strategy review of Afghanistan, Washington is sending an extra 21,000 troops to help curb a growing insurgency which has hamstrung foreign forces in the past two years. Analysts have said that British troops have been over-stretched and poorly equipped to deal with the virulence of the insurgency in Helmand, Afghanistan's largest province. Sedwill said the British and US militaries will work together to coordinate operations. "What we've done is work really closely with the US Marine Corps ... Our militaries will in effect control different zones of Helmand because it is very important that you have clear lines of control and command in those zones but making sure we're working totally in synch along the boundary," Sedwill said. "Some of the operations you'll see our military, and the US military carrying out in the next few months, will be totally coordinated," he said, adding that more Afghan troops in the area will also help turn the course of the conflict in Helmand. Sedwill said that, despite the number of casualties sustained by British troops in Afghanistan, morale among officers was high and hoped that 2009 would be a turning point in the war. "I haven't come across a single soldier, certainly none of the commanders, who see the US military influx as anything other than very good news because it beefs up the military effort and it gives the opportunity to really acceler
