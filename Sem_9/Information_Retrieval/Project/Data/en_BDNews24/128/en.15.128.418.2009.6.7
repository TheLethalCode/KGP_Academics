 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police detained one Arif Hossain, allegedly an associate of Mumbai underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Dhaka early on Sunday. Forty-year old Arif was arrested at a house near Mohammadpur Krishi Market, where he has been living since 2001. Additional deputy police commissioner Mahbub Alam of the DB told bdnews24.com that Arif had been sheltering in Dhaka since the murder of Bhaskar Shethi, a Mumbai businessman. "We suspect he was connected with several other murders also," Mahbub said. At noon, Arif was presented before the reporters. He confessed to murdering Bhaskar Shethhi and said as soon as he had got bail in the case in 2001, he escaped to Bangladesh. He had worked as a butcher at the Mohammedpur Krishi Market and he got enrolled as a voter too posing as a Bihari, Arif said. Police said since arriving in Dhaka, Arif, operating under Chhota Shakil, the sword arm of Karachi-based fugitive Dawood Ibrahim, started recruiting terrorists as his other cohorts arrived later. Arif married a woman of Bhola and they had a child. He did not engage in any job or business here, being the recipient of Tk 16,000 every month from Mumbai. After the arrest of Daud Merchant and his associates, he was contacting various places for legal assistance to release them. He was in regular touch with Chhota Shakil, the police official said. Mahbub added that Arif would be taken to the court in the afternoon for having him remanded. The police on May 27 arrested Daud Merchant, assistant of Dawood Ibrahim, at Brahmanbaria. Two other associates were also arrested later. bdnews24
