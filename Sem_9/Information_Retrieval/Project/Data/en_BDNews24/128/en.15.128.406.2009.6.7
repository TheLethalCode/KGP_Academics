<TITLE> Security has worsened in five months: Moudud </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Moudud Ahmed has alleged that the law and order has worsened severely since the new government headed by arch-rival Awami League took office. "The law and order has deteriorated severely in the last five months. The ministers have also conceded that," he told a discussion at National Press Club. "The miscreants are carrying out grabbing, extortion and many other crimes through the direct and indirect backing by the government," he said. The government is failing to control its partisans, the former law minister said. He also said extrajudicial killings, which peaked during 2001-2006 BNP-led government, violated human rights. The BNP leader asked the government to allow the police to do it job fearlessly. The former minister questioned the efficiency of the ministers. "It is not possible to run the government with such novices. The Awami League's central working committee also put question marks about the acceptability of the ministers." He asked the government not to play game with the country. The Centre for Democracy and Peace Studies organised the discussion session.
