<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With their place at the 2010 World Cup finals now safely in the bag, Australia are determined to cement their status as one of the most improved teams in world soccer. The Socceroos sealed their spot in next year's finals in South Africa after a goalless draw against Qatar in Doha on Saturday. They became the second team to qualify for the showcase soccer tournament, two hours after Group A rivals Japan. "It's amazing  it's an unbelievable achievement," captain Lucas Neill told the Australian Associated Press. "We proved that over all the qualifying games and we deserve to be here, we deserve to be one of the first teams in the World Cup." The Socceroos have not conceded a single goal in the final stage of Asian qualifiers and sealed their place with two games still to go. There was no repeat of the euphoric celebrations when Australia ended a 32-year drought by qualifying for the 2006 World Cup after a penalty shootout against Uruguay when they were still in the Oceania confederation. The overwhelming feeling this time around was more relief than jubilation. "It's a boyhood dream, second time in a row now Australia is going to the World Cup," said Neill. "It's all about the nation creating some more memories like we did in the last one. I can't wait, it's going to be fantastic." Four years ago Australia were the last team to qualify and have had to endure a series of excruciating playoff losses against Scotland, Argentina, Iran and Uruguay in previous campaigns. At the 2006 World Cup, Australia surprised most pundits by making the round of 16, losing to eventual champions Italy after conceding a contentious late penalty. Striker Harry Kewell said the Socceroos' smooth performances in qualifying was further proof Australia were one of the big improvers in world soccer. "It's a respect thing if you make back-to-back World Cups," he said. "Only the great teams make it every four years." Pim Verbeek said the Socceroos were already setting their goals high for South Africa. "We have to go there and do it better than last time," he said. "I think you have to make targets in life and the players are going to do that also. "Now that we have qualified we want to do better than last time, and we will do everything possible to do that.
