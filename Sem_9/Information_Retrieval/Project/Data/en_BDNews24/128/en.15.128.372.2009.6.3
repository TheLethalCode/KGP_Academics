<TITLE> Delwar slams seat offer as 'carrot dangling' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain accused the government on Wednesday of 'dangling a carrot' in the ongoing seat dispute in parliament. "The ruling party is saying that another seat 'may' be given to the opposition," said Delwar, the day before the House was set to sit in its second session. "They are only dangling a carrot in the name of solving the seat distribution problem." "In fact, they do not want the opposition in parliament, so that stories of repression and the real problems of the people are not brought to the floor," claimed Delwar. Only one more Speaker Abdul Hamid has made it clear that the BNP will get one more front-row seat in parliament, two fewer than the main opposition party requested. But with the second session, popularly known as the budget session, starting Thursday, the main opposition is yet to decide whether it would join the session with demands unmet. "I cannot give them more than one seat in the front row," Hamid told reporters on Wednesday at his office. With this BNP would have five front-row seats although the party has demanded seven out of the total nine on the front row to the left of the speaker's chairknown as the 'opposition bench'. The speaker said he could offer the BNP an additional seat as Zillur Rahman's became vacant after his election as president. "BNP's Moudud Ahmed and Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar will sit on the front bench while Mofazzel Hossain Kaykobad will have to go behind," said Hamid. "In addition, one Jatiya Party MPH M Ershad, GM Quader or Mojibor Rahmanwill have to go behind since I am thinking of giving Roushan Ershad a front-row seat," he said. Dispute drags on The ruling Awami League and the main opposition BNP have been unable to settle the seat row since the new parliament convened in January. At present, the BNP has four front row seats on the row facing the treasury bench, the Liberal Democratic Party has one, and the others on the row belong to the AL-led ruling coalition members. Some have blamed immediate past speaker Md Jamiruddin Sircar for the instigating the dispute. The Jatiya Sangsad has a total of 29 front row seats that includes ruling and opposition benchesplaced in the form of a horse shoe. Sircar, now a BNP MP, using his discretionary power as Speaker, gave all front and second row seats at the left of the Speaker to the opposition. But Awami League objected, saying the opposition party should not get more than three front row seats as the party had won only 30 seats in last December's elections against the total 300. Hamid reduced BNP's front row seats to four from eight at the start of the ninth parliament. BNP disputed the arrangement, saying the bench opposite the treasury was the 'opposition bench' after all, and began a parliamentary boycott on Jan 28. They returned to the House on Feb 23 as Hamid assured that he would give the opposition more seats if they joined the budget session. bd
