 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)Members of parliament will not get the facility anew to import duty-free cars, the parliament commission has decided. The commission, which approves all parliament's spending every fiscal year, instead gave the nod on Wednesday to giving all MPs vehicles from the government's transport pool. "No, MPs will not get to import duty-free cars," commission head and speaker Abdul Hamid said of the controversial allowance that has seen more than one MP charged with corruption for abusing the facility. "Why should they?" "They will get vehicles, preferably jeep-types, with drivers," Hamid told reporters after the commission's meeting at his office. He said there would also be ceiling on fuel costs for the MPs. "Those holding offices such as speaker, deputy speaker, ministers and state ministers and others will not come under this as they already enjoy transport facilities," Hamid said. The speaker said the chairmen of the parliamentary standing committees would also be given vehicles on a priority basis along with a gunman. "The chairmen will use a flag inscribed with the monogram of the parliament secretariat," said the speaker. He said he would take necessary measures so that the standing committee chairmen could get vehicles after July. "The commission has approved the proposal for setting up offices for the MPs in Dhaka as well as in their respective constituencies," said Hamid. Hamid had earlier announced that his secretariat would turn the old MP hostels into MPs offices in Dhaka. He also said each of the MPs would get an office at upazilla headquarters in their respective constituencies. The commission also approved about Tk 60 crore budget, 23 percent more than the current financial year, for the parliament secretariat for the 2009-10 fiscal year. The commission did not approve the secretariat's proposal for upgrading the status of the opposition chief whip to the rank of a deputy minister, the speaker said.
