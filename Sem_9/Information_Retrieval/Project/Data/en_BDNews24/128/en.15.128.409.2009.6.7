 LA PAZ, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivia stumbled to a 1-0 home loss to a well-prepared Venezuela in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday, the high-flying hosts given a cold dose of reality after their stunning 6-1 win over Argentina two months ago. Bolivia contributed to their downfall by missing a penalty and scoring an own goal in a disastrous first-half spell as their lingering hopes of qualify for South Africa effectively vanished. Venezuela, who had never picked up a point in La Paz previously, sent an alternative squad made up mainly of players from their under-20 team. They spent three weeks training at high altitude, including two in La Paz, for the game at 3,600 metres above sea level. Argentina, on the other hand, sent their regular team who had played only four days previously and arrived in La Paz two hours before kickoff. The win boosted Venezuela's chances of qualifying for their first World Cup, leaving them with 16 points from 13 games, one behind fifth-placed Uruguay. The top four teams in the 10-team group qualify directly for next year's finals and the fifth plays off against the fourth side from CONCACAF for another place. Bolivia were awarded a penalty in the 21st minute when Alex Da Rosa was fouled but Marcelo Martins fired over. Twelve minutes later, Bolivia pressed the self-destruct button again when Ronald Rivero turned Luis Manuel Seijas' cross into his own net. Bolivia dominated the second half and Martins wasted several chances before he was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 80th minute. Venezuela goalkeeper Rafael Romo ensured the points with three superb saves in the dying minutes. Bolivia have 12 points
