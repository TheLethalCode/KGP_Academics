 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  Town High School of Barisal came from behind to emerge champions in the Citycell National School Football Championships with a 3-1 win over Victoria High School of Moulvibazar in the final on Wednesday. Ali struck twice while Jummon netted the other for champions while Khaled Ahmed scored the lone goal for the runners-up at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Victoria HS deservedly took a 16th minute lead when Khaled capitalising on a cross from Sajal, placed the ball past goalkeeper Rasel Ahmed to put Moulvibazar's lads ahead. After the break, Town Hall stepped up their attacks and went close to finding an equaliser thrice, but Victoria High goalkeeper Jahed foiled all the attempts to keep them in the match. Jahed finally failed to restrict Ali, who levelled the margin in the 67th minute and doubled the lead ten minutes later after dancing past Jahed to place the ball home. Jummon widened the margin in the injury time as the striker swung a free kick from a difficult angle to find the top of the far post though Jahed rose high to stop the shot, but could not stop the curling strike. Sports minister Ahad Ali Sarkar witnessed the match and distributed prizes among the winners as the chief guest while Citycell CEO Michael Seymour was present as the special guest. BFF vice-president Badal Roy, BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi and tournament committee deputy chairman Sheikh Mohammad Aslam were also present. bd
