<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  The national booters will undergo a three-week conditioning camp in Cox's Bazar from June 15 to raise their power and stamina. The decision was taken at the National Team Management Committee meeting held on Sunday at BFF House. "We will declare a 30-member squad on Monday for the SAFF Championship as well as the South Asian Games and the under-23 players may get priority in the selection," said BFF general secretary Al Musabiir Sadi after the meeting. After the camp the players will train for three months at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. "The national team may take part in the Merdeka Cup in the latter part of July subject to an invitation from Malaysia," said Sadi. "If they don't participate in Merdeka Cup, the team will play a few practice matches in Thailand and BFF member Golam Rabbani Helal will take care of it." Coaching staff Shafiqul Islam Manik, however, has termed it a pre-season training as most of the players would be involved in the domestic competitions. "It is a just pre-season training which will help the clubs as well as the national side. Besides, trainer Ariel Colman has sought some time to make the players fit which is a concern for us," said Manik adding that a couple of players from the 25-member squad for the AFC Challenge Cup might be dropped and new faces from BKSP might get the nod. The BFF general secretary informed that the meeting had recommended to increase the salary of the national players to Tk 15,000 from Tk 10,000. Sadi also said they have estimated budget of Tk 50 lakh for the three-month training. bd
