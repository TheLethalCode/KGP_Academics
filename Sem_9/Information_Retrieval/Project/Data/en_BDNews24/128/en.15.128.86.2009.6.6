<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Svetlana Kuznetsova won her second grand slam title when she outplayed fellow Russian and world number one Dinara Safina 6-4 6-2 in the French Open final on Saturday. The seventh-seeded Kuznetsova, U.S. Open champion in 2004, dictated the points consistently and prevailed after 74 minutes on Centre Court to deny Safina a first grand slam title. "Today, when I was coming out on court I knew that everything would be alright," said Kuznetsova. "I was pretty calmed down. "(Safina) is better than me at the moment, she is the world number one, but she was too tight." For Safina it was a familiar story, following her defeat by Ana Ivanovic in last year's final. "I am in the same situation as last year," she told the 15,000 crowd. "Hopefully one day I can win here." Following an early exchange of breaks, Kuznetsova took control, stealing her opponent's serve again in the eighth game with a backhand winner, only for Safina to break back to love. Kuznetsova kept up the pressure and snatched the opening set with her first opportunity. Safina looked in distress in her third grand slam final and, with no plan B to counter Kuznetsova's creative game, she could not turn the tide. Kuznetsova broke for 4-2 when her opponent fired a forehand wide and she did not look back, wrapping it up when Safina doubled faulted on the first match point
