 DHAKA, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) has lost seven more Bangladesh players after they opted to cancel their contracts, Bangladesh Cricket Board officials said on Saturday. Bangladesh slapped a 10-year ban on 14 players after they joined the ICL last year, with former skipper Habibul Bashar leading a newly-formed Dhaka Warriors. Bashar and four other players terminated their ICL contracts in May after the BCB offered amnesty if they met a June 15 deadline. However, the board has said they would not be eligible for national selection until next year. Seven more players, including batsmen Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, and Nazim Uddin, and all-rounder Farhad Reza, filed their applications a week ahead of the deadline. "With them, all (of) the 14 but two have applied to return to the national team, cancelling contracts with ICL, and the Board is likely to consider their applications" a senior BCB official told reporters. "We hope the remaining two players will also apply soon to return to the official cricket," another official said. The International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected the league's application for recognition in April
