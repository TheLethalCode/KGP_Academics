 Mintu Chowdhury bdnews24.com Chittagong Correspondent Chittagong, June 05 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong city may plunged into a environmental disaster unless authorities do something fast about the massive air, water and sound pollution, a top environment official warns. The city is exposed to threat because of pollution far beyond tolerable level. The tolerable level of harmful particles in the air is 200 microgram per cubic metre while it hits 1168 in Agrbad Badamtali area,1057 at AK Khan Square,1112 at Port Connecting Road and 1056 at Nasirabad industrial area. The number of asthma and bronchitis patients is rising alarmingly because of huge presence of toxic particles in the air. The tolerable level of sound is 60 decibels during daytime but it ranges from 72 to 80 decibels in the commercial areas of the city. Drinking water in the port city is not also safe, an environment official said A test conducted by the Department of Environment over the last three months discovered the alarming presence of harmful coli form of bacteria in the water of city's restaurant and houses. The test found only 17 out of 88 samples, more than one fifth, of drinking water germ-free. The divisional director of Department of Environment, Abdus Sobhan, told bdnews24.com, "A terrible picture has emerged after the environment department tested sample in different areas of the city." "Overall public health is in no way sound in the port city. It is not possible for government alone to tackle the pollution," Concerted and planned efforts were necessary for checking it, he added The Karnafully and other feeder canals are getting polluted thanks to the ceaseless disposal of industrial toxic wastes while hill digging is going on unabated despite frequent drive. Despite being greener and opener than capital Dhaka, Chittagong is becoming uninhabitable because of unplanned urbanisation, all-consuming grasp of selfish people and above all, lack of public awareness. The medicine specialist of Chittagong Medical College Hospital Dr MA Hasan told bdnews24.com, "Public health is at great risk now because of air, water and sound pollution." "The city dwellers are getting attacked with many complex diseases." Hasan said recently the number of diarrhoea and asthma patients were soaring. The school-going children were the worst victims, he added bdnews24
