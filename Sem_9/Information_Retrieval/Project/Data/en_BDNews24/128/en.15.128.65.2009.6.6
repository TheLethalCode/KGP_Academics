 By David Alexander CAEN, France, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Saturday he wanted to see "serious, constructive" Middle East peace talks this year aimed at finding a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.

"I don't think that there should be an assumption that we will simply continue down a path in which North Korea is constantly destabilizing the region and we just react in the same ways ... We are not intending to continue a policy of rewarding provocation." Obama and Sarkozy also mentioned the diplomatic standoff over Iran's nuclear program, on which Obama said he was prepared to hold talks "without preconditions."
