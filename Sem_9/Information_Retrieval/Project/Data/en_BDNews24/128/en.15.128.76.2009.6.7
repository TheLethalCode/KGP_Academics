<TITLE> Late Bruno Alves goal revives Portugal hopes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TIRANA, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal needed an injury-time headed goal from defender Bruno Alves to beat Albania 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday and keep alive their hopes of reaching next year's tournament in South Africa. Portugal had taken the lead with a Hugo Almeida header in the 27th minute after Jose Bosingwa surged forward to supply the cross. Albania equalised two minutes later when striker Bogdani beat Bruno Alves in the air to head in Skela's cross. Portugal are third in Group One with nine points, behind leaders Denmark on 16 and Hungary with 13 and their last-gasp win in Albania must be followed by victories in their four remaining matches for them to top the standings. The group winners qualify for the finals while the best eight runners-up from the nine groups go through to a playoff. Cristiano Ronaldo drove his team forward in the early stages and was unlucky not to earn a penalty in the 17th minute when he was fouled in one of his many runs into the box. But Portugal's forwards failed to dominate a well-organised and aggressive Albania defence that often resorted to fouls. Portugal's surprise starter Luis Boa Morte was ineffective and playmaker Deco could not initiate flowing moves. Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz replaced Boa Morte with Simao Sabrosa at halftime and Portugal began to created more chances. Simao almost made an instant impact when his powerful drive flew inches over in the 48th minute. Deco forced Albania's Islli Hidi to save his low drive after 51 minutes and moments later the keeper blocked a trademark Ronaldo free-kick. With Nani replacing Ricardo Carvalho in the 76th minute Portugal started relying on crosses into the box, and the tactic paid off in third minute of injury time when Alves headed in the priceless goal from a long cross by Raul Meireles
