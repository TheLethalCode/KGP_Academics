 ASUNCION, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguay were knocked off the top of the South American World Cup qualifying group after a shock 2-0 home defeat to Chile on Sunday. Matias Fernandez and Humberto Suazo scored in each half to keep the visitors on course for their first World Cup finals appearance since 1998. Paraguay are still well-placed to qualify for their fourth successive finals, although they will be worried at having taken only one point from their last three games. Paraguay, who have 24 points from 13 games, dropped behind new leaders Brazil on goal difference. The two teams meet in Recife on Wednesday. Chile are one point behind the leading pair. The top four teams in the 10-team group qualify directly for the World Cup and the fifth plays off against the fourth side from CONCACAF for another place. Fernandez struck first in the 13th minute when he just managed to control Alexis Sanchez's pass and scored with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area. Paraguay, plagued by injuries and suspensions, were denied an equaliser when Gary Medel cleared Nelson Haedo Valdez's header off the line. Chile went further ahead in the 52nd minute when Jean Beausejour crossed from the left and Suazo headed in at the far post
