<TITLE> Dhaka insists on Pakistan apology </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bndews24.com)Bangladesh has reiterated that Pakistan must apologise for the genocide it had committed during the country's independence war in 1971. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain has reasserted Dhaka's position on Islamabad's apology issue a day after a Pakistan foreign ministry official urged Dhaka to "let bygones be bygones". "We have not changed our position on this issue. "Our foreign minister has made it clear to the Pakistan high commissioner when he came to see her (on Tuesday)," the foreign secretary told bdnews24.com on Friday night. "They can say anything from their point of view," he said. Foreign minister Dipu Moni told high commissioner Alamgir Bashar Khan Babar on Tuesday that his country must resolve the issue of apologising for the killings of 3 million people in Bangladesh. A foreign ministry official said Dipu Moni, now in Myanmar, would brief the media on the issue and her Myanmar visit on May 18. Pakistan's leading newspaper Dawn quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit as saying that the apology issue was settled under the April 1974 tripartite agreement involving Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. Basit said Pakistan had condemned and apologised for wrongdoings of its army in Bangladesh. The envoy said the foreign secretaries would take up the issues at the next meeting, the date of which was yet to be fixed. The ruling Awami League, which led the war, has been demanding apology for the killing of three million Bangladeshis and rape of 300,000 women by the Pakistan army during the bloody nine-month war. Pakistan does not recognise the killing of three million Bangladeshis, though. Its former president Gen Parvez Musharraf during his trip to Dhaka in July 2002 apologised to Bangladesh for "developments in 1971".
