<TITLE> No 'crossfire' killings on our watch: Tanjim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed on Sunday said there had been no extra-judicial killings in the country in the last five months since the Awami League-led government came to power. "No 'crossfire' killings have taken place. What the law-enforcing agencies have done, they have done in self-defence in line with the law," the junior minister told reporters after a meeting on road safety at the Secretariat. He said, "Rights groups must realise that these are not incidents of extra-judicial killings." "Hundreds of people are killed in police shootings in different countries; in the US, 600 to 700 people are killed each year," said Tanjim. But, the state minister did concede that suspicious deaths in police custody could only be construed as 'extra-judicial' deaths. "These types of extra-judicial deaths and 'crossfire' killings took place during the regime of previous BNP-Jamaat coalition government, not during our time," he added. He said his government did not condone any extra-judicial action and would not support such measure in future. In Dhaka alone, at least 10 people have been reported dead in recent weeks, in 'exchanges of gunfire' involving Rapid Action Battalion and police. These shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which in the past has also come to connote 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Most recently, controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital last week. Tanjim said the RAB has launched a departmental investigation into the death of the two students. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past decades have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. Tanjim rejoined his office last week ending a four-day drama over his reported resignation. bdnews24.c
