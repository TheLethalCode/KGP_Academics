 BEIRUT, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A surprise victory in Lebanon by an anti-Syrian coalition against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies should be confirmed on Monday with the release of official results of the country's parliamentary election. Officials from rival camps estimated the bloc won around 70 seats in the 128-member assembly in Sunday's vote. Interior Minister Ziad Baroud was set to announce the final results later in the day, officials said. Supporters of the coalition celebrated into the early hours after voters renewed their majority in parliament four years after the "Cedar Revolution" that helped drive Syria's army out of Lebanon and wrest control of the government. The outcome was a blow to Syria and Iran, which support Hezbollah, and welcome news for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which backs the "March 14" bloc, named after the date of a huge rally against Syria's military presence in 2005. The US State Department had no immediate comment on the outcome of the election. Hezbollah and its allies swept the vote in mainly Shi'ite areas, but defeat of their Christian ally, Michel Aoun, in two key districts deprived the alliance of the majority many had predicted. Saad al-Hariri, the Sunni Muslim leader of "March 14", emerged from the poll as frontrunner to lead the new government and follow in the footsteps of his assassinated father Rafik al-Hariri. "Congratulations to Lebanon, congratulations to democracy, congratulations to freedom," the billionaire politician said in a victory speech at his mansion in Beirut shortly after midnight. "There are no winners and losers in this election, the only winner is democracy and the biggest winner is Lebanon," Hariri, 39, said. GUERRILLA ARMY Lebanon's rival camps are at odds over Hezbollah's guerrilla force, which outguns the Lebanese army, and the ties with Syria, which dominated Lebanon for three decades until 2005. The likeliest outcome of the poll is another "national unity" government, analysts say, though its formation might not go smoothly if the Hezbollah camp insists on veto power. The United States, which lists Hezbollah as a terrorist group, has linked future aid to Lebanon to the shape and policies of the next government. Hezbollah, which says it must keep its arms to deter Israel, is part of the outgoing cabinet. The anti-Syrian majority coalition has enjoyed firm backing from many Western countries, as well as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, since the 2005 assassination of Hariri's father. The coalition took power in an election following the killing, but struggled to govern in the face of a sometimes violent conflict with Hezbollah and its allies. Hezbollah and its allies insisted on being given veto power in a unity cabinet -- a demand that caused an 18-month political deadlock until it was granted under a Qatari-brokered deal that followed street fighting in Beirut in May 2008. Tensions in Lebanon mostly have been kept in check since the Qatari-mediated accord dragged the country back from the brink of civil war. A thaw in relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria has also helped maintain stability in recent months
