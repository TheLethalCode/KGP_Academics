 Munshiganj, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  At least 11 people were killed and over a dozen seriously injured as a bus lost control on the Dhaka-Mawa highway and overturned into a roadside ditch filled with rainwater on Sunday night. The fire service was working to rescue passengers or recover dead bodies that might still be trapped in the submerged bus, police said in the early hours of Monday. Assistant police superintendent Md. Faruqee said the death toll may cross 25 as divers and a crane were sent from Dhaka to help the rescuers. The Saudia Paribahan bus carrying 53 passengers was on its way from Chittagong to Barguna, when it hit a motorcycle at Chanbari in Srinagar Upazila at around 11.30pm, Srinagar police officer in charge Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com. The motorcyclist, 27 year-old Srinagar Chhatra League president Zakirul Haque Kusum and his friend 25 year-old 'Ripon' were killed on the spot. Among the dead bus passengers, nine were recovered from the submerged vehicle after the crash, but could not be immediately identified, said Hossain. "Rescue and recovery work is being hampered now because of the rain," he added. Munshiganj deputy commissioner Mosharraf Hossain and local MP Sukumar Ranjan Ghose visited the scene on hearing of the accident. bdn
