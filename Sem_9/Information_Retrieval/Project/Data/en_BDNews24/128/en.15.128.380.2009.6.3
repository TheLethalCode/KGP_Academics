<TITLE> Pinak on Tipaimukh: Indian control won't mean water held back </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)  India will have sole control of the flow of water at the proposed Tipaimukh dam, but will not hold back water, said Indian high commissioner to Dhaka, Pinak Ranjan Chakrabarti, on Wednesday. The flow of river water and flood control will remain in the hands of India, he told reporters after a courtesy call with communications minister Syed Abul Hossain at the ministry. But, he said, Tipaimukh dam is a hydro-electric project. It will generate electricity from the water flow, but will not hold it back, said Chakravarty. By some accounts, India expects to generate around 1500 megawatts of hydropower from the project. The hydro-electric project by India concerns many in Bangladesh where three riversSurma, Kushiara and the mighty Meghnalie downstream of the proposed dam across the river Barak in the Indian state Monipur. Experts in the country say Tipaimukh dam will reduce the natural monsoon flood patterns of the Sylhet region adversely affecting cultivation and livelihoods in the area on a vast scale. They also fear India could hold up water flow during the dry season. Transit Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, meanwhile, was asked by reporters outright whether Bangladesh was giving India transit facilities by road and rail. "Why shouldn't we? It is profitable for Bangladesh," said the minister of the much discussed transit question that has also stirred controversy since the new government came to power in January. Concerns remain that Delhi would benefit more than Dhaka from such a move. "Don't you want Bangladesh to profit through transit, new roads and rail services?" asked the minister. "Bangladesh has sought financial and technical assistance from India for the development of railway communications since the Indian railway is a profitable sector," said the minister. There have been discussions about setting up new roads and rail lines because Bangladesh wants an alternative road for Benapole land port for increasing revenue, he added. b
