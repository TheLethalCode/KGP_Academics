 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)The government has named Lieutenant General Muhammad Abdul Mubin as new army chief. Gen Mubin, former GOC in Jessore and Chittagong, was made , Principal Staff Officer to the Armed Forces Division exactly a year ago, on June 4, 2008, in a major reshuffle of top army posts. He will replace General Moeen U Ahmed, whose extended term ends on June 13. Mubin made a well-received televised statement on the night of Feb 27 to clarify that the 'general amnesty' the government had declared during the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny did not mean that rebel BDR border guards involved in killings, arson and other crimes would go unpunished. Moeen U Ahmed is widely regarded as having had a key role in the '1/11 takeover' and formation of the new caretaker government after the state of emergency was imposed on the day in 2007. The unprecedented two-year caretaker administration came to be called the 'army-installed' government, while Moeen's speeches on national and political matters raised question as to his intentions. He was repeatedly forced to deny any possibility of an army takeover during the two turbulent years. On April 6 last year, the Moeen's term was extended by another year. The extension took effect from June 15 that year and ends on June 13. Mubin, meanwhile, served as the coordinator of the national coordination committee against corruption during the caretaker government's anticorruption drive against political bigwigs and businessmen. A close associate told bdnews24.com on Thursday that Gen Mubin's family and friends were calling and visiting to congratulate him on his new assignment. bdnews24.
