<TITLE> American Muslims 'still remain a suspicious minority' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The election of Barack Obama last year raised hopes of a new beginning for American Muslims, who were being treated with suspicion ever since the attack by some Muslim terrorists eight years ago. But five months after his inauguration as president of the United States, the cloud over them has not yet lifted. A new report by the American Civil Liberties Union said on Monday that Muslims and their charities in America still remain a target of arbitrary interrogation and probe by law enforcement agencies. Not surprisingly, this has led to interference with the Muslims' religious freedom. The ACLU report says that the law enforcement agencies apply the antiterrorism statutes in a discriminatory manner, which is often coupled with a lack of due process. This, in turn, has starved Islamic charities of money and impeded Muslims' ability to fulfill zakat, their religious requirement to make charitable donations. The report is based on interviews with more than 100 Muslim community leaders as well as experts on antiterrorism laws and regulations. Though it gives no estimate of the decline in donations to Muslim groups, it says a total of nine Islamic charities have closed as a result of government action against them since the Sept. 11 attacks. That action ranges, the report said, from declaring a group to be under investigation to designating it a terrorist organization and freezing its assets. "While there is a legitimate concern about the use of charitable funds to finance terrorism, it does not outweigh the rights of American Muslims to fulfill their religious obligations or override constitutional requirements for due process," said the author, Jennifer Turner, the A.C.L.U.'s human rights researcher. President Obama mentioned the issue in his speech in Cairo this month. "In the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation," Obama said. "That is why I am committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat." The report notes that independent bodies like the Sept. 11 commission have found that evidence used to seize assets is often secret, making it impossible to challenge, and has in some cases included hearsay or been based on news reports. Advocates for Muslim donors and organizations say the rules governing charitable giving are opaque or poorly defined. Donors could, for instance, find themselves in trouble for past gifts to an organization newly designated a terrorist group. "It's absolute madness how this policy has been put together and practiced," said Maja Freij, chief financial officer at Access, a large Arab-American social services group based in Michigan. "It makes you guilty by association, offers no due process and lacks checks and balances." Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, said, "American Muslims with U.S. passports are returning from abroad and being asked about their charitable donations by customs and immigration agents.
