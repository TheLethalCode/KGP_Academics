 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) licensed 53 companies for captive power generation on Tuesday. BERC chairman Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com, "If all the companies, those that have been licensed, start power generation the crisis will be reduced to some extent. Some of them are already in operation and generating power." He said the licensed companies will be able to add another 125 megawatts captive power, when operated at full swing. In total 61 companies were awarded licenses on Tuesday, in an open meeting, four to run CNG stations, 53 for captive power generation, one rental power plant (RPP), two small power plants (SPP) and one company of Chittagong EPZ. The government already has signed deal with the RPP and SPP to purchase the power, Rahman said. The total production capacity of these captive, RPP and SPP companies are 260 megawatts. Most of these companies are now in operation, but another 125 megawatt is expected to be added. The capacity of the captive power plants is between 1.03 to 6.19 MW. The RPP company of Shikalbaha is of 55 MW capacity. Rahman said, "This will see an increase not only in power generation, but also job opportunities. The export oriented companies will be able to run smoothly." As per government rule, captive power generating companies are supposed to utilise self-produced electricity during peak hours, and cannot use any power from the national grid. bdn
