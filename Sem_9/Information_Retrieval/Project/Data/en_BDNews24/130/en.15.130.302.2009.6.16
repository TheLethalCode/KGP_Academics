<TITLE> Iraqis take control of Baghdad's Green Zone </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Tue Jun 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As the armored car carrying Westerners cut to the front of the line at a checkpoint into Baghdad's heavily-fortified Green Zone, an enraged Iraqi leapt from his BMW and yelled at the occupants. "Do that again and I'll call General Farouk. He'll take all your cards," the man shouted, before returning to his car. He was talking about the cards issued by the US military that since the 2003 invasion have placed mainly foreign security contractors and people associated with US forces above Iraqi law -- and at the front of every queue. But as US soldiers pull out of towns and cities this month, they are handing control back to Iraqi security forces. The balance of power is changing and Multinational Force Iraq (MNF-I) cards, which once guaranteed swift passage in a separate lane past waiting Iraqis, have lost their clout.

Journalists were called to a press conference on Monday with Iraq's defense and interior ministers alongside General Ray Odierno, the top US commander in Iraq. Such news conferences have been routinely held at CPIC, the US-run Combined Press Information Center, and that was where the US military initially told reporters to go. Later, amid considerable confusion, the venue was switched to the press center at the Iraqi Council of Ministers building. The message, encapsulated in a joke told by Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh at the beginning of the press conference, was clear. "I'm sorry for the delay. There are new procedures and the general had to get permission to enter the building," he said as reporters chuckled and the towering Odierno, listening to an Arabic translation through headphones, smiled slig
