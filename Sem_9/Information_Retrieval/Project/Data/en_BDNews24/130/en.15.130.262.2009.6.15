<TITLE> Ashraful favours Bangladeshi ICL players </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh cricket captain Mohammad Ashraful on Monday said that he felt there were advantages of having Bangladeshi ICL players in his side, but not before they proved themselves in domestic cricket. Asked whether Bangladesh would follow in the footsteps of Pakistan, who allowed the rebel cricketer like Abdul Razzak to join the national team, the Bangladesh captain said that he had no idea on with what plans the cricket board had. "I don't know the BCB plan, but they were out of action for eight to nine months and they first have to perform in domestic cricket and then they will be considered by the selectors and the board so far," said Ashraful. The rebel cricketers have to spend a cooling period until December this year before being considered for the national side. Following the disastrous performance against lowly Ireland in the ICC World Twenty20 in England, Ashraful's men are gearing up for the upcoming away series against West Indies in July. "We needed them very much when they quitted from the national side and we also won in the one-day international after their departure. This time those players in the squad have also been playing good cricket," said the top order batsman adding that the return of the rebel cricketers to the national side would boost their confidence level. BCB spokesman Jalal Younus also echoed Ashraful views though he said that the board had yet to take any decision on the early return of the rebel players. "They were out of cricket for eight months so far and there is no way at the moment to judge them on performance or fitness," the BCB media committee chairman Younus told bdnews24.com adding that the players would have to prove their fitness level first. "However, the board will take a positive decision in the greater interest of cricket as well as country," said Younus adding that the board might meet in the later part of June or the first week of July. Ashraful also did not conceal the matter that a rift between the mainstream cricketers and the rebels had been created. "It would not be a genuine statement if I say there has been no gap with the Bangladeshi ICL players and I will say of course a distance had been developed with them after their joining the ICL," said the 24-year-old cricketer adding that they made comments about the board, selectors, captain as well as other players when they joined the unrecognised league. The Bangladesh captain also said that the ICL cricketers would now have to initiate ways to reduce to the gap. Meanwhile, all 14 cricketers scrapped their ICL contracts to receive the general amnesty declared by the BCB last month. The board in a statement on Monday also said, "As they have fulfilled the requirements to avail the amnesty, the BCB therefore recognises that these players are eligible to participate in all forms of domestic cricket with effect from June 16, 2009." The cricketers who returned to domestic cricket are: Habibul Bashar, Alok Kopali, Aftab Ahmed, Shahriar Nafees Ahmed, Nazim Uddin, Mohammed Rafique, Farhad Reza, Tapash Baisya, Mohammad Sharif, Dhiman Ghosh, Musharraf Hossain, Monjurul Islam, Mahbubul Karim and Golam Mabud. bd
