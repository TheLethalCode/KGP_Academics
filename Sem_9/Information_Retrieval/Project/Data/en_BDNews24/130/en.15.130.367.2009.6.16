<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 16 (bdnews24.com)The family of a Dhaka Polytechnic student killed in a RAB encounter on May 27, has filed a murder case against 11 people, including 10 RAB-2 members, said Jinnah's brother-in-law Jasim Uddin on Tuesday. Two students were shot dead in the encounter, 22 year-old Mohammad Ali Jinnah and 23 year-old Mohsin Sheikh. Jinnah's brother-in-law Jashim Uddin filed the murder case with Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court on Monday. Magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque received the case on Tuesday and ordered Tejgaon police to submit a report after investigation. The bench clerk Sakhwat Hossain told bdnews24.com the next hearing for the case was set for August 20. The case alleges: "There were wounds on Jinnah's chest, at the middle and right side, and on the left hand, while scrape marks were visible on his legs." "Wounds were also seen on Mohsin Sheikh's throat and above his naval." "The question is, if the two (Jinnah and Mohsin) had fired and were running away how did they receive gunshots in chest, belly and throat?" asks complainant Jashim in his case statement. "The unnatural death case filed by police at Tejgaon PS mentioned that RAB shot seven bullets during the encounter." "The autopsy report says there were exactly seven bullet injuries on the two dead bodies." "The question is, if it was 'an encounter', how did all the seven bullets hit them?" asks the complainant. "It must be judged at how close range the firing came from to ensure not a single one of RAB's bullets missed their target." "And if it the shooting occurred at such close range, how come none of the RAB members were injured by (Jinnah and Mohsin's alleged gunfire) in the 'encounter'?" Jashim told bdnews24.com that the case accuses RAB deputy assistant directors Furjal Hossain and Mohammad Menhajuddin, habildar Abdur Kuddus, lance nayeks Mohammad Sheker Ali and Emran Ali, sepoy Mansur Elahi, lance corporal Siddikur Rahman, corporal Monirul Islam, police sub-inspector Shafikul Alam, police constable Nurul Huda and polytechnic student Shajib Hossain. bdnews24.
