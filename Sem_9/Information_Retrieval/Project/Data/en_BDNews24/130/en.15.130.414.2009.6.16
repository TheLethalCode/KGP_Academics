<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Tuesday placed former BNP MP Nasiruddin Pintu on remand for another day in the BDR mutiny case. Pintu has already been remanded in custody for questioning twice, each time for four days. He faces charges of inciting rebel border guards to mutiny, encouraging the mutineers' supporters to take part in a procession during the February massacre and helping the mutineers to flee the scene. Magistrate Muminul Hasan of Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court gave another day's remand order on Tuesday. Earlier on Thursday, the investigation officer of the case, senior assistant police superintendent Abdul Qahhar Akand of CID, had petitioned the court for putting Pintu on another seven-day remand. Pintu's lawyers that day requested the court to defer the hearing on the remand prayer as the accused had fallen ill in the court. The lawyers in their petition said placing him on remand would be inhuman if one considered his sickness. The court conceded to their appeal and set Tuesday for the remand hearing. Pintu was brought Tuesday from Kasimpur jail to the court. Advocates Sanaullah Mia and Khorshed Alam, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon, Jainal Abedin Mesbah and others took part at the remand hearing. The counsels said the jail authorities defied court orders given on Thursday to treat the former MP. They said Pintu's treatment was an urgent need and he could be remanded later. The lawyers alleged that it was not the CID but some other government intelligence agency which grilled their client. The court ordered that Pintu be quizzed with caution when the IO submitted another petition seeking permission to take the accused on remand. The BNP leader was arrested on June 3 when he had emerged from the High Court after seeking a 'no arrest or harassment' order in the mutiny case. The national probe report stated: "Some civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river." Thousands of border guards, guilty and innocent among them, fled the Peelkhana compound in the chaos of the mutiny and its aftermath. While most reported back to duty in the days that followed, authorities have spent months rounding up fugitives. b
