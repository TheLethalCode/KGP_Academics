 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com chief correspondent Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)BNP MP Salauddin Quader Chowdhury says the Election Commission and the Speaker do not have the power to strip him of the right to represent his electorate. Speaking to bdnews24.com by phone from Singapore on Tuesday, he claimed that he had not provided any false information in the nomination affidavit about his educational credentials. "Both the commission and the speaker know that they don't have the power to do anything due to legal drawback." The Election Commission said earlier in the day that it will ask speaker Abdul Hamid to strip the MP from Chittagong-2 of parliamentary membership ahead of last December's elections. He went to Singapore on Monday night for medical treatment. CHowdhury said: "I have said in the affidavit that I don't have education qualification. If there is any wrong let the commission prove it and collect my certificates." "Then I will say what is true and what is false." On providing two types of information about his SCC exam, Chowdhury said: "I didn't submit any biography to the commission. It might have collected it from the parliament secretariat. "There is no provision to submit biography to the commission. If the commission does so many things based on it I have nothing to say. Replying to a question, he said: "People have been sending me to the parliament for the last 30 years, which proves my eligibility. I don't think there is any need to prove my eligibility." "I don't feel honoured that I sit in parliament but where I sit becomes celebrated." "I owe people and nobody else as they have sent me to the parliament. The BNP leader said: "My biography is known to the people. A number of newspapers print or publish my biography almost every day to increase their publicity. "If the commission gets the biography from there I have nothing to say on the matter," he said. b
