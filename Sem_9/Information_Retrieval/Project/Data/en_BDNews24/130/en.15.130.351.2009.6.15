<TITLE> India points finger at skipper Dhoni after Twenty20 exit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni bore the brunt of fan and media anger back home after the defending champions were unceremoniously dumped out of the Twenty20 World Cup on Sunday. Surprise winners two years ago, India were installed as one of the favourites to capture the title this time but a three-run loss to England consigned the side to a second straight Super Eights defeat and with no chance of reaching the semi-finals. Security was beefed around Dhoni's home in the eastern city of Ranchi on Monday after scores of fans burnt his effigy, shouted slogans and accused the captain of underestimating England in a must-win situation. "Dhoni took the match lightly, he adopted a casual attitude," Arun Kumar, a young protester, told Reuters in Ranchi. "He is fascinated by the glamour world than cricket," Kumar, added, referring to the huge commercial endorsements the 27-year-old national team skipper enjoys. England bowlers pegged the top order batsmen with incisive short-pitched bowling, successfully borrowing the tactic from West Indies in their earlier Super Eights upset of India. The Indian media singled out Dhoni, hailed as a natural leader since captaining the team to victory in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa, as the villain. Dhoni was blamed for shuffling the order and failing to shake off his own subdued batting form when a captain's innings was badly needed. TACTICAL DISASTER His promotion of young all-rounder Ravinder Jadeja to number four instead of the explosive Yuvraj Singh was also seen as a tactical disaster after the 20-year-old failed to force the pace and left his team mates with too much to do in the final overs. "Why did Dhoni throw Jadeja to the lions," asked one TV channel, while another said: "He (Dhoni) could not tonk the ball, got it all wrong with his strategy..., horrible captaining by Dhoni cost us dear." Former India pacemen Javagal Srinath and Atul Wassan were guarded in their criticism. "This team has been fantastic in the last couple of years," Srinath told the CNN-IBN channel. "The bouncers they used were right on to the batsmen, Indian batsmen had no answer to those." Wassan added: "He (Dhoni) did make some mistakes, but won't just blame the captain, the entire team management is to blame." Dhoni has enjoyed a smooth ride as test captain since the 2007 triumph but has come under scrutiny at this tournament after parading the entire team in an attempt to quash media reports of disharmony between him and deputy Virender Sehwag. His relationship with the media worsened after Sehwag was ruled out due to a shoulder injury and Dhoni and his team management were attacked for being less than forthcoming over the nature of the explosive batsman's problem. Cricket-mad Indian fans are well known for displaying extreme emotions. Angry fans threw stones the homes of some players after the team suffered a shock first round exit in the one-day World Cup two years ago. However, thousands lined up on both sides of the road from Mumbai airport to the stadium when the victorious Twenty20 team took out a victory parade months later
