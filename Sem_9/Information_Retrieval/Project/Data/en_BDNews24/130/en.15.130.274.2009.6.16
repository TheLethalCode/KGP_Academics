 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The government is not considering trial of Gen Moeen U Ahmed, who retired as army chief on Monday, or giving him any mission abroad, said a senior government minister on Tuesday amid speculations following the general's retirement. "Moeen U Ahmed went on retirement on expiry of his tenure as army chief. None but he can say what he will do in future," said Ashraful Islam. "It is beyond any thought of the government to put him on trial." "The issue of making him ambassador is also speculation," said the local government minister and Awami League spokesperson in reply to reporters' questions at the party president's Dhanmondi office But, Ashraf added, the government could appoint him as ambassador if it wished. There was a custom to appoint retired army officials ambassador, which would continue also in future, the minister said. "But no such decision has been taken in this regard." A senior BNP leader, along with the party's youth supporters, have demanded the arrest and trial of the outgoing army chief, "for abusing power by violating the constitution". Moeen, who handed the army over to Gen Md Abdul Mubeen on Monday, is widely considered to have been a key player in the '1/11' changeover in 2007, installing an interim government and in effect ruling the country during the subsequent two-year emergency. He was also seen by many to be the man behind the jailing of top politicians on corruption charges, including the current prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. Moudud Ahmed MP, a senior leader of the opposition BNP, demanded the trial of six army officers including the just-retired Moeen on Monday. Moudud, a former law minister, claimed: "Six army officers including Moeen masterminded and executed all designs and work plans to render Bangladesh into a depoliticised and ineffective state." On CG system There have also been calls to abolish the caretaker government system, most recently from ruling party MP Suranjit Sengupta in parliament on Monday. In reply to a question Tuesday, Ashraf said the government had no thoughts of abolishing the system. "But the Election Commission must be strengthened further." The Awami League-led government came to power in a landslide election last December held by the incumbent EC under the caretaker government. bdne
