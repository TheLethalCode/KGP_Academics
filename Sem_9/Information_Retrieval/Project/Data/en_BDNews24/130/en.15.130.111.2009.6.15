<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary probe team has decided to summon former shipping adviser M A Matin over alleged irregularities in awarding a container handling deal to a private firm on his last day in office. The probe body, formed in May by the parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry, said at a meeting Monday that Matin had hurriedly awarded the contract at the last hour on Jan 6 as the new cabinet was taking oath. "We have decided to summon former adviser Matin before the probe body to clarify why he had awarded the contract to the firm within 24 hours," Mohammad Shah Alam, who heads the investigation committee, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at the parliament building. "Next week we will hold another meeting and decide when M A Matin should turn up to answer our questions," he said. Matin was the head of the corruption-busting body formed by the military-installed caretaker government after the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. Shah Alam said the documents of the Chittagong Port Authority read that Matin had arranged a CPA board meeting in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Ishaq Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, he said. "The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning and the same was sent to Chittagong Port Authority for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. "The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of January 6 and the port authority awarded the works to Ishaq Brothers at 9pm at night. "This is a record in Bangladesh's history. We have to know why the file moved so fast." Matin is the first adviser to that caretaker government to have been charged with corruption.
