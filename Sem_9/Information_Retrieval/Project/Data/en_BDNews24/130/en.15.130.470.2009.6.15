<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia striker Harry Kewell and defender Chris Coyne will miss Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Japan in Melbourne because of fatigue. With Australia already assured of their place at next year's World Cup in South Africa, Socceroos coach Pim Verbeek said the players needed the break after a heavy workload. "Both Harry and Chris played two tough games in a very short period of time," Verbeek said in a statement on Monday. "Besides Mark Schwarzer and Jason Culina, Harry and Chris were the only other two players to play (almost all) of the 180 minutes of the Qatar and Bahrain matches. "Both players are disappointed that they are unable to play in the big match on Wednesday night, but physically it's best if we don't take any risks with them." Japan, who have also qualified, will also be without several first-choice players for the match
