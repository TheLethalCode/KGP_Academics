<TEXT>
 SANAA, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three women thought to be among a group of foreigners kidnapped in recent days have been found dead, believed shot, in north Yemen, a government and a tribal source said Monday. The three women were found near the Saada area, the two sources said. It was unclear whether the three were part of a group of nine kidnapped last week in the Saada area. They included seven Germans, a Briton and a Korean. Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, is struggling with an on-off revolt in the north, a secessionist movement in the south and intensified al Qaeda militancy.
