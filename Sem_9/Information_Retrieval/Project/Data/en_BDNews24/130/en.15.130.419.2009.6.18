 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)BNP MP Salauddin Qader Chowdhury, threatened with losing his seat in parliament, has called for the incumbent election commissioners "to go", claiming they were appointed by former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed. In a statement emailed to bdnews24.com from Singapore on Thursday, he stated his case against the Election Commission's recommendation to have him unseated and referred to Moeen several times as "Satan". He said his nomination papers were accepted "unconditionally" by both the returning officer and the Election Commission to be valid before the elections. He also said the qualifications for an MP candidate were specified in Article 66 of the Constitution, and the EC requirement for educational certificates was "merely a matter of disclosure" but not grounds for disqualification. "The Election Commission ... has absolutely no powers to take any action against me on the grounds that I had made a misdeclaration," said the BNP leader. Chowdhury, who was elected MP from Chittagong-2, said the time to declare his nomination papers unfit was before elections "and certainly not five months after the General Election."

The following day, the Election Commission said it was writing to Speaker Abdul Hamid recommending that Chowdhury stand disqualified as an MP for submitting false information about his education in his affidavit and defying a court order to rectify it. In his statement from Singapore Thursday, Chowdhury said: "The Election Commission was nominated by Gen Moeen`s government to do his bidding, re holding, conduct and results of the General Elections." Referring to Moeen, who retired as army chief on Monday, he said "The Satan of 11th January, 2007, and the perpetrator of `high treason` for deliberate and premeditated violation of the Constitution, has finally departed." "But the nominees of the Satan still remain in office." "It is now high time for General Moeen`s Election Commission to goeach of the Election Commissioners have personally violated their Oath of Office to `protect, preserve and defend the Constitution`  and they are liable for prosecution on grounds of `high treason`," said Chowdhury. He said restoration of a stable democracy in Bangladesh would be "wishful thinking" unless "Gen Moeen and his cohorts are brought to justice." "Unless the country is able to affirm through action that experience of the jungles of dark Africa does not provide licence to graduates of Liberia, Ivory Coast, Congo we would continue to be vulnerable to predators of the Constitution," Chowdhury concluded in his statem
