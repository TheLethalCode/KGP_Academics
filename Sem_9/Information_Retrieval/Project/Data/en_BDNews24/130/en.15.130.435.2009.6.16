 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will ask the Speaker to strip opposition BNP's Salauddin Quader Chowdhury of parliamentary membership for giving false information in his affidavit ahead of last December's elections, a senior election official said on Tuesday. The commission will write a letter to Speaker Abdul Hamid recommending that the senior leader stands disqualified as MP from Chittagong-2 in line with electoral law on submitting such false information and defying a court order to rectify it, commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told bdnews24.com. "We have already decided to send a letter to the speaker." The EC earlier collected the proof of his education qualifications from the parliament secretariat. Chowdhury's biodata for the second, seventh and eighth parliaments are preserved in the library. According to section 12 of the Representation of People Order, an MP will lose membership if he provides false information in the affidavit during the nomination process, amounting to perjury. An EC official said Chowdhury has lost his eligibility though he was elected as MP. Ashfaq Hamid, secretary of the parliament secretariat, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday: "We have supplied the commission necessary information." An EC official told bdnews24.com on Monday that they had received conflicting sets of information about Chowdhury's educational qualifications. The MP mentioned in his affidavit ahead of the ninth parliamentary elections that he did not have any educational qualification. But the biographie preserved in parliament says that he passed his BA Honours. However, there are two separate accounts of his SSC exams. His second parliamentary bio says he passed his SSCs from St Placid School in Chittagong, HSCs from Notre Dame College and his BA Honours from Punjab University. He returned to the country while doing a course at the Lincoln's Inn in London because of the death of his father. Another biography says he passed his matriculation (SSC equivalent) from Sadiq's School of Punjab and came back to the country while studying in a London school due to his father's death. Rival candidates, ahead of last December's election, brought the allegations against Chowdhury and Jatiya Party's Ruhul Amin Hawladar for providing false information in their affidavits. In an EC hearing on Dec 10, the two had said they would submit academic certificates 'as soon as possible'. On April 13 this year, the EC gave the elected MPs a deadline until May 31. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said a letter would be sent to the Speaker if they failed to submit the documents. They failed to do so. After the May 31 deadline passed, the High Court earlier this month ordered the two to clarify their qualifications to the EC. On June 1, commissioner M Sohul Hossain, spoke about the EC decision to write to the parliament secretariat for the information. bdnews24.
