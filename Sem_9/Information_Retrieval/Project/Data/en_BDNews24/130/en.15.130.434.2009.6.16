<TITLE> Parliamentary team to visit Tipaimukh site </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary panel on water resources ministry has decided to send a team to India to witness the construction of the controversial Tipaimukh Dam in Bangladesh's upstream. But the committee has yet to fix the date of the trip. "A team of not more than 10 members, headed by the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources ministry, will go to India to witness the Tipaimukh project," Abdur Razzaq, the committee chairman, told reporters on Tuesday after the meeting at the parliament building. "Two opposition MPs, Water Development Board officials and experts will be included in the team". "We want to include some impartial experts," he said without defining who the "impartial" experts will be. The chairman said they would send their recommendations to the prime minister's office for diplomatic contact. "Then the date will be fixed." Razzaq, a former water resources minister, blamed the previous BNP-led government and its minister Hafiz Uddin Ahmed for "agreeing" with India on the Tipaimukh Dam. "We have come to know that the hydro-electric project (Tipaimukh Dam) went ahead as per the discussion with the resolutions of joint river commission in New Delhi in 2003," Razzaq claimed. "Then the water resources minister major Hafiz led the JRC talks," he said. "They had said nothing then, (but) now he is very vocal. "He could have informed the nation about the project at that time," said the chairman. Razzaq said the Indian authorities were yet to start the implementation of the project. "Any experts in the television channels say that they don't know about the project. But they talk against the project. "I request all to not talk (on the issue) without studying about the same," he said. The Indian government in 2003 initiated construction of the Tipaimukh Dam on Indian Borak river which has entered Bangladesh as the Surma, the sole source of bulk water going to hundreds of water bodies and rivers in the greater Sylhet region. India is yet to provide Bangladesh information on the proposed dam on a common river despite Bangladesh's repeated request. New Delhi says the project will not hamper Bangladesh water availability in the downstream. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina last month announced that a parliamentary team would go to India to witness the controversial project. The Indian authorities proposed Bangladesh sending a parliamentary team apparently to allay Dhaka's fear of environmental catastrophe in the Sylhet region.
