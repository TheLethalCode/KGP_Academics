 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP parliamentary party has demanded former army chief Moeen U Ahmed, who retired on Monday, be immediately put on trial. "General Moeen, and others, have seriously undermined the goodwill and heritage of a national institution by committing crimes in the name of the armed forces," opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque told reporters on Tuesday. "They were involved in plotting the destruction of the country by pitting armed forces against countrymen," he said, reading a statement of the parliamentary party. "It the demand of the time to try them to protect the forces' name, and the laws and constitution of the country." The constitution does not allow anyone to be above the law, said Farroque. "But Moeen along with some loyal soldiers committed sedition by threatening the then president and forcing him to declare a state of emergency. "They also forced the then president to deliver a false and objectionable speech," claimed the BNP leader. "Moeen U Ahmed played a vital role in installing and sustaining the emergency government," he alleged. "He played with the country's fate through declarations of various ordinances." "He also committed a severe wrongdoing, unethical and illegal work by extending his own office for one year," said Farroque. He accused Moeen of dividing political parties, trying to banish the two major party chiefs, persecuting politicians, taking bribes, detaining citizens without charge or trial, holding trials through special courts and controlling media through a special agency. "He has violated disciplines and the service code through these misdeeds." The BNP parliamentary party equally blamed former caretaker government head Fakhruddin Ahmed and former president Iajuddin Ahmed alongside Moeen U Ahmed, he said. Among others, he also accused former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, former advisor MA Matin, general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, Bangladesh high commissioner to Australia, retired major general ATM Amin and former DGFI director brigadier general Chowdhury Fazlul Bari. BNP lawmakers Jamir Uddin Sircar, Nurul Islam Manju, Abdul Momin Talukdar, ZIM Mostafa Ali, Golam MOstofa, NIlufar Chowdhury, Moni and Rehana Akhtar Banu were present during the press conference at parliament's media centre. b
