<TITLE> Bangladesh gets on board Asian Highway </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh finally looks to be fully on board the Asian Highway Network to connect over 30 countries across the world's largest continent. The cabinet on Monday approved Bangladesh's long-debated link to the proposed 141,000km web of cross-continental trunk routes from Bulgaria to Japan. "This will open up scope for human and commodity movements across the continent," the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said after the cabinet meeting. He told reporters the cabinet was set to sign the Inter-Governmental Agreement on the highway to have a final say on the routes to go through the country. "If left out of the treaty, there will be no scope left for changing or modifying the routes," he said. "We need to be with everyone for development's sake. We all understand that if we are not with the Asian highway, we will be left alone," Azad said, quoting the prime minister. Stops and starts The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific first launched the cross-continent highway initiative in 1959, in a bid to enhance regional and international communications between Asia and Europe. "We have been a member of UN-ESCAP since then," said Azad. The initial stages of the project ran through the 1960s and 1970. But its development came to a halt in 1975 as its financing was stayed. Change in regional politics and economies kick-started the project again through the 1980s and 1990s. The Asian Highway Network was one of the main elements of ESCAP's Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development Project, approved in Beijing in 1992. As a further development, an IGA on the Asian Highway was drafted in November 2003. Some 27 countries ratified the treaty in 2004, but debate over the possible routes prevented Bangladesh from signing. The deadline to enter into the treaty was the end of 2005. "Bangladesh did not sign the agreement in the specified time," said Azad. "Now, the prime minister feels Bangladesh can no longer lag behind in this era of globalisation," said Azad. Proposed routes The communications ministry has finalised three proposed routes to cross BangladeshAH1, AH2 and AH41. The 495km AH1 from India would go through Benapole-Jessore-Dhaka-Kachpur-Sylhet-Tamabil. The 805km AH2 from India would connect Hati Kumrul-Dhaka-Kachpur-Sylhet-Tamabil. The 752km AH41 also would come in from India and link Mongla-Jessore-Hati-Kumrul-Dhaka-Kachpur-Chittagong-Cox's Bazaar-Teknaf through to Myanmar. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain had said last month the proposed routes would be sent to the ESCAP on approval by the cabinet. ESCAP will finalise them based on the proposal. The work on in Bangladesh will start right after their approval, said the minister. The work will be mainly renovating existing roads and the money will come from joint funds of ESCAP and Bangladesh, he added. 32 countries If the AHN sees full fruition, Bangladesh will be connected with 32 countries including Turkey, Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nepal, the Philippines, China, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Bhutan, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, and all the way to Bulgaria in Europe along the 141,000 kilometres of the completed network. To date, the Asian Highway covers international trunk routes of about 90,000 kilometres, transiting 25 countries, according to ESCAP. bdnews
