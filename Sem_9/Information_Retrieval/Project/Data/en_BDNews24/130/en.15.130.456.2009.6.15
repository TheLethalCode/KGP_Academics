<TITLE> Last-gasp Kaka penalty gives Brazil 4-3 win over Egypt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BLOEMFONTEIN, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil needed a stoppage time penalty from Kaka to beat Egypt 4-3 in a thrilling Confederations Cup Group B match on Monday. Kaka stroked home the winner after substitute Ahmed Al Muhamadi was rightly sent off by referee Howard Webb for handling a shot on the goal-line. Kaka had put Brazil 1-0 up after after five minutes when he glided through a stationary Egypt defence and gave goalkeeper Essam El Hadari no chance with his shot. Egypt equalised four minutes later through Mohamed Zidan but Luis Fabiano headed Brazil back in front and a bullet header from Juan made it 3-1 after 37 minutes. Egypt, though, produced some fine passing football and were rewarded with two goals in two minutes from Mohamed Shawky and a second from Zidan only for the late drama to deny them a draw. Italy were playing the United States in the later match (1830 GMT)
