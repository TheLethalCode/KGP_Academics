 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The government may review the terms for whitening black money in the proposed budget, on basis of discussion in parliament, the finance minister AMA Muhith said on Tuesday. Proposed duty hikes on cars and mobile phone sets along with the SIM tax may also be reviewed, Muhith told the reporters after a meeting with IFC official Pierre Guislian on the proposed budget. The minister said debate was to be expected following presentation of a new budget. "Every year debate and counter debate follows the budget, but everything will be covered in our budget discussion which is yet to begin." "All things would be considered, if necessary, on the basis of discussion in as well as outside parliament," said Muhith. Some issues in this year's budget, such as duty hikes on cars and mobile phones as well as SIM tax triggered, have triggered much debate, he said. Some have also criticised the rise in import duty on powdered milk, said the minister. Most debate has been around the extended three-year provision legalising undeclared income. Muhith defended the three-year offer. "Some argued it should not be more than a one-year term." "But it is obvious that a year will slip away as black money holders must specify how many industries they will invest in for development and for employment generation," he said Asked whether the sources of black money will have to be disclosed, he said, "As the budget has given the provision unconditionally, it would not be logical to question the source." The finance minister said IFC, part of the World Bank Group, had agreed to extend technical assistance in two sectors: private-public partnership projects and climate change risk managment. Guislian, IFC environment affairs director, said, "IFC has helped different countries in executing PPP." "It also wants to assist Bangladesh." bdn
