<TEXT>
 Rangpur, June 16 (bdnews24.com)A murder case has been filed in the chief judicial magistrate Shafiqur Rahman's court in Rangpur Sunday against five persons including three sons of Rahimuddin Bharosha, industrialist and former district president of BNP. Ferdousi Begum, sister of the Noor Alam who was murdered, filed the case. After the hearing was over, the court ordered the case statement to be put on record. The magistrate also ordered the police chief of Kaunia to take appropriate steps. The plaintiff said in her statement Bharosha had proposed to marry her elder brother Noor Alam's school-going daughter. Rahim's three sons Ashraf Bharosha, Emdad Bharosha and Ekram Bharosha got enraged and along with two of their cohorts, Babul and Amin, drew up a plan to murder Noor Alam. At 8:30pm on April 5, accused Ashraf Bharosha summoned Noor Alam via Babul, Aziz Bidi Factory gate-keeper, to the Bharosha House. When Alam arrived, Babul and Amin tied him to a coconut tree trunk first and then the three Bharosha sons and their two associates beat him unconscious. He died as the accused were rushing him to Rangpur Medical College Hospital. In a bid to hush up the incident, the accused put pressure on the family of Alam so that they would not file a case. Instead, the accused filed a general diary with Kaunia police. Police sent the dead body for autopsy. The autopsy report said Alam had died a normal death, but the plaintiff alleged that the accused had arranged to remove the proofs and alibi of the murder. Senior advocate Rathish Chandra Bhowmick assisted by Mashrafi Mohammad Shibli and Santosh Kumar Sarkar conducted the case on behalf of Ferdousi Begum.
