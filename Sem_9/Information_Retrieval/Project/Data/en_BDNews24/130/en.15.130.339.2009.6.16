 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Tuesday approved the supplementary budget of Tk 492.12 billion for the outgoing 2008-09 fiscal year. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith placed the bill before parliament and the house passed the same with voice vote in the absence of main opposition the BNP. The government's total expenditure for the fiscal year was fixed at Tk 1,289.81 billion from the consolidated, but the total expenditure stood at Tk 1,781.93 billion, Tk 492.12 billion more than the approved money. The finance minister sought approval of the additional expenses as the government spent more than the approved money at the beginning of the fiscal year. Muhith told parliament that the government's capacity to utilise annual development expenditure was seriously hampered in the current fiscal year but it would try its best to implement ADP from the next fiscal year. The government will submit revaluation of budget implementation after six months of presenting the budget from the next year, he said. The discussion on the supplementary budget would help the government take prudent decision in the future, the minister added. The bill included 49 grant proposals, of which 11 are compulsory liabilities involving Tk 449.48 billion. BNP MPs made some motions for cut on the supplementary allocations for each of the ministries and departments, but the proposals were not discussed due to their absence in House. bdn
