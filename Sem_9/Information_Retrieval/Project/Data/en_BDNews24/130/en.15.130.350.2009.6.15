 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  After a disappointing ICC World Twenty20 in England, the national cricketers on Monday started training for the away series against West Indies in July. All 20 players of the provisional squad attended the first day in a two-and-a-half hour session that included fitness test, running and fielding at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Former Bangladesh captain and Bangladesh A team coach Khaled Mahmud has been given responsibility to conduct a two-week training for the dead and buried cricketers still feeling the effects of a shock defeat against Ireland who dashed their hopes of qualifying for the Twenty20 Super Eights. Regular coach Jamie Siddons, who decided to fly back home to Australia, is on leave and is expected to join the team in the Caribbean. The Tigers will leave Dhaka on June 29 to play two Tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 international against the hosts. The team's first stop is in Barbados where they play a tour game before moving on to Kingstown in St.Vincent for the first Test from July 9. After the disaster performance in the 2003 World Cup, Mahmud was also made captain to boost the morale of the cricketers and the spirited cricketer showed remarkable signs of improvement in the team's performance graph later. "To be honest, the 2003 World Cup performance was actually a disaster as we lost against Canada and Kenya, two teams we were supposed to win, but looking back at the 2009 World Twenty20, the team played better except for the match against Ireland," said Mahmud, who also saw some progress in the Tigers' performance in England. The former Bangladesh captain, however, wants to overlook the performance of the national team in the World Twenty20 and instead work on some specific areas in line with his assessment. "The team has some problems and I will try to address those problems in my two-week training," Mahmud said. "I particularly want to work on individual skills whether it is a batsman or bowler." It seems Mahmud is keen to increase the mental toughness of the players and teach them how to remain calm during pressure situations in a match. "It is very much important what a player will have to do under pressure and I see our bowlers cannot even deliver slow balls, yorkers and change the bowling at the right time though they have potential." The 37-year-old coach thought that the loss against Ireland could be a tonic for the cricketers in the series against the West Indies. "The loss may work as a tonic as the boys will be wanting to shine against West Indies as they know very well how bad they played against Ireland and I believe they are capable of coming back on track." The interim coach, however, thought that it was important to combine practice and game and if it went accordingly, there was no chance of poor performance in the upcoming matches. Mahmud saw the players had no lack of commitment against Ireland, but still felt that they needed to understand that it was a platform for those who were stronger rather than weaker. Mahmud also thinks the batsmen need to be prepared to face the pace battery in the West Indies. Captain Mohammad Ashraful believed that if they could play better in the West Indies then their performance in the World Twenty20 would not be discussed anymore. Ashraful also said that except for the match against Ireland, Bangladesh have been playing better cricket in the last 12 months and went close to winning a one-day series and even went close to a Test victory against New Zealand and that they were now concentrating on the West Indies tour with two-weeks' hard training. The 25-year-old captain said that he was also disappointed with his performance. "I have always been focused whether I am playing better or not, remain captain or not especially after my inaugural Test century against Sri Lanka. Besides, I also got some runs during Bangladesh's great triumphs and everyone expects Bangladesh to score some more big wins, if I play better, but I cannot always achieve that type of innings and for that I am also disappointed like the spectators." bd
