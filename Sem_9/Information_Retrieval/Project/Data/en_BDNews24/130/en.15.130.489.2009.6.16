 Islami University, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Police retrieved two dead bodies on Tuesday morning from behind a women students' hostel at Islami University in Kushtia. Some local grass-cutters arriving behind Begum Fazilatunnessa Mujib Women's dormitory at 6am saw the 'slaughtered from behind' bodies lying on the ground. Informed by the grass-cutters, IU police chief Mostafizur Rahman retrieved the bodies at 7am and took those to the police station. The dead have been identified as Abdul Awal, 27, son of Abu Taleb Biswas of Dignagar, and Sher Ali, 35, son of Ibrahim Mandal of Shingnagar under Shailkupa Upazila in Jhenidah district, Rahman said. He said the two had been brought down to Dulalpur field and brutally beaten first, then taken inside the IU campus, slaughtered before the bodies were abandoned behind the Hall. They also found three chits inscribed with 'JSD Ganobahini Lal' writing and a cell phone number '01199191089'. Abul Hossain, a school teacher of a Shingnagar school, said Sher Ali was arrested with arms in 2000. He had secured bail and lived at his father-in-law's house in Dignagar. Nazrul Islam, assistant police superintendent, Jhenidah, said Abdul Awal's elder brother Abu Bakar was involved with the local militants. Dignagar UP chairman Shariful Islam Machhum said Abdul Awal and Sher Ali used to move about together. The IU police chief said cadres of some local militant outfit might have abducted the two from Sheikhparha area. The university students, just back from a fortnight's summer vacation, were in panic and unease on hearing the shocking news. Classes are scheduled to start on Tuesday after the summer break. bdn
