<TITLE> EC warns parties against late constitutions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission will issue show-cause notices against registered political parties failing to submit their permanent constitutions by the deadline of July 25, the chief election commissioner said on Monday. "The notices will require them to show cause why their registrations should not be cancelled," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters at the EC secretariat. "If any party applies to extend time, the commission will take it into account," said Huda. No formal application, to this end, has been submitted to the EC though political parties have verbally asked for more time, he said. Electoral laws state that a political party must submit its constitution to the Election Commission after ratifying it through a council within six months of a new parliament. The new parliament convened on Jan 25, but no political party has held a council to date, with time fast running out. Asked about voter list updates, the election chief said updated voter lists will not be finalised before January 2010. "So, it won't be possible to hold Union Parishad elections this year." "But we have plans to hold Dhaka City Corporation elections by the end of the year with the existing voter lists," said Huda. A total of 39 political parties were registered with the Election Commission, which required them to submit provisional constitutions incorporating reforms according to new electoral laws, ahead of the ninth parliamentary elections last December. bd
