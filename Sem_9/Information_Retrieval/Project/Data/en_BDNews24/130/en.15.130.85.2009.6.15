 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)BNP policymaker Moudud Ahmed on Monday demanded the trial of six army officers including the just-retired army chief General Moeen U Ahmed. Moudud, the former law minister and now an MP, called upon the government to constitute an all-party probe committee for the purpose. "Six army officers including Moeen had masterminded and executed all designs and work plans to render Bangladesh into a depoliticised and ineffective state," the BNP's policymaking national standing committee member alleged at a press briefing. The other five officers are former home affairs adviser retired major general MA Matin, lieutenant general Masududdin Chowdhury, brigadier general ATM Amin, brigadier general Fazlul Bari and former Anticorruption Commission chairman retired lieutenant general Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury. Moudud n June 10 said those who harassed and persecuted politicians during the 2007-2008 emergency rule should be named and put on trial. He said both the prime minister and the opposition leader were jailed then. A number of politicians were not only arrested, but were also physically tortured. He himself was persecuted while in the custody of the joint forces, he admitted. The former law minister had said some military officers having wrong notions tarnished the image of our army during the emergency by implementing their own agenda. bdne
