<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 15 (bdnews24.com)Textile mill owners on Monday added their voice to those of other trade bodies against the government's budget offer to whiten black money, saying extending the facility "encourages corruption" and should be limited. "We think the scope for whitening black money should be withdrawn," Bangladesh Textile Mills Association president Abdul Hai Sarker said in a press conference in the capital. Finance minister AMA Muhith, in his budget presentation last week, proposed a lengthy three-year facility to legalise undisclosed income by paying a flat-rate 10 percent tax and providing the money is invested in any of 42 sectors that covers the capital market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. Muhith also included home buyers in the facility, saying "no questions would be asked" of money invested in flats and houses. While the country's apex business federation FBCCI has welcomed the move, a number of other trade bodies including the MCCI, BGMEA, BKMEA and the FICCI have slammed it. Sarkar said: "If the facility is to be offered, then it should be allowed for only four to five sectors including government bonds, capital market and industrialisation" He said it should have not been extended for purchasing houses and cars. The BTMA chief also questioned how the black money whitening scope could be offered for three years in a one-year budget. "With the move the government has encouraged the expansion of corruption". The president also said the proposed budget had frustrated the textile sector. "There is much doubt over how much the export sector will fare under the proposed budget, as it did barely considers the textile sector," said Sarkar. bdn
