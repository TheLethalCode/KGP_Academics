 LONDON, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket distilled to the Twenty20 format has reaffirmed some of the sport's oldest precepts at the current World Cup while parading the revolutionary new skills transforming the game. On Sunday evening, Yuvraj Singh struck the first ball he faced over the boundary at Lord's to signal what all India prayed was the start of an innings which would keep the defending champions in the tournament. Instead he fell victim to a lightning stumping by England's James Foster when his foot briefly left the ground. The hosts eventually won by three runs and India are on their way home. Foster, regarded on the county circuit as the best keeper in England, has been unable to reclaim his test spot because the selectors have preferred players less able with the gloves but more prolific with the bat. However, for the Twenty20 team the same selectors have turned back the pages to a time when the best specialist keeper was routinely picked. Foster's runs are less important than his ability to stand up to the stumps to everybody bar the fastest bowlers. Spinners, to general delight, have played a huge role in the tournament after proving unexpectedly effective in the Indian Premier League. MATHEWS' MAGIC Sri Lanka field the ageless sorcerer Muttiah Muralitharan and his apprentice Ajantha Mendis, New Zealand possess the master of flight Daniel Vettori and India routinely use three spinners. Even South Africa, whose only spinner of note in their test history was Hugh Tayfield in the 1950s, field Johan Botha and Roelof van der Merwe, although both are essentially defensive bowlers. The principle that the best players will succeed in any format also holds true for the pace bowlers. Pakistan's Umar Gul became the first man to take five wickets in a Twenty20 match, getting the ball to reverse swing after coming on as the sixth change against New Zealand. England's pace bowlers confused the Indian batsmen with a variety of full and short-pitched deliveries, exploiting variable bounce in the Lord's pitch, The Twenty20 revolution has come in the batting and fielding. Batsmen, notably West Indies' captain Chris Gayle against Australia, open their stances to club the ball baseball style into the stands. Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan has perfected a scoop shot which send the ball flying over his shoulder. Fielding is now routinely outstanding with players chasing the ball in pairs to allow one to retrieve the ball in a sliding stop and the other to throw it back. New Zealand's Brendon McCullum, who has relinquished the wicketkeeper's gloves in this competition, ran out two Irishmen with direct hits on the stumps. The single play which illustrates the singular appeal and excitement of the tournament came from Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews in a moment of magic worthy of the NBA Finals. Mathews leaped the ropes against West Indies in pursuit of the ball, knocked it back inside the boundary, recovered his balance and hurled the ball back to the stumps. Because the ball had not touched the ground over the boundary officials confirmed it was not a six
