<TITLE> 'Remittance-filled' reserves at all-time high </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jun 15 (bdnews24.com)The country's foreign reserves, boosted by remittances, have touched an all-time high of $7 billion, providing some relief in the ongoing economic downturn, though some concerns remain that high reserves might mean falling imports. Finance minister AMA Muhith told parliament on Monday that Bangladesh's foreign reserves stood at $6.93 billion on Sunday and went over $6.94 billion on Monday morning. At the end of the day, the reserves had crossed $7 billion, said an official of Bangladesh Bank's forex reserve and treasury management department. Muhith, in his budget speech on June 11, had said more than three months' import costs could be met with the present reserves. A country's reserves are seen as healthy if they can meet three months' import costs at any time. "It's certainly positive for our economy if the reserve crosses 7 billion dollars even after meeting essential import costs," Zaid Bakht, senior research director at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, told bdnews24.com on the day. "But import of capital machinery has fallen recently, resulting in inflated reserves," he said. "It is best if reserves are high while essential imports remain on track," said Bakht. Analysts mainly credit remittance inflow by expatriate workers, still relatively untouched by the global downturn, for the record reserves. Bangladesh Bank figures show $8.76 billion sent back by overseas workers in the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year, defying all predictions of a slump in remittances in face of the global financial meltdown. Total remittance in the previous fiscal stood at $7.91 billion. Bangladesh broke its record for remittance in a single month in March this year with $881.3 million. The World Bank, IMF, Asian Development Bank and local analysts had warned that the remittance inflow, one of the main economic indices, would see a slump in the current fiscal year due to the world recession. bdne
