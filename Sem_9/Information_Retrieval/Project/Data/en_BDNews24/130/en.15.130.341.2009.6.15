 SANAA, Mon Jun 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three women from a party of nine kidnapped foreigners have been found dead in north Yemen, officials said on Monday, in a rare killing that comes as separatist and militant tensions intensify. The three women were believed to have been shot, two sources told Reuters, in a dramatic escalation of violence that comes one day after authorities arrested a man described as al Qaeda's top financer in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Yemeni state news agency Saba said the three were part of a group of nine -- seven Germans, a Briton and a Korean -- that included three children and their mother and were kidnapped last week in the mountainous Saada region bordering Saudi Arabia. A source told Reuters on Sunday that one of the German captives was a doctor at a local hospital which the other Germans were visiting. The Briton is an engineer and the South Korean was working with an aid agency. Two of the dead women were German nurses and one was a Korean teacher, the Yemeni military said in a statement. No claim of responsibility for the killing has been made. If the killing was carried out by tribal forces, it would mark the first time that women hostages have been victims. Two Belgian women, however, were killed in 2008 by gunmen in an ambush that authorities blamed on al Qaeda. Dubai-based security analyst Fares bin Houzam said it was possible al Qaeda was behind the latest deaths. No al Qaeda statement claiming responsibility has been published so far. "It's very rare for kidnappers in Yemen to kill, we have to wait to know what happened. But whoever is behind this, this is a fatal blow to security in Yemen," he said. Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, is struggling with a revolt in the north, a secessionist movement in the south and growing al Qaeda militancy, which have unsettled Western governments and neighboring Saudi Arabia. Kidnappings of Western tourists or workers by tribes is fairly common in Yemen with most incidents resolved peacefully in exchange for ransom or concessions from authorities. In this case, no tribal demands were made public. Increasing unrest has raised concerns Yemen could slip into chaos and provide a base of operations for al Qaeda or pirates operating in the Indian ocean. On Sunday Yemen arrested Saudi national Hassan Hussein Alwan described as al Qaeda's top financier in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, brought under control an al Qaeda campaign of violence launched in the kingdom in 2003, but fears are that Yemen will become the staging post for a revival of the effort to bring down the U.S.-allied Saudi royal family. Yemeni authorities have blamed the Houthi tribal group for kidnapping the nine foreigners, a charge the Houthis denied. In 2004, tribesmen in Saada led by members of the Houthi clan began an intermittent rebellion against the government in protest at what they said was economic and religious discrimination. Yemeni tribesmen in Saada on Friday released a group of 24 doctors and nurses they abducted a day earlier, demanding the authorities release two prisoners, a government official said. The medics, most of whom were Yemenis but also included Egyptians, Indians and Filipinos, were working at a Saudi-backed hospital in the northern Saada re
