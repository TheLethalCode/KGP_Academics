 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta told parliament that the caretaker government system should go and the next national polls should take place under an elected government. "The caretaker government, which was supposed to last for three months, headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, clung to power for two years in violation of the constitution," he said. "This caretaker government sent Sheik Hasina and other Awami League leaders to jail." "We don't want to go back to the caretaker government system anymore." "If our governments can rule the country for five years, we can also rule as caretakers for three months," Sengupta told parliament while speaking on the supplementary budget for 2008-09. He said the Awami League government had no chance to have a say on the caretaker government bill, according to which general elections take place under a non-party interim government within three months, that was passed by the BNP government "in the dead of night" in 1996. "Let the (next) elections take place under the Election Commission as it happens in other countries in the world," said Suranjit, whom pro-Hasina leaders branded as supporters of the military-installed caretaker government which tried to exile her in 2007. Suranjit also made a proposal for the Awami League's reform according to which Sheikh Hasina would have had to quit as party president. The Awami League in 1996 forced the BNP government to pass a constitution amendment bill for the passage of the caretaker government bill. Jatiya Samanjtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu, also speaking on the supplementary budget, warned politicians they "should not behave in such a way so that an unelected government like the caretaker government could suppress the country's politics, economy and society". Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon said the caretakers tried to introduce a "controlled political system" by imposing a national charter. "If we had agreed with the so-called national charter, you can imagine what kind of regime would be under now." "There is no room to be compromising with the country's political future." "The caretaker government did not hold elections. The elections took place due to people's democratic aspiration," claimed Menon. bdn
