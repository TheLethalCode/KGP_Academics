 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has said it is parliament that will decide whether caretaker government system should stay or go. "I personally think the caretaker government is not required if the Election Commission can work independently," the minister told reporters Tuesday at the Secretariat. His comment came a day after ruling Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta said in parliament that the nation did not want to go back to the interim government system anymore. "The constitution stipulates caretaker government system for holding a free and fair election," Shafique said. Shafiq said India did not need a caretaker government as the election commission was working neutrally and independently. "I think every institution in Bangladesh is independent. It will depend on the people of the institution whether it will work independently or not," He said, replying to a question. Suranjit had said the next national polls should take place under an elected government. The caretaker government, headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, which was supposed to last for three months, clung to power for two years in violation of the constitution, he said. "This caretaker government sent Sheikh Hasina and other Awami League leaders to jail. "We don't want to go back to the caretaker government system anymore," the MP told parliament. bdne
