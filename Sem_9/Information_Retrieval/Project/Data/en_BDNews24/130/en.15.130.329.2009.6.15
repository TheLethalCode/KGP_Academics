<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 15 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has warned the Special Security Force to be more watchful of militants who are now using modern technology. The premier's remark came from a ceremony marking the 23rd anniversary of the elite security force, deployed for VIPs, in the capital on Monday. "In the present national and international situation, ensuring security for VIPs is a sensitive and complicated issue," Hasina said. She said working areas and challenges for the SSF have increased a great deal compared to the past. "The security must be foolproof, while the force will have to realise the need for greater visibility and publicity of the VIPs they protect," she said. The prime minister also directed the authorities concerned to introduce subsidised essentials for all SSF officials. bdnews
