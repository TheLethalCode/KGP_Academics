The 45-year-old may have to cope without two of the squad's best players, though, because Argentine midfielder Cristian Ledesma and Macedonia forward Goran Pandev have threatened to leave. "If a player leaves, another with just as much potential will arrive," he added. Ballardini led Palermo to an eighth-place finish last term but refused to stay on in Sicily after falling out with chairman Maurizio Zamparini, who brought in former Catania coach Walter Zenga to replace him.
