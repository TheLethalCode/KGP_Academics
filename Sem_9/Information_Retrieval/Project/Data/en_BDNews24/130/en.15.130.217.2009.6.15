 BEIJING, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tianjin Teda defender Tan Wangsong faces a stiff fine and a long ban after a horrendous late challenge on China goalkeeper Yang Zhi, the lowlight of a tempestuous 1-0 derby defeat at Beijing Guoan at the weekend. Flying missiles also injured some of the 50,000 fans packed into the Worker's Stadium for the highest attended match of the season in China, and Tianjin complained that Beijingers had dazzled their players with lasers. The previous match between the clubs was marred by a mass brawl which caused television to cease broadcasting the league and Tan is likely to attract the full ire of the Chinese Football Association (CFA)'s disciplinary body when it meets on Tuesday. "We will appeal to the CFA," Beijing club president Luo Ning told the Beijing Times. "The CFA should hand out a severe punishment. "It was a malignant attack and this player just refuses to mend his ways. Last year, it was because of him the teams had the brawl. He was sent off at the Olympic Games as well." The 23-year-old was sent off at last year's Olympics for kicking a Belgian player in groin, leaving his opponent writhing on the pitch in agony. On Saturday, he was again red-carded for slamming into Yang's standing knee at full speed with the ball already in the goalkeeper's arms during stoppage time. The automatic ban is unlikely to be the full extent of the sanctions, though, with the CFA on the warpath against violent play this season. Tianjin said Tan had no hostile intent and said they would appeal against the referee's decision as well as the security problems at the ground, where Beijing will host England's Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Hull City next month. "Some Beijing fans shone lasers at in the faces of our players," Teda assistant manager Mu Jianxin told Sohu.com. "The CFA has to pay attention to this terrible action." Beijing lead the league on goal difference from Shandong Luneng after 11 matches of the season
