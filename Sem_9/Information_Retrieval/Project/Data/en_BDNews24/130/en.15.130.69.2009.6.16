<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Unlike the ruling MPs, finance minister A M A Muhith has praised the immediate past caretaker government for holding the ninth parliamentary polls and preparing the photo-attached voters' roll. "The caretaker government clung to power for more than the mandated timeframe. They set many examples of unwise decisions in their two-year rule," he told parliament on Tuesday. "They wanted to create a king's party, implement the so-called minus-two formula and set up local government without politics. "But they routinely corrected their mistakes," Muhith said before passage of the supplementary budget for the 2008-09 fiscal year. "They prepared a good voters' list." He differed with some Awami League MPs and said the ninth parliamentary polls were conducted well due to the caretaker government. "If the government was corrupt we would not have had a voters roll like the one we have," he said. "So, they deserve praise". A good number of MPs belonging to the Awami League and its coalition partners on Monday branded Fakhruddin Ahmed's military-installed caretaker government "corrupt". Awami League MP Suranjit Senpgupta criticised the finance minister as Muhith did not term the interim government "corrupt" in his budget speech. The finance minister in his budget speech on June 11 had said some of measures of the caretaker government were "slightly unwise". Suranjit said the ninth parliamentary polls were fair because of the Election Commission, not the caretaker government. Muhith said he could have used tougher adjectives for the BNP for its "misrule" from 2001-06. "But we don't want to look back only. We want to go forward," he said. "We are now presenting the budget for 2009-10 fiscal year, this is one of the achievements," he said. Terming the caretaker government's budget "ambitious", the finance minister said, "This is the basis of the proposed new budget".
