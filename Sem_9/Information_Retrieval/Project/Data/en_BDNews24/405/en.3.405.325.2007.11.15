<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Thu Nov 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks slipped on Thursday, led by declines in financial shares as nervousness about bank losses and credit market problems persisted. A weak outlook from J.C. Penney Co Inc added to the early weaker tone. Shares of General Electric Co declined 0.9 percent to $38.68 after it said its short-term bond fund ran into trouble amid losses on asset-backed securities and that all its outside investors have liquidated their holdings. Barclays Plc, Britain's third-biggest bank, unveiled a 1.3 billion pound ($2.7 billion) write-down on its exposure to credit market problems. Its shares fell about 1 percent in Europe. J.C.

"You're seeing some news overseas on writedowns and banks are down, but they're not too bad considering some of their (earlier) losses," said Steve Goldman, market strategist, Weeden & Co, based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 47.64 points, or 0.36 percent, at 13,183.37. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 7.20 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,463.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 6.98 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,637.34. Citigroup Inc shares fell 2.1 percent at $35.30. However, UBS has advised some analysts this week that the Swiss bank does not expect to make a huge fourth-quarter writedown on its subprime-related exposures.
