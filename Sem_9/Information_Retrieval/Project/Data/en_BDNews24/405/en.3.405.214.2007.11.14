<TEXT>
 SHANGHAI, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer got his quest for a fourth Tennis Masters Cup title back on track with a 6-4 6-3 win over Russian Nikolay Davydenko on Wednesday. The Swiss, stunned by Chile's Fernando Gonzalez in his Red Group opener in Shanghai, was below his best but was still good enough to eliminate Davydenko from the season-ending event. "It was just a different situation coming back from losing," said Federer, who had never tasted defeat in a round-robin match at the Masters Cup before being ambushed by Gonzalez. "Here you lose and you play another top 10 guy. This was a top-four guy so it doesn't get any easier. Anything can happen in the men's game. "You're a little bit off, you're a little bit tired, you'll lose right away. But I create myself many, many opportunities so eventually I'll break through and I'll break their will." With cow bells echoing around Qi Zhong stadium, Federer struggled to overcome an opponent he had beaten in all their previous 10 meetings. Federer, who is bidding to win a fourth title in the last five years at the showcase eight-man tournament, did just enough to take a scrappy first set despite 22 unforced errors. He broke to lead 5-3, promptly dropped his own serve but restored normal service in the next game, breaking again to win the set when Davydenko blew an easy smash. FOREHAND ROCKET Federer raised his game in the second, a forehand rocket putting him 3-1 up, and he put Davydenko out of his misery after 87 minutes, letting out a roar of delight as his opponent's backhand sailed long. Davydenko, who will be involved in the Davis Cup final starting later this month, already has his getaway planned once his final Masters Cup match is over with. "I fly to the Maldives on Sunday for one week for a rest," said Davydenko, who this week successfully won his appeal against a $2,000 fine imposed on him by the ATP Tour for not trying hard enough during a match. "The end of the season I was really tired physically and mentally. I just want to prepare for next season to be as fit as possible to play against Federer or (Rafael) Nadal." Gonzalez was playing American Andy Roddick in the day's second Red Group match later on Wednesday
