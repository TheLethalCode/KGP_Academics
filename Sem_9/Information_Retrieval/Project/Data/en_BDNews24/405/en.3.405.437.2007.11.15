<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  A 30-strong Abahani Limited squad, with a pack of 20 footballers, leave Friday morning for Guwahati in India to play the Bordoloi Trophy. Abahani, who became runners-up in 1992 losing to East Bengal, will start their campaign straight from the second stage with the preliminary round with 16 teams getting underway on Nov 8 in the capital of Assam state. The Dhanmondi outfit is scheduled to play first match on Sunday but manager Satyajit Das Rupu could not confirm who they would play. The sky-blues are eyeing to put up a better show ahead of the Friendship Cup in Dhaka later this month. "We have trained by and large," said Rupu, adding that they were forced to change their plans at the last moment as Nigerian striker Elijah Junior was not available. Junior, top scorer in this year's inaugural B. League for Brothers Union, trained with Abahani as a guest player, but he cannot travel with the team because of "technical problems". Abahani, the B. League champions, have hired Muktijoddha striker Saifur Rahman Moni, Ghanaian defender Charles Ghansha and Farashganj's forward Mohammed Robin for the trip. "Moni and Robin are national players and I don't think our attack would weaken ( in the absence of Junior)," said Abahani captain Arif Khan Joy. "I don't want to say that we have had fantastic preparation in the lead-up to the tournament but the fitness of the players is very good," Joy said. "Our primary target is to win the two group matches to secure a semifinal place." The former Bangladesh captain said their target was to emulate Brothers Union, who are the only Bangladeshi team to have clinched the Bordoloi trophy in 2004. The final is slated for Nov 24.
