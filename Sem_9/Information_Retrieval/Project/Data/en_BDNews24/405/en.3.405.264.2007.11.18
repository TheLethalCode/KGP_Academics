 Ravaged south Patuakhali, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) The trail of destruction left in the wake of tropical cyclone Sidr that slammed into Bangladesh Thursday night has left many southern areas devastated, with massive destruction to crops, uprooted trees and thousands of demolished homes. Communities in the affected south and southeastern areas are reeling from the intensity of reported 250 kmph winds and unexpectedly high tidal surges. bdnews24.com correspondent Sanjay Dey reports that more than half of the houses in the Turki Bazaar in Gournadi and Uzirpur areas of Barisal District have been totally destroyed, with much of the crops and other vegetation swept away. Houses in many areas have been reduced to piles of broken wood and twisted corrugated iron sheeting, said Sanjay. The relief operation has been hampered by a huge number of downed trees on the roads and highways, which has severely restricted movement in the area. Joint forces have been working round the clock to re-establish road links, which freed up some southern routs by Saturday morning, locals report. Travelling by bus early morning Sunday in Barisal District, the bdnews24.com correspondent reports that mile after mile of betel leaf plantations had been levelled, with coconut trees decapitated and few crop fields salvageable. Hotel Mabia, a two-storey structure in Kashipur, near Barisal city, had sustained huge damage with its roof shorn off. Nearby Phultali bus-stand was strewn with large billboards, stacked one on top of the other. Sanjay also reported that large numbers of people tried to make their way to the southern region in search of news of family members, while communications by phone remain disrupted. Md Firoz, who was heading south in search of his family said: "It's always the poor who are hit the worst. A huge tamarind tree fell on my house in Uzirpur during the storm." "My mother, sister and niece were all living there, and I don't know what happened to them," he said. Construction worker Md Faruque Sharif, who was travelling on the Patuakhali to Barisal road, said he still had no news from his village home in Patharghata. "There were eight or ten people living in my house the night of the storm, including my mother, grandmother and younger son," said Sharif. "My uncle said they all came to his house during the cyclone, and they were safe. But I don't believe him, because I heard from other sources that our house and everything else was simply razed to the ground," he said. Golam Azad from Charhakgachhia in Barguna said: "Our home and all our belongings are still under water. My brother told me over the phone that they retrieved two dead bodies from the neighbouring cane garden, and that the whole area was strewn with corpses." Road communication to Patuakhali was restored Sunday, following a two-day disruption when the ferry at Lebukhali was swept away. Rustam Ali, a shopkeeper from Lebukhali, said he saw the ferryboat, bridge and jetty all washed away during the cyclone. "A six- or-seven foot storm surge caused the pontoon to violently collide with the row of shops I work in, and then it was simply swept away," Rustam said. The ferry jetty was restored Sunday morning, although the Amtali ferry-crossing on the Patuakhali to Barguna road is yet to be made operational. bdnews24.com/
