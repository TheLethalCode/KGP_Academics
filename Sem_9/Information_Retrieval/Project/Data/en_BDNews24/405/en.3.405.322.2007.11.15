 WASHINGTON, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pentagon on Wednesday said it was not worried about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons amid the political crisis there, rolling back from comments made by a senior US general who called the issue a "primary concern." "At this point, we have no concerns," said Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell. "We believe that they are under the appropriate control." Last week, Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, director of operations for the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military was concerned about the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal after President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule and arrested thousands.

Pakistan carried out its first nuclear test in 1998 and experts estimate it has material for as many as 90 weapons. Washington considers Pakistan an important ally in the US-declared war on terrorism. The US military in particular works closely with Pakistani forces, especially along the Afghan border.

Still, Morrell said the US military had begun looking at alternate routes to send supplies to its troops in Afghanistan in case the political crisis in Pakistan makes current supply lines unavailable. The U.S. military sends 75 percent of its supplies for the Afghanistan war through or over Pakistan, including 40 percent of the fuel sent to troops, the Defense Department said. "There are efforts under way right now to figure out contingency supply lines to our troops in Afghanistan if it becomes necessary to alter the way we now support our troops in Afghanistan," Morrell said. "In light of the fact that there is civil unrest in Pakistan, in light of the fact that there is a state of emergency in Pakistan, we feel it is responsible, given the importance of the Pakistani supply lines to our operations in Afghanistan, to have a contingency pla
