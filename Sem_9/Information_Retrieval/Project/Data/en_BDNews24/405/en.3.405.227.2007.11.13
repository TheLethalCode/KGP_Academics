<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday asked Myanmar to import pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and ceramics from Bangladesh to reduce the trade gap between the two countries. Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at around $35 million in the last fiscal year, although Bangladesh only accounted for around $6 million in exports for the period, according to commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed. "We've asked the Myanmar government to import products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and ceramics from Bangladesh so that the trade deficit can be reduced," Azizul told reporters after a meeting with the visiting Myanmar trade delegation. The Myanmar delegation, led by deputy commerce minister Aung Tun, arrived in Dhaka Sunday to attend the Second Joint Trade Commission meeting between the neighbouring countries. Azizul said both countries had agreed to extend bilateral cooperation, particularly in the private sector. The adviser said a committee, led by commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, had been formed to explore ways for the two governments to improve policy support to the private sector. Azizul said Bangladesh also made a proposal to the Myanmar delegates to utilise their gas to produce fertiliser in Chittagong. "We have both the infrastructure and experience in producing fertiliser," Azizul said in response to Myanmar's insistence that any factory would not be situated in Myanmar. The adviser said the proposed Consumers Rights Protection Ordinance 2007, which was approved in principle by the council of advisers last Sunday, would prove to be an efficient tool. The proposed ordinance would establish sentences of up to three years' imprisonment or a fine of Tk 2 lakh for violations of consumer rights. Specifically, terms of one year, or a fine of Tk 50 thousand, or both, have been proposed for selling expired products. The government has sent the draft back to the commerce and law ministries for further examination and vetting, he added. bd
