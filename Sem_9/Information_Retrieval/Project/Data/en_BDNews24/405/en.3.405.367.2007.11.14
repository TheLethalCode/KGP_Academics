<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)Law adviser Mainul Hosein expressed satisfaction over the pro-reform BNP leaders' entry into the party's central office in Naya Paltan Wednesday. Mainul told reporters in his law ministry office: "I am happy to hear that they have entered their central office unopposed, without any trouble." Earlier in the day, the reformist BNP leaders and workers entered their office as at least 400-strong police force stood guard to handle any opposition to the entry. The adviser said a top-level law and order monitoring and surveillance committee at its meeting in the home ministry had discussed law and order in the country in detail. Admitting that there had been law and order breaches at places lately, the adviser said: "The overall situation is not all that bad, and the government is satisfied with the prevailing situation." On the fertiliser crisis, he said: "The government is monitoring fertiliser availability and distribution carefully. This crisis has been caused by the dealers, and, as we know, there are adequate stocks of fertiliser." bdnews24.
