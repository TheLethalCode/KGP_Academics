 LONDON, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British court ruled on Thursday that radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri could be extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges including trying to set up an al Qaeda training camp in Oregon. Egyptian-born Hamza, 49, currently serving a seven-year jail term in Britain for inciting his followers to murder non-believers, is wanted by US authorities on 11 charges. The US indictment accuses Hamza of attempting to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, from 1999 to early 2000, and also providing support to al Qaeda and the Taliban. Hamza, who applauded the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, also faces charges that he was involved in plotting the taking of 16 Western hostages in Yemen in 1998. Four of the hostages, three Britons and an Australian, were killed when Yemeni troops stormed the militants' hideout. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of up to 100 years in prison. London's City of Westminster Magistrates Court approved the extradition but that decision has to be ratified by the British Home Secret
