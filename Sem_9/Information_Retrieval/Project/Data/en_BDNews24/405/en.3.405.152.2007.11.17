 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  City life in Dhaka was paralysed Friday as the national power grid struggled to cope with demand in the wake of tropical cyclone Sidr. Power supplies were snapped for more than 12 hours, which left filling stations unable to operate and the transport system severely affected. Private and commercial vehicles lined the roads by filling stations as the power supply was partially re-established Friday night. Cab driver Abdur Rahim, arrived at the city's GQ Samdani Pump in Nilkhet at 7.30 in the morning to refuel for the day. After a six-and-a-half hour wait, he was still behind 12 cars. The situation was echoed around the capital. Md Raju, an employee at the gas station, said: "Vehicles belonging to the police, ambulance services and ministry cars come here a lot. That's why we can't supply well to ordinary people." Raju added that their business was interrupted for an hour Saturday after power outages in the morning. Drivers expressed their anger at the situation. Rahim, who drives a taxi, told bdnews24.com: "My daily taxi rental is Tk 800, how will I manage to pay that? The owner won't listen to any excuses." Harunur Rashid Chowdhury from Meghna Model Service Centre, the only government filling station, near Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, said: "The station has been crowded since Saturday morning. No matter how hard we work, the queue doesn't seem to shorten." Nearby Shahjahan Enterprise, a CNG supply station, said he was facing similar problems. The manager, Mosharraf Hossain, said the pressure eased slightly at midday. bdnews2
