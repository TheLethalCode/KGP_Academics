<TITLE> Spanish police arrest Madrid officials </TITLE>

 MADRID, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Several officials were arrested in a police raid on Madrid's city government offices on Wednesday, on suspicion of taking bribes in exchange for business licences, the deputy mayor said. Manuel Coba told a news conference that 16 officials, many long-serving, are under investigation, as well as an unspecified number of businesses but he did not say if they were among those arrested in the raid. Authorities have not disclosed a precise figure for the number of arrests. The city government is controlled by the opposition conservative Popular Party but Coba played down the political significance of the raids, which come four months before general elections. "We're not talking about people with responsibility for politics, we're not talking about councillors," Coba said. High profile arrests linked to bribes and kickbacks paid by property developers to planning authorities in cities such as Marbella were a key issue in May's local elections.
