 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday cleared businessman Salman F Rahman of funds embezzlement in two cases after the plaintiffs said they had got their money back. Magistrate Al Mamun of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka delivered the verdict Sunday afternoon in presence of Salman, also an adviser to the Awami League chief. His brother Ahmed Sohel Fasiur Rahman, better known as Sohel F Rahman who had been on the run, was also relieved of the charges. Salman, chairman of Shinepukur Holdings Ltd, would not be released from jail anytime soon as he faced other cases, a court official said. Sohel is the vice president of Shinepukur. Abu Mohammad Sayeed, a resident of Jhigatala in the capital, filed a case against them on March 19. Sayeed alleged that he deposited Tk 1 lakh from 1999 to 2005 with Shinepukur for a plot in its project 'Suncity-1', but the company neither handed over a plot to him nor had it returned his money. Mosharraf Hossain Ahmed of East Nakhalpara filed the other case the same day alleging that he had deposited Tk 2.35 lakh from 2000 to 2005 for a plot in Suncity-3 but did not get the plot or the money back. The plaintiffs submitted affidavits to the court saying that they had got their money back and that they would not complain if the accused had been exempted from the cases. bdne
