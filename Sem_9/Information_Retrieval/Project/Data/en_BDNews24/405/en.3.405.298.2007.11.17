 CENTURION, South Africa, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis scored his fifth century in seven test innings to establish South Africa's lead over New Zealand in the second test on Saturday. Kallis' 131 was the top score in South Africa's total of 272-3, which they reached before bad light ended play seven overs after tea on the second day to earn a lead of 84 runs over New Zealand's first innings of 188. Kallis' 29th century was also his fastest, coming off 143 balls. The all-rounder and Hashim Amla, who was 89 not out at the early close, shared a stand of 220 for the third wicket. New Zealand had resumed on 187-8 but were dismissed just four balls into the first over of play when Chris Martin edged a delivery from paceman Makhaya Ntini and was caught by Kallis at second slip without scoring. Martin's wicket ended New Zealand's innings with opener Craig Cumming, who retired hurt on 48 on Friday and spent the night in intensive care with a fractured cheekbone and jaw after being felled by a bouncer from fast bowler Dale Steyn, unable to continue his innings. Medium pacer Martin returned to remove openers Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs by the ninth over of South Africa's reply. Smith was dismissed with the last ball of the first over, which he chopped onto his stumps to be bowled for two. Martin (2-56) then bowled Gibbs for 25 with a delivery that moved sharply off the seam towards the right-hander. Reduced to 31-2, South Africa fought back through Amla and Kallis, who scored steadily and took few risks. Kallis scored 95 of his runs between lunch and tea before being trapped in front by debutant fast bowler Mark Gillespie with the fifth ball after tea. Kallis faced 177 balls and hit 17 fours and two sixes
