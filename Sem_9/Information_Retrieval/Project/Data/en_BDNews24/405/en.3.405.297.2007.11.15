<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The benchmark index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange crossed an all-time high of 3000 points Thursday, fired by rally in power, bank and cement heavyweights. The market was apparently untroubled by the severe cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, which is expected to make landfall sometime Thursday night. The market rose from the opening bell, partly influenced by earnings reports from Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. Also fuelling the buoyant market were speculations surrounding banking and cement sector issues. However, overall investor presence was lower as reflected in the downturn in turnover on the bourse. "It appears that investors are used to flooding and cyclones. The fact that the 3,000 mark was crossed is a reflection of such an adjustment," said Sharif Ataur Rahman, who has 30 years experience in the stock market with SAR Securities. "More securities are now needed to absorb the investors' upbeat mood," Sharif added. The DGEN or general index, which crossed the 2900 mark on Oct 25, added 27.81 points, or 0.93 percent, to end on 3013.00, the highest level recorded on the bourse. "Let's see whether this level can be sustained or not. A technical analysis suggests there should be some resistance at the 3000 level," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh. The DSI all-share price index climbed 21.99 points or 0.87 percent to end on 2549.34. The DSE-20 blue chip index added 10.06 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish at 2325.54. Gainers outnumbered losers 127 to 75, with 22 securities holding steady. Turnover, however, declined to Tk 2.22 billion from 14, 856, 583 traded shares. "The influx of investors has increased in recent days, but the supply of issues remained almost at the same level. An increased demand for shares is driving the market up," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the country's premier bourse. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, third biggest issue by market capitalisation, led the rally, gaining 1.48 percent to end on Tk 736.25. The state-run power distributor posted a 25 percent cash dividend and reported that its earning per share doubled to Tk 34.41 on June 30, 2007 from the previous year's figure. BRAC Bank guided the banking sector, adding 1.87 percent to finish on Tk 1633.75. A court decision slated for Nov 20, which will give a date for the UCBL's postponed annual general meeting, drove the bank's share prices 2.12 percent higher to Tk 5503. Lafarge Surma Cement, the second biggest share by market capitalisation, moved up 5.70 percent to Tk 449.5 on speculation that it would win a legal battle centred on the removal of a limestone stockpile in Meghalaya, India. "It appears that investors, in many cases, are banking more on rumours than on fundamental strengths," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance. "The rally is linked to rises in issues with higher market capitalisation." AB Bank rose 0.93 percent to Tk 2875.75. Social Investment Bank, Islami Bank and Bextex also finished higher, while Trust Bank and Standard Bank dipped on profit-taking. All the indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also closed higher, with 73 issues gaining, 34 loosing and eight holding steady. bdne
