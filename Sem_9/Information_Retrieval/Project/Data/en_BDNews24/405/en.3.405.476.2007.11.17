 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com) - Two US Navy amphibious assault ships each carrying helicopters, hovercraft and equipped with hospital facilities have been dispatched to join the reconstruction efforts in the cyclone-battered Bangladesh, a news report said Saturday. The US made the decision pending a formal request for help from Bangladesh, Bloomberg news agency quoted Major David Griesmer, spokesman for the US Pacific Command in Hawaii, as saying. The two US vessels, the USS Essex and USS Kearsarge, have "the capabilities that we think will prove to be the most useful", he said. "It may take several days for the government to work out what it really needs." More ships may be made available once Bangladeshi officials know what they need, he said. Meanwhile, Touhid Hossain, secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the government did not make any request to the US government for help. Bangladesh has yet to receive a formal offer from the US Navy, Touhid told Reuters. He told bdnews24.com: "We did not take any decision yet on seeking help in rescue operations from a foreign country. We are trying to work on our own." The US move came amid the government's efforts to stand by the millions of affected people across the country's southwestern coast. The official death toll from Thursday's savage cyclone stood at 1,723 Saturday night, as the relief workers were struggling to reach the survivors. Troops have also joined the workers and helicopters were rushing food and medicine to the remotest areas. The US Navy helped after a devastating storm in 1991. bd
