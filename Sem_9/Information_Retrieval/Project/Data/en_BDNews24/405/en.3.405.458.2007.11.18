 Algiers, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six Algerians were killed on Saturday when a gas explosion ripped through a decrepit two-storey house in eastern Algeria, the official news agency APS reported. Authorities were investigating whether a gas leak or something else caused the blast in Annaba, 600 km (375 miles) east of Algiers, APS added. Eight others were injured. Thousands families are forced to live in sub-standard homes in several Algerian cities because of a severe housing shortage.
