 Chittagong, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zia International Airport reopened after 20 hours of closure Friday as a deadly cyclone subsided in the Bay of Bengal, officials said. Operations at main Chittagong port also resumed after a suspension lasting nearly 48 hours as the cyclone moved towards Assam in India and subsided into a tropical storm. Thirteen foreign ships were stranded at the sea port since operations were suspended late on Wednesday due to an approaching Category 4 cyclone. "We have advised normal operations at the port as the storm crossed the coast overnight," said a senior official of Chittagong port, which handles 80 percent of external trade. Flight operations at ZIA remained suspended early Friday and civil aviation official Saber Ahmed told bdnews24.com at 12:30am that no flights had taken off or touched down at the airport after 9:30pm Thursday. Weather office in Dhaka earlier Thursday advised authorities at ZIA to halt all flights from 9pm until further notice. The cyclone, packing winds up to 250 kph, hit Bangladesh's coastal belt late on Thursday, killing more than 250 people and triggering a 5-metre high water surge that devastated three coastal towns with a combined population of 700,000. Officials said the death toll would rise as the search for more bodies continued
