 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Khulna toppled Rajshahi to sit pretty at the top of the table with their first win while Dhaka and Barisal also won their fourth round four-dayers of the National Cricket League Tuesday. A fine 52 from opener Nazmus Sadat helped Khulna record their first triumph with a two-wicket win over Rajshahi at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. An all-round show by Mehrab Hossain Junior powered Dhaka to a three-wicket win over Chittagong at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Raqibul Hasan and Arafat Salahuddin each hammered fifty as Barisal registered their second win, handing a two-wicket defeat to Sylhet at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. After the fourth round, Khulna top the six-team point table with 46, four ahead of Rajshahi, Dhaka and Barisal who share the second place. Chittagong have 22 points while Sylhet raised their points tally to 21 from four outings. Khulna vs Rajshahi Chasing 241, Khulna openers Nazmuz Sadat (52) and Imrul Kayes (41) put on 80 runs before Kayes holed out to Suhrawardi off Nayeem Islam, who also removed Nazmus with scoreboard on 108 for two. Habibul Bashar (35) and Tushar Imran (34) put on 59 runs for the third wicket before Khulna lost three quick wickets to slip to 177 for five. However, Ziaur Rahman (26) and Mustafizur Rahman (19) denied further damage to take their side to 223 before Khulna once again lost another three wickets to wobble at 228 for eight. Man of the match Dollar Mahmud (12), who snared seven wickets including a hat-trick, and Syed Rasel (2) however remained unbeaten to steer Khulna home. Rajshahi, having resumed on 192 for seven, had finished at 242 with skipper Khaled Mashud stretching his overnight 10 to 62. Dhaka vs Chittagong Chittagong, who resumed the final day on 165 for five, batted almost two sessions to finish at 278 all out, but the visitors could not avert the defeat after setting Dhaka just 103 runs to chase. Chittagong captain Ehsanul Haq converted his overnight 18 to 56 and lower order Tareq Aziz played a patient 31 off 91 balls, but they failed to provide their team with a healthy lead. Dhaka were also in tatters at 46 for five as Chittagong left-arm pacer Kamrul Islam wrecked the top-order, removing four batsmen. Mehrab and Mahmudullah Raid (27) took Dhaka to 85 before let-arm spinner Saju Datta struck twice in an over to send back Riad and Mohammad Rafique (0). The story would have been different had umpire Aktheruddin not ignored pacer Kamrul Islam's leg before appeal against Mehrab in the very next over as TV replay showed Mehrab caught plumb. However, Mehrab (22) and Mohammad Sharif (8) remained unbeaten to give Dhaka their second triumph in the league. Barisal vs Sylhet On the final day, Sylhet were only five wickets shy of their maiden victory, but they failed to cash in on the collapse of Barisal, who had been struggling at 17 for five at one stage on the third day. Man of the match Arafat Salahuddin (76) and Raqibul Hasan (57) converted their overnight scores to fifty and scored 126 crucial runs for the sixth wicket. Tapash Ghosh (13) and Talha Jubair (12) finally added 21 for the unbroken ninth wicket to steer Barisal home. b
