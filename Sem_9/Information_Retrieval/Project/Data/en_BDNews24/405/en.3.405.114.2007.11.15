 DHAKA, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone may buy other operators as competition intensifies from rivals including Orascom Telecom, Bloomberg reported Thursday. ``We are always seeking to extend our footprint," chief executive officer Anders Jensen said in an interview with the news agency in Macau. The six wireless carriers operating in the country are ``two to three too many", he said. Acquiring other operators will give Grameenphone, controlled by Norway's Telenor, more spectrum as the carrier's target of adding seven million new users each year crowds the airwaves it currently holds. The company has a 61 percent share of a market where less than one in five people own a mobile phone. ``If we get additional spectrum, we will be more willing to invest,'' said Jensen. Grameenphone may otherwise slow capital spending as equipment purchases alone cannot create enough new capacity, he said. The company has about 16 million users. Grameenphone invested about $300 million in each of the past three years to meet demand, former chief executive officer Erik Aas said in June. Jensen, previously an executive at the Swedish unit of Fornebu, Norway-based Telenor, replaced Aas in September. Closely held Grameenphone faces rising competition as Cairo-based Orascom, the Middle East's largest wireless operator, and Singapore Telecommunications invested in mobile-phone operations to tap demand in Bangladesh. Mobile-phone calling rates may fall to about 1 cent a minute as operators offer discounts to lure users, Jensen said. Grameenphone plans to encourage users to make more calls and introduce new services such as Research in Motion's Blackberry device to increase average spending from less than $5 a month, Jensen said. Grameenphone has signed an agreement with Waterloo, Ontario-based Research in Motion to be the first Bangladeshi operator to offer the Blackberry device, Jensen said. The service, which allows users to make calls, e-mail, browse the Web and download songs, will initially be offered in 16 cities, and is projected to start by the end of the year, he said. Telenor, the largest phone company in the Nordic region, owns 62 percent of Grameenphone. Grameen Telecom owns the remaining 38 percent. Grameenphone may complete a share listing on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in 2008, Jensen said. The proposed stock offering will be the biggest ever in Bangladesh, he said. ``There is strong interest from the owners for the IPO,'' said Jensen. ``There are practical things such as whether the Dhaka Stock Exchange can handle a deal of this size.''
