 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla ports have been advised to lower distant warning signal number two and instead hoist warning signal number 4. Earlier, a special weather bulletin issued Tuesday morning by the Storm Warning Centre of Bangladesh Meteorological Department said the severe cyclonic storm 'SIDR' over southeast Bay and adjoining area remained stationary. It was centred at 6am Tuesday about 1210 km south of Chittagong port, 1125 km south of Cox's Bazaar port and 1205 km south-southeast of Mongla port. It is likely to intensify further and move in a north-northwesterly direction, the bulletin said. It said the maximum sustained wind speed within 64 km of the storm centre was about 90 km per hour, rising to 115 km per hour in gusts/squalls. The seas are likely to remain turbulent. All fishing boats and trawlers over the north Bay have been advised to remain close to the coasts so as to take shelter within short notice. They are also advised not to venture into the deep sea. bd
