 LONDON, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks eroded gains, Wall Street braced for a weaker opening and the yen steadied against the dollar on Wednesday as investors turned cautious about buying risky assets ahead of major US economic data. Stocks, emerging markets and other risky assets won a reprieve earlier after a positive trading update by HSBC and reassurance from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs on Tuesday that the bank does not face big credit losses. However, investor sentiment hinged on US retail sales and producer prices data due later in the day, which should give more clues on whether financial markets are right to price in further cuts in the US Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate from the current 4.50 percent. "Markets remain very volatile," said Dirk Thiels, head of global equity funds at KBC Asset Management. Jeremy Stretch, market strategist at Rabobank, said: "Economic weakness in the US is keeping the dollar under pressure and further weak data from the retail sector, if it's combined with higher producer prices, could prove to be a toxic combination, as it would make the job much harder for the Fed." The FTSEurofirst 300 index pared early gains to stand up 0.1 percent on the day, having hit its lowest since mid-September on Tuesday. HSBC gained 2 percent after it reassured investors it had not suffered significant write-downs on U.S. mortgage-backed debt, as had some of its rivals. However, Alliance & Leicester fell 5 percent on market talk of funding worries, reflecting persistent concerns about the banking sector. MSCI main world equity index was up 0.8 percent, off the previous day's eight-week low. Stocks in Asia and emerging markets gained 2-3 percent, according to MSCI measures. The low-yielding yen -- often borrowed to fund purchases of higher-return assets -- was steady at 110.98 per dollar, but down 0.6 percent to 163.01 per euro. Sterling fell to a four-year low of 71.12 pence per euro after the Bank of England signalled lower UK interest rates. In the money market, three-month sterling interbank lending rates hit a 1-1/2 month high, some 40 basis points above expected UK interest rates in three months' time. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 3 points, with sentiment helped by a rebound in commodity prices. US light crude rose 1 percent to $89.81 a barrel on expectations that US oil inventories are falling. It surged past $98 last week, which heightened inflation concerns. Gold rose to $810.90 an ounce, around $45 below its 28-year peak set last week. The December Bund future was down 21 ticks as safe-haven flows dried
