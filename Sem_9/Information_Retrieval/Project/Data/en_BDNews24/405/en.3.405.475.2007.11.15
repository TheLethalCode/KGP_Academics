 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) The hurricane SIDR struck Khulna-Barisal coast shortly after 5pm Thursday, setting off driving rains in its path. In a 6pm bulletin, the Met office said the centre of the cyclone would cross the coast through the river Baleshwar in three hours' time. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed rushed a meeting and asked government officials in 15 districts not to leave workplaces in order to cope with the aftermath of the hurricane that started cutting its path. CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters that control rooms had been opened in the vulnerable districts to mount constant watch on the situation. The strong winds came over Khulna-Barisal coast. The cyclone warning centre said the eye of the storm would take some time to hit the coast. The hurricane triggered heavy winds speeding at up to 180 kilometres per hour through Heron Point, Khepupara, Dublarchar and coastal areas adjacent to the Sundarbans. The sea turned "very turbulent", the weather office said. Water level rose by up to 3 feet in the Bay. Strong winds accompanied by heavy rain started blowing through the Sundarbans and adjoining areas, bdnews24.com's correspondent Monir Hossain Kamal reported from the south. The vesselMV Abashar hired for BBC's river tour named "Bangladesh by river"got stuck, 25 kilometres off Sirajganj town, because of the bad weather, a journalist aboard the vessel told bdnews24.com by phone. Rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal along parts of the southern coast have all swollen and are still rising, water department officials said. "From my window, I can see tins ripped off the roofs and tree branches flying under the sky covered with thick clouds," said Moulvi Feroze Ahmed, a local government official on St. Martin's island in the Bay of Bengal near the storm. "It looks like the sea is coming to grab us," he said. "It has been rough with high waves. The storm has already triggered a 3-foot (1-metre) high water surge." Officials at Cox's Bazar, a popular tourist destination, said they had evacuated nearly 200,000 people to about 600 government and private shelters and asked others to move on their own. "The shifting process is continuing," said Sajjadul Hasan, chief of the local district administration. People heading for shelters were taking food, clothes and their cattle with them. Chittagong and Mongla ports suspended operations on Wednesday and moved ships to safer areas, port officials said. Chittagong airport suspended flights and moved planes away, officials said. All schools and colleges in Chittagong and other towns in the storm's path have been shut down and fishing trawlers have been asked to return to port immediately. In Chittagong, officials said they were worried by the unusual calm before the storm. "This suggests the core of the storm has been static, but may suddenly move with super speed before it finally slams the shores," a meteorological official said. The meteorology department raised danger signal number 10, the highest, at Mongla, Bangladesh's second main sea port, and number 9 at Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. The storm was expected to hit India's West Bengal coast around midnight with wind speeds of up to 200 km per hour, said B.P. Yadav, a senior weather official. "We have suggested evacuation of people from the region," he added. Reuters contributed to the report bdnews2
