 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Aid officials have described damage from the mega-cyclone, which killed about 1,000 people, blew away homes and ripped out trees and power lines, as extremely severe. Most of the country plunged into darkness Friday after the electricity grid was knocked out. Parts of Dhaka, the capital city of 10 million people, were still without power Saturday. "Our relief teams have started emergency distribution, with an initial coverage of 100,000 people," said Vince Edwards, World Vision's Bangladesh national director. "However, several areas are inaccessible right now due to fallen trees," a World Vision statement quoted Edwards as saying on Saturday. Rice crops that had been ready for harvesting next month have been seriously damaged, he said. Germany has allocated $293,000 in emergency relief aid and the European Union has released 1.5 million euros ($2.1 million) in fast-track aid. "This is a major tragedy with hundreds already known to have died and hundreds of thousands suffering from this disaster," said Louis Michel, the European Commissioner responsible for Development and Humanitarian Aid. In New York, John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said his office would make available "several million dollars" in emergency aid. The United Nations Development Programme offered to aid Bangladesh to help cope with the aftermath of the cyclone, UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien said. Dessallien made the pledge at a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his office Saturday. "Our sympathy goes out to those families who have lost loved ones. We stand by the victims and we support the government's good efforts to alleviate their sufferings and rebuild their livelihoods," Dessallien said. Commenting on the situation, Dessallien said, "The government's preparatory efforts and use of early warning systems played a significant role in minimising the loss of life." "Given the force of the cyclone, much assistance will be required to help the survivors in the worst affected districts to recover from the devastation," she said. BRAC, one of the largest development organisations of the world, launched extensive disaster relief operations and allocated Tk 7 crore in emergency funds. "BRAC has committed Tk 7 crore from its own fund and is hoping to mobilise another Tk 7 crore for relief and livelihood rehabilitation work in the initial stage," the NGO said in a statement Saturday. The UN's World Food Programme said it was sending 98 tonnes of high-energy biscuits, enough for 400,000 people for three days. "The urgent needs are food, water purification tablets and medicines," WFP spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said. The United States expressed its "deepest" sympathy for the cyclone victims as it joined hands with the international community in relief efforts. "The United States government would like to express its deepest sympathy for the victims of the cyclone," US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said, reading a statement to reporters in Washington. "We are ready to work with the government (Bangladesh) and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster," he said. "Many people are homeless, crops and livelihoods have been destroyed and this is going to put great pressure on the government, the economy, and the people themselves -- particularly as this comes only a few months after floods devastated the northern part of the country," said Suman SMA Islam, CARE's humanitarian assistance coordinator in Bangladesh. bd
