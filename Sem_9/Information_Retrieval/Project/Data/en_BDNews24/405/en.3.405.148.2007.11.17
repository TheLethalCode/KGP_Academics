<TITLE> Sidr weakens into land low </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Mega-cyclone Sidr, which ravaged large swathes of Bangladesh, weakened into well-marked land low, the Met office said Saturday. At 8.30am Saturday, the land low exited Bangladesh to the northeast and headed into Assam and Tripura in India. Meteorologists said Sidr had intensified into a hurricane near its centre, and that wind speeds were "very high" when the storm was 1,115 kilometres off the coast of Bangladesh. The weather office could not confirm whether Sidr was the strongest cyclone in the history of Bangladesh. The Met office recorded Sidr's highest wind speed of 223 kilometres per hour in Patuakhali. Before making landfall, wind speeds reached 220 kilometres per hour within a 74 kilometre radius of the eye of the storm, with gusts exceeding 240 kilometres per hour. Wind speeds were higher than 225 kilometres per hour in some places, and the Met office believes the speeds at the storm centre were even higher. The weather office did not have observation centres at those places hit hardest by the storm. The wind speed of the 1991 cyclone was 225 kilometres per hour. Meteorological Department director Samarendra Karmakar told bdnews24.com that the warning signal No. 4 had been hoisted in coastal areas before the storm struck because the weather office was not certain of the storm's path. According to official rules, the 'great danger' storm signal is to be hoisted at least 10 hours before a storm hits land. During Sidr, the 'great danger' signal was announced 24 hours before the storm made land fall. This early warning announcement was a first in Bangladesh. Ex-director of the Meteorological Department Sajedur Rahman said Sidr generated very high wind speeds at its centre as it moved towards the coast. He said storm casualties and damage would have been worse if the storm had moved along the coast instead of heading inland. bdnews
