<TITLE> UK to lift curbs on hand luggage from January </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security restrictions on hand luggage carried onto passenger planes in Britain will be lifted starting in January, the British government said on Wednesday. The restriction was introduced in August 2006 after British police said they foiled a plot to blow up US-bound airliners over the Atlantic using liquid explosives. The tight security measures initially caused chaos at London's Heathrow airport and drew complaints from airlines. British Airways says that its business has been hit. "Starting with several airports in the New Year, we will work with airport operators to ensure all UK airports are in a position to allow passengers to fly with more than one item of hand luggage," Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly said because airports were so busy during the Christmas period, the earliest the lifting of the restriction could take effect would be January 7, 2008. "This is not about relaxing security. It's about allowing airports to take advantage of smarter technologies," Kelly said. Brown also said the government planned additional screening of baggage and passenger searches at large railway stations
