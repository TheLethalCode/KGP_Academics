 LONDON, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The first Eurostar train slid out of the elegantly refurbished St. Pancras station in London on Wednesday at the start of a new high-speed run to Paris. Accompanied by bagpipes playing "congratulations", a Eurostar official cut the yellow ribbon to open the departures section of the Victorian Gothic "Cathedral of the Railways" after an 800 million pound ($1.66 billion) facelift. Trains will run from St Pancras in north London to the Channel Tunnel on a new line, allowing them to touch speeds of 186 miles (299 km).

It has reported a surge in bookings for travel from the new St Pancras terminus with one million seats already reserved. Travellers will be sent off and arrive in elegant style from the cavernous station first opened in 1868. With a vast 75 metre (240 feet) glass and steel arched roof bathing travellers with sunlight, the station boasts a large sub-level shopping mall and what it says is the longest champagne bar in the world at 93 metres. However, Eurostar passengers arriving at the Gare du Nord in Paris faced a struggle if they wanted to travel any further. Transport links in the French capital were badly disrupted by strikes over pension refo
