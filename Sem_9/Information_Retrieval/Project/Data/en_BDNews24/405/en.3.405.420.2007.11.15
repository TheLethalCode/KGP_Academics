 JERUSALEM, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel have the opportunity of becoming Group E kingmakers when they face Russia in a Euro 2008 qualifier in Tel Aviv on Saturday. The home side are out of the running for a place in next year's finals but the hopes of second-placed England as well as Russia rest on the result of the game. Victory for Guus Hiddink's Russia will practically secure them a place in next year's finals with a final group game against bottom side Andorra. However, a win or draw for Israel will leave the door open for England to qualify when they take on group leaders Croatia at Wembley in their final match next Wednesday. Hiddink believes his charges are good enough to win in Tel Aviv and he does not expect Israel to be able to maintain the pressure for the whole match. "Israel have no extra pressure as they are already out of the qualifying ... They will also be playing at home and so will try to attack, but I don't think they can put us under pressure for the entire 90 minutes," Hiddink told Reuters. He is likely to keep faith in the same lineup that beat England 2-1 in Moscow last month, although in the goalkeeping department he must choose between former number one Igor Akinfeyev, who is back from injury, and Vladimir Gabulov. Despite Hiddink's confidence, the Russians are faced with Israel's impressive home record. Tel Aviv is a place where most teams struggle to come away with more than a point. Croatia's 4-3 win there in November 2006 ended Israel's seven-year unbeaten run in the city. Dror Kashtan's side includes a number of young recruits who will want to perform well knowing that the eyes of much of the soccer world will be on them. Kashtan will miss the in-form Yossi Benayoun of Liverpool through a groin injury but he welcomes back Argentine-born striker Roberto Colautti from an ankle problem that sidelined him for Israel's qualifiers with England and Croatia. The rest of the team will be a mix of experience and youth with Deportivo Coruna goalkeeper Dudu Aouate and Chelsea central defender Tal Ben Haim probably alongside young Maccabi Haifa defender Dekel Keinan. Probable teams: Israel: Dudu Aouate; Yoav Ziv, Shimon Gershon, Tal Ben Haim, Yuval Shpungin; Gal Alberman, Tamir Cohen, Barak Yitzhaki, Maor Buzaglo, Aviram Barchyan, Roberto Colautti. Russia: Igor Akinfeyev; Vasily Berezutsky, Sergei Ignashevich, Alexei Berezutsky; Dmitry Torbinsky or Alexander Anyukov, Yuri Zhirkov, Diniyar Bilyaletdinov, Konstantin Zyryanov, Igor Semshov; Andrei Arshavin, Roman Pavlyuchenko. Referee: Stefano Farina (Italy
