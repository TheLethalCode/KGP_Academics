 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks ended mixed Tuesday as institutional investors moved to rebalance their portfolios. "It's all about institutional balancing. Some investors sold their stocks while others bought," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The market grew in the opening session, but stared to decline amid selling pressure driven by profit-taking, primarily from a section of institutional investors. An internet failure, following a break in the optical fibre cable connection, stalled some investors who trade outside the stock exchange. "Many investors failed to get into the market due to the internet failure," said Khan. The DSI or all-share price index lost 1.45 points or 0.05 percent to end on 2503.81. The DGEN or general index ended almost flat at 2960.51, up 0.27 points or 0.0091 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip gained 28.21 points, or 1.21 percent, to end on 2322.03. Of the issues traded, 102 gained, 101 lost and 22 held steady from 13,591,759 shares worth Tk 2.49 billion. Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion of funds at AIMS of Bangladesh, said the market was behaving normally. "The market ended almost flat without any hype," said Sayeed. BRAC Bank, the most active issue on the bourse, declined 1.40 percent to Tk 1616.75. Market heavyweight, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, the second most active issue, declined 1.09 percent to Tk 630.50. Other power issues closed mixed, with DESCO gaining and Summit Power declining. Islami Bank continued its rise, adding 3.91 percent to end on Tk 6317. Trust Bank gained 0.02 percent to finish on Tk 1114. UCBL advanced 1.81 percent to Tk 4775.25. Standard Bank and Eastern Bank advanced, although AB Bank continued its decline. Square Pharma finished upbeat. All indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange, except for the CSE all share price index ended higher. A total of 52 issues gained, 65 lost and five held steady, with 3,036,223 shares worth Tk 427.99 million traded. bd
