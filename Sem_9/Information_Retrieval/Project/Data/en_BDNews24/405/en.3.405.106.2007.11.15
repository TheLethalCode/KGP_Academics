<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka special court Thursday sentenced former BNP state minister Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku to nine years in jail for acquiring illegal assets and hiding information. Justice Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Judge's Court-5 handed down seven years for having nearly Tk 5 crore in undeclared assets and two years for hiding information and also fined him Tk 50 lakh. Tuku will have to serve another year in jail if he fails to pay the fine, according to the verdict. The former junior minister for power was arrested by the joint forces on Feb 3 and his jail sentence comes into force from the day he was detained. The appeals court, however, stayed the trial of the cases filed against Tuku's wife Romana Ahmed, son Abed Hasan Mahmud and daughter Sara Hasan Mahmud. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed a case against Tuku and his family on March 21 with Mohammadpur Police Station on charges of illegally acquiring Tk 4.96 crore worth of assets and concealing income-related information in his wealth statement. Another ACC deputy director, Akhtar Hamid Bhuiyan, pressed charges on June 28 at the metropolitan magistrate's court. A Special Judge's Court housed in the Sangsad Bhaban complex framed charges against Tuku and family on July 15 and the witnesses started testifying on July 23. The judge set the verdict date after hearing arguments on Nov 4. bdnews24
