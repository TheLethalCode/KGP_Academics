<TITLE> Asian shares sag on resource stocks, OPEC eyed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian share markets slipped further on Tuesday after suffering their biggest one-day percentage drop in three months, as resource shares fell on the back of sliding commodities and oil prices. Gold fell more than 1 percent to its lowest level in nearly two weeks before rebounding, and oil eased for a second day as the U.S. dollar held on to its recent gains and traders considered the possibility that OPEC would raise output. Financial bookmakers in London expect France's CAC 40 to open down as much as 1 percent, Germany's DAX to open as much as 0.8 percent lower and Britain's FTSE 100 to start as much as 0.7 percent lower. Tokyo's Nikkei average ended 0.5 percent down despite solid economic growth figures and extending its losing streak into an eighth straight session as energy-related shares fell. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks dropped 0.3 percent by 0615 GMT. On Monday, the MSCI index tumbled nearly 4 percent, suffering its steepest drop slide since the 5.7 percent slump on Aug. 16. The index has fallen more than 10 percent from the Nov. 1 record high, the second double-digit pullback from a peak this year. "Hedge funds, facing redemptions, appear to be cashing in and it may be that European investors are taking advantage of the strong yen and selling their Japanese stock holdings," said Toru Otsuka, deputy general manager of the investment information department at Mizuho Investors Securities Co Ltd. Investors sold Japanese exporters such as Canon Inc, fearing the yen's strength would dent dollar profits at these firms. Resource companies were the hardest hit. Oil producer PetroChina Co Ltd fell 4.4 percent in Hong Kong. Rival CNOOC Ltd sank 4.3 percent. Gold miner Zijin Mining dived 12.1 percent, while nickel miner Xinjiang Xinxin Mining Industry Co Ltd tumbled 10.7 percent. Australia's biggest investment bank, Macquarie Group, was also among the biggest losers, down 4 percent after giving a cautious outlook. But some financial shares found support in data that showed Japan's economy grew a better-than-expected 0.6 percent in the third quarter. South Korea's KOSPI finished 0.5 percent up. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell nearly 2 percent, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index put on 0.9 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX rose 0.7 percent. On Wall Street, stocks dropped for a fourth session on Monday led by technology shares. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.7 percent while the blue-chip Dow edged down 0.4 percent. RISK AVERSION Japanese government bonds edged up and the 10-year yield hit a 22-month low after Tokyo shares slid, reinforcing doubts about when the Bank of Japan would be able to next raise rates. The central bank kept rates at 0.5 percent for an 11th straight meeting on Tuesday, but market players believe Governor Toshihiko Fukui will reiterate that rates will rise gradually despite the latest credit jitters hitting stock markets. The yen retreated against the dollar, following a surge in the Japanese currency sparked by unwinding of risky carry trades -- when investors borrow low-yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding ones. The dollar traded at 110.00 yen pulling away from the day's high around 110.50 yen, but the pair stayed above an 18-month low of 109.12 yen hit on electronic trading platform EBS on Monday. The euro was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.4580, though still well below a record high of $1.4753 hit on EBS on Friday. US light crude for December steadied around $94.63 a barrel by 0630 GMT, recovering from a more than $1 slide in early trade after Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the producer group would not act on output at a summit this week in Riya
