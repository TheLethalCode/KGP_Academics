 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Tropical cyclone SIDR intensified in strength prior to striking the Khulna-Barisal coast Thursday evening. Earlier forecasts from various hurricane-warning centres around the world had predicted that the force of the cyclone would reduce in intensity before hitting land in southwestern Bangladesh Thursday. SIDR developed into a powerful category 4 hurricane Wednesday, but was expected to weaken in intensity prior to landfall, though still hit coastal regions with devastating force. Before striking the coast Thursday evening the cyclone's intensity was forecast to have reduced to 110 knots (127 mph or 200 km/h). However, SIDR attained maximum sustained wind speeds of up to 135 knots (155 mph or 250 km/h), just before striking land, according to a forecast of the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre, based in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. According to the JTWC's SIDR Warning No 13 (1200 GMT Thursday), the cyclone began to feel some land influence as it approached the coast of Bangladesh, and weakened slightly from its peak intensity. It is expected to track more northeastward after landfall and will steadily weaken due to land interaction. SIDR is forecast to continue overland for the next 48 hours, before dissipating. A hurricane, the strongest storm on Earth, is a cyclonic or rotary storm system that derives its energy from cloud formation and rainfall, rather than from a temperature gradient. When winds are sustained (based on a one-minute average) at 64 knots (74 mph or 119 km/h) or more, the storm is called a hurricane, a typhoon or a tropical cyclone/severe cyclonic storm, depending on its geographical location. The strongest hurricanes release energy equivalent to one 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. Alongside the recent Hurricane Noel, SIDR has been predicted to be one of the most powerful tropical cyclones this year. However 2007 will rank as a historically inactive hurricane/cyclone year for the Northern Hemisphere as a whole, according to the Florida-based Centre for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS). During the past 30 years, only 1977 has experienced less tropical cyclone activity than 2007. Nevertheless, says COAPS, late-season developments may still occur since hurricane season continues until the end of November in the Atlantic, and the Western Pacific and Northern Indian Ocean see cyclone activity in early winter bdn
