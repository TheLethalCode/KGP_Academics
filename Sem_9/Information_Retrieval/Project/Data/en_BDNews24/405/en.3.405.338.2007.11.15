 GWALIOR, India, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) - Sachin Tendulkar hit a stunning 97 as India beat Pakistan by six wickets in Gwalior to claim a first one-day series win over them on home soil since 1983. Tendulkar was imperious in sharing 107 with Virender Sehwag (43) but fell in the 90s for the sixth time in 2007. It mattered little as Yuvraj Singh (53no) and Mahendra Dhoni (45no) eased India home with 21 balls to spare. Mohammad Yousuf finished unbeaten on 99 as the tourists totalled 255-6, with Younus Khan weighing in with 68. It was a mixed-bag of a batting effort in which no-one really launched a sustained assault. Salman Butt followed his 129 in Kanpur with a two-ball duck, trapped lbw by one that RP Singh nipped back, and India's seamers maintained a firm stranglehold in the first half of the innings. Younis was twice almost caught behind off Irfan Pathan before eventually unfurling some delightful strokes as he put on 78 with Shoaib Malik and reached his 29th ODI fifty off 70 balls. However, after skipper Malik inside-edged a delivery on to his middle-stump to hand Zaheer his 200th ODI wicket, another period of consolidation was required. Number three Younus swept Harbhajan Singh for six and Yousuf cut Sehwag powerfully to signal a change of tempo in their partnership of 51 but two quick wickets set Pakistan back again. Younus got a leading edge back to slow left-armer Yuvraj and Shahid Afridi provided Sourav Ganguly with his 100th ODI victim, falling lbw trying to work the ball on the leg-side. Yousuf, who reached his 59th ODI half century off 64 balls, was becalmed by those blows and he and Misbah-ul-Haq (40) only intermittently pierced the field with some good timing. A heave off Harbhajan over deep mid-wicket for six and crash over cover off RP Singh were among the highlights from Yousuf, while Misbah smashed RP Singh down the ground for a maximum. But there was little else to truly excite as India's trio of left-arm pacemen resumed their earlier control. Yousuf did manage a straight six off Singh in the final over after Misbah had been cleaned up by a Pathan off-cutter to end their stand of 94 in 15 overs. If Pakistan were in contention then, they were in the ascendency when Ganguly edged Shoaib Akhtar to second slip and Gautam Gambhir pulled Rao Iftikhar Anjum straight to square-leg. However, as the wicket livened up under the lights, Tendulkar came to the fore with a 102-ball masterclass featuring a sumptuous array of leg-side flicks and drives through the arc between point and cover. Anything even a fraction short or wide was ruthlessly punished and so dominant was he that it almost escaped unnoticed that the man at the other end was Sehwag, himself no slouch. Comprehensively overshadowed by the efforts of his partner, Sehwag provided a reminder of his power by driving Anjum quite majestically through the covers and thrashing Afridi over wide long-on for six. It was not long before Tendulkar took the lead again, however, blasting Afridi over cover, backward of and in front of point for three boundaries in as many balls. Pakistan were wilting but they had some relief when Sehwag was run out by a direct hit from Malik at mid-off and 10 balls later most of the crowd groaned when Tendulkar got an inside edge on to his stumps off Gul. That window of opportunity for the visitors was closed with the minimum of fuss by Dhoni and Yuvraj, who between them launched a series of blistering cuts, pulls and cover-drives to render Sunday's finale in Jaipur academic.
