<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares were down more than 1 percent by midday on Wednesday, erasing gains made earlier this week, with Royal Bank of Scotland and French drug maker Sanofi-Aventis among leading losers. Euro-zone inflation rose to its highest level in more than two years, prompting some economists to warn that the European Central Bank (ECB) may have to raise interest rates, and other data signalled slower economic growth and hence deteriorating prospects for corporate profits. By 1155 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.1 percent at 1,505.88 points, having risen for the previous three sessions. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland fell 4 percent, with traders citing persistent worries about the extent of damage banks would take from the turmoil in credit markets. Barclays rose as much as 6.8 percent in early trade after the bank said it had wrote down 1.3 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in the period between July and October, less than was feared, but retreated to trade flat by 1155 GMT. French retail bank Credit Agricole fell 3.5 percent after it reported lower third-quarter net profits. The Wall Street Journal said Swiss bank UBS could face fourth-quarter writedowns of up to $7.11 billion, while Citigroup could also incur more losses. UBS shares were down 2.2 percent and the DJ STOXX banks index was 1.6 percent lower. Euro-zone inflation rose to 2.6 percent in October. "The risk is that above-target current inflation rates contribute to a sustained dislodging of inflation expectations. In this case, the ECB would likely act to quell the increase in inflation expectations by raising rates," UBS said in a note, adding that an ECB rate increase was not its central scenario. "Equities generally don't like news of inflation, they would probably prefer to be looking at a series of central bank cuts that are getting delayed and that's part of the issue -- whether the credit, or liquidity crunch ... has put things slightly on hold," said Dresdner Kleinwort strategist Philip Isherwood. The Swiss ZEW investor sentiment indicator fell in November to the lowest since it was launched in June 2006. "The fall is due to the turbulences on the financial markets ... the banks' troubles will keep us busy well into 2008," said Julius Baer economist Janwillem Acket. L'OREAL CUTS STAKE Italian think tank REF revised down its economic growth forecast for Italy to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent, citing higher prices and unfavourable euro rates, and British retail sales unexpectedly fell in October for the first time since January and sales growth in September was revised lower. Sanofi-Aventis fell 4.4 percent after L'Oreal said late on Wednesday it cut its stake in the company. "There may be some short term pressure on the stock from a technical point of view but we would use any dip to pick up stock as we expect any technical pressure to unwind relatively quickly," Dresdner Kleinwort said in a note. Bear Stearns downgraded its European pharma sector rating to market weight from overweight. "We expect overall market risk or a further wave of product disappointments triggering earnings downgrades at several companies could result in a further de-rating," said Bear Stearns, which rates Sanofi-Aventis "underperform". Shares in oil major BP were down 1.3 percent, Royal Dutch Shell fell 1 percent and French Total dropped 0.7 percent as the crude oil price struggled to break above $94 a barrel. US inventory data is due later on Thursday. But OMV rose 1.5 percent after the Austrian oil and gas group's third-quarter earnings beat market expectations. "OMV is well on track to meet its 2010 production targets," Sal. Oppenheim said in a note, reiterating its "buy" rating. Among other gainers, shares in Scottish and Newcastle rose 3.1 percent after Danish Carlsberg and Dutch Heineken raised their joint cash bid for the British brewer. Key economic data due later include U.S. consumer prices for October, due at 1330 GMT, which could determine the timing of the Federal Reserve's next rate c
