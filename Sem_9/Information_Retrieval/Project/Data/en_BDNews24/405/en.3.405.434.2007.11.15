 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture adviser CS Karim Thursday said he was sorry over industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury's comments on the fertiliser crisis. Geeteara Tuesday termed the crisis a 'myth' created by the media and the farmers unwilling to queue up. Addressing a press briefing at the secretariat, CS Karim said the government in an effort to curb the problems in fertiliser distribution had decided to appoint three block traders along with the existing single dealer in each union. Meanwhile, the government had asked law enforcers and intelligence agencies to intensify border vigilance against smuggling of fertiliser, he noted. The adviser said that they were sorry about the comments because the farmers were "national heroes". Replying to a query, he said the government was trying to set up two new fertiliser factories to meet the local demand. "We are asking for help in this regard from friendly nations. The factories will be set up as soon as we get promises from them. Then we will figure out how much we can export instead of calculating imports," Karim said. The adviser told the press briefing that there was no shortage of fertiliser in the country, but that there were problems in the distribution process. "The government has decided to appoint a sales representative in all the three blocks of each union. That would bring to 14,400 the number of dealers along with the existing 4,800. Farmers can collect fertiliser from those representatives. However, the block traders will add transportation costs to the fixed cost. The price will be fixed by the District Fertiliser and Seed Management Committee," he added. The adviser said that the government was determined to supply fertiliser to farmers at a reduced price. "That's why the government subsidises Tk 2.40 per kg for locally produced fertiliser and Tk 25.70 per kg for the imported ones. Everyone has to be aware so that the government subsidies go to the farmers, and not to the intermediaries", he added. Karim said that the government had to subsidise Tk 3,606 crore for fertiliser as the price had gone up on the international market. "Tk 3,120 crore would be for urea fertiliser alone," he said. The adviser also painted a picture of the seed supply situation and fertiliser production for the coming Boro crop season at the press briefing. He said: "The demand for seed in the coming Boro season is estimated at 98,500 tonnes for 43,75,000 hectares of farmland." bdnews
