 Bandarban, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Allegations of illegally filling out voter enlistment forms have been made against 17 Rohingyas from Bandarban, said district election officer Quamrul Hasan Tuesday. Hasan told bdnews24.com that the Myanmar nationals have now been identified and their names dropped from the voter rolls. Residents from the Sualak area in Bandarban lodged a complaint with the local Union Parishad chairman who forwarded the matter to the District Election Office. Locals complained that a number of Rohingyas from Myanmar had filled out information sheets required for voter registration and national ID cards, using various ploys. "So far, 17 Rohingyas from Islampur and Langiparha have been identified as having filled out the forms. Their names have now been struck off the voter list," Hasan said. "We are probing other complaints of a similar nature," the DEO said. Voter listing and preparatory work for the new national ID cars started in Bandarban on Oct 22, with the process of voter data collection completed on Nov 3. "Representatives from local Union Parishad's are now attending registration centres when voters are being photographed to help law enforcers identify illegal Rohingyas," Hasan said. bdnews2
