 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The one-member Judicial Commission assigned to probe the August violence at Dhaka University said Thursday the initial protest by the students was spontaneous but later instigated by political forces. The commission chief, justice Habibur Rahman Khan, in a report submitted to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said the instigation was tied to political interests. The violence that took place on Aug 20-22 was the first major flare-up after the interim government came to power, backed by the army. Many had argued that the three-day protest was spontaneous while many others had said political parties had tried to cash in on the situation to embarrass the government. The protest began after an altercation between a university student and an army officer during a football match in the university playground. The situation became complicated after some other army officers had allegedly beat the student, sparking broader protests. In a news briefing, the commission chief said the protest on Aug 20 was not instigated and remained so until midday of Aug 21. Khan said the government had removed the army camp from the campus immediately to meet the demand by the students. He said rickshawpullers and street vendors, who were ousted from the streets by the government, took part in the violent protest after the Aug 21 midday, worsening the situation. The politics of students and teachers added fuel to the protests, he said. The commission placed a set of recommendations to prevent such incidents in future. One of them is, students, teachers and members of the law-enforcement agencies must follow their institutional code of conduct. Khan also recommended amendment to the Commission of Enquiry Act 1956, as it does not empower a commission to try any offender. The commission also suggested formation of a campus security force under the management of the university authorities. It said the teachers and students should not maintain a direct link with any political party. On whether the commission had put any point on the release of the detained students and teachers, Khan said that no commission head should make any comment on matters on trial. bdnew
