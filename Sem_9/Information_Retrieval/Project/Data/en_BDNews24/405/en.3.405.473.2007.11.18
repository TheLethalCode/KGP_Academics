 BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Belgians marched on Sunday to defend the integrity of their linguistically divided country after a government crisis that has led to speculation the kingdom might break up. Organisers hope to press Dutch- and French-speaking politicians to resolve differences that have left the country still governed by a caretaker administration more than five months after a parliamentary election. "We, Belgians of birth, heart or choice, demand that politicians respect our country. And our unity," said the marchers' declaration, which was to be handed to leaders of the Belgian parliament. The suspension of four-party talks to form a government this month has revived media speculation about a possible break-up of the 177-year-old nation, seat of the European Union's main institutions, even though polls show most Belgians favour unity. "Its a strong signal and we must take notice of such signals since it doesn't happen often," francophone Socialist Party leader Elio de Rupo told reporters. Police estimated some 20,000 people began the protest at the Gare du Nord railway station in central Brussels. Their number grew as they marched in cold, sunny weather towards the Parc du Cinquantenaire, near the EU's headquarters. The march's organiser, civil servant Marie-Claire Houard, had expected up to 50,000 people to show up, saying less than 10,000 would represent a failure. Houard has collected nearly 140,000 signatures on the petition to preserve the unity of the nation of 10.5 million people. "It's ridiculous, we have loads of problems with politicians ... we have come here to show that we are all together and in solidarity with each other," said one of the marchers, Yannel de Wouters, Brussels resident. Francophones were in clear majority among those marching, many wrapped in Belgium's black, yellow and red flag. One banner said: "Mummy is Flemish, daddy is French and we are all little Belgians." Politicians from the more prosperous and populous Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north are seeking more autonomy in government negotiations, while their counterparts from poorer, French-speaking Wallonia defend the status quo. Belgians on either side of the language divide have their own schools and news media, and different political parties. Francophone newspapers had appealed to readers to show up en masse for Sunday's march, while their Dutch counterparts have given it minimal coverage. Flemish parties, fed up with decades of subsidising Wallonia, have demanded decentralisation of power in talks led by would-be prime minister, Flemish Christian Democrat leader Yves Leterme. The last time Belgium was in a similar crisis was in 1988, when it took 148 days to form a governme
