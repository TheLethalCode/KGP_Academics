<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona cruised to a 3-0 away win over Segunda B (third division) Alcoyano in the first leg of their King's Cup last 32 round tie on Tuesday, while holders Sevilla were held 1-1 away to Denia. Barcelona's France striker Thierry Henry finished off a slick move involving Xavi and Eidur Gudjohnsen in the 25th minute, and Iceland forward Gudjohnsen put away a penalty three minutes from time. Youngster Bojan Krkic added a third in the last minute after Alcoyano, who had rarely threatened, lost their heads. They finished with nine on the pitch after having two players sent off in the last 10 minutes. The victory eased the pressure on coach Frank Rijkaard, who had been under fire over their poor away form, as the side showed far greater commitment than they had in Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Getafe in the Primera Liga. Sevilla were given a run for their money by another Segunda B side Denia, as they were held to a 1-1 away draw on an artificial pitch. Uruguayan striker Ernesto Chevanton, in a rare appearance, put Sevilla in front, diverting Jesus Navas's cross into the net in the 75th minute. But they only held the lead for two minutes before Pablo Vidal headed the home side level. In the day's other game, second division Hercules gave visiting Athletic Bilbao a scare as they took a two-goal first-half lead. The home side were reduced to 10 men just before the break and Bilbao restored their pride with goals from Fernando Llorente and Asier del Horno, to scramble a 2-2 draw. There are six more first legs being played on Wednesday, including two between top-flight sides, with Levante hosting Almeria and Real Murcia travelling to Valladolid. The Primera Liga's second-placed club Villarreal visit second division basement side Las Palmas. The remaining seven ties have been postponed until next month at the request of clubs exercising the option due to international call ups. The return legs are due to be played on Jan. 2
