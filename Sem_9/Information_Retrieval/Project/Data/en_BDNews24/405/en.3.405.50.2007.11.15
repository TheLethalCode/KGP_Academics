 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Officials in Cox's Bazar Thursday said they had evacuated nearly 200,000 people to about 600 government and private shelters and asked others to move on their own. As the hurricane SIDR crashed on the Barisal-Khulna coastline, around 400,000 more had been evacuated from other coastal areas, disaster management officials said. Chittagong and Mongla ports suspended operations on Wednesday and moved ships to safer areas, port officials said. Chittagong airport suspended flights and moved planes away, officials said. All schools and colleges in Chittagong and other towns in the storm's path have been shut down and fishing trawlers have been asked to return to port immediately. The meteorology department raised danger signal number 10, the highest, for Mongla, the country's second main seaport, and number 9 for Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. The disaster management coordination committee, headed by cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder, asked all government employees in coastal districts to remain at their posts. The coast guard and police were asked to prepare more cyclone shelters and ensure the security of property belonging to those evacuated. Members of Ansar, the Village Defence Police and the fire brigade were instructed to carry out rescue and relief operations, while medical teams were established and medicines readied. To maintain communications, arrangements have been made for round-the-clock contact with critical people by mobile phone through the satellite system. In addition to government officials, over 40,000 volunteers have been mobilised in coastal districts under the Disaster Preparedness Programme to assist in the evacuation. There are 2,148 cyclone shelters in the coastal districts, which will have to meet a potential influx of over 3,000,000 people. The disaster management committee said in addition to current stocks held in the 15 districts at risk, Tk 50,000, 50 tonnes of rice, 1000 blankets and 7060 tents had been sent to the districts. Dry food has also been prepared for every cyclone shelter. The meeting also requested the Air Force to ready helicopters for the rescue and relief operations. The government requested local officials to contact the control room of the food and disaster management ministry for advice and assistance. The districts at risk are Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Feni, Luxmipur, Bhola, Barisal, Patuakhali, Barguna, Chandpur, Comilla, Faridpur, Dhaka, Pirojpur, Jhalakati, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, Jessore and Kushtia, said a Met Office bulletin Thursday. The control room numbers for the food and disaster management ministry are 7160454 and 7162116. The Disaster Management Bureau control room number is 8859638. The storm preparedness programme control room number is 9353625. The number for the Directorate of Relief and Rehabilitation is 9891926. The storm was expected to hit India's West Bengal coast around midnight with wind speeds of up to 200 km per hour, said BP Yadav, a senior weather official. "We have suggested evacuation of people from the region," he added. India issued a red alert for coastal areas of Orissa and West Bengal on Thursday, information and broadcasting minister Priyaranjan Dasmunsi told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
