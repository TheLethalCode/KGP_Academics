<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) -- A committee formed to evaluate government employee pay-scales in the face of a sustained rise in the costs of living advised a salary hike in the form of a 'dearness allowance'. "The committee decided that government employees need an upper adjustment to their salaries to cope with inflationary pressures," the committee head and additional secretary of the finance ministry, ATM Fazlul Karim, told reporters after a final meeting on the subject in his office. However, Karim declined to give specifics on any the committee's recommendations, including how much the potential salary hike would be. "The committee will submit its report to the finance adviser soon," said Karim, adding, "The highest authority, the council of advisers, will make the final decision." The additional secretary said the system for the new financial benefit would be neither incremental nor by rationing. "The committee has instead suggested a dearness allowance," he said. The committee also included representatives from the Chief Adviser's Office, the Ministry of Establishment and the Ministry of Defence. The rate of inflation, on a point-to-point basis, crossed the double digit level last July, and 10.12 percent in August, although it came down to 9.6 percent in September. The caretaker administration's initial projection for the annual rate of inflation was below 7 percent for the current fiscal year. But economists and other experts have already expressed doubt about the government's projection. They fear the prevailing rate of inflation will continue to rise in the coming months due to higher commodity prices in the international market and sluggish local economic trends. The committee discussed different indicators such as the rate of inflation, the country's per capita income, and the cost of living and price trends of commodities in the international market. It also considered steps taken in neighbouring countries to assist government employees overcome domestic rises in the cost of living. The last pay hike introduced was made by the immediate past political government in May 2005. It approved a new pay scale with a 53.33 percent salary hike for civil servants and defence officials in the highest grade, and 60 percent in the lowest grade. That pay hike cost the government Tk 3,975 crore. Some 1.55 million government employees, including 828,000 civil servants, 140,000 defence personnel and 560,000 teachers, on the Monthly Payment Order, received the last pay hike. bd
