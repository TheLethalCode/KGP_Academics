<TITLE> Gold flirts with $800 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold briefly dipped below $800 an ounce on Wednesday before bouncing back on bargain hunting and firmer crude oil, but dealers said the correction from recent multi-year highs may not be over yet. Spot gold fell as low as $799.70 an ounce before rebounding to $805.10/805.80, higher than $798.10/798.90 late in New York, with a recovery in Asian stocks offering support. Gold hit a low of $790.80 on Tuesday, its lowest since November 2, having retreated from a 28-year high of $845.40 hit last week. The metal struck a record high of $850 in January 1980. "As we proceed to the year-end, there could be some more profit taking. These volatilities are symptomatic of investors' desire to lock in profits and adjust portfolios," said Pradeep Unni, an analyst with Vision Commodities in Dubai. "It remains to be seen whether this drop will attract physical buyers again. Near-term psychological support is spotted around $799, a breach of which would take the market to $780." Crude oil futures gained and stayed above $91 a barrel after losing more than $5in the past two sessions, with analysts expecting U.S. government data due on Thursday to show declines in inventories. Gold tends to track oil prices as some investors buy the metal as a hedge against oil-driven inflation. Oil has fallen back after touching a record $98.62 a week ago. Gold posted its biggest percentage loss since October 2006 on Monday after investors liquidated positions on sliding oil and a wave of risk aversion, which hit equity and foreign exchange markets. "Looking ahead, if there's no follow through below $790, we should be able to end the week still above $810. The range should be $790 to $810. That's the range for the week," said William Kwan, a dealer at Phillip Futures Pte Ltd in Singapore. "I believe this so-called retracement should be a short-lived thing," he said. Rising energy costs, which had raised gold's appeal as hedge against inflation, helped the metal's recent rally, in addition to expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates by another quarter percentage point at its next meeting in December. Tokyo's Nikkei average climbed 2.47 percent, steadying after an eight-session losing streak, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks rose 2.91 percent, adding to Tuesday's 0.7 percent rise. Gold traditionally has been used by investors as protection against economic and political uncertainty. But it can sometimes behave much like other financial assets because of the growing role of commodities in diversified portfolios. "There's modest interest from Japanese investors. I guess the firming of the euro and the revival of stock markets also help the market," said a dealer in Hong Kong. The key gold futures contract for October 2008 delivery on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange rose 19 yen per gram to 2,906 yen due to a weaker Japanese currency. The contract tumbled to its lowest in nearly three weeks at 2,815 yen on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 111.05 yen -- moving away further away from 109.12 yen hit on Monday as investors believed a rally that pushed up the Japanese currency had gone too far. The euro gained to $1.4661, closing in on a record high $1.4753 hit late last week. In other precious metals, platinum rose to $1,427/1,432 an ounce from $1,415/1,420 in late New York on Tuesday, when it rose about 2 percent on an industry report supporting bullish views on the white metal. The world platinum market would end 2007 in a big deficit, with the metal seen hitting a record high of $1,575 in six months on strong fundamentals and buoyant gold prices, said Johnson Matthey, the world's top platinum refiner and fabricator. Palladium was unchanged at $369/373 an ounce. Silver edged up to $14.81/14.87 an ounce versus $14.65/14.70 in New York on Tuesday. The most-active December gold contract on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $8.2 an ounce to $807.2 on electronic trade.
