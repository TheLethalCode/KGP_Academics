 LIMA, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A struggling Peru are out to cause an upset when they take on Brazil in Sunday's World Cup qualifier, according to coach Jose Del Solar. Peru, who last played at the World Cup in 1982, have taken only one point from their opening two games in the qualifiers for 2010 and have yet to score. They drew 0-0 at home to Paraguay and were beaten 2-0 in Chile last month. "We're going to try and take on Brazil on with what we have, it's a game from which we need the three points and, although we know it will be difficult, we're going to try," Del Solar told reporters. "We left a lot of empty spaces against Paraguay, which we will try and correct... and you can be sure that the team will try and win the game from the first minute." Del Solar welcomed the return from injury of German-based striker Paolo Guerrero, who missed last month's games. "It's obvious that Paolo is important for the team, for the way he plays and the enthusiasm which he always gives to the team," he said. Del Solar also backed Chelsea striker Claudio Pizarro, who has been heavily criticised for his performances. "As far as I'm concerned, he's been phenomenal," he said
