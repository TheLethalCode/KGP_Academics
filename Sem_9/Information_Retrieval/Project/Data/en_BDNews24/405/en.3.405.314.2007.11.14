<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative women seeking an exotic Asian spa experience without compromising their modesty need look no further than Malaysia's first fish spa. Located in Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur's main shopping area, the Kenko Reflexology and Fish Spa employs Kangal, or "doctor" fish, to nibble at the dead skin on customers' hands and feet before they are massaged with special oils. Currently, both male and female customers share the fish pool, but from next month, Kenko will offer private rooms for women with tanks big enough to immerse their whole body into. "We have been getting a lot of Middle East customers," said spa manager Evelyn Leong, adding that these women, mainly from conservative Gulf Arab states, would soon be able to expose their legs or bodies in full privacy. Also in line with strict Islamic tradition, only female masseurs will serve female Middle Eastern customers, she said. Mainly Muslim Malaysia is a favorite holiday destination for well-heeled Gulf Arabs and the country, seeking to boost its tourism revenues, is going all-out to welcome these visitors. The government expects tourist arrivals from the Middle East to hit record 300,000 this year, almost double from last year. Each summer, thousands of Gulf Arab families pack the sidewalk cafes and shopping malls, with women wearing the trademark black abaya, the flowing robe that covers from head-to-toe. More restaurants and hotels now serve food that complies with Muslim dietary laws, offer separate swimming pools for women and provide Arabic satellite television channels in the rooms. There is also a park in Kuala Lumpur that is especially for Arabs. The main international airport makes passenger announcements in Arabic and has special immigration counters for Middle Eastern visitors, who often get visas to stay for up to three months. Fish spas, popular in Turkish spas where they are used to treat skin diseases, are found in several Asian countries including Singapore and Japan.
