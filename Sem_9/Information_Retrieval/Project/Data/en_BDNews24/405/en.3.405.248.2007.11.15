<TITLE> Abbas calls for Hamas's ouster as Gaza's ruler </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday the Gaza Strip's Hamas Islamist rulers must be brought down, issuing his strongest call yet for their removal. "We have to bring down this gang that forcibly took over the Gaza Strip," Abbas said in a television address, three days after seven people were killed by gunfire at a Fatah rally surrounded by Hamas security forces in the territory. Abbas, preparing for a U.S.-hosted Middle East conference the United States hopes will bolster him, offered no details about how Hamas's removal could be accomplished. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described Abbas's comments as "shameful" and said they proved he was not interested in any Palestinian internal reconciliation. Abbas has said there could be no new unity talks with Hamas until it relinquished control of the Gaza Strip, home to 1.5 million Palestinians. Hamas took over the area in fighting in June against Fatah. In the speech, Abbas said he would meet Saudi King Abdullah on Friday to try to hammer out a united stance for the Annapolis, Maryland, conference that the Saudis have sent mixed signals about attending. Saudi Arabia has told senior Western diplomats in recent days that its participation was in doubt because it was not satisfied with the gestures announced so far by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, diplomats said on condition of anonymity. U.S. officials said it was premature to judge Saudi Arabia's intentions because the Bush administration has yet to send formal invitations to the conference, due to convene in the final week of November. CRITICAL ATTENDANCE Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials see Saudi Arabia's attendance as critical to giving a wider Arab stamp of approval to a conference which Abbas sees as a launching pad for establishing a Palestinian state and Israel sees as a way of lessening its isolation in the region. Abbas, who is based in the occupied West Bank, said his talks with King Abdullah were aimed at "coordinating steps, uniting them to achieve our mutual goals". It is unclear how any future peace deal could be implemented with the Palestinian territories divided. Saudi Arabia, which does not have formal relations with Israel, has called on the Jewish state to freeze the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank to attract Arab states to the conference. Israeli officials said Olmert plans to release several hundred Palestinian prisoners and was considering calling for at least a partial freeze in Jewish settlement building before the conference convenes. The Palestinians asked Israel to release 2,000 prisoners and to impose a complete freeze on settlement activity. A senior Israeli official acknowledged that Saudi Arabia was "playing hard to get". "We're willing to give and take with the Palestinians. But we're not going to pay a price to make sure a Gulf state appears," the official said on condition of anonymity. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been struggling to agree on a joint document that would address in broad terms core issues like borders, the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees. But it is increasingly unclear whether a joint document will be ready in time for the conference. Both Israeli and American officials said reaching an agreement on the document was not a requirement for going ahead with the meeting as schedul
