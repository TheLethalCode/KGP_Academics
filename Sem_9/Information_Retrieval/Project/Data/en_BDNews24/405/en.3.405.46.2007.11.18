 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) -- The United Nations and other global aid agencies have started pouring emergency aid amid a renewed promise that they are ready to stand by cyclone victims for rehabilitation and reconstruction, officials said Sunday. The UN officials and representatives of the agencies sat in a crucial meeting with the food and disaster management ministry to review the post-disaster situation and the need for reconstruction, Mohammad Ayub Mia, acting disaster management secretary, told reporters. "We had a very good discussion with the representatives of the UN and the bilateral donor agencies," Ayub said. "They came here to know about our plan and what we need at this moment to stand by the people battered by the cyclone." In the meeting, the UNDP said it released $7 million in immediate support while Japan, Canada, Australia and Spain promised emergency assistance to help survive the crisis, Ayub said. Japan pledged immediate reconstruction materials such as tents from the country's stock in Singapore, he said, adding that Japan also asked other agencies to come forward with projects. "Japan is even ready to fund various projects taken by other parties," the secretary said, adding that the government will use an unutilised Japanese fund for the rehabilitation. The representative of the Australian government told the meeting that the country will make a final announcement Monday about its immediate response. The UN's World Food Programme has already distributed 78 tonnes of high-energy biscuit and another 100 tonnes would be distributed Monday, while another 200 tonnes of biscuit would be dispatched in a few days, Ayub said. The WFP has also offered 10,000 tonnes of rice that could be used through the government's current Vulnerable Group Feeding programme, the secretary said. Unicef said it would provide $5.3 million while it would mobilise another $1.5 million from Canadian International Development Agency, he said. The USAID will provide $2.1 million in aid that would be available soon. The British government said it would channel $5 million through the Department for International Development. The UK-based aid agency Islamic Relief said it would immediately use GBP1 million while another GBP3 million would be used for rehabilitation of the survivors. Spain will give 5,000 euro as emergency aid, Ayub said. Speaking to reporters, WFP country representative Douglas Broderick said that the aid agencies had got a good picture from the government about what the victims needed most. He hoped the aid would continue to flow over the next six months as several millions of victims would require help to live on. bd
