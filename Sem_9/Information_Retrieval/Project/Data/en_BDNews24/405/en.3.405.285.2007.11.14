<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New West Indies coach John Dyson will not accompany the team on their forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe as he remains in Australia to finalise his domestic matters. The 53-year-old former Australia batsman, who was appointed last month, was absent from the first day of the team's training camp on Monday and the chief executive of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) Donald Peters said they had met with the coach and come to an agreement on his availability. "There are no major issues where this is concerned. Obviously for someone coming from so far there are a number of matters to settle. He will miss the Zimbabwe tour and will join the team in South Africa," said Peters. West Indies play the first of five one-day internationals in Zimbabwe on Nov. 30 before touring South Africa where they will play three test matches and another five ODIs. Peters said the coaches in Zimbabwe will be Henderson Springer and David Williams who will then be the assistants to Dyson in South Africa
