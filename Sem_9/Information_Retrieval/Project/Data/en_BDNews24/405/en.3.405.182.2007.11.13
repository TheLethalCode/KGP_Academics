 BAGHDAD, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US and Iraqi troops killed an estimated 15 al Qaeda gunmen during a fierce battle south of Baghdad after the militants launched a major attack on recently formed neighbourhood patrols, the US military said on Tuesday. In a statement, the military said 30 to 45 al Qaeda fighters assaulted two checkpoints operated by local security guards on Monday using a mix of small arms and heavy-calibre machineguns mounted on trucks, sparking a day-long fight. At one stage, American F-16 warplanes jets dropped two 500-pound bombs on routes used by the gunmen to attack the checkpoints in the town of Adwaniya, 20 km (12 miles) southeast of Baghdad near the Tigris River. The area has long been a haven for al Qaeda in Iraq. The al Qaeda raid marked one of the biggest attacks on neighbourhood patrols since a programme to increase their numbers picked up steam in and around Baghdad a few months ago. The US military calls the men "concerned local citizens". They mainly run checkpoints and guard infrastructure. Such groups first emerged last year when Sunni Arab tribal leaders, tired of al Qaeda's indiscriminate killings and strict interpretation of Islam, set up neighbourhood police units in Anbar province in western Iraq. Anbar, once the heart of the Sunni Muslim insurgency, is now relatively peaceful, and the U.S. military has been spreading Anbar's model into other Sunni Arab and Shi'ite areas. About 70,000 Iraqis have so far been registered across Iraq under the neighbourhood security plan. US officials said Monday's battle underscored the cooperation between US and Iraqi forces and the local patrols. It was unclear if any local guards or US troops were wounded in the fighting. "I think all the elements that had a part in today's battle were impressed with the concerned citizens," First Lieutenant Robert Hamilton, a US platoon leader, said in the statement. Some US military commanders have cited the neighbourhood patrols as being a factor in helping sharply reduce violence in Iraq in the past few months, especially around Baghdad and in areas where al Qaeda once had a strong presence. The patrols are relatively new in Adwaniya, the military statement said, but those who came under attack received assistance from local patrol groups from another area. Major-General Rick Lynch, commander of US forces in central Iraq, said on Sunday that 26,000 Iraqis had signed on to the programme in his area of command, which encompasses Adwaniya and other areas south of Baghdad. Of those, 17,000 were directly employed by the US military, manning about 800 checkpoints and earning about $300 a mon
