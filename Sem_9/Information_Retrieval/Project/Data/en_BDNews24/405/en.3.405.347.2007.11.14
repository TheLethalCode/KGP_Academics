<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Wednesday as investors snapped up financial shares that had been hit hard by four straight sessions of losses, while a weaker yen spurred buying of exporters such as Canon Inc. Tokyo's Nikkei average bounced back from the previous session's 15-month low, rising 2.5 percent. US crude oil rose, staying above $91 a barrel after losing more than $5 in the past two sessions. Gold hovered near $800 an ounce, off a 28-year peak of $845.40 an ounce set on Nov. 7. Financial bookmakers expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open up by 55-60 points, Germany's DAX by 67-80 points and France's CAC 40 by 52-66 points, making for gains of around 1 percent. "Unless the US subprime troubles take a turn for the worse, equity markets have a good chance of sustaining an upward trend," said Kim Joong-hyun, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in South Korea. "But in the short-term, sharp swings are still very likely depending on the credit situation." Surprisingly strong earnings from the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores and reassurance from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group that the investment bank does not face big credit losses helped boost the appetite for stocks. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks gained 3.2 percent by 0640 GMT, adding to Tuesday's 0.7 percent rise. It is about 6 percent off a peak struck in early November but still 38 percent higher than at the start of the year. South Korea's KOSPI closed 2.1 percent up and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index ended 1.3 percent higher. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore all rose. Financial shares and exporters were among the strongest performers. A weaker yen helps boost earnings of exporters' dollar-denominated sales when converted into local currency. Australia's top investment bank Macquarie Group climbed 4.2 percent, Citigroup gained 7.3 percent and Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ added 6.3 percent. But some resource stocks slightly underperformed following a pullback in oil and gold prices. Gold producer Newcrest Mining rose 1.8 percent and oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum fell 0.8 percent. On Wall Street, stocks snapped a four-day losing streak on Tuesday, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its biggest one-day gain in more than four years. The Nasdaq gained 3.5 percent, while the blue-chip Dow put on 2.5 percent. YEN SLIPS The yen fell as Asian stocks climbed, with investors feeling a rally that pushed the Japanese currency to an 18-month high against the dollar this week had gone too far. "Short covering in the yen was overdone, so we're seeing an adjustment in those positions," said Hideaki Inoue, a forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking. The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 111.04 yen and kept its distance from an 18-month low of 109.12 yen hit on Monday. But the dollar stayed weak against other currencies as investors shunned it on the view sluggishness in the US housing sector and lingering subprime mortgage woes could hurt the broader economy. The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.4658 closing in on a record high of $1.4753 hit late last week. A leap in share prices also knocked Japanese government bonds from highs. December 10-year futures fell 0.25 point to 136.67, retreating from a 21-month peak of 136.92 hit the previous session. US crude traded at $91.52 a barrel by 0650 GMT, well below a record high of $98.62 set earlier in the mon
