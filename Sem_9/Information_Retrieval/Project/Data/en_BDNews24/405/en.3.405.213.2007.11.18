 DHAKA, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Grieving relatives and rescuers Sunday picked through the rubble left in the wake of a super cyclone that battered the south as the death toll was expected to rise. The control room of the disaster management ministry counted 1,860 deaths in its latest tally released at 8am Sunday. Military ships and helicopters were trying to reach thousands of people believed stranded on islands in the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas still cut off by the devastating storm. Officials expected the death toll to rise further as the search for hundreds of people missing after Thursday night's storm intensified. "It will take several days to complete the search and know the actual casualty figure and extent of damage to property," said food and disaster ministry official Ayub Miah. A huge effort was underway to get food, drinking water and shelter to tens of thousands affected by the storm, the worst to hit disaster-prone country since 1991 when nearly 143,000 people died. Cyclone Sidr smashed into the southern coastline late Thursday night with 250 kph (155 mph) winds that whipped up a five meter tidal surge. Most of the deaths came from the surge washing away homes and strong winds blowing down dwellings. Many others drowned or were lost at sea. Helicopters flew sorties to devastated areas, dropping food, drinking water and medicine for the survivors. "There are not many places where we can land," said one pilot, as large areas were still under water. Several fishermen picked by a trawler from sea said they saw dozens of bodies floating in the waters near the Sundarbans mangrove forest, a world heritage site and home to the endangered Royal Bengal tiger. They also saw scores of dead deer and other wildlife floating in the Pashur river, near the forest. Navy ships scoured coastal areas and sought to clear river channels clogged with sunken vessels. Red Crescent officials said some 1,000 fishermen and about 150 boats were still unaccounted for in the Bay of Bengal. Aid officials said damage from the storm was very severe. "Our relief teams have started emergency distribution, with an initial coverage of 100,000 people," Vince Edwards, national director of World Vision Bangladesh. In many areas, 95 percent of rice crops due to be harvested in a few weeks have been badly damaged, officials said. Hundreds of shrimp farms have also been washed away.
