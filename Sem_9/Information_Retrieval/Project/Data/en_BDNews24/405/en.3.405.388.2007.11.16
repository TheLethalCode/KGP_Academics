 Lahore, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Pakistan freed opposition leader Benazir Bhutto from house arrest on Friday hours before a caretaker prime minister was sworn in to oversee elections the opposition say won't be free and fair. Jail officials left the residence in the eastern city of Lahore where Benazir has been confined since Tuesday to prevent her from leading a pro-democracy rally against President Pervez Musharraf's emergency rule. "The government has withdrawn Benazir's detention order, and from now, she is free to move wherever she likes," Aftab Cheema, police chief of the eastern city of Lahore, told Reuters. "Police will remain (outside) for her security, but there will be no restriction on her movement." The United States had hoped Musharraf and Benazir would end up sharing power after a general election, but they have rounded on each other even before polls take place. Musharraf has pledged to hold the parliamentary elections by Jan. 9. Benazir's release comes ahead of a planned visit by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, who will push General Musharraf to end the emergency rule he imposed on Nov. 3 in an apparent bid to hold on to the presidency, and to free thousands of detained opposition figures. Benazir's release was welcomed in Washington. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said other political detainees should also be freed. "Other steps need to be taken too, including the lifting of the state of emergency," he said. The National Assembly -- which critics say was a pro-Musharraf rubber stamp convened after what they say were rigged polls in 2002 -- completed its term on Thursday. Musharraf swore in an ally as caretaker prime minister -- Senate Chairman Mohammadmian Soomro -- and a 24-member cabinet packed with Musharraf loyalists to oversee the election. The opposition rejected the move as part to Musharraf's plan to retain power and said the election would not be fair, especially under a state of emergency. DETAINEES FREED? Benazir, who was due to hold a news conference later on Friday, has said the possibility of a vote boycott would be discussed at an opposition meeting on Nov. 21. Lahore police official Malik Mohammad Iqbal said detained women activists would be released on Friday but a Benazir party official that was only being done to impress the Americans. "The government is doing this to show their masters that we are so democratic and the caretaker government is neutral," said Latif Khosa, a senator and aide to Bhutto. Struggling to secure another term of office in the face of legal challenges, Musharraf suspended the constitution, fired judges regarded as hostile to his rule, rounded up thousands of opponents and rights activists, and curbed the media. He cited a meddlesome judiciary hampering efforts in the war on terrorism. He had been at loggerheads with the judiciary since March, when he tried to dismiss the chief justice. The United States is worried the turmoil will distract attention from the fight against militants who have been infiltrating into the northwest from Afghan border strongholds. The army has stepped up efforts to clear militants from one such area, the Swat Valley in North West Frontier Province, where the army says it has killed dozens of militants in recent days. Musharraf, in power since a 1999 coup, had been due to quit the army by Nov. 15 but that was before the Supreme Court took up challenges to his Oct. 6 re-election by legislators. He now says he will quit as army chief and be sworn in as a civilian president as soon as the Supreme Court, where judges regarded as friendly to the government have been appointed, dismisses the challenges. The attorney general said the court was expected to validate the vote before the end of the month
