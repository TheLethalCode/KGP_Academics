 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League's Dhaka city unit plans to undertake intensive programmes to rejuvenate the organisation, a party leader said Tuesday. It intends to woo back former members of the party who left after the state of emergency was imposed. The plans were made at a meeting between central leaders and city unit leaders at acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam's home opposite the Jatiya Sangsad Complex. "We are going to revive the organisation," Quamrul Islam, acting general secretary of the AL's Dhaka city unit, told reporters after the meeting. "AL city unit leaders will hold a meeting Saturday with the presidents and general secretaries of all police station areas at our Bangabandhu Avenue office." "We hope to involve more party workers in the voter listing process. We are now united," Quamrul said. bdnews
