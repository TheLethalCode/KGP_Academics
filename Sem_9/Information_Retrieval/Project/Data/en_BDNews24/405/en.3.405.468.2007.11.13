 LONDON, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British support services and defence company VT Group Plc said on Tuesday it was on track to meet full-year expectations as it posted a 29 percent rise in core first-half profit, at the top end of forecasts. At 1000 GMT, VT shares were up 3.8 percent at 607.5 pence to value the business at 1.06 billion pounds ($2.19 billion). "We continue to make progress towards closing some major support services contracts in the near future that will enable us to increase our 3.7 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) order book considerably and will give us excellent visibility of earnings," chairman Michael Jeffries said in a statement. Those contracts include a UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) deal, Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) programme and a Building Schools for the Future project in Lewisham. VT, which has its roots in shipbuilding, made a pretax profit before amortisation and joint-venture taxation of 42.3 million pounds in the six months to end-September on turnover up 23 percent to 573 million pounds. The interim dividend was raised 9 percent to 3.55 pence. Panmure Gordon analysts said the results "reflect progress across all divisions and were a little better than we expected. We have upgraded our full-year forecasts again and now expect 14 percent EPS (earnings per share) growth for the year. "The order book has been replenished and will receive a 2 billion pounds boost from contract close on three large contracts, taking it to our estimate of 5 billion pounds for the year-end. This gives high visibility to the group's outlook." VT plans to focus entirely on support services where it has four businesses; Communications, Education and Skills, Services in the United States, and Support Services, mainly in Britain. It is putting its shipbuilding operations, which account for a sixth of group revenue, into a joint venture with Britain's BAE Systems Plc. VT will have an option to sell its 45 percent stake to BAE. The joint venture is awaiting final clearance, expected by early 2008, from Britain and the United States, having gained permission from the European Commission on Oct. 17. The deal will involve BAE selling its 50 percent stake in Flagship Training Ltd to VT for up to 75 million pounds. More imminently, VT is due to be told by the end of the year whether it has won a contract to build, operate and maintain a waste facility for Wakefield Borough Council, northern Engla
