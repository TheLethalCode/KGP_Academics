 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks soared Wednesday as Power Grid Company of Bangladesh rallied to an all-time high after posting a 25 percent cash dividend for the year 2006-2007. Market heavyweight Power Grid Company of Bangladesh surged 15.06 percent to close on Tk 725.50, its highest level since it was listed last year. "It is beyond investors' expectations.
