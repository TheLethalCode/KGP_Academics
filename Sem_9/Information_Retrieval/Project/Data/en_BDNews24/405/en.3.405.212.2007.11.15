 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com) - The Olympic Day Run is shifted to Saturday instead of Friday following the inclement weather, said a Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) press release Thursday. Heath and Family planning adviser Dr ASM Motiur Rahman is scheduled to open the Run, which begins at 7:40 am in front of the National Tennis Complex in Ramna and conclude at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The Olympic Day Run is an annual global event of the International Olympic Committee to spread the Olympic ideals throughout the world. The Run was supposed to be held in June, but the BOA shifted it to November because of inclement weather. Of the taka 30 lakh budget, the BOA would provide Tk 3.2 lakh while the rest of the money would be provided by sponsors EXIM Bank, Coco Cola, Samsung, SPA and Suvastu. Besides the capital, the Olympic Day Run will also be staged in all five divisional headquarters.
