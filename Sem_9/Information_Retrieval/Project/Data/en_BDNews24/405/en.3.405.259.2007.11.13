 MANILA, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful explosion rocked the Philippine Congress on Tuesday night killing one person and injuring several others, including three lawmakers, a senior politician said. The blast destroyed the ceiling of the south entrance to the Batasan complex as members of the lower house were leaving after the final session, shortly after 8 p.m. (7:00 a.m. EST). Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters that a driver of a female lawmaker was killed in the blast. The lawmaker was injured. "I would like to condemn in the strongest terms this cowardly and dastardly attack against the House of Representatives," he said. "I was lucky. I had left a few minutes before the explosion." "This is the work of a terrorist or an anarchist," he added. A police spokesman declined to say what caused the blast, which reduced the lobby ceiling to a gnarled mesh of wire and concrete. One witness said the explosion appeared to come from a car parked outside the building. The spokesman for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said she had ordered the national police chief to personally supervise the investigation to determine the cause of the blast. The Philippines is fighting communist and Muslim insurgencies and small-scale bomb attacks are common in the restive south of the archipelago. At least 11 people were killed and about 120 injured in an explosion in an upscale Manila mall last month. The police have said a build up of gases was the likely cause, but a final report has yet to be released and the owners of the Glorietta complex have disputed the police's preliminary findings.
