 ASHGABAT, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top global energy officials gathered in Turkmenistan on Wednesday for two days of intense diplomacy as they vie for a slice of the Caspian nation's vast oil and gas reserves. US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman, EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and executives from BP, Chevron and others met in Ashgabat for an oil conference marking the end of Turkmenistan's self-imposed isolation. Turkmenistan is keen to showcase its improving investment climate since the death last December of its long-serving leader Saparmurat Niyazov who ran the gas-rich nation as a personal fiefdom and cared little for international diplomacy. The West, Russia and China intensified contacts with the former Soviet nation since its more reformist new leader, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, came to power. "We are always ready for cooperation with well-known companies with vast experience in production and modern equipment, with global financial organisations and banks to implement big oil and gas projects," Berdymukhamedov told delegates in remarks published ahead of the conference. The Caspian nation plans to more than triple its gas production by 2030 from this year's planned 80 billion cubic metres of gas. It still relies on a Russian-controlled pipeline network for its exports but wants to diversify supply routes. The West, however, has also urged Berdymukhamedov to show equal commitment to improving Turkmenistan's human rights record following a 21-year rule by Niyazov who brooked no dissent and kept many of his political opponents in jail.
