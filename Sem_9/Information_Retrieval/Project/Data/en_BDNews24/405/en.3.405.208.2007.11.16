 Lucknow, India, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three suspected members of a Pakistan-based militant group, plotting to kidnap Rahul Gandhi, were arrested in Uttar Pradesh on Friday with a cache of weapons and explosives. "This is one of the biggest catches we have made in recent times," Uttar Pradesh state police chief Vikram Singh told Reuters. Singh did not say who their target was but a senior intelligence official, who asked not to be identified, said the men plotted to abduct Rahul, one of the ruling Congress party's general-secretaries. His mother Sonia, who heads the governing coalition, is seen as India's most powerful politician. The suspects from the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad group were arrested on the outskirts of Lucknow. Rahul's parliamentary constituency is in Uttar Pradesh
