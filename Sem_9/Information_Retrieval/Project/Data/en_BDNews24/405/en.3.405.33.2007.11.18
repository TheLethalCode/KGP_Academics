 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks rallied Sunday, buoyed by a rush from retail investors to bag shares of multinational companies after Bata Shoe posted a 145 percent interim dividend. The rally kicked off after Bata's announcement hit the market a few minutes after opening. A rumour regarding the possible release of detained Beximco Group vice-chairman Salman F Rahman also influenced the market, operators said. Life insurances, along with some banks and non bank financial companies also moved up significantly. "It's a knock-on-effect from Bata Shoe's posting. Investor expectations regarding other multinationals increased as a result," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion of funds at AIMS of Bangladesh.
