 BERLIN, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Blood tests have revealed no evidence that Tommy Haas was poisoned during Germany's Davis Cup defeat by Russia in Moscow in September, the German Tennis Federation (DTB) said. "It's no longer an issue," the DTB quoted Haas as saying in a report on its Web site (www.dtb-tennis.de). "The tests gave no results," Haas was further quoted by German media. "It was too far in the past." Alexander Waske, a doubles player in the beaten German team, was quoted in German media earlier this month as saying an unnamed person had told him in Moscow that Haas had been poisoned. Haas, who was beaten in straight sets on the opening day of the semi-final and was unable to play in the reverse singles because of gastro-enteritis, had tests in New York to see if there was anything to the rumour. "I wanted to be absolutely clear about what was happening to my body," Haas told the DTB. Haas had a minor operation on his right shoulder while in New York. The world number 12 will take six weeks off from training but expects to be fit enough to take part in the Australian Open from Jan. 14-27 next year
