 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Friday counted in the dark the cost of an overnight cyclone that cut its devastating path through the south to leave at least 915 dead, according to official counts. The hurricane knocked electricity poles off in capital Dhaka and elsewhere, affecting running water supply and hospital services. With road communications across the country snapped, government and aid agencies battled scattered debris to reach food, medicine and other supplies to survivors. A government spokesman said the power situation might take up to three days to be fully restored although electricity was getting back on in small pockets on Dhaka. Duty officer at the disaster management control room Md Islam Mia confirmed to bdnews24.com at around 12 midnight the death of 671 people, adding that a countless others were injured. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed flew to Patharghata in the southern district of Barguna and Khulna to assess the ravages and oversee relief operations. The deadly hurricane, which has subsided into a tropical storm and is moving toward Indian state of Assam, cut off communications and electricity supplies across the country. Packing winds of 250 kph the cyclone continued its severest onslaughts on the southern coast from about 5:30pm Thursday to early Friday. Reports of 240 casualties came alone from Patuakhali, 165 from Barguna, 44 from Barisal, 133 from Bagerhat, 27 from Jhalakathi, 24 from Pirojpur, 21 from Madaripur, 24 from Bhola, 12 from Khulna 12, 19 from Shariatpur and 10 from Gopalganj 10. Another three were reported dead in Satkhira, six in Faridpur, four in Chandpur, and one each in Luxmipur and 1, as storm surges nearly 15-feet high slammed into 15 coastal districts. Disaster management officials in Dhaka said casualties might rise as hundreds of fishing boats caught in the cyclone failed to return to shore. The storm uprooted thousands of trees, blasted roofing off countless houses and knocked off electric and telephone poles. The surges washed away hundreds of flimsy straw and mud huts, destroyed crops and fish farms and killed livestock. The capital Dhaka had power and communications link cut off as driving rains flooded some streets and strong winds sent billboards flying through the air. Authorities fear the death toll may rise significantly as reports continue to come in. Residents of storm-hit areas estimate that casualties could exceed a thousand. The storm knocked out power and telecommunication lines through much of the country. Disrupted road links made it hard for relief materials to reach storm-hit areas. Tidal swells washed away crops and cattle. SIDR made landfall in Bangladesh Thursday along the banks of the river Baleshwar. It headed northeast, battering coastal areas in its path. The Met office said the cyclone turned into a land depression and was active Friday morning. Maritime ports have been advised to maintain storm warning signal no 3 and river ports have been told to hoist signal no 2. bdnews24.com Barguna correspondent quoted Red Crescent deputy director Shamsul Alam as saying that at least 85 people had been killed in the district. Local residents believed the death toll was much higher. The district administration could not confirm the figure. Coastal zones went under 12 feet of water in some areas. Cyclone shelters were packed to capacity. Felled trees blocked road links. The Bagerhat district administration said violent winds ravaged 1,62,000 houses. At least 51,000 houses were partly damaged. As many as 3,500 Red Crescent volunteers were on their way to storm-hit areas with relief materials. Mongla port harbour master Shah Alam said a cargo vessel sank near Ismailer Char area. In Patuakhali, the control centre estimated that 40 people were killed in the storm. Most were crushed by falling trees and collapsing houses. Officials said eight cargo vessels and seven trawlers sank in the river Bishkhali. The fishermen and crew members on board are missing. As many as 20,000 thatched houses were damaged by the storm and 5,000 houses were partly damaged in Pirojpur. Fifty four shelters housed scores of people in Pirozpur district. Industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury is in Pirojpur to supervise the relief effort. Earlier, Sanjib Samaddar in Dhaka, who spoke to his parents in Baulakanda village in Pirojpur by phone Thursday night, told bdnews24.com that a tree had come crashing down on their tin-roofed house, smashing part of it. Sanjib failed to contact his parents a second time as the mobile network floundered. The areas plunged into blackouts. Details were sketchy. The cyclone with the core of hurricane winds cut its path through the Khulna-Barisal coastal zone shortly after 5:00pm Thursday, according to the weather office. A boat capsized in Satkhira, leaving a 70-year-old man dead, as SIDR struck Khulna-Barisal coastline amid driving rains. The boat capsize occurred at Noabek ferry terminal in Shyam Nagar in Satkhira, said a police official. Satkhira police chief Mirza Abdullahel Baki said three other passengers were missing after the boat sank. The body of Ibrahim Hossain was found later, Baki said. bdnews24.com/corrs/mr
