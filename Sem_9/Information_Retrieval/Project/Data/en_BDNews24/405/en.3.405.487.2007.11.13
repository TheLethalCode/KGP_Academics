 WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration on Tuesday slapped US financial sanctions on Belarussian oil processor Belneftekhim in a bid to put more pressure on the country's president, Alexander Lukashenko. New US Treasury sanctions against Belneftekhim prohibit Americans from doing business with the refining and petrochemical firm and freeze any assets it has under US jurisdiction. International banks often follow U.S. banks in adhering to such bans. Belneftekhim, the Belarussian State Concern for Oil and Chemistry, has a wholly owned US subsidiary, Belneftekhim USA Inc., and is made up of more than 50 petroleum and petrochemical businesses. Belarus depends almost solely on Russia for the crude oil it refines. The United States and European Union are harsh critics of Lukashenko for ruling the ex-Soviet state with an iron grip and accuse him of shutting down media outlets, holding political prisoners and rigging elections. Since 2006, the Treasury has blocked personal assets of Lukashenko and other high-ranking officials in the Belarussian government. "Today's action tightens our sanctions against Lukashenko and his cronies by imposing financial sanctions against a massive conglomerate under the regime's control," said Adam Szubin, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The blacklisting of Belneftekhim was under an executive order issued by President George W. Bush in 2006 that allows the Treasury, after consultation with the State Department, to block assets of those responsible for or contributing to the undermining of democratic processes and human rights abuses related to political oppression in Belarus. The Bush administration has imposed similar financial sanctions issued under other executive orders against Iranian individuals and state firms aimed at pressuring Iran to abandon its nuclear enrichment program and to halt state support of terrorist groups.
