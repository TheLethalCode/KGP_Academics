 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com) The government Saturday said it would welcome help from the international community although it had not yet requested aid after cyclone Sidr that wrecked large swathes in the south. The advisory council sat Saturday to discuss relief efforts in the aftermath of the super cyclone, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said at a press briefing at the Chief Adviser's office. Officials with divisional, district and upazila administrations were working on storm damage and casualty estimates, Munaim said. He said foreign diplomats and aid agencies were discussing relief assistance with the government. "The secretaries of the food and disaster management ministry, Economic Relations Division and foreign ministry have been appointed to coordinate foreign aid efforts," Munaim said. The chief adviser discussed his impressions of the storm-ravaged areas and advised the use of satellite phones in areas where communications systems could not be restored, according to Munaim. The press secretary said that 12 of the 23 districts hit by the storm had been severely affected. "Patuakhali, Bagherhat, Pirojpur, Barisal, Barguna, Jhalkhathi, Bhola, Madaripur, Gopalganj, Shariatpur, Khulna and Satkhira have been identified as having suffered the greatest damage," he said. "They have been earmarked for prioritised relief work. The secretaries of the food and disaster management ministry, communications ministry and telecommunications ministry have been asked to coordinate efforts to reinstall road, power and telecommunications systems in the affected areas," he added. The chief adviser's press secretary said that disruptions in the power supply were due to a 'technical fault'. "The storm shut down the power supply in many areas. Some 2,000 electric poles had been knocked down during the storm, not to mention torn cables. This is the reason for the problems in the power supply. The situation will be normal by Sunday." Munaim said housing and crops had been seriously damaged by the cyclone. "About Tk 11.5 crore has been allotted in aid from the chief adviser's relief fund. Another Tk 35 crore has been allotted to rebuild damaged houses. The district collectors will disburse the money to affected families by the local committees," he added. Munaim said the navy, air force and joint forces were working with the civil administration to rebuild the south after Sidr. bdnews24.co
