 LONDON, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate rose more than expected last month to above the central bank's 2.0 percent target for the first time since June as petrol and food costs soared, official data showed on Tuesday. The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in October, taking the annual rate up to 2.1 percent from 1.8 in September. That was above analysts' forecasts for a 1.9 percent annual rate and the highest level since June. Policymakers are having to balance risks to inflation after a sharp rise in commodity prices this year against the prospect of a weaker economy due to financial market turmoil and higher borrowing costs. The Bank of England had been expected to lower interest rates from the current 5.75 percent in the next few months, but economists are now starting to question that view. "With further rises in petrol and food prices likely, inflation looks set to move further above the Monetary Policy Committee's two percent target and could stay there for some time," said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at Capital Economics. "Interest rates may not fall for a while yet." The pound rose and interest rate futures fell after the strong set of data, which also showed retail price inflation -- on which many pay deals are based -- was higher than expected last month. PETROL FUELS PRICE SURGE The ONS said the chief culprit was higher petrol costs which added 0.29 percentage points to the annual inflation rate. Food price inflation, particularly meat and fruit, added 0.12 percentage points. Crude oil prices have neared $100 a barrel and wheat prices have remained high. British food maker Premier Foods said on Monday it was raising bread prices for the second time in three months. The biggest downward impact came from household bills as gas and electricity prices continued to fall after huge rises last year. The cost of electricity, gas and other fuels fell 4 percent on the year, the biggest decline since 1998. The BoE's new inflation forecasts, due on Wednesday, will prove crucial in gauging where monetary policy is heading in the next few months. Governor Mervyn King has been criticised for his softly-softly handling of the credit crunch which triggered the first run on a British bank -- Northern Rock -- in more than 140 years. But policymakers have given no indication the BoE is about to cut borrowing costs as the U.S. Federal Reserve has done. With headline inflation climbing back over target and factory gate inflation hitting a 12-year high last month, the central bank is likely to feel vindicated so far. "We will just have to wait for the inflation report to see how the Bank of England splice and dice the balance of growth and inflation risks ahead," said David Brown, an economist at Bear Stearns. "We may have to wait until February and the next subsequent inflation report before the BoE is prepared to cu
