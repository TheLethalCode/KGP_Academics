 Lahore, Pakistan, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan freed opposition leader Benazir Bhutto from house arrest shortly before a top US diplomat began a visit on Friday aimed at persuading President Pervez Musharraf to end emergency rule. US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte was due to meet General Musharraf on Saturday, and was expected to push him to roll back the emergency invoked two weeks ago, release thousands of detainees and hold elections. Most opposition leaders were in custody, along with lawyers, opposition and rights activists. Bhutto, who had been under house arrest in Lahore since Tuesday to stop her leading a rally against Musharraf, went on the offensive as soon as she was released. "There can be no fair and free elections under the emergency; there can be no fair and free elections when the chief of army staff is also president; there can be no fair and free election under the present Election Commission," Bhutto told a news conference in Lahore. Asma Jahangir, head of Pakistan's independent human rights commission and a fierce critic of Musharraf's, was seen visiting Bhutto's Lahore residence on Friday, having been detained herself as soon as the emergency was imposed. In the capital, Musharraf swore in a caretaker prime minister who will be responsible for overseeing parliamentary elections due by Jan. 9, after the National Assembly completed its five-year term on Thursday. The outgoing prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, was widely credited with transforming Pakistan from a country on the brink of bankruptcy to one of the fastest growing economies in the world over the past eight years. There are considerable doubts about his position in the next government. The uncertainties are weighing on financial markets. Stocks closed only marginally down on Friday, but the main index was near a two-month low, and has lost 5.5 percent since the emergency was imposed. It is still up 31 percent this year. The United States had hoped army chief Musharraf and Bhutto would share power after the election but Bhutto, infuriated by the crackdown, has ruled that out. "I can't see how I can team up with somebody who raises hopes and dashes them, who makes commitments and moves the goal posts. He talked to me about a roadmap to democracy and imposed martial law," she said. She said opposition parties would meet on Nov. 21 to discuss whether to boycott the election. "INDISPENSABLE" Negroponte, who has warned against cutting ties to an "indispensable" ally, said on Thursday the political process had been derailed and he wanted to help put it back on track. "The signal that Mr Negroponte should give is that this aid could stop," Bhutto told Britain's Sky News. The United States has given Pakistan an estimated $10 billion of financial support since 2001, the bulk of it for the military. In declaring the emergency, Musharraf suspended the constitution, fired judges seen as hostile, rounded up thousands of opponents and rights activists and curbed the media. The United States is worried the turmoil will distract attention from the fight against militants supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan. The army has stepped up efforts to clear militants from one such area, the Swat Valley in North West Frontier Province, where it says it has killed dozens of rebels in recent days. Musharraf swore in an ally as caretaker prime minister -- Senate Chairman Mohammadmian Soomro -- and a 24-member cabinet packed with Musharraf loyalists to oversee the election. Small protests have erupted across the country and been broken up by police with sticks, but two boys were killed in shooting during a protest by Bhutto supporters on Thursday. Musharraf says he will quit as army chief and be sworn in as a civilian president as soon as the Supreme Court, where judges regarded as friendly to the government have been appointed, dismisses challenges against his re-election last month. The attorney general said that should happen by the end of the month. Many Pakistanis seem disillusioned with all leaders. "We've tried everyone, they're all the same," said Islamabad bank worker Yousuf Ali.
