 SHANGHAI, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer was honoured in Shanghai on Tuesday after finishing the year as the world's top player for the fourth season in a row. The Swiss was assured of finishing 2007 ahead of Spanish rival Rafael Nadal in the ATP Tour's Champions Race after winning his hometown title in Basel at the end of last month. Federer, still licking his wounds after Monday's shock defeat by Chile's Fernando Gonzalez in his opening round-robin match at the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, paid tribute to Nadal. "This year was very special because I was behind Nadal and won it back," said Federer in an on-court ceremony before the Spaniard's match against compatriot David Ferrer. "It's the fourth consecutive year for me to finish as number one. It's an amazing run I'm on and I'll try my best to maintain it in 2008.
