 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com) - Businessmen and local economists Wednesday favoured a 'homegrown' growth strategy for Bangladesh rather than replicating World Bank models to put the country into the middle income category over the next decade. Businessmen, however, expected that the multilateral donor would extend support for the country's infrastructure and human resources development. "We are confident to achieve an over 7.5 growth a year if the World Bank supports us in developing physical infrastructure such as ports, power and roads as well as human resources," said Mir Nasir Hosain, president of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Nasir made the appeal at a seminar at the FBCCI where World Bank economists said that Bangladesh needed to maintain a 7.5 percent growth a year if it wanted to become a middle- income country by 2016. WB senior economist, Sandeep Mahajan, presented the paper on a WB report 'Challenges for Bangladesh in Becoming a Middle Income Country', where it said Bangladesh required a deeper labour intensive industry and productive agriculture, cut in tariff rates, and emphasis on urbanisation to become a middle income country by the year 2016. "I think you want to give us a universal prescription. Bangladesh needs a homegrown growth strategy. We want the World Bank to think like the people of Bangladesh," said FBCCI director MA Rouf Chowdhury. He also said that focusing more on export had turned Bangladesh into an import-dependent country. "We need to maintain a balance and minimise our vulnerability to the global commodity price hike," he said. Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of a local research body, Centre for Policy Dialogue, criticised the WB for its focus on growth rather than on income distribution. Since 1990, Bangladesh has maintained a steady growth of over 5 percent a year, but the inequality between the rich and poor and among the regions has increased during the period. "Regional disparities have increased. It appears that there emerged two economies," he said, mentioning the income distribution patterns in divisions. Dr Shantayanan Devarajan, WB chief economist for South Asia, however argued that growth was vital for reducing poverty. "It's probably the most important for reducing poverty. We cannot deny that inequality has increased. But Bangladesh's rate of poverty reduction is higher than that of India, Sri Lanka," he said. Replying to a query whether India's robust growth was due to following WB prescription, WB lead economist for Bangladesh Vinaya Swaroop said: "India grew on its own." bd
