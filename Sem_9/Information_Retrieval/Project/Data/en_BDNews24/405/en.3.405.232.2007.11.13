 Gazipur, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  A three-member committee has been formed to probe allegations that a compulsory second-year English honours examination paper of the National University was leaked out. University authorities asked the committee to report on the alleged breach within 10 working days. The committee headed by the university's director-in-charge (curriculum and development) Dr SM Abu Raihan also includes assistant examination controller Badruzzaman and Professor Mohammad Manzure Elahi. Examination controller Mohammad Ibrahim told bdnews24.com that they received complaints that questions were leaked, moments after the examination started Sunday. Principal of Kishoreganj Gurudoyal Govt College wrote the authorities about the matter. The principal said in his letter that a hand written question paper found prior to the examination had exactly the same seven questions as the exam paper. He attached a copy of the hand written question paper with the letter. Ibrahim said that Kishoreganj police had arrested two students and the owner of a photocopy centre on charges of involvement in the leak. Rangpur district collector Khandaker Atiyar Rahman, meanwhile, wrote the university about the matter with comments from a Rangpur magistrate, Mostayin Billah. The magistrate said he came to know that the leak had originated from Dhaka by mobile phone. It was then hand written and photocopied for selling. Karim Enterprise, a photocopy centre, was involved in the trading of the leaked question paper and the owner went into hiding afterwards, according to the magistrate. Ibrahim, the NU examination controller, said, "Question paper leak is defined as top to bottom similarity between the examination and the student's document. We can give details once the probe committee's report comes in our hand." Vice-chancellor Prof Wakil Ahmed said, "A group is conspiring to tarnish the university's image. This incident is a part of the plot. Steps will be taken based on the probe committee's report." Asked whether the examination would be cancelled, the vice-chancellor refused to say anything before getting the report. bdnews24.com/
