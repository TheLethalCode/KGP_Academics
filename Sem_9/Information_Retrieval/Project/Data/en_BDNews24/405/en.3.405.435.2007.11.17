 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  DESA Saturday said that it tried to manage the capital's power shortage through 'load management', which aims to provide power for a limited period to every area of the city between Friday night and Saturday noon. Iftekhar Uddin Firoz from the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority's control room told bdnews24.com at 3.30 pm: "Power is being supplied more or less across the capital by load management. The power supply will be further increased in the evening. According to the DESA control room, the power supply amounted to 900 megawatts at 3.30 pm, which would be increased towards the evening. Firoz said current levels of load shedding amounted to between 100 and 150 megawatts, and demand for the DESA area as a whole is 1600 megawatts. Meanwhile, the Power Development Board's control room said that about 1,800 MW was supplied at 3.30pm, which would probably be increased to 3000MW by Saturday evening. Power supply was disrupted in the wake of tropical cyclone Sidr, which led to a collapse of the national grid twice, a government spokesman said Friday. Power secretary Faozul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com Friday night by phone that the gridline failed for a second time Friday afternoon, as demand far outstretched production. "We could not restart the units near Dhaka. Many parts of the country were out of power. We will be able to supply 1000MW shortly, if things go right," Khan said. Only 500 megawatts of power could be supplied across the country at 3:30pm Friday. The national grid failed again at 5:30pm. Power Development Board officials said the power system collapsed due to an imbalance in the production system at 7:57am Friday. Following the failure, power production dropped to zero megawatts. bdnews2
