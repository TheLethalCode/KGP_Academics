 MILAN, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top players will shun Italian soccer if fan violence and other scandals continue to dog the game there, AC Milan playmaker Kaka said on Tuesday.

'FRIGHTENED SILENCE' Top names had already begun to head to Spain and England rather than the once-dominant Serie A following a match-fixing scandal two years ago, dubbed Calciopoli, and the killing of a policeman during riots outside a Catania match in February. "First Calciopoli, then the police officer killed in Catania. Now this new tragedy. A fan killed while he was going to see a game," he said. "Italy is losing credibility. The list is becoming too long." Real Madrid spent most of the close season trying to tempt AC Milan to sell prized asset Kaka, who has admitted a move to the Bernabeu might interest him.
