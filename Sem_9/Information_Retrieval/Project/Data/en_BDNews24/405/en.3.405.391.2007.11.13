 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The 22nd National Swimming Championship, organised by Bangladesh Swimming Federation (BSF) and co-sponsored by Keya Cosmetic and Mercantile Bank, begins Wednesday at the National Swimming Complex in Mirpur. LGRD and Co-operatives Adviser Anwarul Iqbal will declare the four-day meet open. Some 350 swimmers, including 75 women, from 31 teams are going to participate in the meet which did not take place last year. "Some 16 national records were set up in the last edition of the meet and we hope the meet will see more national records this time," said BSF general secretary Commodore (rtd) MS Kabir at a press conference Tuesday. BSF vice presidents Dr Sultanul Aziz and M Solaiman, senior media manager of the Keya Cosmetics Limited Anisur Rahman Dipu and deputy managing director of the Mercantile Bank Limited MA Sahjahan were also present at the press briefing held at the NSC auditorium. Apart from swimming, the meet would also experience water polo and diving, said MS Kabir, who took over the responsibility of the committee in August after the government dissolved the elected committee. He said that swimmers from army, navy, air force, BDR, police, ansar, BKSP, BJMC, all districts, divisions, education boards, and universities were invited for the championship. The federation will bear all costs of the swimmers outside Dhaka. The Keya Cosmetics and the Mercantile Bank would share equally the estimated budget of TK 11 lakh.
