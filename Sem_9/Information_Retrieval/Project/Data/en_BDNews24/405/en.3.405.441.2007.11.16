 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  A boat capsized in Satkhira, leaving a 70-year-old man dead, as the hurricane SIDR struck Khulna-Barisal coast Thursday amid driving rains. Samarendra Karmaker, director of the Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com that SIDR was more powerful than the 1991 cyclone that killed 1.4 lakh people. But he said: "The movement of SIDR seems to have slowed, but it is still as powerful as before." "It is centring around Khulna and its environs," Karmaker said, referring to the midnight latest on the storm. A bulletin of the weather office said at 9:50pm that it may take three to four hours more to cross the Barisal-Khulna coastline. The boat capsize occurred at Noabek ferry terminal in Shyam Nagar in Satkhira, said a police official. Satkhira police chief Mirza Abdullahel Baki said three other passengers were missing after the boat sank. The body of Ibrahim Hossain was found later, Baki said. Southern residents battened down the hatches late Thursday night as the storm downed thousands of trees and blasted roofing off many houses. The storm triggered tidal surges that inundated many villages in the southern districts of Pirojpur and Jhalakathi. Sanjib Sammader in Dhaka, who spoke to his parents in Baulakanda village in Pirojpur by phone Thursday night, told bdnews24.com that a tree had come crashing down on their tin-roofed house, smashing part of it. Sanjib failed to contact his parents a second time as the mobile network floundered. bd
