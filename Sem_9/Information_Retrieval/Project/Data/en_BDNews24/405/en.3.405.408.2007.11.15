 BAGHDAD, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US forces backed by aircraft killed 25 suspected insurgents in operations targeting al Qaeda near the Iraqi capital Baghdad, the US military said on Thursday. It was the latest in a series of operations mounted against al Qaeda, which US commanders say has been seriously weakened since the launch of a US counter-insurgency strategy to deny the militants safe haven in provinces around Baghdad. North of the capital, in the ethnically and religiously mixed oil-producing city of Kirkuk, a carbomb targeting the convoy of a police colonel killed four people, including one policeman, police said. In a statement, the US military said the suspected al Qaeda insurgents were killed during operations late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday west of Tarmiya. It said 21 suspects were detained. The statement said US forces called in aircraft to attack armed men seen acting with "hostile intent" in the area of the operation. One gunman was killed. Ground forces then moved further into the area, where they came under fire. Troops again called in aircraft, killing 24 suspected insurgents. Troops found a weapons cache that included numerous anti-aircraft guns, surface-to-surface missiles, rifles, pistols, grenades, mortar rounds and artillery shells, the statement added. US commanders say al Qaeda in Iraq, a militant Sunni Islamist group blamed for most major car bomb attacks, is resilient despite the recent military gains against them and still retains the capability to launch attacks. US and Iraqi forces said they killed 15 al Qaeda gunmen south of the capital on Monday after heavily armed militants attacked checkpoints manned by so-called "concerned citizens", mainly Sunni Arab armed groups working in conjunction with the US military. It was one of the biggest attacks by al Qaeda since the start of a US-led crackdown to quell sectarian violence. A wave of tit-for-tat attacks between majority Shi'ites and minority Sunni Arabs has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis and displaced at least one million people since February 2006. A US general said last week that al Qaeda no longer had a foot hold in any part of the Iraqi capital, where US President George W. Bush sent thousands of reinforcements earlier this year to retake control of the city's lawless streets
