 GENEVA, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening up rich countries' farm markets is crucial for a deal on world trade, and the Doha round of trade talks will not succeed without agreement on agriculture, developing countries said on Thursday. Ministers and senior officials representing nearly 100 developing countries reiterated at meetings called by Brazil at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that development was at the heart of the agenda of the Doha round, launched six years ago.

The poor countries also expressed frustration at the slow pace of the negotiations, with the deadline for agreeing the outlines of a deal repeatedly put back, most recently from October, to the middle of this month, to late November or early December or even the beginning of next year. And they also expressed concern that the expiry of the US president's fast-track trade negotiating authority was creating uncertainty as the talks approached their final stage. Trade promotion authority allows the administration to present a trade deal to Congress for approval or rejection as a whole without any changes.
