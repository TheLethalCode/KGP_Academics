<TITLE> Fertiliser crunch unreal, distribution suffers: Geeteara </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury Tuesday said the fertiliser shortage was a myth created by the media and those farmers unwilling to queue up. She told reporters at the home ministry conference room that fertiliser stock was sufficient although its distribution suffered. The adviser advised farmers to rest assured that enough stocks of fertilisers exist to meet their needs through the season. She said not only the rice growers, fish and corn farmers as well were getting fertiliser allocations this season, which only proved that the government had adequate stocks of fertiliser to meet every requirement. Geeteara informed the media that the government had decided to streamline the manure distribution countrywide, which included the decision of importing more fertiliser and building buffer stocks. The government was taking a look at the distribution system to address the hurdles, she said, adding that they were considering introducing a new system being piloted at the field level. The 'improved' system would be introduced after the 'peak season' is over and the government was employing more people to strengthen the distribution system through the present season, the adviser said. bdnew
