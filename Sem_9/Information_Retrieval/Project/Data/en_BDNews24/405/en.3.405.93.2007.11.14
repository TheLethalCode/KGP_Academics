 BOSTON, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Massachusetts enacted the toughest restrictions in the United States on protesters at abortion clinics on Tuesday with a law that forces them to stay 35 feet (11 metres) away. The law signed by Gov. Deval Patrick takes immediate effect and expands on legislation from 2000 that sought to keep protesters 6 feet (1.8 metres) from a patient within an 18-foot (5.4-metre) zone outside the state's 10 clinics that perform abortions. The state government said in a statement that the old law, especially the 6-foot rule, had proven difficult to enforce. "By widening the buffer zone around reproductive clinics, we will protect patients from the harassment that so many have encountered as they seek care," said Patrick, a Democrat. The bill, which does not apply to hospitals, sailed through the state's Democratic-controlled legislature, winning unanimous backing of the Massachusetts Senate last week after clearing the House in a 122-to-28 vote. It is the country's largest fixed buffer zone passed by state law to protect abortion clinics. Melbourne, Florida maintains a larger, 36-foot (11-metre) buffer zone but that only applies to one clinic and was created by court injunction. The Massachusetts law applies statewide to all reproductive health centers. Advocates say the law protects patients and clinic staff from harassment, intimidation and violence. Opponents say it breaches freedom of speech protections. "We have protesters daily outside our facilities," said Lisa Dacey, spokeswoman at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, which operates four clinics in the state. The state's Supreme Judicial Court upheld the constitutionality of buffer zones in 2001 after the previous law was challenged, saying it did not violate the US Constitution's First Amendment right to free speech and peaceful assembly. Calls for tougher legislation to protect abortion clinics in Massachusetts began in 1994 when a man killed two workers and injured five in a shooting at two women's clinics in Brookline, bordering Boston.
