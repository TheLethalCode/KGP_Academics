 Maruf Mallick Staff Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh coasts have been hit by over 80 cyclones of hurricane violence in the past 125 years, killing about two million people and rendering many more millions homeless, meteorologists said. On Nov 1, 1876, the 'Great Bakerganj Storm' hit Barisal region at a speed of 220 kmh, killing about two lakh people. It was considered 'a great human disaster' as the country's population was scanty compared to today. Some witnesses claimed the tidal wave had risen to 16 metres or over 50 ft in height. Sajedur Rahman, former director of Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com that the cyclones brewed in the Bay of Bengal usually hit Bangladesh in April-May and October-December seasons. A terrible cyclone packing a hurricane speed of 222 kmh ravaged the coastal districts of Barisal, Patuakhali, Noakhali and Bhola, washing away about a million people under 10 metre-high waves on Nov 12, 1970. It has since been remembered as the 'Fearful November 12'. In 1985, a cyclone blowing over Urir Char at 154 kmh killed about 11,000 people. The tidal waves were 15 ft high. On April 29, 1991, the 225 kmh cyclone sweeping over Chittagong coasts and whipping up 25 ft high waves killed 1.5 lakh people. The Nov 29, 1997 cyclone also swept over Chittagong at a speed of 224 kmh, generating 6.1 metre-high tidal waves and killed about 1.5 lakh people. Other cyclones hit Bangladesh in 1960, 1961, 1963, 1965, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2003. The oldest account of a similar disaster occurring in 1582, as chronicled in the historical volumes titled 'Ain-i-Akbari' and 'Riaz-us-Salatin' speak of a most violent cyclone. It razed Barisal and Patuakhali areas to the ground during its five-hour onslaught at hurricane speed; only a few strongly founded temples survived. An NGO publication titled 'Nirapad Barta' said up to 2001, at least 83 cyclones of 'the most violent' to 'moderate' magnitudes slammed the coasts of Bangladesh. No cyclones have ever occurred in this part during the months of January, February, March and July, it said. bdnews
