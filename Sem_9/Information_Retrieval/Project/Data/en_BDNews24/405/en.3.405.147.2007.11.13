<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A German court has fined two men involved in a racist mob attack on a group of Indians in east Germany earlier this year. The court in the city of Oschatz near Leipzig said in a statement on Tuesday it had given two men, aged 22 and 35, fines of 2,625 euros ($3,837) and 1,500 euros respectively. A mob of about 50 people attacked and injured the Indians at a fair in the east German town of Muegeln, Saxony, in August, besieging them in a pizzeria until they were rescued by police. The number of victims of far-right violence in Germany jumped by more than 25 percent in the first nine months of this year, and violent anti-Semitic crime was also up, interior ministry data showed last week. Eastern Germany in particular, where unemployment is about twice as high as in the west, has seen intermittent racist attacks on foreigners since German reunification in 1990. The far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) entered the regional parliament in the eastern state of Saxony in 2004 with over 9 percent of the vote.
