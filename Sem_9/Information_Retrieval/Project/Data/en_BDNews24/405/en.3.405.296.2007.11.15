 JAKARTA, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Military-ruled Myanmar will be expected to uphold commitments to democracy and human rights included in a Southeast Asian charter set to be signed next week, an Indonesian presidential spokesman said on Thursday. Myanmar and Indonesia alongside other countries in the 10-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are due to sign the charter on Nov. 20 at a meeting in Singapore. The charter should transform the association into a regional body and give it a legal identity, with an emphasis on progressive values including democracy and human rights, spokesman Dino Patti Djalal told reporters. "A new ASEAN charter will be signed and Myanmar will be part of the charter," Djalal told reporters. "The countries who sign this charter are expected to uphold and apply the values mentioned in the charter, including Myanmar." ASEAN is one of the few international groups to accept the former Burma as a member. It has been criticised for failing to bring the country into the democratic fold despite its 10-year-old policy of engaging the nation through dialogue.

At least 10 people were killed in September when the junta crushed the biggest pro-democracy protests in nearly 20 years, prompting international condemnation and tougher sanctions.

Djalal said the new charter would not change ASEAN's policy. "ASEAN does not work with sanctions. For instance, in the case of Myanmar, engagement is the best approach albeit its limitation and weaknesses and the fact that it has not yielded maximum results yet." The junta has embarked on a national convention to draw up a new constitution as part of its "road map to democracy", but the process has been criticised by Western governments as a sham. Djalal said the Indonesian president had corresponded with junta leader Senior General Than Shwe, urging an "inclusive process" in Myanmar's bid for democracy to ensure stability. Myanmar opposition leader Aung Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won 1990 elections by a landslide, but was denied power by the military, which has ruled in one form or another since a 1962 co
