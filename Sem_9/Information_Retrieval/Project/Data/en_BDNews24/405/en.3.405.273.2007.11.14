<TITLE> Hungarians try to revive game one beer at a time </TITLE>

 MISKOLC, Hungary, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Hungarian entrepreneurs have proposed a novel solution in Hungary's struggle to wake national soccer from two decades of slumber: slot machines. Hungary, once unbeatable under Ferenc Puskas's "Golden Team", have not qualified for a major international tournament since the 1986 World Cup. There was even a sigh of relief last month when they managed to beat Malta, 137th in the FIFA rankings, and take revenge for a humiliating defeat last year. Lajos Marton and Gabor Csendes, two businessmen in the eastern Hajdu-Bihar county, thought rebuilding should start with young players, many of whom do not have adequate training grounds or kit, especially in poorer eastern Hungary. They have started installing hundreds of soccer-themed slot machines in pubs around the country and donate part of the proceeds to youth teams. "More and more teams have got in touch saying they want to take part in this," Marton said. The machines, which can be played with 100-forint ($0.574) coins, feature photographs of players from the local team in each town, arranged in two concentric circles on the front of the machine. FREE BEERS Punters can win small prizes such as ashtrays or tickets to games if they get lights to flash next to the same player on both circles. They can win an additional prize of one to four beers depending on which number lights up on the display. "Since a normal tradition of sponsorship has not developed in this country yet we must be thankful for every penny," said Balint Nagy, spokesman of Hajduszoboszloi SE, a county league team which has received 20 soccer balls from the scheme. The Hungarian Football Association (MLSZ) said it welcomed the project though it was not officially taking part in it. "Obviously, we are delighted to hear anything that is connected to helping in any fields of the game," spokesman Peter Serenyi said. The national team has started to recover slowly since coach Peter Varhidi took charge last year, partly because the trainer bravely uses young players, mainly based abroad, a tactic which has brought back the interest of supporters. Hungary have already abandoned hope of qualifying for Euro 2008 but many believe that the new, young team that beat world champions Italy 3-1 in August could end the drought and get to the 2010 World Cup. PAMPERED PLAYERS One fan who has played on the soccer-themed slot machine said sponsoring young players was a good idea, though he was worried the money might not end up in the right hands. "I hope more people will play (on the machine), the junior teams could use the money," said postman Ervin Pavlanszky, 37, in a pub outside the Diosgyor stadium in Miskolc, eastern Hungary. Another fan said he could not see Hungary building a strong team again because the country, now part of the European Union and massively richer than at the height of communism when Puskas played, pampered its players. "They are overpaid," said Istvan Soltesz, 51. "If someone can kick the ball hard that's already enough to be selected." Many mourned Hungarian football last year after the death of Puskas, one of the greatest players of all time, whose "Magical Magyars" beat England 6-3 in 1953 at Wembley. August's victory over Italy, however, revived hopes for a turnaround for the nation which was 2-0 up in the 1954 World Cup final before losing 3-2 to West Germany. It was the only match Hungary lost between 1950 and 1955. "We have become unaccustomed to such glee," wrote veteran soccer commentator Ivan Hegyi in the daily Nepszabadsag after the game against Italy. "I have been reporting on Hungarian national team matches for almost quarter of a century but I cannot think of a similar achievement from a period of several decades.
