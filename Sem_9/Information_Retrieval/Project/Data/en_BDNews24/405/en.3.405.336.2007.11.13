<TITLE> CID seeks to quiz Hasina on Aug 21 attack </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Criminal Investigation Department of Police Tuesday appealed for court permission to speak to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina as part of a probe into the August 21, 2004 grenade attack. The CID also sent a letter to the Police Headquarters to issue a "red warrant" through the Interpol against Maolana Tazuddin, brother of former BNP lawmaker Abdus Salam Pintu. The CID chief, additional inspector general Fani Bhushan Chowdhury, said Tuesday that they needed to interrogate Hasina in the interest of the case and had applied to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka to do so. Habibur Rahman, general reporting officer for prosecution at the CMM's Court, told bdnews24.com that they had not received any application until 5:00pm Tuesday. As Hasina was neither plaintiff nor convict in the case, but only a victim, the CID did not need permission of the court, he said, adding the permission of the jail authorities would be enough. The CID head said they would examine the bullet-riddled vehicle of Hasina. It was confirmed that the police had fired blank shots, but there was no proof that anybody else had fired. He said that a convict named Joj Miah's statement was recorded earlier, but that statement had no congruity with the investigation. In his statement, Joj Miah had revealed names of some top terrorists of Dhaka. But recently, Mufti Hannan in his statement confessed that his organisation had carried out the attack. So there is a lot of inconsistency in the two statements. Fani Bhushan said that it was immaterial whether or not Joj Miah had given the statement under duress. They could not take him for remand. They were examining whether he could be remanded in another case. He would be a convict along with Mufti Hannan, Bhushan added. bdnew
