<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Rizvi Ahmed, the BNP's acting office secretary, said Tuesday that embattled party leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain may seek medical treatment overseas when he is well enough to travel. The ousted secretary general is currently being treated at BIRDEM hospital in the capital. Rizvi briefed reporters at his home opposite the Sangsad Bhaban: "The secretary general is suffering from a number of ailments such as diabetes, liver and kidney problems as well as a heart condition." "We are all praying he gets well soon, however, he may need to go abroad for further treatment," Rizvi said. The acting office secretary nevertheless stressed that the party would still act under the leadership of Delwar, who he said remained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's nominated secretary general. Referring to the deepening schism within the troubled party, Rizvi said: "Many people say they are loyal to the leadership of the chairperson, but they are simply staging one drama after another and ignoring her directions." The BNP leader said the election commission had committed a grave error in not inviting the 'mainstream' of the party to reform dialogue. "They must reconsider the matter or we will petition the court against the commission's decision." "Plots to split the BNP were attempted during Ershad's tenure, but they failed, and the people voted for BNP in 1991." Rizvi also complained that he feared the BNP's head office in Naya Paltan would be occupied by 'conspirators' with the assistance of a police guard. "If anybody occupies our office under the protection of the police, we will go there in number," he added. bdnew
