<TEXT>
 SHANGHAI, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer put on a vintage display to beat Spain's David Ferrer 6-2 6-3 6-2 in securing his fourth Masters Cup title at the season-ending event on Sunday. Federer's victory at the showcase eight-man tournament put him level with Ilie Nastase and one behind the record of five titles held by Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras. The Swiss, appearing in his fifth successive Masters Cup final, had never lost to Ferrer in seven previous matches and he simply had too much firepower again for the Spaniard. Ferrer had been a revelation in his tournament debut, reaching the final with a perfect record but he quickly crumbled against Federer in the biggest match of his career. The warning signs were there for Ferrer after Federer's clinical 6-4 6-1 demolition of world number two Rafael Nadal in Saturday's semi-finals. Federer swept through the first set in 26 minutes and Ferrer's resistance effectively collapsed in the second, a wild forehand leaving Federer in total control. Ferrer never looked like emulating Argentine David Nalbandian's amazing fightback from two sets down against Federer in the 2005 final. The world number one continued to drill winners past his dazed opponent, breaking for 3-1 in the third with a superb running forehand that was too hot for a lunging Ferrer to handle. He put Ferrer out of his misery with another sizzling forehand pass after one hour and 38 minutes to capture his eighth title of the year and the 53rd of his career. His victory in Shanghai was worth $1.2 million for the 12-times grand slam winner, taking his total prize money in 2007 to more than $8.6 million
