<TITLE> Myanmar set to sign rights charter at ASEAN summit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is unlikely to suspend Myanmar and the military-ruled country is set to sign the new ASEAN charter on democracy and human rights next week, ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong told Reuters on Saturday. On Friday, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to urge ASEAN to suspend Myanmar until its government shows respect for human rights. Myanmar's military rulers carried out a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in September. "We cannot resolve this problem with sanctions or a hardline position," Ong told Reuters in an interview ahead of the annual ASEAN summit, where the 40-year old grouping is set to sign a charter that will give it legal status. Ong said he expects that Myanmar will sign the charter, which spells out lofty goals for democracy and human rights for the 10-country group. "Myanmar has not fought to take out words like 'human rights' and 'democracy'. They are not against putting these down as an aspiration, but they ask for more time," Ong said. Myanmar's prime minister, Thein Sein, is set to attend the summit in what will be the first appearance of a top junta member at an international forum since the crackdown on protesters.
