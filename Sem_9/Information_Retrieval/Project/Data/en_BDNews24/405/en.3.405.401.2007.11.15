<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is all set to get an artificial football turf on a ground known as Balur Math adjacent to its Bhaban instead of a football academy under the FIFA goal project-2. FIFA development director and AFC vice president Manilal Fernando disclosed this to reporters at a press conference at the BFF House Thursday. The FIFA official arrived here Wednesday on a one-day visit to inspect the progress of construction of two football centres and a football academy under the Tsunami Fund and the FIFA goal project. He was scheduled to leave here Thursday night. "Three pieces of land were offered for building a football academy under the goal project and one of them is adjacent to Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BSKP), but none of them has yet been acquired. "And, we have offered to lay an artificial turf next to the football building under the goal project-2," said Fernando adding that the land would be released by the government next Tuesday while the groundwork would start in January next year. "I had a very fruitful meeting with the NSC chairman and its secretary today (Thursday) and they are very energetic to promote football in the country," said the Sri Lankan citizen. He hoped that AFC president Mohammad Bin Hammam along with the BFF president and the NSC chairman would lay the foundation at the site for the artificial turf. Fernando said that the FIFA plans to grant another US$ 4,00,000 to build a football academy next to the BKSP under the goal project-3 immediately after the land has been acquired. "It is an advantage to build a football academy adjacent to the BSKP as the players will also get the facilities of the institution," Fernando also said that they would build a football centre in Barisal under the Tsunami Fund. "We are yet to start building football centres in Cox's Bazar and Barisal though they were supposed to have started in 2005. It could not be done due to non-availability of land. "The NSC chairman sought to bring some changes in design for better facilities and we have decided to provide US$ 2,50,000 to build a football centre in Barisal," said Fernando adding that they would provide another US$ 2,50,000 to build another football centre in Cox's Bazar. Asked about forming district and divisional football associations (DFA) under the FIFA guideline ahead of the BFF election, Fernando said that though he had not come here to discuss the formation of the DFAs he, however, discussed the matter with the NSC secretary. "He is very positive about it and explained what the actual position is ," Fernando said, "He told me what the government would like to see and what difficulties they are facing." "We just want a body to be elected without any influence from the government or the political parties," said Fernando adding that nothing was possible without government support. Fernando said that he would discuss the matter with the FIFA and try to do his best to solve the matter. BFF president SA Sultan, vice president Abdur Rahim, Sirajul Islam Bachchu and acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu were present on the occasion. bdn
