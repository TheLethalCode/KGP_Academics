 Cox's Bazar, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Fishing trawlers returned to shore in Cox's Bazar Wednesday as the sea turned turbulent following the brewing of a severe storm in the Bay of Bengal. The sky was overcast and there was intermittent rainfall since early morning, bdnews24.com's Cox's Bazar correspondent said. In the afternoon, the district disaster response committee had a meeting in the Deputy Commissioner's Office. The meeting decided to keep dry food stored and transports ready to carry people to safe places if the situation worsened. bdnews2
