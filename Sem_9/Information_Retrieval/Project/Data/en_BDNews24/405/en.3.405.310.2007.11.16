 New Delhi, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's communist parties allowed the government on Friday to start crucial talks with a UN watchdog needed to clinch a nuclear deal with the United States, reviving hope over the fate of the controversial pact. "The government will proceed with the talks and the outcome will be presented to the committee for its consideration before it finalises its findings," a statement issued by a joint panel of communist and ruling coalition leaders said. The India-US civilian nuclear cooperation agreement aims to reverse a three-decade ban on New Delhi's access to American nuclear fuel and equipment, but the communists say it impinges on India's sovereignty and imposes Washington's influence. The communists, who shore up Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition from the outside, have been threatening to withdraw support if the government pursues the deal. Their unrelenting stand forced New Delhi to pause the deal last month and avoid seeking clearances from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), one of the next three steps needed to clinch the deal. However, some communist leaders said this week they could consider allowing the government to hold talks with the IAEA -- but not sign a pact without their approval. That was formally agreed by the panel meeting on Friday. The nuclear cooperation agreement has been hailed as the symbol of a new strategic friendship between the once-estranged democracies and aims to help India, one of the world's fastest growing economies, meet its soaring energy needs. But critics say it undermines non-proliferation efforts as it rewards India, which has not signed the non-proliferation treaty and tested nuclear weapons. Although it faces no formal deadlines, Washington is keen the deal be approved by US Congress -- the final step before nuclear commerce can begin -- during the term of President George W. Bush and before campaigning picks up for presidential elections next year.
