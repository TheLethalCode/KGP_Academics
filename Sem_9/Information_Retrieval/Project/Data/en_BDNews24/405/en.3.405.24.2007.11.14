<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com) -- The deferred poverty reduction strategy (PRS) implementation forum meeting will not be held before January, officials with the Economic Relations Division said Wednesday. "The meeting was scheduled for November 17-18 in Dhaka, but could not be held because of time constraints, particularly of the donors," ERD additional secretary Shaheedul Haque told bdnews24.com. The government finalised the PRSP on October 2005. Implementation and the way forward were discussed at a government-led first PRS Implementation Forum in November 2005. The forum meeting was earlier known as the Paris Consortium. The forum provides Bangladesh an opportunity to share its successes, challenges, development agenda, strategies and goals with its development partners. "We're working with the donors closely on the upcoming meeting," Dilip Kumar, a deputy secretary of the ERD told bdnews24.com. He said that the meeting might be held at the end of January or the first week of February. "The meeting will focus on poverty reduction strategy and how to achieve the millennium development goals," said Kumar. Replying to a query, he said that the donors do not pledge aid at the forum meeting. "They (donors) give us aid on the basis of their respective country assistance strategy, but the meeting discusses the requirement of financial assistance to achieve the goals," he added. bd
