The Maldives' 1,200 coral islands sit less than 2 metres (yards) above sea level and are threatened with inundation if sea levels rise 59 cm (23 inches) by 2100 as predicted by the UN climate panel. It would cost an estimated $1.5 billion to provide sea defences for the country's deluxe $1,000-a-night resorts. The conference brings together officials from countries including Singapore, Micronesia, Grenada and the Seychelles, as well as environmental lawyers.
