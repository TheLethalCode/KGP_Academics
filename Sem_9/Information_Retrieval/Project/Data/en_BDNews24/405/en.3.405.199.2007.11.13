 NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N: Quote, Profile, Research) on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected rise in quarterly profit as it controlled expenses and drew customers into its US stores earlier than ever for holiday shopping. Shares of the world's largest retailer rose 3.7 percent to $44.95 in trading before the market opened. Wal-Mart said net income rose 8 percent to $2.86 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the third quarter ended October 31 from $2.65 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit from the sale of real estate, earnings were 69 cents per share, beating the analysts' average forecast by 2 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Wal-Mart is trying to revive sales at its U.S. stores and appeal to shoppers who are feeling the pinch of higher food and fuel costs and the downturn in the housing market. In the past several weeks, it has cut prices on popular toys and 15,000 other items to try to drive shoppers to its stores for their holiday shopping. The company is also keeping an close eye on expenses, reducing costs in part through programs it has already announced, like a new system that schedules hourly employees based on the number of shoppers in a store. In a research note on Monday, Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira said Wal-Mart's use of low prices to drive shoppers to its stores while keeping a tight control on expenses was "the right strategy for the right time as consumers tighten their belts." SALES RISING HEADING INTO HOLIDAYS Sales rose almost 9 percent to $90.9 billion. Sales in the U.S. division rose 6.4 percent to $57.65 billion while sales in the company's international operations rose almost 17 percent to $22.4 billion. Chief Executive Lee Scott on a recorded call said Wal-Mart's grocery, health and wellness, and entertainment businesses were performing strongly, while the struggling home and clothing departments were showing improving trends. But the company continues to have a hard time attracting more shoppers to its U.S. stores. Sales at U.S. Wal-Mart stores open at least a year -- a key retail gauge known as same-store sales -- rose 1 percent in the quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent gain at Wal-Mart's Sam's Club warehouse division. On the recorded call, Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of U.S. operations, said same-store sales had increased because shoppers spent more during their store visits, while customer traffic declined. For the fourth quarter, Wal-Mart expects U.S. same-store sales to be flat to up 2 percent. Castro-Wright said that for the holidays, the company expected strong demand for electronics, like televisions, digital cameras, video games and computers. PREPARING FOR FISCAL-YEAR FINALE Wal-Mart forecast earnings per share from continuing operations at 99 cents to $1.03 for the fourth quarter and $3.13 to $3.17 for the full year. The outlook includes an after-tax restructuring charge of $40 million in the fourth quarter for the company's Japanese operations. Wal-Mart said last month it would acquire the remaining shares of its Japanese supermarket subsidiary, Seiyu Ltd (8268.T: Quote, Profile, Research). In August, after Wal-Mart reported a lower-than-expected second-quarter profit, it cut its full-year forecast to $3.05 to $3.13 per share from continuing operations, down from an earlier view of $3.15 to $3.23. Analysts currently expect earnings of $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.09 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company were down roughly 6 percent year to date through Monday, while smaller rival Target Corp (TGT.N: Quote, Profile, Research) had fallen less than 1 percent.
