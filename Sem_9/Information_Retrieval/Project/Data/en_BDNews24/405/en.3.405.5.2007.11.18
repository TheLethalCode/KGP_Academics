<TEXT>
 Sydney, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 17 people were reported killed and others missing after widespread flooding destroyed about 450 houses in Papua New Guinea following a week of heavy rains, police said. Thousands of villagers were forced from their homes in eastern Oro Province by rising waters, which also washed away roads, bridges and food gardens, Australian Associated Press reported from the capital, Port Moresby. "There's some information coming in that mothers and their babies and old men and women were washed away in the floods," Provincial Police Commander Buafe Hugo told AAP. "Houses were washed away and we don't know if there were people in them or not," he said. Police were flying by helicopter to affected districts on Sunday, and Buafe said he feared the death toll could rise. The flooding followed days of heavy rains caused by tropical cyclone Guba, which has moved slowly across the Coral Sea and is currently sitting off northern Australia. Displaced villagers in Oro were running out of food and trying to get to care centres being set up by authorities. The water supply to the provincial capital Popondetta, about 150 km (95 miles) north-east of Port Moresby, had had to be shut down and the province's main airport and wharf were also closed. John Hosea, of Red Cross Papua New Guinea, told AAP the agency would send tarpaulins and water containers to Oro on Monday on a military aircraft.
