<TITLE> Japan minister named in defence scandal hearing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former top defence official embroiled in a scandal said he and senior ruling party lawmaker Fukushiro Nukaga, currently the finance minister, had dined with a defence contractor who was recently arrested for suspected embezzlement. Former Vice Defence Minister Takemasa Moriya said under oath in parliament that former Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma had also dined with the contractor on a separate occasion. A widening of the scandal is likely to further complicate Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's efforts to restart Japan's naval mission in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan -- stalled by opposition parties in control of parliament's upper house. It could also damage Fukuda's government as the Japanese leader struggles to implement policies in the face of a divided parliament, analysts said. Fukuda took power in September after his predecessor quit in the wake of a string of ministerial scandals. "I think it was Mr Kyuma and Mr Nukaga," Moriya told the committee after repeatedly saying he did not want to name politicians who had dined with defence contractor Motonobu Miyazaki in case his memory was inaccurate. "I remember the occasion with Mr Nukaga clearly," he said later, adding that he did not know who had paid for the meal. Media reports have said Nukaga, a former defence minister who has quit cabinet posts twice in the past over scandals, received cash from the contractor. Nukaga has said that he returned the cash and he has denied having any special ties to the firm. Asked about the testimony, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said: "The finance minister told me he has never accepted entertainment from Mr Moriya or Mr Miyazaki," adding that reporters should check directly with Nukaga if they had doubts. The main opposition Democratic party said it would demand Nukaga also give testimony in parliament. "Depending on his explanation, the question could very well arise as to whether he is properly suited to the finance portfolio," senior party executive Naoto Kan told reporters. SLUSH FUND? Prosecutors last week arrested Miyazaki, 69, a former top executive of Tokyo-based Yamada Corp, on suspicion that he had embezzled money from the firm's U.S. unit to obtain funds to set up a new firm, Japanese media have reported. Media have also been awash with speculation about a special slush fund set up by Miyazaki to court favours from officials and politicians. Moriya has admitted that he played golf more than 200 times with Miyazaki over more than a decade and was treated to meals, trips and gifts. Prosecutors are preparing a case against him for taking bribes, media reports say. "The most difficult thing for me is that hard-working military personnel may be looked at with suspicion because of what I did," Moriya said in frequently emotional testimony. The 63-year-old ex-bureaucrat has denied he did favours for Miyazaki, who Japanese media said was not only politically well connected at home but had close ties with US defence officials. "It appears that the contractor approached various politicians, not just Moriya," said Yasunori Sone, a political science professor at Keio University in Tokyo. "If Nukaga had to quit, that would damage Fukuda and make it even harder to enact the new bill enabling the naval mission," he said, adding there was speculation the scandal might widen to take in more politicians. Fukuda's predecessor, Shinzo Abe, abruptly resigned in September after a year plagued by scandals and gaffes that cost him five cabinet ministers, including one who committed suicide. Voters angry at the scandals and other government bungling handed victory to the Democratic Party and its smaller allies in a July upper house electi
