<TITLE> IT businessmen rap BTTB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com) -- IT businessmen Tuesday came down hard on BTTB for what they said was its inefficiency and neglect of duty in maintaining internet connections through the country's sole submarine cable. Updates with more details At a press conference that came amid the breakdown of the internet services across the country, they concluded that internet disruptions cost businesses much more than hartal. They asked the BTTB to ensure an alternative to the existing submarine cable, which often goes down or out, hurting businesses. The acting president of Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services, Rafiqul Islam said: "We thought that internet services would improve in Bangladesh thanks to the submarine cable which was installed in May 2006. But it did not happen so." Rafiqul said the submarine cable had been severed 27 times since the start of the services, hurting the IT sector, which would have a "negative impact on the economy". "I think it is because of inefficiency of the BTTB," he said. Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), Bangladesh Computer Samity (BCS) and the Internet Service Providers Association of Bangladesh (ISPAB) organised the conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity. Internet users ran into serious service disruptions Monday night after the fibre optic link to Dhaka was cut off at a point in Sitakundu. Saiful Islam, who mans the help desk of internet service provider ADN, told bdnews24.com at 1:45am Tuesday: "All fibre links are down." Kaimuzzaman, support officer at Bangladesh Online (BOL), said: "We have switched to VSAT." "It's been down since 12.45am and we've been trying to contact BTTB officials," he told bdnews24.com at 1:50am by phone. Fazal M Kamal, executive director for news and public affairs of bdnews24.com, one of the most affected internet-based operations, said: "It's most distressing that a second disruption has taken place in a matter of 48 hours." "We are able to operate because of VSAT connectivity provided by the ISP. But our readers are unable to access our site," he added. "It's worrying that it has occurred a number of times in the past few months and it's not ceased yet. In the larger perspective, it affects many business operations adversely." bdnews
