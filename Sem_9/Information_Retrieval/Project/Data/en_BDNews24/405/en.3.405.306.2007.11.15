<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday hailed the move to formally transfer the management of nationalised commercial banks to their boards as a sure way to reduce political intervention in banks' activities. The adviser made his comments at the finance ministry during the management handover of Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks to their boards. Three separate vendors' agreements were signed between the government and the boards of the banks. "These banks could not perform at their desired level because of political intervention by successive governments," said Azizul at a ceremony to mark the agreement. With the vendors' agreement, Azizul said, the government has now completed the process of handing over the management of the banks to its boards. "Now the banks will enjoy real autonomy," he said. However, the banks now face enormous challenges in improving their services, accountability and transparency if they are to improve customer confidence. Another major challenge for the state-owned banks is to compete effectively with the private banking sector: "I think their prospects are good," said the advisor. The boards and management of the banks have to work out clear plans to improve the level of efficiency in their activities, Azizul said. "I hope the boards will take steps to enhance their services, assisted by the autonomy the now enjoy," said Azizul. The advisor reminded the banks new management that the role of state-owned banks is continually shrinking next to the private banking sector. He said: "You have to improve the quality of your services to regain your reputation." The adviser also urged the new management not to be guided solely by profit maximisation: "Bring balance to deposit and lending rates so that both stakeholders' interests are safeguarded." Speaking on behalf of the three banks, former commerce secretary Sohel Ahmed Chowdhury said accountability and transparency will be ensured with the new autonomy the banks enjoy. The caretaker government's council of advisers approved the draft by-laws in February that paved the way for the move. Later, the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies issued the three banks operating licenses, and with the vendors' agreement, they become fully corporatised. The deal was inked by cabinet secretary and chairman of the board of directors of Sonali Bank, Ali Imam Majumdar, chairman of Agrani Bank and former finance secretary Siddiqur Rahman Choudhury and chairman of Janata Bank and former commerce secretary Sohel Ahmed Chowdhury. Quamrunnahar Ahmed, deputy secretary of the finance ministry signed for the government. bd
