 DHAKA, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The death toll from super cyclone Sidr climbed to 1,070 Saturday, as rescuers struggled to reach thousands of survivors, officials said. Naval ships and army helicopters continued their rescue operations in the southern arc ravaged by mighty winds and waves. The official death count from the cyclone, which measured more powerful than the 1991 elemental swoop, was still much less than previous death tolls from cyclones. Tens of thousands of people passed tense hours without power although the government struggled to ensure electricity through what came to be known as "load management" much across the country. Car users, cabbies and autorickshaw drivers stretched queues for gas in the city and elsewhere Saturday morning, as hours of blackouts halted the operations of filling stations through Friday night. Naval ships scoured the pummelled coastal areas for hundreds of people reported missing and to clear river channels clogged with sunken boats and vessels to restore normal navigation, officials said. Helicopters flew sorties to devastated areas, dropping food, drinking water and medicine for the survivors. Cyclone Sidr smashed into the southern coastline late Thursday night with 250-kph winds that whipped up a 5-metre tidal surge. It was the strongest cyclone since a 1991 storm killed some 143,000 people. "There was no tin-roofed house here, which did not suffer the onslaughts of the cyclone," Swapan Bepari told bdnews24.com by phone from Pirojpur in the ravaged south. The area he lives in is without power. Swapan who works for the Department of Youth Development as group animator said: "I don't expect electricity to come back even in one month." In Pirojpur, one of the hardest-hit districts, rescuers retrieved 75 more bodies Saturday, raising the death count to 127. "It will take several days to complete the search and know the actual casualty figure and extent of damage to property," said food and disaster ministry official Ayub Miah. The US navy is reportedly ready to send two amphibious assault ships with helicopters to help in rescue efforts. Bangladesh had yet to receive a formal offer from the US Navy, foreign secretary Touhid Hossain told Reuters. Touhid told bdnews24.com: "We did not take any decision yet on receiving help in rescue operations from a foreign country. We are trying to work on our own." The US navy helped after a devastating storm in 1991. AID PLEDGED Aid officials described damage from the storm, which blew away homes and ripped out trees and power lines, as extremely severe. Most of the country plunged into darkness Friday after the electricity grid was knocked out. Parts of Dhaka, the capital city of 10 million people, were still without power Saturday. "Our relief teams have started emergency distribution, with an initial coverage of 100,000 people," said Vince Edwards, World Vision's Bangladesh national director. "However, several areas are inaccessible right now due to fallen trees," a World Vision statement quoted Edwards as saying Saturday. Rice crops that had been ready for harvesting in December have been seriously damaged, he said. "Many people are homeless, crops and livelihoods have been destroyed and this is going to put great pressure on the government, the economy, and the people themselves -- particularly as this comes only a few months after floods devastated the northern part of the country," said Suman SMA Islam, CARE's humanitarian assistance coordinator. Germany has allocated $293,000 in emergency relief aid and the European Union has released 1.5 million euros ($2.1 million) in fast-track aid. "This is a major tragedy with hundreds already known to have died and hundreds of thousands suffering from this disaster," said Louis Michel, the European Commissioner responsible for Development and Humanitarian Aid. In New York, John Holmes, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said his office would make available "several million dollars" in emergency aid. MISSING AT SEA Red Crescent officials said some 1,000 fishermen were still unaccounted for in the Bay of Bengal, onboard about 150 boats. Fishing community leaders in Cox's Bazar and Barisal said they still expected some of the missing crew to return safely. In past storms, fishing boats took shelter in the Sundarbans mangrove forests, said Shohel Ahmed, a Barisal fisherman. The Sundarbans, home to the endangered Royal Bengal tigers and a World Heritage site, took the brunt of the latest storm and forest officials said many wildlife could have died. The Category 4 cyclone and the tidal surge it spawned devastated three coastal towns and forced 3.2 million people to evacuate, officials and aid agencies said. It lost strength after landfall and passed over the country early Friday, weather officials said.
