<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi pressed on with their unbeaten one-day run Wednesday to firm up their lead in the National Cricket League table while Chittagong and Sylhet also won their fourth-round games. An all-round performance from Nayeem Islam powered Rajshahi to a five-wicket win over Khulna, who Tuesday snatched the lead in the four-dayer beating Rajshahi, at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. National discards Nafis Iqbal and Faisal Hossain Dickens smashed fifties as Chittagong registered a three-wicket win over hosts Dhaka, who had beat the same rivals in the four-dayer at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium the previous day. Away at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium, a Golam Mabud century helped Sylhet to taste their first victory as they overcame Dhaka, whom they lost to in the four-dayer Tuesday, by 14 runs. Rajshahi have eight points from four straight wins while Chittagong joined Khulna in the second position with four points each. Dhaka and Sylhet each have two points while Barisal are winless in four matches. Rajshahi vs Khulna Khulna's decision to bat first appeared right with scoreboard on 103 for three in 20 overs, but they collapsed spectacularly to be bundled out for a paltry 187 in 47.5 overs in the face of some tight bowling from Rajshahi. Saqib Al Hasan top-scored with 52 while Imrul Kayes (27), Habibul Bashar (25) and Nazmus Sadat (15) were other notable scorers. Nayeem Islam (2/16), Suhrawardi Shuvo (2/26), Mahbub (2/34) and Farhad Reza (2/55) ran through the Khulna batting. In reply, Nayeem hammered 66 and Farhad Hossain hit 43 as Rajshahi reached 188 for five in 42.1 overs. Chittagong vs Dhaka Deciding to bat first, Dhaka had a rocky start as they lost openers Javed Omar (3) and Al Shahriar (23) for 27 before the middle order steadied the innings. Mosharraf Hossain Rubel played the anchor to put on 79 with Mehrab Hossain Junior (34) and another 65 for the third wicket with Mohammad Ashraful (45) to take the side to 171 for four. Rubel, who swept Sabbir Khan to reach his fifty, made 69 off 107 balls and Mohammad Rafique made a breezy 22 off 14 to help Dhaka post 253 for nine in 50 overs. In reply, Chittagong openers Mahbubul Karim and Nafis Iqbal put on 58 with Karim making a stroke-filled 46 off 45 balls before being trapped lbw by Musharraf. Nafis then paired with Aftab Ahmed (38) and together they contributed 81 runs for the second wicket before the opener top-edged Mohammad Rafique to wicketkeeper Sajjad Kadir for 50 off 80 balls. Chittagong lost two quick wickets to slip to 141 for four before Nazimuddin and Dickens took them to 203 for five. Nazim gave a catch to Riad at cover for 34 off 39, studded with two sixes and one four. Dhaka spinner Mohammad Rafique troubled Chittagong sending Dickens (52 off 62 balls) and Karmul Islam (0) back in one over. Dhiman Ghosh (20) and Rezaul Karim (2) remained unbeaten to take Chittagong to 254 for seven with three balls to spare. Sylhet vs Barisal Sent in to bat first, Sylhet posted a modest 225 for nine in 50 overs despite a top-order collapse. Number-four Golam Mabud rescued Sylhet with a brilliant 100 off 116 laced with 12 fours and two sixes. Sharifullah (38) and Ejaj Ahmed (30) provided supported Mahbud in the middle. Barisal, in reply, could not recover from a slow start after being reduced to 29 for two by pacer Subhashish Roy and finished on 211 for nine in 50 overs. Barisal needed to make 85 runs in the last 10 overs with five wickets in hands. Spinner Enamul Haq Junior (4/50) and pacer Tapash Kumar (1/32) slowed down the Barisal run rate. They removed three batsmen in the space of nine runs as Barisal slipped to 194 for nine in 48.2 overs from 185 for six. Raqibul Hasan scored an unbeaten 87, but it was far from enough to avert fourth defeat in a row for Barisal. b
