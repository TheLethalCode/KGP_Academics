 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday sent former BNP MP Ali Newaz Mahmud Khoiyam to jail, a day after he was arrested on charges of taking bribe. Magistrate Abdullah al Mamun of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka turned down Khoiyam's bail appeal and ordered him to jail. In the bail appeal, Khoiyam pleaded innocent and claimed that the case was filed to tarnish his image. "Besides, the case was filed 13 months after the incident reportedly took place. If the incident had been true, law enforcers would have appealed for remand," the appeal said. Joint forces arrested Khoiyam in Kakrail area Tuesday for taking Tk 15 lakh in bribe in return for awarding a work deal at the parking yard of Daulatdia Ferry Ghat. He was later handed over to Tejgaon police. One Solaiman of Manikganj filed the case against three people. In the case, Solaiman said Ali Newaz demanded Tk 15 lakh from him in 2005 for the work, which the plaintiff claimed to have paid by more than one cheque. Two others named in the case are Asaduzzaman and Anwar Hossain, who are evading arrest. bdnew
