 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Meteorological Department Tuesday sounded a special warning for the Chittagong port area as the severe cyclonic storm 'SIDR' turned into a hurricane. Hundreds of ships and fishing boats headed back to port. Meteorologists said the storm, packing winds of around 185km per hour was some 1,100 km off Chittagong port and could be heading for shore. British storm tracking system Tropical Storm Risk described it as a category 4 storm, the same strength as Hurricane Katrina which killed more than 1,700 people in the United States in 2005. Samarendra Karmaker, director of the Met office, told bdnews24.com by phone Tuesday night that the category 4 cyclonic storm means it has the same power as hurricane. As many as 42,675 volunteers are ready for deployment in the coastal areas of 11 districts in the event of a disaster, an official with the food and disaster management ministry told bdnews24.com. "The severe cyclonic storm 'SIDR' with a core of hurricane winds over the east central Bay and adjoining southeast Bay remained practically stationary," the weather office said in a bulletin. "It is likely to intensify further and move in a north-northwesterly direction," the bulletin added. The maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla have been advised to keep up the warning signal No. 4. A November storm killed more than five lakh people in 1970, while an April storm killed 1.43 lakh people in 1991. bdnews24.com's Chittagong bureau said a control room had started operations at the port, Syed Farhaduddin Ahmed, Chittagong Port Authority secretary, said to bdnews24.com. Reuters contributed to the report. bdn
