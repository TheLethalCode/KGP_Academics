 HOBART, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)- Australia established yet another position of dominance by reaching 329-3 on day one of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Hobart. Phil Jaques and Michael Hussey, centurions in the easy first Test win, each added another three-figure score while Sri Lanka fielded poorly. Chaminda Vaas was denied a 100th Test cap because of worries about whether his shoulder would last the match. And Muttiah Muralitharan managed just one wicket from 25 overs of toil. The scalp of Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who was caught at slip for 31, took Muralitharan to 703 victims in his bid to beat the retired Shane Warne's record of 708. But the day was all about some effortless batting from Jaques (150) and Hussey (101 not out). Sri Lanka, who lost the toss, showed two changes from the side crushed in the first Test at Brisbane. Fast bowler Lasith Malinga returned to the starting line-up, ousting Vaas, and their leading batsman Kumar Sangakkara returned from injury to replace Thilan Samaraweera. The Aussies were unchanged from the side that won in Brisbane, batsman Michael Clarke recovering from a tight hamstring. After Matthew Hayden had gone for 17, Jaques and Ricky Ponting (31) added 85 for the second wicket. The big partnership came either side of tea - left-handers Jaques and Hussey putting on 152 in 38 overs. Hussey, in his 18th match for Australia, went to bed with a Bradmanesque Test average of 87.19. His seventh century in Tests came when he pulled the second ball of the final over, bowled by Farveez Maharoof, expertly through midwicket for four. Jaques' innings was studded with some powerful shots off the back foot square of the wicket on both sides. He also indulged in some delightful cover drives, hitting 18 fours and scoring at a healthy rate throughout. Jaques found Dilhara Fernando the most generous of the Sri Lanka bowlers. But he was watchful against Muralitharan, who troubled him in the first Test. Spin did account for Jaques in the end. Shortly before the new ball was due he advanced to lofted Sanath Jayasruiya straight to long-on. Hussey compiled his runs with a minimum of fuss and looked at his best when cover-driving over-pitched balls, enjoying particular success against Malinga. He did manage a couple of boundaries against Muralitharan too, including a regulation pull forward off midwicket from the third ball he faced. Sri Lanka messed up two decent run-out chances to remove Jaques when the Victorian was in the 20s. While those missed opportunities proved extremely costly, Hayden was more charitable. Looking out of sorts, the Queenslander had already been dropped once when slashing Fernando to the wicket-keeper. After the day's play Hussey said: "I've convinced myself [the average] is going to come down at some stage, but I'm happy to keep it like this for as long as possible. "I just want to enjoy it while it's lasting and keep a level keel, not get too excited when things are going well, or too low when they're not going well." Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss pleaded with his bowlers to be more persistent with their lines and lengths. He said: "When the plan doesn't work, the discipline goes away.
