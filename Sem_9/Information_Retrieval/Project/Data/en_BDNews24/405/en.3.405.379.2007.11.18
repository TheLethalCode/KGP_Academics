 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The head of a visiting European Union delegation Sunday said the emergency rule should be lifted before local government and national elections are held. A six-member EU delegation led by Robert Evans met chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda at his office in the morning. Evans told reporters after the meeting that the move was necessary to enable political parties to carry out their election campaigns effectively. "The government might well consider making the schedule for lifting emergency rule public," said Evans. The EU team chief added that they had also discussed voter registration and election transparency during the meeting. bdnews24.c
