 Pabna, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  A Pabna court Thursday ordered former BNP lawmaker KM Anwarul Islam into jail for misappropriating a large number of corrugated iron sheets earmarked for relief. Public prosecutor Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com that judge Sunil Chandra Paul of Pabna District and Sessions Judge's Court rejected the former MP's appeal for bail, which he submitted directly after turning himself in to the court. On March 11, joint forces seized 200 pieces of corrugated iron sheets, intended for relief projects, from a Chatmohar poultry farm owned by the son of former lawmaker from Pabna-3 constituency. Chatmohar police chief Jahidul Islam filed a case naming Anwar as the main accused. The former MP's son, Monwarul Islam, was named as co-accused but he has gone hiding. bdnews24.com/co
