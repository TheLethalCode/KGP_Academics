 MACAU, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Macau Chief Executive Edmund Ho promised a crackdown on corruption and tax cuts in a crucial policy address on Tuesday, delivered at a time of mounting social tensions in the gambling haven. Macau's government has faced a raft of challenges over the past year, including violent labour protests over a widening wealth gap and a major corruption trial that threatens to expose what many perceive as endemic graft in the casino boomtown. "We have learnt profound lessons," said Ho in his speech to the city's legislators, an apparent reference to the spate of problems besetting the former Portuguese colony. "By proactively strengthening the transparency of government, and enhancing the foundation of mutual trust, we can reduce misunderstandings in our work, and make things better," Ho added. The 90-minute speech was delivered in Macau's legislative council, just a stone's throw from the courthouse where a former Ho ally, ex-secretary for transport and public works, Ao Man-long is now on trial for 76 counts of corruption, including accepting bribes, laundering money and abuse of power. The corruption trial, dubbed Chinese territory's biggest ever, has shone a spotlight on the crime feeding off an economic boom but it has also fanned hopes for stronger supervision. Ho pledged to "attack" graft, boost government transparency and put forward new legislation next year to bolster the investigative powers of Macau's anti-corruption watchdog. But some legislators were sceptical, saying the problems were endemic. "I don't believe that he (Ho) has introduced any deep structural reforms to address corruption, nor introduce greater accountability, there is only a shadow," said Antonio Ng, a legislator and long-standing government critic. Since 2001 when Macau liberalised its gaming sector, it has flung its doors open to global gaming giants from Wynn Resorts to the Las Vegas Sands, which operates the Venetian Macau, turning the territory into the world's largest gaming hub. Despite Macau's economic boom, there is widespread discontent over a growing wealth gap, soaring inflation and housing costs as well as its flawed governance and corruption. Thousands of angry labour unionists and residents spilled onto the streets in a May Day Protest, scuffling with police. Ho acknowledged these pressures and pledged to hand out some 1.1 billion patacas ($141 million) in income tax cuts from next year and slashing various other rates and housing fees. But some said it wasn't enough. "He hasn't done enough to help Macau's low income working poor ... there are now 40,000 people in Macau living on less than 3,500 patacas ($450) a month, these policies will provide little relief for them," said Macau legislator Kwan Tsui Hang. Others, however, said it was Ho's most substantive policy address since taking power eight years ago. "Society is facing an unprecedented era of fast-paced change. These initiatives show the people that the government is truly concerned about livelihood issues," said legislator Steven Lei. ($1=7.8 patac
