 GWALIOR, India, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan all rounder Shahid Afridi and Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir were heavily fined on Wednesday following their on-pitch clash during the third one-day international in Kanpur. Afridi was fined 95 percent of his match fee and Gambhir 65 percent following a hearing on Wednesday by the International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Roshan Mahanama, an ICC statement said. The players were charged under two counts of the ICC Code of Conduct relating to conduct unbecoming of their status which could bring them or the game into disrepute and the rule relating to "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players in the course of play." Gambhir and Afridi were involved in a heated altercation after they collided, forcing umpire Ian Gould to intervene and separate them. India won the third game by 46 runs to lead the five-match series 2-1. The fourth game will be played in Gwalior on Thursday
