<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Tue Nov 13(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Acclaimed Indian director Sudhir Mishra's new movie, "Khoya Khoya Chand" (Lost Moon) recreates 1950s Bollywood through a tale of politics, corruption and exploitation of women. Mishra's film narrates a love story between a writer-director and a star actress during a vintage era for Indian filmmaking. "It is a story about a writer-director who liberates the actress from the clutches of a powerful actor only to exploit her for his own benefit," Mishra told Reuters on Tuesday. "He soon realizes his sin -- that is when he falls in love with her and understands the value of love." Mishra said "Khoya Khoya Chand" is his tribute to some of Indian cinema's best years. Some famous Bollywood movies such as "Pyaasa" (Eternal Thirst) and "Kaagaz Ke Phool" (Paper Flowers) by Guru Dutt, "Devdas" by Bimal Roy and "Mother India" by Mehboob Khan were made during the decade. "The 1950s is the best period for Indian cinema," Mishra said. "The films that were produced in that period are still incomparable in content, screenplay or direction. What we are making now is simply fluff." Mishra said he paid minute attention to costumes, music, set design and hair-dos when recreating the 1950s look. Bollywood last week saw another film, "Om Shanti Om," a spoof of Bollywood in the 1970s, open to roaring box office success. Mishra said he was hoping for a similar audience response to his movie which is due to open on December
