 LONDON, Nov 13(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police charged pop singer Boy George with false imprisonment on Tuesday after he allegedly chained a man to a wall at his London home. Boy George, whose real name is George O'Dowd, was released on police bail and is scheduled to appear in court on November 22. "George O'Dowd ... is charged with false imprisonment of a 28-year-old male ... on April 28, 2007," a police spokeswoman said. The 47-year-old former Culture Club frontman was arrested in May after a man accused him of "false imprisonment and common assault" at the singer's London home. Last year Boy George was ordered to sweep the streets of Manhattan by a American court after charges stemming from an incident when police responded to his call reporting a burglary and found cocaine in his apartment.
