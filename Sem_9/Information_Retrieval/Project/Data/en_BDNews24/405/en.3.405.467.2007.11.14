 ISLAMABAD, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition parties tried to forge a united front on Wednesday to end the rule of Pervez Musharraf as the military president insisted a state of emergency he imposed this month was necessary for fair elections. US ally Musharraf, who took power in a 1999 coup, plunged the nuclear-armed country into crisis on Nov. 3 when he declared emergency rule, suspended the constitution, rounded up thousands of opponents and curbed the media. "We are ready to set aside our differences with the People's Party," former prime minister Nawaz Sharif told Reuters by telephone from Saudi Arabia, referring to the party of another former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto, who had been in power-sharing talks with Musharraf for months, returned home in October from 8 years of self-imposed exile, aiming to work with him on a transition to civilian rule. Then came the crackdown. After police stifled a protest by Bhutto on Tuesday and put her under house arrest, she announced her talks with Musharraf were over, and for the first time called on him to step down as president as well as army chief. She added that her party might boycott a parliamentary election Musharraf has promised to hold by Jan. 9. Bhutto also contacted old rivals including Islamist alliance leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed, cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, whom police detained on Wednesday, and Sharif's party to urge a "coalition of interests", party officials said. "She's trying to unite all political parties on a minimum agenda to return the country to true democracy," said Latif Khosa, a senator and aide to Bhutto. "The minimum agenda is the ouster of General Musharraf and formation of a neutral government of national consensus to organise free and fair elections," Khosa said. Sharif and Bhutto were bitter rivals during the late 1980s and 1990s, both serving two terms as prime minister, alternating with each other until Musharraf ousted Sharif in 1999. Both Bhutto and Sharif faced corruption charges. "EMERGENCY NECESSARY" Musharraf, under pressure from allies to put the country back on a path to democracy, said at the weekend the general elections would take place but he would not say when the constitution would be restored or the emergency lifted. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, who last week warned against cutting aid to an "indispensable" ally, is due in Pakistan late this week to urge Musharraf to end the emergency. But Musharraf has repeatedly defended the emergency. "In an environment marked by terrorism and suicide attacks, the state of emergency was necessary for the holding of peaceful, free and honest elections," he told Le Monde on Wednesday. Musharraf told Britain's Sky News he had considered resigning but now felt he was the man to lead Pakistan to democracy. Sky, the last foreign news channel available on cable in Pakistan, went off the air shortly after broadcasting that news. Musharraf also told Sky he felt let down by the West and betrayed by the media. "We may lose the battle on terror because of misreporting," he was quoted as saying. Police have used batons and tear gas to break up small protests in various parts of the country since the emergency was declared but there has been no major violence. Analysts say Bhutto's refusal to deal with Musharraf had isolated the embattled president, though he retained the crucial backing of the army and the support of disparate group of politicians expected to do badly in the polls. "The entire political spectrum is united to oppose him," said Talat Masood, a former general and a political analyst. "He is becoming more and more isolated." But underscoring the difficulty of uniting a fractious opposition, students loyal to religious alliance leader Ahmed briefly detained Imran Khan when he emerged from hiding to lead a campus protest in Lahore. Police later detained Khan. Pakistani shares ended 2.24 percent down on political worry while the rupee edged to a three-year l
