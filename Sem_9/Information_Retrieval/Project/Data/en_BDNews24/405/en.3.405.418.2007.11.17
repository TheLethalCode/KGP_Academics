 DHAKA, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Naval ships and army helicopters Saturday were trying to reach thousands of survivors of a super cyclone that killed about 1,000 people and pummelled the southern arc with mighty winds and waves. Cyclone Sidr smashed into the southern coastline late Thursday night with 250-kph winds that whipped up a 5-metre tidal surge. It was the strongest cyclone since a 1991 storm killed some 143,000 people. Navy ships scoured coastal areas for hundreds of people reported missing and to clear river channels clogged with sunken vessels to restore normal navigation, officials said. Helicopters flew sorties to devastated areas, dropping food, drinking water and medicine for the survivors. The official death toll from the cyclone was 915. "It will take several days to complete the search and know the actual casualty figure and extent of damage to property," said food and disaster ministry official Ayub Miah. The US navy is reportedly ready to send two amphibious assault ships with helicopters to help in rescue efforts. Bangladesh had yet to receive a formal offer from the US Navy, foreign secretary Touhid Hossain told Reuters. Touhid told bdnews24.com: "We did not take any decision yet on receiving help in rescue operations from a foreign country. We are trying to work on our own." The US Navy helped after a devastating storm in 1991. MISSING AT SEA Red Crescent officials said some 1,000 fishermen were still unaccounted for in the Bay of Bengal, onboard about 150 boats. Fishing community leaders in Cox's Bazar and Barisal said they still expected some of the missing crew to return safely. In past storms, fishing boats took shelter in the Sundarbans mangrove forests, said Shohel Ahmed, a Barisal fisherman. The Sundarbans, home to the endangered Royal Bengal tigers and a World Heritage site, took the brunt of the latest storm and forest officials said many wildlife could have died. The Category 4 cyclone and the tidal surge it spawned devastated three coastal towns and forced 3.2 million people to evacuate, officials and aid agencies said. It lost strength after landfall and passed over the country early on Friday.
