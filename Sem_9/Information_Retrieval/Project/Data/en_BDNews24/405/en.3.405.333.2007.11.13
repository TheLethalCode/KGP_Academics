<TITLE> Russian food firms may extend price freeze: WBD </TITLE>

 MOSCOW, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Russian food producers and retailers may agree to extend a price freeze on consumer staples by two months to the end of March 2008, the chairman of dairy and fruit juice company Wimm-Bill-Dann said on Tuesday. The extension, designed to curb inflation that is set to exceed the government's target, would ease pressure on the Kremlin before March presidential elections. But economists have criticised the freeze as Soviet-style intervention. "We will do it in order not to cause problems in the pre-election period. We understand our social responsibility, although this measure won't come cheap," David Yakobashvili, a core shareholder in Wimm-Bill-Dann, told Reuters. Around 20 companies agreed last month to hold the prices of basics such as bread, milk, sunflower oil and eggs until Jan. 31. Russia holds a parliamentary election on Dec. 2 and voters elect a successor to President Vladimir Putin next March. Milk powder prices have doubled this year and bread prices have rocketed in line with world grain prices. The price spike has dented the high popularity of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which Putin will lead in December parliamentary polls. About 1,500 people, half of them pensioners, marched through Russia's second-largest city of St Petersburg this month, banging empty saucepans and shouting anti-Kremlin slogans in protest against rising food prices. Food vendors in provincial towns say they are struggling to make a living as their products have become too expensive for customers. HIGH INFLATION Wimm-Bill-Dann's Yakobashvili said he was speaking on behalf of his company, Russia's largest dairy firm, but added he expected other food companies to support an extension. Those who joined the original freeze include store chains Metro, Auchan, Pyatyorochka, Perekryostok and Lenta. Vegetable oil producer Yug Rusi and dairy firm Unimilk also signed up. Inflation is particularly sensitive to food prices, which make up about 40 percent of the consumer price index in Russia compared with nearer 15 percent in the European Union. The central bank's first deputy chairman, Alexei Ulyukayev, on Tuesday forecast Russian inflation would hit 10-11 percent this year, overshooting the government's 8 percent target. Russia has introduced varied measures to try to contain inflation. A 10 percent export tariff on wheat and a 30 percent export tariff on barley came into effect on Nov. 12 to keep more grains at home and depress bread prices. The government is also selling grain from its intervention stocks to domestic flour millers, although these sales have so far done little to tame prices. Russia will also cut an import tariff on soy oil, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil to 5 percent from 15 percent for six months from December. In a separate order, the government cut an import tariff on some vegetables by the same degree from Jan. 1. 20
