The Board of Sudanese Religious Scholars ruled that Muslims were only banned from sacrificing animals with a disease mentioned in the Hadith, a collection of the sayings of the Prophet, the paper said. Sudan's Ministry of Animal Resources has claimed there is no sign of Rift Valley Fever among livestock, despite the confirmed human cases.
