<TITLE> Kosovo election favourite promises independence </TITLE>

 Pristina, Serbia, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Front-runner Hashim Thaci pledged independence for Kosovo on Saturday as the breakaway province voted for a new parliament in an election shunned by Serbs bitterly opposed to its secession. Turnout was also weak among Albanians, who have grown suspicious of political parties and unfulfilled promises of jobs and economic development. By 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), 24 percent of the 1.5 million eligible voters had cast ballots. "These elections are not about Kosovo's status," Thaci, a former guerrilla fighter who is favourite to become the new prime minister, said after casting his ballot. "We will declare independence immediately after Dec. 10." That is the date for a report by Russian, United States and European Union mediators on last-ditch talks in search of a compromise between Serbia and Kosovo's 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority. There is still no glimmer of a deal, with two negotiating sessions set for Brussels and Vienna in the coming week. The OSCE said turnout among Kosovo's small Serb minority was predictably minimal, after Serb leaders in Belgrade warned voters not to legitimise a "secessionist" parliament. Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku, a former guerrilla commander who does not have a party of his own, is stepping down. Thaci, who leads the Democratic Party of Kosovo, is a narrow favourite to succeed him, according to opinion polls. Whatever the result, all four main parties have committed to unilaterally declare an independent republic. Diplomats expect it to come within weeks, not days, of the mediators' report, despite Thaci's rhetoric. If he wins, Thaci would still have to form a coalition, possibly with the Democratic League of Kosovo of the late independence icon Ibrahim Rugova. They would hope to create a new government before the mediators hand in their report. NO HAGGLING, PLEASE Even then, Kosovo has promised its Western backers in Washington and Brussels that it will coordinate its declaration with the major powers from whom it expects quick recognition. In a parting admonition to Kosovo's often squabbling politicians, Ceku warned they would inflict "serious damage" on the historic independence process if they spent weeks haggling instead of getting the new government ready for action. On the eve of the vote, a petrol bomb was thrown at the home of a Serb candidate for the Kosovo parliament, who had defied Belgrade's boycott call. Police said no one was hurt. "Anyone who votes is a traitor," said Serb Misko Mitrovic in the Serb stronghold of northern Mitrovica. "Whoever votes has given up on his people." Serbia's ally Russia has blocked a Western-endorsed proposal for EU-supervised independence in the U.N. Security Council. But plans for the EU mission in Kosovo are going ahead. EU mediator Wolfgang Ischinger sees no hope of agreement on status. At talks on Tuesday in Brussels he may propose that Serbs and Albanians sign a deal that ignores the issue. But even that has already been ruled out by Serbia. Kosovo guerrillas took up arms in 1998 to end a decade of repression under late Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic, whose brutal response put almost 1 million civilians to flight, triggering NATO intervention in 1999 and an era of UN control. The election for the 120-seat Kosovo parliament is the third since then. The campaign was dominated by party pledges to tackle 60 percent unemployment, minimal foreign investment and rampant corruption. The bid for statehood was never in question. Polling stations were due to close at 1800 GMT.
