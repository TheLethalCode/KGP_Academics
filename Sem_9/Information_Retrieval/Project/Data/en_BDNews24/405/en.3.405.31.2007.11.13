<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is set for a recall when India's selectors choose a 15-man squad on Wednesday for the first two tests against Pakistan. Harbhajan, 27, was dropped from the test and one-day teams after the World Cup in March due to a slump in form and missed the test series win in England. However, he has staged a one-day comeback following his efforts during the Twenty20 World Cup triumph in September. "Harbhajan will be back," a national selector told Reuters on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. Leg spinner Anil Kumble, the third highest test wicket-taker, will take over as captain for the three-test series starting in New Delhi on Nov 22. Harbhajan bowled sharply on his one-day comeback in the 4-2 home series defeat against Australia last month and has helped India take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series against Pakistan. In-form Delhi batsman Gautam Gambhir is bidding for an opener's slot with Dinesh Karthik, who had partnered Wasim Jaffer with some success during the 1-0 test series win in England. The selectors are also expected to discuss the workload of the new ball bowlers with India due to begin the tough tour of Australia in December
