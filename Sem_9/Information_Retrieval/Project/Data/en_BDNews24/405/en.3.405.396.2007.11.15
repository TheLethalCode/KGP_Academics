 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks slipped on Thursday, led by declines in financial shares as nervousness about bank losses and credit market problems persisted. A weak outlook from J.C. Penney Co. Inc. added to the early weaker tone. Shares of General Electric Co declined 0.9 percent to $38.68 after it said its short-term bond fund ran into trouble amid losses on asset-backed securities and that all its outside investors have liquidated their holdings. Barclays Plc, Britain's third-biggest bank, unveiled a 1.3 billion pound ($2.7 billion) write-down on its exposure to credit market problems. Its shares fell about 1 percent in Europe. J.C. Penney shares declined 2 percent to $45.84 after the retailer slashed its fourth-quarter profit outlook by at least 25 percent. For details, see ID:nWNAS2594.

The Dow Jones industrial average was down 47.64 points, or 0.36 percent, at 13,183.37. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 7.20 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,463.38.
