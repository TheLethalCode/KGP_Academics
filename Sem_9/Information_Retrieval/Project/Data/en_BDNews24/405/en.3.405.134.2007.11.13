<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia Tuesday threatened to take legal action against the Election Commission if it did not scrap the invitation of Hafizuddin Ahmed to dialogue. Barrister Nowshad Zamir, lawyer for Khaleda, sent a legal notice to the main poll office asking it to withdraw the invitation letter in 48 hours. The BNP chairperson expelled Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan from the party as secretary general, a day before she was arrested in a graft case in September. Khaleda also installed Khandaker Delwar Hossain as new secretary generala decision which was conveyed to the Election Commission by acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. The legal notice said that the letter had asked the EC to invite Delwar to any talks on electoral reforms. According to the legal notice, the High Court issued a rule nisi asking the EC to explain why the BNP's constitution would not be complied with in bringing changes to the party and making other decisions. The notice claimed that Khaleda was the only person to sack or appoint secretary general to the party in line with the constitution. "It means Khandaker Delwar Hossain has been entrusted to represent BNP in dialogue with the Election Commission," the notice said. The Election Commission invited Hafizuddin on Nov 5 to the talks in what the notice said was a rushed move. The EC described the move as a doctrine of necessity. "This doctrine outlived its validity," the notice said. The BNP's standing committee at a meeting on Oct 29 installed former finance minister M Saifur Rahman as acting chief of the troubled party and Hafizuddin as acting secretary general. The move deepened the crisis in the party as the Delwar-led faction did not endorse the decision saying "it was done without consent of Khaleda and in violations of the party constitution". bd
