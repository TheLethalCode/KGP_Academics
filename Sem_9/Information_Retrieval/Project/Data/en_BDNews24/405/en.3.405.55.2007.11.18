 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  United States president George Bush and first lady Laura Bush extended condolences to the survivors of cyclone Sidr, the White House said in a statement Saturday. The US first couple's statement of sympathy highlighted "especially those who have lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods in this tragedy". The US government provided an initial $2.1 million emergency relief contribution and were "assessing critical needs to see where... [their] assistance can be most effective," the statement said. Two US naval vessels, the USS Essex and the USS Kearsarge, were on their way to Bangladesh to help in relief operations, according to the release. The White House statement said USAID would airlift 35 tonnes of non-food items including plastic sheeting, jerricans and hygiene kits to Bangladesh. The statement added that an 18-member US department of defense medical team that was already in Bangladesh before the cyclone would help with current medical needs. The statement said the US government was "committed to helping the people of Bangladesh and their government" in the aftermath of Sidr. bd
