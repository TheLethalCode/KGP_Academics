 NEW DELHI, Thu Nov 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, who owns the world's largest steel group, Arcelor Mittal, tops the list of Indian billionaires with a staggering $51 billion, Forbes magazine said on Thursday. A bull run in Indian markets ensured Mukesh Ambani who heads top private firm Reliance Industries ran a close second to London-based Mittal with a personal fortune of $49 billion. Local media reported recently that Mukesh bought his wife a $60 million luxury Airbus jet with entertainment cabins, a sky bar and fancy showers for her birthday.
