 NEW DELHI, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hindu nationalists are likely to return to power in the riot-scarred western Indian state of Gujarat in elections next month for a fourth time, a survey said on Thursday, although with a reduced majority. Gujarat, scene of deadly Hindu-Muslim riots five years ago, votes on Dec. 11 and 16 to elect a new state assembly. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to win 100 of the 182 seats in its assembly, the opinion poll published in the Indian Express newspaper said. The BJP, which is in the opposition nationally, is hoping that victory in Gujarat would mark a turning point for it political fortunes ahead of at least 10 state elections next year and possible early national polls. But the party could not be complacent in the run-up to the Gujarat polls as its vote share had come down from the previous election in 2002 when it won 127 seats despite the state witnessing some of India's worst religious riots earlier that year, it said. About 2,500 people, mostly Muslims, were feared to have been killed in Gujarat in 2002 and Chief Minister Narendra Modi was accused of turning a blind eye while Hindu mobs burned, stabbed and beat Muslims to death. "His popularity rating is high and so is the satisfaction level with his government," the report of the survey, conducted by the New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, said. "As of now, at the starting point of the race, his party is the front-runner," it said. "Yet something is amiss. He is more vulnerable than what these numbers show." The fall in the BJP's vote share, the survey said, could be due to a change in its regional caste support base and the popularity of the nationally ruling Congress party -- expected to win 76 seats against 51 in 2002 -- among poor voters. The 2002 riots erupted after a suspected Muslim mob set fire to a train carrying Hindu pilgrims in the state, killing 59 people. Modi says his administration did all it could to stop the violence. Although few Muslim victims have got justice or have been properly rehabilitated, Modi has tried to put the riots behind and focus on development and growth in one of India's most industrialised states. And that seems to have worked with the state's majority Hindu community which is known for its business acumen, the survey said. "Ironically, the very issue that makes this election special for a large number of democrats within and outside India appears to be a non-issue within the state," it said. "An average Gujarati wishes to forget 2002 riots as a bad dream that must not recur, without taking or assigning any responsibility for what happened.
