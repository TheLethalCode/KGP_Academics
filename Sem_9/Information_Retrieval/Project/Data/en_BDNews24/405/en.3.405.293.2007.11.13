 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Millions of dollars worth of exports have been put at risk due to the vulnerability of the optical fibre cable which now connects most businesses to their overseas clients. The cable was severed again early Tuesday, 40km from Chiringa in Cox's Bazar, said the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. BTTB officials suspected that a business cartel was involved in the latest incident, which followed three separate disconnections Monday midnight in Sitakundu. The 437km long cable runs from Cox's Bazar to Dhaka and has now been cut off 22 timesarguably 27 timessince it was installed in May 2006. The cable was cut off eight times "intentionally", with the remaining disconnections due to careless handling while the project was being developed, landslides and road accidents, according to the BTTB. The BGMEA, a trade body for the readymade garments industry, said industry export earnings worth $9.2 billion a year were being put at risk. According to the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), export earnings for the IT sector stood at $30 million in 2006. The foreign communications of the two sectorsIT and garmentsare now almost solely internet based, and business leaders have complained that their image is threatened when they fail to contact their clients on time. BGMEA president Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez told bdnews24.com by phone: "Any type of disruption such as this tarnishes our image." "A lot of work orders have been cancelled because we failed to contact our foreign buyers on time. Other countries then get the orders," Parvez said. The BGMEA leader added that some work orders require a bidding process through the internet: "In these cases only a couple of hours are given to put your bid in." Lieutenant colonel Zia Safdar, general manager (security and surveillance) for the BTTB, told bdnews24.com that the cuts had been done intentionally. "The BTTB is facing huge losses due to this, although communications were not completely snapped this time. I suspect illegal businesses are doing this for their own benefit," said Safdar. BTTB's security and surveillance chief said the government has taken the matter seriously: "Law enforcers, including several intelligence organisations and the joint forces are all working on it." Safdar reported that the joint forces are intending to submit a report as soon as their investigations have been completed. Armed members of the Ansars and other guards have been appointed to maintain the cable, he said. Safdar also said an initiative was under way to set up an alternative cable with the help of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. "It will be in operation soon and will allow communications to continue if the cable is cut off. The capacity of the microwave connection would also be increased," he said. Currently, BTTB has 26,500 internet subscribers as well as many internet service providers as clients who also use the submarine cable. bdnews24.c
