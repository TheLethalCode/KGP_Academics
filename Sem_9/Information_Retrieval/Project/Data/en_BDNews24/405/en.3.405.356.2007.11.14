<TITLE> UN's Ban to visit Lebanon 'very soon' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will soon pay a visit to Lebanon, embroiled in a crisis over the election of its next president, a UN spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Spokeswoman Marie Okabe said Ban would go there "very soon" but gave no further details. Earlier, Lebanese political sources said the UN chief would visit the country on Thursday to urge politicians to hold the election on time. The Lebanese parliament is due to elect a new president next week to replace pro-Syrian Emile Lahoud but a political standoff between the anti-Syrian government and pro-Syrian opposition has already delayed the vote three times. The Nov 21 vote is now critical because Lahoud's term ends on Nov. 23 and there are fears of political chaos if a successor is not chosen on time. In a report for the Security Council last month, Ban said a fair election without foreign interference was vital and voiced concern that Lebanese militias were arming to prepare for a "constitutional void" if there was no deal on a president. bd
