 PRISTINA, Serbia, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mediators see no hope of agreement between Serbs and ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future status and will propose instead a deal that ignores the issue of independence, the EU envoy was quoted as saying. Wolfgang Ischinger said all proposals presented so far had been rejected by Serbia and leaders of Kosovo's pro-independence Albanians, Kosovo and Serbian television reported on Wednesday, both quoting a Voice of America report. They said the German diplomat and his mediating partners from the United States and Russia were seeking approval from their capitals to present a "status-neutral" agreement to regulate relations regardless of Kosovo's future status. Ischinger was speaking to journalists in Washington late on Tuesday, they said. The report topped Serb and Kosovo afternoon news bulletins. Ischinger said the proposal would regulate economic cooperation, trade and the fight against crime but nothing about status. Mediators would see how the two sides reacted to the proposal. The mediating "troika", which began a fresh round of talks on Kosovo at the end of August, has until Dec. 10 to report back to the United Nations. Leaders of Serbia and Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian majority are due to meet again in Brussels on Nov. 20, before an expected make-or-break encounter at the end of the month. Serbia has offered broad autonomy, but the Kosovo Albanians say they will accept nothing less than independence, eight years after NATO went to war to halt Serb atrocities during a counter-insurgency war and the United Nations took control. Kosovo Albanian leaders, heading into a parliamentary election on Saturday, have threatened to declare independence and seek recognition from Western powers once talks end.
