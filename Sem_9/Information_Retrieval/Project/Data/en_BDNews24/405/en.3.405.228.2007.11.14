<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India off spinner Harbhajan Singh has been handed a test recall after selectors included him in the 14-player squad announced on Wednesday for the first two tests against Pakistan. The 27-year-old was dropped from the test and one-day teams after the World Cup in March due to poor form and missed the test series win in England that concluded in August. However, Harbhajan earned a recall to the one-day side after helping India win the Twenty20 World Cup in September and his strong recent performances have impressed the test selectors. Harbhajan replaced off spinner Ramesh Powar in the team, which has left-armer Murali Kartik as an extra specialist spinner after he did well on his one-day return in October. The first game in the three-test series starts in New Delhi on Nov. 22. The hosts have chosen three spinners and three medium-pacers in the squad, captained by veteran leg spinner Anil Kumble who succeeds Rahul Dravid after the batsman quit the post in September. Wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was appointed vice captain, a sign the one-day and Twenty20 skipper will take over as test captain in the future. Dinesh Karthik, who partnered opener Wasim Jaffer with some success during the 1-0 test series win in England, was chosen ahead of in-form Delhi batsman Gautam Gambhir, while Virender Sehwag, the country's only test triple centurion, is still waiting for a recall. Squad: Anil Kumble (captain), Wasim Jaffer, Dinesh Karthik, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Vangipurappu Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Murali Kartik
