 CENTURION, South Africa, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand opening batsman Craig Cumming underwent a successful operation in Johannesburg on Friday to repair broken bones in his face. Cumming sustained a depressed fracture of the cheekbone and a broken jaw when he was felled by a bouncer from South African fast bowler Dale Steyn on the first day of the second test in Centurion on Friday. "He was operated on last night, and several plates were inserted into his face in the cheek and jaw area," New Zealand team manager Lindsay Crocker told reporters on Saturday. Crocker said Cumming, who is diabetic, was kept in intensive care overnight for observation. Cumming's doctors were satisfied with his condition, Crocker said. "He's come through it pretty well," Crocker said. "He was a bit of a mess but his surgeons are happy with the work they've done." Crocker said Cumming would stay in hospital until Sunday or Monday and that he would not be fit to travel back to New Zealand for approximately a week
