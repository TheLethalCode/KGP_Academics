 London, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose above $95 on Friday as traders consolidated their positions ahead of the expiry of the December contract. U.S. crude for December , which expires at the close of trading on Friday, briefly surged by more than $2. By 1446 GMT, the contract traded up $1.84 at $95.27 a barrel. London Brent crude for January rose $1.35 at $91.58. "The jump in prices is linked to expiry. The remaining open interest in December futures is above normal," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. Oil stands about 4 percent below the record high of $98.62 a barrel achieved on Nov. 7. Prices clawed back their losses from Thursday as traders scrutinised the details of the unexpected 2.8 million-barrel increase in U.S. crude inventories. Analysts had predicted a decline of 800,000 barrels. "A rebound in U.S. crude stocks, due in part to a one-off backlog of imports, was... less bearish than it appeared," said Fimat energy analyst Antoine Halff. Some analysts said the prospect for tightening winter fuel conditions would keep prices supported. "Losses will be limited unless there is extra OPEC supply," said Gerard Rigby of Fuel First Consulting in Sydney. OPEC will not discuss output levels at a heads of state meeting on Nov. 17-18, but officials said it will be on the agenda at the group's next policy meeting on Dec. 5 in Abu Dhabi. Iran's oil minister said it was too early to say what action OPEC might take at next month's meeting. Concerns high prices and economic problems in the United States might hit consumption growth helped halt oil's record rally, as the U.S. data showed a 0.7 percent dip in demand over the last four weeks, compared with a year ago. OPEC on Thursday lowered its world oil demand growth forecast for the fourth quarter of this year partly due to the U.S economic problems, a downgrade that came just days after the International Energy Agency (IEA) slashed its demand outlook. "There are some concerns on the strength of oil demand growth going forward in this price environment," said Mike Wittner, global head of oil research at Societe Generale. "But for the time being, those concerns are being offset by the fact that it's mid-November and we haven't started the winter yet." Oil prices have surged nearly 40 percent since mid-August, as worries about winter supplies, the weakening dollar and geopolitical tensions drew fresh speculative investment
