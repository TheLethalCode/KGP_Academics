<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  At least 120 people died in an outlying village in the southern district of Barguna, ravaged by the mega-cyclone Sidr, witnesses said. The district's Naltona Union Parishad chairman Sultan Mahmud told bdnews24.com that he had supervised burial rites for the 120 villagers. He said a further 300 people went missing after the cyclone struck the village. The village was hit by the tidal waves that surged 10-15 feet. The heavy rush of water fractured the 5km flood defence embankment. Sultan said no relief had reached his area yet. "People will simply die if relief does not arrive in my village in the next 24 hours," he said. bdne
