 CARACAS, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Tuesday proposed OPEC finance social development programs for poor countries and boost activity in geopolitics, seeking to put his self-styled socialist revolution on the global stage. The proposals appear to be similar to the anti-US leader's strategy of using oil revenues to fight poverty and help poor nations cope with soaring fuel bills as oil prices approach $100 per barrel. Chavez said at the upcoming OPEC heads-of-state meeting in Riyadh, Venezuela will offer a raft of proposals including helping protect fuel-strapped nations from high oil prices and creating a new system for global oil pricing. "(OPEC should) go beyond just energy; it should have the appearance of politics -- even more so given the context in which this summit will take place," Chavez said during a press conference with foreign correspondents. OPEC should work to maintain prices near $100 per barrel "for several years," Chavez said. "If the United States decides to invade Iran, oil will not just reach $100 per barrel, it will reach $200 per barrel," he added, in reference to rumors over a possible US strike on the Islamic country. But he said that Venezuela wants to create "protection mechanisms so that the price of oil at $100 does not turn into a destructive bomb for weak economies." "A great alliance of OPEC nations ... (should) direct a part of that oil income to intense programs for literacy, health, education and housing," he said. The leftist leader has maintained a strong political base by spending oil revenue on the poor majority, and has proposed a constitutional reform to scrap presidential term limits that is expected to be approved in a Dec. 2 referendum. This year he launched a broad nationalization campaign, taking control of four multibillion-dollar oil projects and parts of the electricity and telecommunications sectors as part of a drive to create a socialist state. NEW OIL BENCHMARK PRICE Chavez added that Venezuela would propose changes in global crude oil pricing at the upcoming meeting, insisting West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is no longer an appropriate global benchmark. "One of the ideas that we are taking to the (OPEC) meeting is that we change the methods of measuring the price of oil," he said, without providing details other than to say the system would not involve price bands. "WTI is a very, very, very small proportion if we compare it to the global daily production of oil ... so it is not the best indicator." Oil traders are closely watching statements by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ahead of the gathering in Saudi Arabia for clues to the political will for a possible output hike that could ease pressure on prices. Venezuela is a major oil supplier to the United States and holds some of the largest reserves outside of the Middle East. The main international benchmark prices for crude have been close to $100 this month. "It's not OPEC's fault," said Chavez, a price hawk in the exporting group. "It's always been the tradition for the large consuming nations to make OPEC the devil, to blame OPE
