<TITLE> Striking French workers fight Sarkozy reforms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striking French transport and energy workers caused widespread disruption for the second time in a month on Wednesday in a protest over pensions that is the biggest test yet of President Nicolas Sarkozy's reform drive. Train services were disrupted and energy production capacity was reduced, but there were signs the stoppage might come to a swift end after unions and the government agreed a compromise over negotiating methods. "The president thinks there is a chance for the spirit of responsibility to find a way out of the conflict," said presidential spokesman David Martinon. Sarkozy has broad public support for the reform which aims to bring generous pension provisions for about 500,000 public sector workers in line with those of all other workers ahead of a general pension reform next year. The streets of Paris were heaving with mopeds, bikes, cars and pedestrians from before dawn as the capital tried to get to work without its usually efficient metro and bus system. "I have nurses, carers and other workers who do a very hard job and they don't have special pensions," said Gerard Alaux, a nursing home owner who was walking 6 km (around 4 miles) to work because his metro line was not working. "We can't avoid pension reform in this day and age." Only a handful of trains were scheduled to run on Wednesday and Paris's transport system operated reduced services. But some lines were less affected than predicted and the SNCF rail operator said worker participation was at 61.5 percent, down from 73.5 percent on Oct. 18. Eurostar, which switched London stations to St Pancras from Waterloo for the first time on Wednesday, was running as normal. Striking energy workers cut about 12 percent of production capacity at EDF nuclear plants and blocked ships and gas input into the network at the Fos-sur-Mer gas terminal. COMPROMISE Sarkozy has said repeatedly he will not back down on his plan to end the "special regimes" that were introduced last century to allow workers with arduous jobs to retire after 37.5 years of pension contributions compared to 40 years for others. Most unions have also stood firm, promising open-ended strikes and raising the prospect that the disruption could drag into next week when civil servants are due to stage a 24-hour stoppage to protest at state sectorjob cuts. But both sides indicated on Wednesday they did not want the conflict to last; union and government comments seemed to point to a solution. Sarkozy accepted a negotiating plan put forward on Tuesday by Bernard Thibault, the head of the most powerful CGT union. "Bernard Thibault has made it possible to untangle this crisis as of the first day of the conflict," Claude Gueant, a senior Sarkozy aide told Le Monde daily. Thibault said he would accept company-by-company negotiations with management and government representatives, backing down from his earlier demand for national talks. Other union leaders, who met with Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand on Wednesday, were also ready for talks. "Even the CGT seems ready to negotiate, let's not waste any time, this morning if possible, let's negotiate," said Jacques Voisin, head of the CFTC union after meeting Bertrand. The strikes are also being seen as a test of union strength. Only around 8 percent of workers belong to a union and membership has fallen in recent years so they do not want to alienate members who do not benefit from the special pensio
