 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka Thursday rejected appeals to remand Tarique Rahman in custody for questioning in two extortion cases. The court, however, allowed investigators to question detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son at jail gate. Police took Tarique to court at noon and the investigation officers appealed to remand him for 14 days, seven days for each case filed with Dhanmondi and Gulshan police stations. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sultan Mahmud's court first heard the case filed with Dhanmondi Police Station by contractor Mir Zahir Hossain. Another additional chief metropolitan magistrate, Shawkat Ali Chowdhury, heard the other extortion case filed with Gulshan Police Station by contractor Aftabuddin. Tarique's lawyers appealed to the magistrates to reject both petitions. On hearing the cases for one and a half hours, the judges turned down the remand requests but permitted the investigating officers to quiz him at jail gate. During the first hearing, magistrate Sultan Mahmud also allowed seven lawyers to talk to Tarique in the dock. bdnews24.c
