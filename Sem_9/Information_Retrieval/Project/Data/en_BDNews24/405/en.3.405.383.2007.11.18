<TITLE> China "blacklists" 10 substandard cosmetic products </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has "blacklisted" 10 domestically made cosmetics, saying they contained chemicals that could cause the skin to atrophy, become discoloured and be susceptible to disease, state media reported on Sunday. In the latest crackdown on product quality, the Ministry of Health targeted nine types of lotions, gems, anti-allergy essence and masks produced by the Guangzhou Shimei Cosmetics Co Ltd and an anti-allergy moisture mask produced by Gelamei Cosmetic Co Ltd, both based in Guangdong Province, Xinhua news agency said. The report did not say what was involved in a blacklist designation or whether any recalls of the products were required. It also did not say whether any of the products had been exported. The notice said cosmetics containing dexamethasone, or "skin opium", initially make the skin seem improved but over time can make the skin atrophy, become thin and dark, and lead to skin diseases. After customers stop using the products, their skin usually becomes dry and develops rashes, the notice said. After a series of disclosures involving unsafe or substandard China-made products ranging from toys to pet food to tooth paste, Beijing has publicised efforts to improve quality and safety of products for export as well as for products sold domestically.
