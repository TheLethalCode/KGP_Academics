 UNITED NATIONS, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has nominated Canadian prosecutor Daniel Bellemare to lead the UN investigation into the 2005 killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. In a letter to the UN Security Council made public on Tuesday, Ban said he planned to appoint Bellemare, a former Deputy Attorney General of Canada, to succeed Belgium's Serge Brammertz as the next commissioner in the probe. In a separate letter to the Security Council also made public on Tuesday, he said he was nominating Brammertz to succeed Carla del Ponte as prosecutor of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia from the start of next year, as expected.
