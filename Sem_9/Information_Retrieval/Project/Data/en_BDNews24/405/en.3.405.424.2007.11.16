 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities of Signage, Mega Vision and Adcomm Thursday rejected charges against businessman Nazim Kamran Choudhury, who allegedly grabbed a building in Gulshan. Farhana Islam, the owner of the building, filed a case against Nazim Kamran, husband of industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury, and eight others Wednesday on charges of staying in the building even after a house rental agreement expired. Farhana also alleged that Nazim Kamran and his men beat her with iron rods when they made a bid to "usurp the property". A statement signed by company director Abu Rushd Tarek said: "We would like to clarify that Signage, Mega Vision and Adcomm for the last five years have been tenants of the premises located at House 7A, Road 41, Gulshan. We have been paying our rent regularly including that of November. Since other tenants are also using the house the question of grabbing the building does not arise." The statement said the landlord was trying to smear their reputation. "In a press conference on Oct 25 they have charged us with fabricated, false, ill-motivated and intentionally incorrect accusations," the statement said. "In light of this unacceptable and unsubstantiated action we served them a legal notice on Oct 31, 2007. Unfortunately they attempted to bring us disrepute and filed a case against us with the CMM's Court." bd
