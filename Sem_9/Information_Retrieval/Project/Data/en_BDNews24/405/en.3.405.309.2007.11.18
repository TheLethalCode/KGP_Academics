 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  US charg d' affaires in Dhaka Geeta Pasi Sunday said the two US Navy ships would be in Bangladesh to facilitate rescue work in the cyclone-ravaged south. "The ships are coming as part of a series of military exercises with Bangladesh," she told reporters after a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his office. "But we're going to deploy the ships for immediate post-cyclone recovery work," the US embassy chief said. "The ships will provide logistics support to facilitate the work." The USS Essex and USS Kearsarge, each carrying helicopters, hovercraft and equipped with hospital facilities, have been dispatched, pending a formal request for help from the Bangladesh authorities, Bloomberg news agency quoted Major David Griesmer, spokesman for the US Pacific Command in Hawaii, as saying. "More ships may be made available once Bangladeshi officials know what they need," he said. But foreign ministry officials here said they ere not aware of the development. Super cyclone SIDR packing winds of 250 kph slammed into the Khulna-Barisal coast Thursday evening, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. Thousands of lives are feared to be lost. Pasi said the White House offered condolences Saturday evening to victims of the deadly cyclone in Bangladesh. She added that the US government had provided an initial $2.1 million in emergency relief aid. "President and Mrs Bush have offered condolences to the victims of cyclone SIDR, especially those who have lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods in this tragedy," the White House said in a statement. Pasi said the US was committed to helping the victims of Bangladesh and their government as they face the many challenges of rebuilding and recovering. "We've identified that food items, including rice and edible oil and non-food items such as blanket, plastic sheeting, hygiene kits and other supplies are needed for Bangladesh urgently," the US embassy official said. Replying to a query, Iftekhar said the government had not made a formal appeal for foreign aid for the cyclone victims. But he added: "We welcome help from our friendly countries." bd
