 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)--A woman Wednesday sued businessman Nazim Kamran Choudhury, husband of industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury, and eight others on charges of land grab and physical harassment. Updates with quotes from Geeteara's brother Farhana Islam, wife of Dr Mahbubul Islam, filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Among the accused, Abu Rushd Tarek, younger brother of the caretaker adviser, said the case was designed to defame them. Farhana attached with the case documents a medical certificate as a "proof of physical harassment". The others named in the case are Shamsun Nahar Tarek, Mukim Choudhury, Shakhawat Hossain Shahadat, Adit Bhagat, Ripon, Bipul and Yaar Ali. According to case details, Nazim Kamran had illegally stayed in Farhana's building in Gulshan-2, which houses his businesses, even after the house rental agreement had expired. Farhana also alleged that Nazim Kamran and his men beat her with iron rods and tugged at her sari when they made a bid to "usurp the property" on Oct 22. Tarek told bdnews24.com Wednesday: "We served a legal notice on them (Farhana and her husband) on Oct 31 and the case might come as a backlash." Tarek claimed that Farhana and her husband made "false and baseless" statements against them from a press conference on Oct 25. "They told reporters that we had harassed and manhandled Dr Islam and his wife. Our legal notice was served after those false allegations," he added. Tarek threatened to file a defamation suit against the couple. bdnews24.com/
