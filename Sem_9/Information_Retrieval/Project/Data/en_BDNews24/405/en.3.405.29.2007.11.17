 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Residents of the capital's Dhanmondi area face a possible one-week wait for a full restoration of their power supply after two sub-stations in the area failed in the wake of Thursday's mega-cyclone. "It will take at least five days to repair the damaged sub-stations," Brig-Gen Nazrul Hasan, chairman of Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, told reporters Saturday. "We're currently providing a partial supply of electricity in the area, using alternative methods," Hasan said. Tropical cyclone Sidr devastated large parts of the country Thursday, taking out power plants and vital power transmission and distribution lines in its wake. Much of the country experienced total power outages Friday after hurricane winds recorded at up to 223kmph. Two 132/33 KV power transformer's were damaged in Dhanmondi. "Residents in Dhanmondi may have to suffer for five-to-six days," Hasan told reporters, adding: "We're trying our best to re-establish services as soon as possible." According to DESA, some 230 11-KV feeders out of 379 failed in Dhaka, while 27 33-KV feeders out of 65 went down, with seven sub-stations failing due to the cyclone. Collapsing electric poles and towers were the main reason behind the widespread power failures, officials said. According to Rural Electrification Board figures, 29 Samity (associations) out of 70 in the country were damaged by the cyclone, with some 1,722 electric poles and 700km of cable damaged. bd
