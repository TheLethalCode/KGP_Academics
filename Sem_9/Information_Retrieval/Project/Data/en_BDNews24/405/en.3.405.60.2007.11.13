 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Oman is keen to invest in fertiliser production in Bangladesh, said FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain after his three-day visit to explore the economic and trade opportunities available in Oman. Hossain said that the southwest Asian country also wanted to import skilled and semi-skilled manpower from Bangladesh. "But, we've asked Omani investors to take the immense potential in Bangladesh's power and pharmaceutical sectors," Hossain told bdnews24.com. He led a 27-member business delegation that held talks with government officials and private sector people in Oman. "The pharmaceutical sector is our strength as we have patents for drug manufacturing up to 2016 though most of the countries of the world are not being allowed to manufacture patented drugs since 2005," Hossain said. "We've told them that an excellent opportunity exists in Bangladesh for foreign investors who want to go for bulk drug manufacturing," he said. According to FBCCI, Bangladesh's exports medicines and pharmaceutical products to over 68 countries with the market estimated at around $600 million and an annual double-digit growth rate. Mir Nasir also asked Omani investors to invest in the country's power sector that he said has lot of potential for investments. The FBCCI president also explained the workings of the manufacturing sector of Bangladesh. He said that Bangladesh manufactures around 191 products. "Our ceramic industry has got world class reputation. We have jute and leather products and a lot of other things to offer the Omani market. This market is a strong market having a strong purchasing power," Hossain told bdnews24.com. This is the first trade delegation to visit Oman following establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago. A MoU was signed between the private sectors of the two countries in 2002, but no trade visits took place. On manpower export from Bangladesh, Hossain said that more than 150,000 Bangladeshi workers were contributing to the Oman economy. Around nine million out of 140 million people in Bangladesh have been working abroad. "We can also provide trained skilled workforce, including doctors, engineers and professors," he said. bd
