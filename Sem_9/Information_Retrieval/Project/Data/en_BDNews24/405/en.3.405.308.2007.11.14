 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission Wednesday answered Khaleda Zia's legal notice and said it would not go back on the invitation to acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed to join the reforms dialogue. Khaleda, the detained BNP chief, served a legal notice Tuesday on the EC, asking it to withdraw the invitation of Hafizuddin within 48 hours. She threatened to take legal action against the Election Commission if it did not scrap the invitation of Hafizuddin Ahmed to dialogue. "We have responded to the legal notice of Khaleda Zia today," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters at the EC secretariat. Asked what the commission's response to the notice was, the CEC said, "We haven't moved from our position." The Election Commission would not scrap the decision to invite Hafizuddin, Huda added. He said they would accept the verdict of the court on a petition on which faction of BNP should be invited to the dialogue slated for Nov 22. The top polls office has had talks with the Awami League and other parties as part of a series of meetings with the political parties on electoral reforms. The BNP's policymaking standing committee at a meeting on Oct 29 installed former finance minister M Saifur Rahman as acting chief of the troubled party and Hafizuddin as acting secretary general. The Election Commission on Nov 5 invited Hafizuddin to the talks on the "doctrine of necessity". The move deepened the crisis in the party as the deposed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain-led faction did not endorse the decision. They said "it was done without consent of Khaleda and in violations of the party constitution" and petitioned to the High Court for the legal right to represent the beleaguered party. The BNP chairperson expelled Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan from the party as secretary general, a day before she was arrested in a graft case in September. Khaleda also installed Khandaker Delwar Hossain as new secretary generala decision which was conveyed to the Election Commission by acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. The legal notice said that the letter had asked the EC to invite Delwar to any talks on electoral reforms. According to the legal notice, the High Court issued a rule nisi asking the EC to explain why the BNP's constitution would not be complied with in bringing changes to the party and making other decisions. The notice claimed that Khaleda was the only person to sack or appoint secretary general to the party in line with the constitution. "It means Khandaker Delwar Hossain has been entrusted to represent BNP in dialogue with the Election Commission," the notice said. bdnew
