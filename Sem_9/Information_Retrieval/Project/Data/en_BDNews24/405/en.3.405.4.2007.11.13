 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--The Committee on Strengthening Local Government Institutions has recommended a five-tier local government free of lawmaker and outsider influence, according to a report submitted to the chief adviser Tuesday. The committee also proposed reservation of 40 percent seats for women for 15 years instead of the existing 30 percent. After 15 years, which means three terms, reservations will cease to exist and women will contest elections. After about five months of work, the committee headed by former secretary Shawkat Ali presented its recommendations to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his office. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal was present. In a press briefing in his office, Anwarul Iqbal said that under the proposed structure, the local government system had been split into five tiers: Union Parishad, Municipality, City Corporation, Upazila Parishad and Zila Parishad. In line with a recommendation, anyone sentenced to more than six months will be ineligible for elections for five years. Any loan defaulter to government, a full-time or part-time teacher or anyone proved guilty under electoral laws will not be able to contest elections. Anyone declared a fugitive will also not be able to take part in elections. Election expenditure limits have also been mentioned. Expenses will run from Tk 20,000 for Union Parishad members to Tk 5 lakh for the Dhaka city mayoral candidates at the highest. The adviser further said the number of Pourashavas was 309. "Many of the Pourashavas were created out of political consideration. Those Pourashavas not meeting the criteria will cease to exist. The work to identify those Pourashavas would begin this month," Iqbal added. The designation of municipal chairman and municipal commissioners have been proposed as municipal mayor and municipal councillor. The committee recommended that six city corporations now governed by as many separate laws should be brought under a unified law. In the report was proposed the creation of a local government commission, which will determine the projects to be undertaken centrally. Iqbal said: "The chief adviser consented to the recommendations." bdnew
