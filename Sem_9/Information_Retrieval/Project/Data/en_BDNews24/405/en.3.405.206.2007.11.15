<TITLE> China set to get first judge on WTO's top court </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China is set to get its first judge on the World Trade Organisation's highest court, which will also for the first time include three women, diplomats and officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Chinese lawyer Yuejiao Zhang is slated to be named on Monday to the seven-member WTO Appellate Body, which issues rulings in trade disputes that can be worth billions of dollars, including cases between China and the United States. Jennifer Hillman of the United States, Lilia Bautista of the Philippines and Shotaro Oshima of Japan were also endorsed by a WTO selection committee to fill the four soon-to-be-vacant spots on the dispute board. They are expected to be officially selected at a meeting on Monday at the WTO, where any of the trade body's 151 member states have the right to veto their accession. Dispute resolution is the heart of the multilateral trading system, which hinges on countries' adherence to rules on how to treat goods and services crossing borders. WTO member states can seek a ruling on another country's policies that they believe violate international trade rules. Both developed and developing countries have launched disputes in areas including bananas, computer chips and rolled steel. Complaints are reviewed by an expert panel, whose findings may then be appealed to the Appellate Body which can uphold, modify or reverse the conclusions. Countries losing cases at the WTO can be forced to change their laws or face trade sanctions. ECONOMIC TENSIONS WTO disputes are expected to proliferate if diplomats negotiating a new global trade pact, known as the Doha round, fail to produce a deal to smooth trade flows. Several big cases are now underway at the WTO, including fights between Airbus and Boeing over aircraft subsidies. Economic tensions between the United States and China are also playing out at the WTO, where both Washington and Beijing have launched cases against the other on issues including copyright, taxation, car parts, paper and movies and music. Climate change, another sensitive issue for China, which has resisted accepting limits on its explosive economic growth, is also likely to come up before the WTO in coming years. Countries' efforts to subsidise biofuel manufacturers may face litigation if world prices for goods such as ethanol shift as a result, and any penalties imposed on imports from countries with weak carbon emission rules could also be reviewed. "Any trade measure that a government imposes can be challenged at the WTO," said Joost Pauwelyn of the Graduate Institute for International Studies in Geneva. The international law professor said it was critical the WTO's judges be seen as politically neutral, especially given the weighty business and economic issues ahead. Otherwise, he said countries may raise serious questions about the forum's legitimacy to rule on such matters. The WTO says members of its Appellate Body must be recognised authorities with expertise in law, international trade and the subject matter of the various agreements. "They are also required to be unaffiliated with any government and are to be broadly representative of the membership of the WTO," a statement on its Web site reads. If selected on Monday, Hillman and Bautista would join the top court next month, replacing Yasuhei Taniguchi of Japan and Merit Janow of the United States, who was the first woman to serve as WTO appellate judge. Zhang and Oshima would join in June, taking the place of Georges Michel Abi-Saab of Egypt and Arumugamangalam Venkatachalam Ganesan of India. They can serve up to two four-year terms
