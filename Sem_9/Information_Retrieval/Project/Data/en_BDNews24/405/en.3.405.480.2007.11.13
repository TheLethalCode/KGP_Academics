 MANILA, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A lawmaker from the Philippines' restive Muslim region, Wahab Akbar, was the likely target of a fatal explosion at Congress on Tuesday night, Manila's police chief said. "From what we saw, it looks like congressman Akbar was the target of the attack," Geary Barias told local radio. Akbar, the representative for the southern island of Basilan, was reported to have died from his injuries, according to local media, quoting Akbar's chief of staff. His death, if confirmed, would be the second from the explosion, which injured several others.
