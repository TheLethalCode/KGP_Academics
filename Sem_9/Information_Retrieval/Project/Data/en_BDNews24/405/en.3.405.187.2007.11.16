 Srinagar, India, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two soldiers and nine separatist militants were killed on Friday in two separate gun battles near the Pakistan border in Indian Kashmir, an army spokesman said. It was the highest number of people killed in firefights in a single day in the Himalayan region in recent months. "The contacts between soldiers and militants have increased in recent days resulting in fierce encounters," Army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel A.K. Mathur said. The latest gun battles took place in Kupwara district bordering Pakistan, nearly 90 km (55 miles) northwest of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. The clashes between Indian troops and Muslim militants have intensified in recent days in the mountainous region as militants come down to the plains due to the onset of bitter cold weather, officials say. At least 15 militants and four soldiers were killed in separate gun battles last week. Overall militant violence has declined in Kashmir after India and Pakistan, which claim the region in full but rule it in parts, launched a peace process in 2004. Officials say more than 42,000 people have been killed in Kashmir since a revolt against Indian rule erupted in 1989. But human rights groups put the toll at about 60,000.
