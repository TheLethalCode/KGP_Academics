<TITLE> Morning rains waylay Dhakaites </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The approaching cyclonic storm touched off drizzles Wednesday night before they whisperingly turned into steadily tip-tapping soft rains in the capital Thursday morning. Dhaka residents woke up to cloud-covered heavens, shivering slightly as the chill of the drenched November morning touched them furtively. School and office-goers sloshed through the thin rains and muddy sidewalks. The rains spelled fare troubles. Everybody seemed competing to get a ride on the rare rickshaws, auto-rickshaws, taxicabs and busesa usual sight on a rainy day. The luckier ones fetched whatever carrier they could hire at exorbitant fares, the less fortunate shifted uneasily on their feet, with women suffering the most. Frequent power failures in areas landed people in further troubles as they could not attend to the countless domestic chores. Weathermen said the cyclone SIDR is likely to intensify the rains further as it draws nearer by the hour. Dhaka rainfall recorded at 6am read 1 mm, which was 22 mm for Chittagong, 23 mm for Sandwip, 22 mm at Cox's Bazar, 13 mm for Feni, 13 mm for Patuakhali, 2 mm for Sylhet and 9 mm for Barisal. bdne
