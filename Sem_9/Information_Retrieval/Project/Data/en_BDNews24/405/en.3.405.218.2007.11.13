<TITLE> Pakistani man jailed in Italy for daughter's murder </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Italian court on Tuesday sentenced the father of a Pakistani immigrant girl and two other male relatives to 30 years in prison for her murder, ruling they had killed her because they disapproved of her Western lifestyle. The killing last year of 20-year old Hina Saleem near Italy's northern city of Brescia shocked Italy and threw a spotlight on the clash of cultures faced by some immigrants and their children in Europe. Hina was found buried in the garden of her family home with her throat cut. The Muslim family had been living in Italy for five years. Hina's friends told prosecutors her male relatives resented the fact that she dated a local Italian carpenter, drank, wore tight clothing and worked as a waitress. When the trial started in June this year, Brescia's chief prosecutor Giancarlo Tarquini called the crime "a confrontation between customs in a multi-ethnic society". Italian right-wing politician Daniela Santanche, who was at the court, said she was "totally satisfied" with the sentences given to Hina's father Mohammed Saleem and two of her brothers-in-law, adding the verdict set an example. A fourth relative, Hina's uncle, was given a lesser sentence of two years and eight months in jail.
