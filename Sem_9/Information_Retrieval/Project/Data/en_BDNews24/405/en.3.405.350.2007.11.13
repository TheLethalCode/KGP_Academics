 Cox's Bazar, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Border security forces from Myanmar allegedly abducted 16 Bangladeshis and seized two fishing trawlers in the Bay of Bengal near Saint Martin's Island Monday evening, locals said. Locals alleged that members of Nasaka released three of the fishermen after demanding Tk 3 lakh for the freedom of the others and the return of the trawlers. Ali Ahmad Majhi, Abdus Shukkur and Rahmat Ullah reported the incident to locals after they were released. Two of them returned to Myanmar Tuesday with the demanded money. Local BDR deputy commander Major Azharul Islam said they had heard of the incident. He added that the trawlers' owners Aman Ullah and Zafar Alam from the Teknaf area, had been sent for. Reuters quoted a BDR official saying: "The fishermen were captured late on Monday while they were fishing in Bangladesh waters ... near the Saint Martin's Island." bdnews2
