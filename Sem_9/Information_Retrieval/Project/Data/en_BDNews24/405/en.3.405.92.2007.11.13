<TITLE> Honeywell tests brain-wave system: WSJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Nov 13(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc, looking to speed up how fast humans analyze intelligence data like aerial photographs, is testing a system that monitors analysts' brains for early signs of electrical activity when they see something interesting, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday in its online edition. According to the Journal, the three-year-old project instantaneously keys in on certain faint neural signals as a way of identifying and flagging images worthy of further assessment, before analysts themselves can consciously react to them. Tests so far have allowed human analysts to process images five to seven times faster than current computer-based methods, Bob Smith, head of the advanced technology group for Honeywell's aerospace unit told the Journal. Officials from the company are expected to release information about the project, which has funding from the U.S. Defense Department, later this week, the Journal reported. Representatives from Honeywell were not immediately available for comment.
