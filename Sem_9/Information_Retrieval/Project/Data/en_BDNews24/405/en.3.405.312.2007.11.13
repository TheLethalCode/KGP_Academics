 KARACHI, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen opened fire on two police stations in the Pakistani city of Karachi on Tuesday as supporters of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto were protesting against her house arrest, but no one was hurt, police said. "About 35 to 40 armed men fired ... while the PPP workers were holding a protest rally," said senior police official Fayyaz Khan, referring to Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. The attacks occured in the PPP-dominated Lyari neighbourhood but it had not been confirmed the gunmen were party supporters, he said. Bhutto was placed under a one-week house arrest earlier on Tuesday in the city of Lahore to stop her from leading a procession to protest against military ruler Pervez Musharraf's imposition of a state of emergency on Nov.
