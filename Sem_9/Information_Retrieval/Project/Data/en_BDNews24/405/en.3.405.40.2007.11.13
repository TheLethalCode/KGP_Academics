 LONDON, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK insurer Pearl, closing in on rival Resolution, is unlikely to yield to pressure for a higher offer in exchange for board backing and other moves to ease the 4.9 billion pound ($10.1 billion) takeover, sources familiar with the matter said. Pearl was left to claim victory on Sunday after the only other bidder for Resolution, Standard Life, pulled out of the bid battle for Britain's sixth-largest insurer.

But the sources said Pearl, which already owns 26 percent of Resolution, is unlikely to feel pressured to raise its bid beyond the current 720p per share. Resolution's shares -- discounting the fact the deal is unlikely to be completed before the new year -- are trading at 706p. "Clearly, Resolution's board will be asking for more money, but they are going to have to recommend the deal anyway," another source said. "Nothing can be ruled out but two deals have collapsed, do you think Resolution are not going to help Pearl?" a third source said, referring to Standard Life's withdrawal and the earlier failed merger with Friends Provident, another UK rival. Both Resolution and Pearl declined to comment on the tal
