 TUNCELI, Turkey, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's military, which already amassed up to 100,000 troops near the border with Iraq, sent hundreds of anti-terrorism special forces to the region on Tuesday, military sources said. It was not immediately clear whether the special forces' presence in Sirnak and Hakkari provinces were linked to an offensive launched on Tuesday against PKK rebels following clashes, which left four soldiers dead.
