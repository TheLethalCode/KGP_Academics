<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com) - The Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday decided to raise the paid-up capital requirement for full-fledged merchant banks to Tk 100 million from Tk 20 million. "The current level of paid-up capital requirement for these institutions is very low given the depth of the market. Their activities and risk exposures have increased many times compared to 10 years back," said SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed. The stock market regulator made the decision at a meeting and directed the merchant banks to convert themselves to corporate entities within six months after the publication of the amendments in the official gazette. The watchdog moved to frame the rule in the wake of nearly half of the 30 merchant banks lying idle after having been awarded licences with a paid-up capital of Tk 20 million. The SEC, however, said merchant banks would have to raise the paid-up capital up to Tk 60 million in the first year and to 100 million in the second year. If an institution acts only as issue manager, it will have to elevate the paid-up capital to Tk 10 million from the current Tk 2.5 million in one year, the SEC official said. The paid-up capital requirement for underwriters is Tk 50 million from Tk 10 million at present. Underwriters will be allowed to have Tk 30 million in paid-up capital in the first year. "It will bring about qualitative changes in the market. New capital requirements will also increase banks' strengths and ensure capital utilisation," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. "As the market is becoming broader, greater capital size of the merchant banks has become necessary to enable them to meet the challenges of the time," he said. The DSE chief, also a member of SEC consultative committee, said merchant banks would have to remain active if they are to retain their licences under the proposed rule. The regulator exempted Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum from submitting their audited accounts for the year ending on June 30, 2007. In practice, companies interested to go public need to submit their audited accounts within six months or 180 days as, according to SEC, audited accounts become invalid after 180 days. "Considering the demand for their shares in the market, we have exempted these two companies from complying with the rules. Now they will be able to publish their information documents to sell their shares through stock exchanges," Farhad said. Jamuna and Meghna earlier submitted their audited accounts for the year ending on June 30, 2006. bd
