"She said that truth will prevail one day," Mahmud said. Mahmud alleged that Hasina's relatives and lawyer had not been allowed to meet her for several days. The TV cable connection to her special jail had also been cut, he said. He demanded that all national newspapers be supplied to her. Deputy inspector general (prisons) major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that they allowed relatives and lawyers to meet Hasina in line with the jail code. "The jail code does not allow prisoners to watch cable TV.
