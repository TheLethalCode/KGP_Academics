<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  BNP central office reopened Wednesday morning to its leaders and workers for use after a 10-month shutdown since the imposition of the emergency rule. Dhaka City unit president Sadeque Hossain Khoka and general secretary Abdus Salam were first to enter the office at 10:20am. Acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed followed suit at 10:52 am, as party adherents cheered and chanted slogans. Acting chairperson M Saifur Rahman arrived at 11:40am and was also enthusiastically greeted by party followers. "We have come to our own office to work, not to take possession of it," Saifur told reporters, adding, "I'm only doing my part in the absence of Khaleda Zia." Hafizuddin added: "We call upon the dissident minority within the party to merge with us, and bolster the solidarity of the BNP." Anticipating the reopening, hundreds of party leaders and workers had flocked to at the venue since early morning, almost halting traffic in busy Paltan and adjacent Motijheel areas. Nearly 400 police personnel and plainclothesmen were deployed in Naya Paltan prior to the headquarters' reopening. Salam told bdnews24.com that their office remained closed for long because of misunderstandings among the party workers, but now they would use the office for a united political front. Saifur told reporters: "The BNP, founded by [Ziaur Rahman], will act under the leadership of Khaleda Zia, even though she is currently detained." "She will come to the office after her release. We have taken over party responsibilities only temporarily, while she is absent." "She has no scope to do anything from jail. We don't even know whether she had sent the legal notice to the [Election] Commission." "I believe the chairperson is unaware of the present political situation in the country," added Saifur. The former finance minister also claimed that the party had made significant headway in the development of the country in the last five years. Hafizuddin told journalists: "Veteran leader Saifur Rahman has been with the party since its inception." "He has taken on his responsibilities in the absence of the chairperson. The BNP is united and will remain so," he said. On Sept 11, pro-reform leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan wrote to the Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner for barring party workers from entering the office 'to avert a conflict'. On Oct 29, the policymaking standing committee made Saifur acting chairperson and Hafizuddin acting secretary general, and relieved Delwar of his secretary general position citing 'health reasons'. The meeting however retained Delwar's membership in the standing committee and withdrew the expulsion of Bhuiyan, Ashraf Hossain and Mofikul Hasan Tripti. The Election Commission on Nov 5 invited Hafizuddin to dialogue on electoral reforms. bdnews24.com/
