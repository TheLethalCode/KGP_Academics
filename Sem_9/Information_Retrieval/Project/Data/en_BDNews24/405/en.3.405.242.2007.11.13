 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday sued Firoz Mahmud Iqbal, former assignment officer to Khaleda Zia, for misappropriating government funds. According to case details, Firoz had illegally used three cars supplied by Essential Drugs Company and two from the Local Government Engineering Department when he was Khaleda's assignment officer. The cars were allegedly used by Firoz between 2002 and 2006, when he received Tk 34.9 lakh in government funds for the maintenance of the cars and other personal spending. Firoz worked at the Directorate General of Health Services before joining the Prime Minister's Office on deputation in 2002. In June 2003, he asked the LGED to send a car on an urgent basis for the use of the Prime Minister's Office. The LGED dispatched a car following the request, after which Firoz allegedly used the car for personal use. In 2005, he asked the LGED office for another car, without returning the one he acquired two years earlier. He allegedly used both cars for personal purposes until the BNP-led alliance left office. He received Tk 15.03 lakh for the maintenance costs of the two cars car from the LGED. The case details outline a similar pattern for the way he acquired and used the three vehicles from Essential Drugs. He received Tk 19.87 lakh for the maintenance of those cars.
