 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Friday said it would make available "several million dollars" in emergency aid to cyclone victims in Bangladesh. "Significant damage is expected. However, information collection on casualty and damage figures is still very much in the early stages," said OCHA spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs in Geneva. In New York, OCHA chief John Holmes said his office was ready to make available "several million dollars" in emergency aid, but he declined to name a specific figure. The UN's World Food Programme said it was sending 98 tonnes of high-energy biscuits, enough for 400,000 people for three days. "The urgent needs are food, water purification tablets and medicines," WFP spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said. The United States expressed its "deepest" sympathy for the cyclone victims as it joined hands with the international community in relief efforts. "The United States government would like to express its deepest sympathy for the victims of the cyclone," US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said, reading a statement to reporters in Washington. "We are ready to work with the government (Bangladesh) and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster," he said. Reuters contributed to the report.
