 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday ruled out talks with political parties on the current situation. "The Election Commission is having discussions with political parties. I don't think it is necessary for the government to have talks with them now. We will consider the matter in future if necessary," he told journalists at a meeting in his office. The political situation, runaway prices of essential commodities and fertiliser supply snags figured high in the discussion. Fakhruddin said the main goal of the interim administration was to peacefully hold free, fair elections, which was exactly what it was working on. Asked if the government had any plan to list and try war criminals, he said: "How could war criminals be determined? If an aggrieved person wants to take recourse to law, the door is still open. I will welcome it." "Their participation in polls is unwarranted," he added. To another question, the interim government head said, "I don't know of any effective measures taken by anyone in the past against war criminals. They had come to power with people's mandate. "We've come for a brief period and are working on limited goals. We've embarked on necessary reforms to ensure conditions conducive to work," Fakhruddin said. He observed that diverging to other issues while working on a big task distracts one from the main goal. On whether the emergency government had sought Supreme Court reference now that the constitutionally-mandated 90-day term for a caretaker government has ended, Fakhruddin said: "We had talks with constitution experts on the matter. They said the incumbent interim government can stay in power until it hands over power to an elected government. After that, I don't think seeking reference is any more necessary." The chief adviser said the issue of reference would be considered if any expert raised it. He said the state of emergency would be lifted when the government would think that a congenial atmosphere had been created. He acknowledged that soaring prices of essentials had hurt the people. "There are some reasons behind the price hike. Prices of rice, wheat, edible oil and powdered milk went up because they had to be imported. "Wheat is more expensive than rice in the international market. We kept the Food for Work, Vulnerable Group Feeding and Open Market Sale programmes on with the imported rice. "VGF programme would run until December 31. Each family in monga-stricken areas is being given 15 kg of rice. I hope such feeding programmes will have a positive impact in curbing market price." The chief adviser said that the government had taken several steps to strengthen market management. He said it was the responsibility of the government to reach fertilisers to farmers. "In the past, the agriculture sector was not given priority. The government took steps to find out ways to increase production of paddy, rice and edible oil within a short time." Fakhruddin trashed news reports on fertiliser crisis. "Fertiliser is being distributed through 4,500 dealers across the country. Efforts are on to improve fertiliser management. "A decision has been taken to appoint three sub-dealers with every dealer so that farmers could avail fertiliser easily." On inflation, Fakhruddin said: "In August, inflation rate was 10.12 percent. It is now 9.6 percent." bdnews24.com
