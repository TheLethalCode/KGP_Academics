 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) -- A hurricane, the strongest storm on earth, is a cyclonic or rotary storm system that derives its energy from cloud formation and rainfall, rather than from a temperature gradient. When winds are sustained (based on a one-minute average) at 64 knots (74 mph or 119 km/h), the storm is called a hurricane, a typhoon or a tropical cyclone/severe cyclonic storm, depending on its geographical location. The strongest hurricanes release energy equivalent to one 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. Tropical cyclone "SIDR" developed into a powerful category 4 hurricane Wednesday, with maximum sustained wind speeds of up to 130 knots (150 mph or 240 km/h), according to the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre based at Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. Located in the northern Bay of Bengal, it had tracked northward at 12 knots (14 mph or 22 km/h) over the six hours up to 0300 GMT Thursday, the time of JWTC's SIDR Warning No 11. The cyclone had also markedly intensified in the previous 24 hours, which means the current forecast predicts a less-pronounced weakening prior to landfall than had previously been anticipated. Alongside the recent hurricane Noel, SIDR is predicted to be one of the most powerful tropical cyclones this year. However 2007 will rank as a historically inactive hurricane/cyclone year for the Northern Hemisphere as a whole, according to the Florida-based Centre for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS). During the past 30 years, only 1977 has experienced less tropical cyclone activity than 2007. Nevertheless, says COAPS, late-season developments may still occur since hurricane season continues until the end of November in the Atlantic, and the Western Pacific and Northern Indian Ocean see cyclone activity in early winter Tropical storms are given individual names in the Atlantic, Pacific and South Indian Oceans, and in the Arabian Sea. bdn
