 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  It may take up to three days to restore power to homes and businesses that have been darkened a day earlier by a fierce cyclone which wreaked havoc on many power plants and distribution systems, a government spokesman said Friday. The national grid tripped twice after the cyclone struck the country, he said. Power secretary Faozul Kabir Khan, meanwhile, told bdnews24.com at 8:15pm Friday that the grid broke down for a second time in the afternoon as the demand far exceeded the production. "We could not restart the units near Dhaka. Many parts of the country were out of power. We will be able to supply 1000 megawatts shortly if things go right." Only 500 megawatts power could be fed to the grid until 3:30pm before it failed at again 5:30pm. Power Development Board officials said the power system collapsed as an imbalance occurred in the production system at 7:57am Friday. Power production slumped to zero megawatt at the time leading to the collapse of the national grid. bdnews24.com
