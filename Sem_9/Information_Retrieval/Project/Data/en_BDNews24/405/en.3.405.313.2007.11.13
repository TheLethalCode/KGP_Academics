<TITLE> Great Portland defies UK property market malaise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK property firm Great Portland Estates emerged unscathed from this summer's rapid commercial real estate price slide, posting an 8.9 percent rise in asset value in forecast-beating half-year figures. Rising rents and consistent tenant demand for London business space has so far shielded Great Portland from asset writedowns, but chief executive Toby Courtauld remained cautious, warning investors rents might not grow as quickly as capital values could fall in the coming months. "The investment markets are still incredibly sensitive right now, and yields look destined to keep rising. There's just no way of knowing whether outperformance in the occupational market will be enough to offset poor investment sentiment going forward," Courtauld told Reuters in a telephone interview after the results for the first half to Sept. 30. The company's shares stood almost 3 percent higher at 531 pence in late morning trade against a FTSE 350 Real Estate Index that was up just 0.3 percent. Data from benchmark provider Investment Property Databank showed almost 14 billion pounds ($28.97 billion) was wiped off the value of the 860 billion pounds UK commercial real estate market in September, with October data due later this week expected to indicate further losses. But Great Portland said the value of its portfolio climbed to 1.75 billion pounds and its adjusted net asset value (NAV) per share rose by 11.1 percent to 660 pence over the period. Pre-tax profits rose 55.2 percent to 10.4 million pounds, while joint venture fee income grew 12.5 percent to 24.3 million pounds, defying the summer liquidity squeeze and the onset of a long-awaited UK property market slowdown. Courtauld attributed the NAV rise to the coincidence of undersupply in West End business space, the successful delivery of several well-located development projects, and continued planning restrictions which had so far ruled out possibility of a West End development boom. He said the group would continue to carefully assess timing of its 2.9 million square foot development programme given current turbulent market conditions and rising construction costs but he was convinced the pipeline would enhance group returns in the mid-to-long term. Great Portland generated a total property return of 9.5 percent over the period, outperforming the Investment Property Databank Central London benchmark of 6.6 percent. Property analysts from JPMorgan and Lehman Brothers said the group had weathered recent storms in the property and capital markets well, and was in good shape to withstand any further sector stresses. Despite trading at a discount to NAV of around 20 percent, Courtauld said the firm had no plans to buy back shares -- unlike peers Land Securities and British Land. "It is fascinating to see how the share buybacks have dried up recently as evidence has shown they have not necessarily represented good use of capital," Courtauld said. "We are we are a property company; not speculators in property shares and we will continue to use funds according to that status," he sai
