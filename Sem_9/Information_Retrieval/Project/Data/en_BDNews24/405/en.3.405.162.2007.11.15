 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday set Dec 12 for next hearing on the judiciary separation cases. The court will pass judgement on the contempt of court case filed against 13 government officers, including four secretaries, on the day. A six-member bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin told attorney general Fida M Kamal at 9:30am that it would not hear the cases Thursday as Justice MM Ruhul Amin, who sat on the bench, was abroad. On Oct 3, the apex court set November 15 for the next order. Another order on the Oct 24 law ministry letter asking deputy commissioners not to demand courtrooms, vehicles and other facilities for the judicial magistrates was also due the same day. On Sept 18, the court ordered the government to ensure courtrooms, vehicles and other facilities for the judicial magistrates. It served a notice on Oct 28 on the four secretaries to explain the law ministry's letter. The Supreme Court on Oct 28 stayed the efficacy of the letter and ordered the government to ensure infrastructural facilities for the judicial magistrates within two days. The government after arranging the facilities started formally operationalising the separation of judiciary on Nov 1 and the judiciary has since been functioning as an independent organ of the state. bdnews2
