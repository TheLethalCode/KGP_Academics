 UNITED NATIONS, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A UN envoy on Monday urged countries with troops in Afghanistan to resist the temptation to reduce their roles, saying security still was a challenge and the Afghan police was plagued by corruption.

Afghanistan produced some 8,200 tonnes of opium in 2007, or 93 percent of the world's supply, according to UN figures. "A disjointed international community approach, combined with a lack of Afghan leadership at the national and sub-national levels, has allowed drug traffickers to prosper," Koenigs said.
