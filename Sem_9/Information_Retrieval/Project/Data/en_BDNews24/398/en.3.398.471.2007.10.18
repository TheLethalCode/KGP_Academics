 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Muhammad Abdul Majid, the new chairman of the National Board of Revenue, said Thursday he had got a "national duty". Majid, previously a member of the Planning Commission, in his very first reaction to bdnews24.com said that he hoped to join the office Monday. "It's a national duty. I would be happy to contribute to the economy and the country," he said by phone hours after he was made the country's revenue chief. "I am going to join Monday since Sunday is a national holiday (because of Durga Puja)." Majid was made secretary on Sept 18, and a government order Thursday said he would replace former chairman Badiur Rahman. Badiur, until recently secretary to the Internal Resources Division and chairman of the National Board of Revenue, has been transferred to the food and disaster management ministry, the establishment ministry said in a statement. Badiur had become the country's chief revenue collector on Jan 21. Asked whether he would press on with the tax collection measures taken by his predecessor, Majid said: "Let me join first. I want support from all." bdne
