 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh take on hosts United Arab Emirates (UAE) in their second match of the Group D in the AFC Under-16 Championship Qualifying round at the Military Physical Centre Stadium Saturday. The Bangladeshi youth got off to a flying start routing Palestine 9-1 in their group opener and they would certainly look for another hunt to see themselves one more step ahead in the qualifying meet. Before leaving here for Abu Dhabi, Bangladesh coach Jubaer Nipu said that they wanted to win at least two matches against Palestine and Turkmenistan in the six-nation meet. Bangladesh will face Turkmenistan on October 22, Uzbekistan on October 25 and Tajikistan on October 28. The top two teams in the group will qualify for the 16-nation final round.
