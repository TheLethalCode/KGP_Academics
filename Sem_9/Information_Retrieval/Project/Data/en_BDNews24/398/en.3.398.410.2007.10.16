 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina spoke to her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy and daughter Saima Wazed Putul in the US by phone, a top prisons official said Tuesday. This is the first phone call to her relatives since the Awami League chief was arrested on July 16 at Sudha Sadan in a corruption case. "Sheikh Hasina called her daughter shortly before 2pm and her son at 6:45pm," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. There is no clear provision in the Bangladesh Jail Code to allow prisoners to make personal phone calls to family members, said Siddiqui. "Special approval was given for the former prime minister to call her children, on humanitarian grounds," the DIG of prisons added. Hasina used a landline phone. Prisons officials and intelligence agents were present when she made the phone call. "She talked about family affairs," Siddiqui said. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia has also sought permission from jail authorities to meet or speak by phone with her two detained sons, but a decision has yet to be made in this case, Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. bdnews
