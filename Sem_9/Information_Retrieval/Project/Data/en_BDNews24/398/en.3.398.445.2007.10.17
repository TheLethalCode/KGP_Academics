 London, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  General Moeen U Ahmed has again rubbished talk of a military takeover and said he harbours no ambition to become the country's head of state. The army chief, who was on his way to New York, told reporters Tuesday at the High Commission in London: "I have no such ambition. Rumours of taking over as president are all figment of imagination." But he revealed government plans to appoint more cabinet members to accelerate the pace of work in the administration. "An expansion of the advisory council is being considered. The government is also thinking of appointing consultants," Moeen told Bangladeshi journalists. On arrival at Heathrow Airport, he said: "This government came with one missionthat is, a free, fair and credible election." "The Election Commission made a roadmap. The government is moving in that direction. The army is just assisting the government," said Moeen, en route to the US to deliver a lecture at Harvard University. "It's up to the political parties to follow the roadmap and turn it into a reality. Responsibility lies on them," the army chief told London-based Bangla TV, which posted its interview details on YouTube. bdnews
