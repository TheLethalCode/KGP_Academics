 BAGHDAD, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Iraqi government said on Wednesday it would send a delegation to Turkey to assure Ankara that it was committed to stopping Kurdish rebels from using Iraq as a launchpad for attacks on its neighbour. The announcement came as Turkey's parliament prepared to vote on cross-border operations into northern Iraq to hunt down Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels hiding out in the mountainous region.

Baghdad's government has little sway over the largely autonomous Kurdish north of the country, which has its own government and security forces that are reluctant to take action against their own kin. The Iraqi statement reiterated that Baghdad was committed to an anti-terrorism deal it signed with Ankara in September, under which the two countries agreed to take all ncessary measures, including financial and intelligence, to combat the PKK and other militant groups. "The Iraqi government affirms its desire to establish the best relations with neighbouring Turkey on the basis of joint interests and ... non-intervention in internal affairs," it said. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since the group launched an armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey in 19
