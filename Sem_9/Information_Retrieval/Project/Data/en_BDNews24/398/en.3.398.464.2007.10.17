<TITLE> Moroccan Islamist says new government will fall </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RABAT, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Morocco's new government will be short-lived because it lacks the support it needs in parliament and the country, a leading figure from the main Islamist opposition said. The Justice and Development party (PJD) became the second-biggest force in the Rabat assembly after elections last month but remains in opposition after parties from the outgoing secular coalition rallied to form a majority. The cabinet unveiled this week, led by veteran conservative politician Abbas El Fassi, contains nearly all the parties that formed the outgoing administration but adds more technocrats appointed by the royal palace. In a sign the government enjoys parliament's backing for now, deputies on Wednesday chose the leader of governing coalition member the National Rally on Independents instead of a PJD member as the assembly's new speaker. But PJD deputy leader Lahcen Daoudi suggested the honeymoon could be short-lived. "This is a tragi-comic government that lacks the necessary support," he said in an interview on Wednesday. "It only needs some abstentions in parliament for it to fall." "With a government this weak, we should be prepared for early elections within two years." The cabinet meets on Thursday to map out its policies and outline the 2008 budget. King Mohammed, who is executive head of state and has the final word on policy, has urged it to focus on social and economic reform. Big infrastructure projects and business-friendly measures are yet to transform living standards in the country of 33 million and a record-low turnout of 37 percent in the elections suggested widespread disillusion with the ruling secular elite. In line with the cautious liberal reforms promoted by the king, seven women were appointed as ministers or deputy ministers, up from two last time around. Daoudi said that, with 33 members, the new cabinet was too unwieldy. "We said there should be 20 to 25 ministers but there are far more. ... People went after government posts looking for a place in the sun and they got them." FAILURE The PJD has transformed itself from a political minnow a decade ago into a major political force by drawing on popular anger at poverty and corruption and calling for more morality in public life but avoiding fundamentalist policies. It failed to achieve its goal of becoming the biggest group in parliament last month. The election results suggested most people eligible to vote shunned all parties, including the PJD. When the results came through, PJD officials accused opposition groups of buying votes to sway the result. On Wednesday, Daoudi took aim at the election organisers. "We think at least 300,000 PJD ballot papers were destroyed in the voting stations," he said. Morocco's complex voting system, fashioned under the iron-fisted rule of the king's father, favours broad coalitions and makes it hard for one political force to acquire a majority. "Our country cannot progress under the current system. ... We need to end the balkanisation of party politics. Parties must rationalise their structure," Daoudi told Reuters. But he said the PJD had no regrets in being part of mainstream politics, unlike its rival Justice and Charity, a charitable religious movement with broad support in poor areas that is not a recognised political party. "The PJD is more unified than ever today," Daoudi sa
