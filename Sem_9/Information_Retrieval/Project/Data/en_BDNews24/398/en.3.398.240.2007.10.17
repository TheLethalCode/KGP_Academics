<TITLE> Japan cabinet to approve naval mission bill </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's cabinet was set to endorse on Wednesday a bill to let the navy keep supporting US-led military operations in Afghanistan -- a mission both Washington and Tokyo say is vital -- but the outlook for the controversial legislation was murky. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda wants the navy to keep refuelling US and other ships policing the Indian Ocean against drug and arms smugglers and terrorists after current enabling legislation expires on Nov. 1. But meeting that deadline looks impossible because opposition parties that control parliament's upper house are against the mission, which they argue lacks formal U.N authorisation. While the ruling camp could override the upper house with its two-thirds majority in the lower chamber, lawmakers may well be reluctant to risk a public backlash by doing so, analysts said. Japanese voters are divided on whether the mission should be extended, although support has increased in recent weeks. Former Defence Minister Gen Nakatani, the head of a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) panel on security issues, sidestepped a question on the possible use of the coalition's two-thirds majority. "There are those within the Democratic Party who think this is something we should do, so we want to discuss it and get their understanding somehow," he told reporters after the party endorsed the draft bill. Political analysts say despite opposition calls for an early lower house election, neither camp is keen for a showdown over an issue of less concern to most voters than pocketbook matters such as pensions and health care reform. No lower house poll need be held until late 2009, but speculation persists that policy paralysis will spark a poll after enactment of the state budget for 2008/09 in late March. Opposition leader Ichiro Ozawa, the head of the Democratic Party, has rejected calls to rethink his stance on the naval mission and suggested that instead, Tokyo could provide support for the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF), a U.N.-authorised, NATO-led peacekeeping mission. The government says participating in ISAF would violate Japan's pacifist constitution. "Ozawa insists that Japan should take a more dangerous role to fight terrorism, but I don't think there is a consensus among the public that Japan should do that," said Toru Umemoto, a forex strategist who analyses politics for Barclays Capital. Ozawa's party, an often fractious group of former LDP lawmakers, ex-Socialists and younger hawks, has yet to agree on a counter-proposal to the government bill. A poll by the Asahi newspaper published on Tuesday showed that two-thirds of Japanese voters wanted a compromise on the mission, but predicting what form a deal would take is tough. "The government doesn't have a clear idea, nor do the Democrats," said Yasunori Sone, a Keio University political science professor.
