 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Storms, electrocution, boat capsize and home or mud collapse twinned with heavy rains have left at least 16 people dead and more than 100 injured since Monday, as violent wind and rain continued to whip the country Tuesday. The death toll could still climb since many of the injured were being treated in the troubled areas, bdnews24.com correspondents reported. Violent storms ripped through many impoverished farming villages across the country overnight, uprooting trees and electric poles, destroying crops and homes and knocking off power lines. Heavy downpours caused water-logging in many low-lying areas across the country. According to the weather office, heavy rains set off by a well-marked low Tuesday battered the country with gusty winds whipping the coastal belts and the mid-region. Many roads in the port city of Chittagong went under knee- to waist-deep water, throwing traffic into disarray. Passenger launch services on the southern river routes remained suspended since Monday evening. The seaports have been asked to keep local cautionary signal 3 hoisted, which means the fishing trawlers will have to stay close to the shore for safety. The weather office said in a special bulletin Tuesday the land depression over Barisal, Faridpur and Comilla regions moved north-northeastwards, and weakened into a well-marked low hovering over Dhaka and Comilla at 6am. It is expected to move northeastward and dissipate gradually causing more downpour. The sea might remain moderately rough, it said. Meteorologist Ayesha Khatun told bdnews24.com the three maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar and Mongla had been asked to continue to hoist cautionary signal 3 and the internal river ports to show riverine cautionary signal no 2.
