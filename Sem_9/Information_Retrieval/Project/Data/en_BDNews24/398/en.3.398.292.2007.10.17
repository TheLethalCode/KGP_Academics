 CAIRO, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police divers have pulled the bodies of two people, including a child, from the Nile river, bringing the death toll from a holiday ferry accident to 10, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported on Wednesday. The agency said the bodies were those of 7-year-old Mohamed Salah Mahmoud and Fawqiya Hassanein, 53. Five other people were slightly injured in the accident on Sunday in the province of Minya, some 200 km (120 miles) south of Cairo, that occurred over the Eid el-Fitr holiday that marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. State news agency MENA quoted the governor of Minya as saying that a large number of passengers had been trying to get on the ferry when a ramp linking it to the river bank collapsed. Security officials said one of the boat's railings also collapsed, sending more people into the water.
