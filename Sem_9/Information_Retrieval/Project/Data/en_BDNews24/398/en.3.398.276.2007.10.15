 HONG KONG, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks edged higher on Monday, extending their recent rally, while the dollar held firm after strong US retail sales data helped soothe worries about the health of the US economy, the region's top export market. But a subdued start awaited investors in Europe, where financial bookmakers were expecting European stocks to slip after rallying for nearly three weeks. EU] The upbeat US report also helped underpin base metals prices, while mounting tension between Turkey and northern Iraq kept US crude within striking distance of a record high of $84.05 set on Friday. Concerns that rising energy prices would stoke inflation drove gold back towards its recent 28-year high of $753.60. At 0617 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had gained 0.5 percent and was within easy reach of a record high set last Thursday, while Tokyo's Nikkei average settled up nearly 0.2 percent. Last week, the MSCI index posted its eighth straight weekly gain and set four record-closing highs in the last five sessions. But analysts warned that further substantial gains may be limited, given concern that Asian stocks may have risen too much, too fast over the last few weeks. "We're probably due for a correction at some point. The higher it gets, the more tempting it will get to take profits," said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. Still, the positive US retail sales report and figures showing US inflation pressures were largely muted, have helped ease fears that the world's largest economy may be sliding into a recession for now. "Most people had worried the US economy would enter a recession, but the data on Friday showed the economy is not that bad," said Cho Seong-joon, an analyst at Meritz Securities. On the back of the renewed confidence in the US economy and stronger commodity prices, investors bought resource stocks including mining giant BHP Billiton and oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Some exporters such as Sony Corp and chip-tester maker Advantest Corp, were further underpinned by a firm dollar, which tends to boost the value of overseas sales. PetroChina surged 10 percent on news of production gains and hopes it has made some big new finds, sending its market value past $400 billion, on a par with General Electric, the world's most highly-valued listed company after Exxon Mobil Among regional markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index hit a life high and was up 0.9 percent by the midday break, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index ended 0.2 percent lower after also scaling a fresh peak earlier. Stocks in mainland China reversed early losses to break the 6,000 point level for the first time. The key index was up 1.7 percent in late trade as investors took Beijing's latest move to cool its booming economy in their stride. On Saturday, China's central bank raised the proportion of deposits that banks must hold in reserve for the eighth time this year. But the main focus was on the 17th Communist Party Congress, which started on Monday, with investors looking to see how the authorities will steer China's economy over the next few years. "The government is ensuring a harmonious political atmosphere for the Party Congress, and this means a healthy stock market," said Liu Lifeng, fund manager at BOC International Holdings in Shanghai. DOLLAR STEADY In the forex market, the dollar held near a two-month high against the yen and was steady versus the euro after the upbeat retails sales report cast doubts about whether the Fed would cut interest rates again at its meeting at the end of October. But caution ahead of a Group of Seven meeting later this week was likely to keep the major currencies stuck in a range. "It's not as if there is a clear sense of direction, especially with the G7 looming ahead this week. There's no real reason to take positions at current levels," said a trader for a Japanese trust bank. The dollar traded at 117.58 yen near a two-month peak of 117.79 yen set last Thursday. The euro was little changed from late New York levels on Friday at $1.4175 and was trading at 166.69 yen not far off a 2- month high near 167.70 yen struck last Thursday. Tracking falls in US Treasury prices, Japanese government bonds (JGBs) lost ground, pushing yields higher. The yield for the benchmark 10-year JGB climbed 2.5 basis points to 1.725 percent. US light sweet crude for November delivery climbed 6 cents to $83.75 a barrel by 0615 GMT, hovering within sight of last week's record high
