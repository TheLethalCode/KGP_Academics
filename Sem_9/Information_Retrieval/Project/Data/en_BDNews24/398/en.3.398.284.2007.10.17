 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday acquitted Atiqullah Khan Masud, editor of the daily Janakantha and chairman of Globe Constructions Ltd, of fraud charges over sale of flats. Masud's lawyer Nikhil Chandra Datta told bdnews24.com, "We reached an amicable settlement with the plaintiff when the case was on. The plaintiff has submitted an affidavit in the court mentioning that she has got her money back in full, which has been attached to the verdict." This is the second out-of-court settlement reached during trial in corruption cases in two weeks after Daily Jugantor publisher Nurul Islam Babul struck a similar deal, prompting the court to clear him of fraud, land-grab and threat-to-kill charges. Ashraful Haque, general manager for Globe Constructions Ltd, who has been on the run since the case was filed, was also acquitted of deception charges. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate M Shah Alam Sardar handed down the verdict. Masud however would remain in prison as he faces 14 other cases. On April 18, Rebecca Mahmuda, a resident of Malibagh Chowdhurypara, filed a case with Ramna Police Station against Masud and Haque, accusing them of cheating buyers of flats built by Globe Constructions Ltd. The case details said the accused embezzled Tk 9.78 lakh deposited by the plaintiff against purchase of a flat. Sub-inspector Golam Mahfuzur Rahman of Ramna Police Station pressed charges on Sept 17. The case was later included for trial under the emergency powers rules. Masud told bdnews24.com after the verdict, "There's no need to write long reports on such cases, as these are based on all sorts of false accusations. Opportunists filed such cases against me just to harass me after I was detained." bdnews24.co
