 Kiyoshi Takenaka and Alison Tudor TOKYO, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sanyo Electric has given up on the sale of its microchip unit after private equity buyer Advantage Partners failed to secure funds for the deal in tougher credit markets, dealing a blow to its share price. The planned sale was a symbol of Sanyo's efforts to shed struggling units and focus on profitable ones, such as its batteries business, under the eye of shareholder Goldman Sachs that strategy looked less certain after the deal sank. "We decided not to sell the semiconductor business, and instead we will nurture it as one of core businesses in our components division," Sanyo said in a statement. Shares in Sanyo, the world's largest maker of rechargeable batteries, were down 7.1 percent at 182 yen by early afternoon. They underperformed the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index IELEC, which fell 1 percent. "Their original plan was to take the cash from the sale and put it in profitable businesses. That plan is derailed at least for now," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. However, Akino believes Sanyo will ultimately stick to its strategy of focusing on core operations and will sell the semiconductor unit eventually. Advantage Partners, a Japanese fund, had earlier this year gained priority negotiating rights to buy Sanyo Semiconductor, outbidding other buyout funds with an offer above 100 billion yen ($855 million). But Advantage Partners could not raise the funds. Reuters reported last month that Advantage would have difficulty levering the deal Rising defaults in the US subprime mortgage sector and a backlog of unsyndicated debt from massive buyouts in Europe and the United States have made lender banks wary of taking on new obligations. One of the banks Advantage engaged to raise funds, Citigroup , was cautious about its ability to syndicate any loans to other banks and had told Advantage it would only underwrite the deal on a 'best efforts' basis, the sources said. On October 15, Advantage's deadline to secure funds, Citigroup said that its third-quarter profit fell 57 percent as losses mounted from subprime and leveraged loans, fixed-income trading and its US consumer business. Another of the banks Advantage approached to provide funds, Merrill Lynch, has also been hit by the credit crisis. On October 5, Merrill said it would write down $5.5 billion for bad bets on subprime mortgages and leveraged loans. QUAKE DAMAGE Osaka-based Sanyo spun off the chip-making business last year in a move widely seen as a prelude to selling it. The unit posted 181.27 billion yen in sales in the year ended March, and squeaked by with an operating profit of 4 billion yen. The unit has been floundering since a major earthquake in 2004 hit its factory in northwest Japan, ruining equipment and prompting customers to switch suppliers. Sanyo's rechargeable batteries business has been more successful. Its lithium-ion batteries are used in four of every 10 mobile phones in the world. As a group, Sanyo Electric has lost about $3.6 billion over the past three business years, hit by the chip unit's woes and sluggish sales of core electronics products such as digital cameras and mobile phones. The global credit crisis has made lender banks more cautious when it comes to financing leveraged buyouts, but many Asian banks are still willing to fund deals if the target company is strong. Banks appear keen to finance the $2 billion acquisition of Japanese agrichemical business Arysta whose core earnings are growing Also, the $610 million buyout of profitable business software firm Yayoi Co by North Asian private equity firm MBK Partners was backed by lender banks. The syndication of the debt is at an advanced stage, according to financial sources.
