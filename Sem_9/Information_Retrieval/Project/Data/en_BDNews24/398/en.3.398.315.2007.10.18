 ISLAMABAD, Mon Aug 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's embattled President Pervez Musharraf has sent representatives to London to negotiate with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on a power-sharing pact, an official and newspapers said on Monday. Pakistan is facing weeks of uncertainty and the risk of turmoil as army chief Musharraf prepares to secure another term as president while his opponents vow to end military rule. The United States and other Western countries are likely to watch developments closely in a nuclear-armed ally which is seen as vital to efforts to end terrorism and bring peace to Afghanistan. "We are in contact with Benazir Bhutto, that's true," said Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani, referring to newspaper reports that three senior Musharraf confidants were in London for talks. He declined to elaborate. Musharraf, who analysts say is at his weakest since he seized power in a 1999 coup, met self-exiled Bhutto in Abu Dhabi last month. Liberal-minded Bhutto is seen as a natural ally of Musharraf's who promotes a vision of "enlightened moderation" for his country. Both oppose Islamist militancy. Her Pakistan People's Party is generally seen as the country's most popular party, and a pact with her would broaden Musharraf's support base. Bhutto, a two-time prime minister who still has corruption charges hanging over her, has said any deal would depend on Musharraf taking confidence-building steps by the end of August. She wants immunity for the actions of civilian governments from when she first came to power in 1988 and the lifting of a ban on a prime minister serving a third term. She is also demanding that Musharraf resign from the army and reforms that would ensure a fair election. "If our negotiations fall apart, we can always turn to the other political party," she told Newsweek magazine in its latest issue, referring to the party of her old rival, another former prime minister in exile in London, Nawaz Sharif. CHALLENGES Musharraf intends to seek re-election from the national and provincial assemblies, while remaining army chief, between mid-September and mid-October and hold parliamentary elections within months. But he is expected to face opposition to his plan. Last week, Musharraf issued a call for reconciliation and some Pakistani newspapers reported that he had sent representatives to talk to Sharif but Information Minister Durrani denied that. Sharif, also a two-time prime minister, was ousted in a 1999 coup and later sent into exile by Musharraf. The Supreme Court ruled last week that Sharif, who has allied himself with conservative religious parties, should be allowed to return. Vowing to end Musharraf's rule, Sharif said he would be back soon to contest elections, a move analysts say would likely hurt Musharraf's plans to secure another term. After the 1999 coup, Musharraf co-opted the rump of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League to form his political base, and analysts say that could splinter if Sharif were to return. An intelligence official said the government was keen to prevent Sharif's return before the presidential election but he could come back after that. That message was sent to Sharif via Saad al-Hariri, son of assassinated Lebanese prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, the official said. Rafik al-Hariri and Saudi Arabia were reported to have helped work out the agreement under which, the government says, Sharif agreed to 10 years exile and was allowed to leave in 2000. But Sharif said there was no agreement with the government and petitioned the Supreme Court to clear the way for his return. Both Bhutto and Sharif are meeting party colleagues in London this week to work out their strategi
