<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- US-listed shares of overseas companies fell Tuesday led by an unexpected decline in earnings at Swedish telecoms maker Ericsson and Korean steelmaker POSCO. Equity markets around the world fell as renewed worries about credit and a surge in oil price above $88 a barrel raised concerns about the outlook for global growth. The Bank of New York's index of leading American Depositary Receipts was down 1.42 percent while the 30-share Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.57 percent in early afternoon trade. The Bank of New York's index for European ADRs declined 1.23 percent, the Latin American index was down 1.68 percent and the Asian index was down 2.04 percent. Ericsson lost one-quarter of its market value on Tuesday after the world's biggest supplier of mobile networks reported a surprise drop in third-quarter profits on the back of weak sales of network upgrades. Ericsson was the third-biggest declining stock on Nasdaq and the most heavily traded company share on the tech-laden exchange, registering greater volume than such computer-related icons as Intel, Cisco Systems or Microsoft. ADRs of Ericsson lost $9.87 or 24.11 percent, to $31.06 on the Nasdaq. Ericsson's plunge pushed down an exchange-traded fund for Swedish stocks, the iShares MSCI Sweden Index Fund, by 5.19 percent. POSCO, the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, also trimmed its full-year sales and operating profit even as analysts said the company's outlook is positive amid strong global demand. POSCO ADRs fell $18.10, or 10 percent, to $162.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. The fallout on Ericsson fell hard on European rivals Nokia Corp and Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia fell $1.13 or 3.1 percent to $35.31 and Alcatel declined 47 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $9.27.
