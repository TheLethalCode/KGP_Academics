 Jerker Hellstrom and Niklas Pollard STOCKHOLM, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares in telecoms equipment maker Ericsson plunged 25 percent on Tuesday after the firm stunned the market with a profit warning, saying third-quarter earnings were well short of expectations. Ericsson, the world's biggest mobile network maker, said in a preliminary report its operating earnings dropped 36 percent to 5.6 billion Swedish crowns ($876 million) from a year-ago 8.8 billion, on disappointing sales of upgrades and expansions. A Reuters survey of 33 analysts had forecast 8.9 billion crowns in operating earnings. The news landed hard on shares in rivals such as Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent. "I think it's a major disaster and unfortunately it's more than a Q3 issue," said Thomas Langer, analyst at West LB, which cut Ericsson to "reduce" from "buy". He said the warning pointed to deeper trouble at Ericsson than just the past few months. "My interpretation is that mix of sales in the market is likely to prevail in 2008 -- this is the big, bad news." The company blamed its woes on an unfavourable business mix. "The unexpected development in the quarter is mainly due to a shortfall in sales in mobile network upgrades and expansions which resulted in an unfavourable business mix that also negatively affected group margins," it said in a statement. Analysts said the news was unsettling for what it said not only about the company's earnings but also about management. Only last month, Ericsson executives painted a rosy picture at an investors' conference in London, saying the company was poised to grab an even bigger slice of the markets it targets. "This represents a significant change in tone from management, contrasting with the recent commentary of last month's investor day," Cazenove said in a note to clients. It said it was retaining an "underperform" rating on the stock. Ericsson shares at 0748 GMT were down 24.5 percent at 19.92, having earlier fallen as low as 19.56. The collapse wiped out all the gains from a modest rally since mid-August and sent them to a new low for the year. They started 2007 at 27.70 crowns. EARLY WARNING Ericsson was due to report earnings on Oct. 25 but it issued the preliminary figures ahead of time on Tuesday. It said net sales rose 6 percent to 43.5 billion crowns, compared with market forecasts for 45.5 billion. Gross margins fell to 35.6 percent from 38.2 percent a year earlier, far short of the 42.5 percent expected by the market. Income after financial items fell 37 percent to 5.6 billion crowns from 8.9 billion a year earlier. The market expected net earnings of 6.2 billion crowns. "Ericsson's networks business continues to develop most rapidly in regions where new network rollouts and break-in contracts are predominant," the company said. "This is where competition is intense as it builds footprint for long-term profitable growth." The company said margin pressures in these areas to date were offset by higher-margin sales from network expansions and upgrades, but that those had recently dried up. "Such expansions and upgrades have a short sales cycle and builds during the quarter. This quarter, sales of these higher margin offerings did not materialize as much as in previous quarters. High margin software sales are also lower than normal," the company said. SEB Enskilda analyst Mats Nystrom said this was even worse than an unexpected margin slide last year. "I think the equities market will see this as worse than the situation after the first quarter 2006 when the operating margin went from 22 to 17 and caught everybody by surprise," he said, ""Now it happens again, with even greater force." Asia Pacific showed a serious deterioration with sales dropping 28 percent to 12 billion crowns from 16.6 billion in the prior three months, the firm said. They were up three percent from a year earlier. Western Europe, narrowly the biggest source of revenue for the company, reported 12.3 billion crowns in sales, down 1 percent from the second quarter and up 7 percent from a year before. Ericsson's networks division represents the lion's share of its business and this accounted for the earnings slippage. The company said its multimedia business grew 31 percent from a year earlier and operating income was slightly above the breakeven level. Its professional services division grew 26 percent from a year earlier and was outpacing the market.
