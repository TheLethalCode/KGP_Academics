 LOS ANGELES, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England captain David Beckham returned to action for the first time in seven weeks as his LA Galaxy were held to a 1-1 draw by New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer on Thursday. Beckham came on as a 68th minute substitute, making his first appearance since suffering a knee injury on Aug. 29. The draw leaves LA needing to win their final regular season game -- away to the Chicago Fire on Sunday -- to have any chance of making the play-offs. The Galaxy took the lead in the 15th minute when Troy Roberts headed in a Landon Donovan cross at the back post. New York, already assured a play-off spot, drew level within a minute though as Jozy Altidore thundered home a header after a superb cross from Dave van den Bergh. Beckham, who is not yet fully fit, received a warm welcome from the home supporters when he entered after the break but made little impact on the game
