 LONDON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Steve Harmison will play two matches for South African side Highveld Lions next month as he continues his recovery from injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Wednesday. Harmison, who has not played for England since the fourth test against West Indies in June, will be accompanied in South Africa by national bowling coach Ottis Gibson, the ECB said on its Web site (www.ecb.co.uk). The 28-year-old suffered a hernia during the series against the West Indies, which later required surgery. He then sustained a back problem while playing for his county side Durham. England play a three-test series in Sri Lanka in December and are due to name the squad on Friday
