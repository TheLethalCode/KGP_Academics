<TEXT>
 MANILA, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Philippine military tribunal cleared three young army officers and a navy ensign on Wednesday of any role in a failed mutiny against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo four years ago. Brigadier-General Nathaniel Legaspi, head of a seven-member tribunal, said there was insufficient evidence to link the four officers to the take over of a high-rise apartment at the heart of Manila's financial centre during a coup attempt in 2003. Legaspi said two officers -- Army Captain Francis Balan and Navy Ensign Ronald Paras -- were freed and ordered to return to active duty after dropping charges against them for conduct unbecoming and failure to suppress mutiny. The two other officers -- Lieutenants Engelbert Gay and Andrin Baldonado -- were also cleared of the same charges but were ordered to remain in detention pending resolution of other cases in another army tribunal. "On account of having gone absent without official leave and conspiring with destabilisers, the accused will be prosecuted for a different offence before a different court," Legaspi said, reading an order. All four were implicated in the failed coup after their names were found in a computer disk seized from about 300 soldiers who seized Oakwood Apartments in July 2003. They were not among those who took part in the actual mutiny. About 80 officers and 200 enlisted men were court-martialled for the mutiny. A few dozen were cleared because they were found to have been misled into taking part. In 2005, the enlisted personnel were freed from army detention and restored to active service after they agreed to enter into plea-bargaining deals, accepting minor punishments. In April 2007, 54 officers also agreed to similar deals and will be freed on Jan. 27 next year after serving their prison terms. But, they are deemed discharged dishonourably and will not be reinstated into active duty. Twenty-nine officers, considered to be the leaders of the failed mutiny, are still facing charges in both civilian and military courts. Except for two officers, the rest have agreed to a deal to accept minor punishments and be discharged. One of two officers who declined to a plea bargaining deal won a seat in the senate in the May elections but remains in detention until his cases are resolv
