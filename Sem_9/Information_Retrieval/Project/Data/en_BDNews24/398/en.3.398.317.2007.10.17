 Oct 17 -(bdnews24.com/Reuters) Dissidents on the run in military-ruled Myanmar called on the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to impose a blanket arms and investment ban on the junta to try to force it towards democratic reform. Here is an overview of countries that have imposed sanctions against the former Burma and its rulers. AUSTRALIA: -- Australia said on Sept. 27, 2007, it planned targeted sanctions against leaders of the regime. On Oct. 1, it rejected Myanmar's nomination of an army general as envoy to Canberra in response to the crackdown on Buddhist monks and pro-democracy supporters. Australia has had visa restrictions on senior junta figures and a ban on defence exports since 1988. CANADA: -- Limited trade sanctions. Permits are required for exports to Myanmar and one other country (Belarus). EUROPEAN UNION (EU): -- On Oct. 15, 2007, EU foreign ministers agreed to broaden visa bans and asset freezes on generals, government officials and their relatives, and to target the country's key timber, metals and gemstone sectors in response to last month's crackdown. -- New measures include an export ban on equipment to sectors involving timber, metals, minerals, semi-precious and precious stones plus import and investment bans on the sectors. -- So far the 27-nation bloc has steered clear of Myanmar's energy sector, in which French oil giant Total is a big investor. JAPAN: -- Japan has refrained from imposing sanctions on Myanmar. But the government announced it was cutting 550 million yen ($4.7 million) worth of aid on Tuesday to show its disapproval of last month's suppression of monk-led protests and the killing of a Japanese video journalist during street clashes. NEW ZEALAND: -- A long-standing ban on visas for military leaders and their families. UNITED STATES: -- A State Department official said on Monday the United States is debating more punitive measures after Washington last month tightened economic sanctions on the leaders of the regime and expanded a visa ban on those responsible for human rights abuses and their families. -- The U.S. first imposed broad sanctions on Myanmar in 1988, after the junta's bloody crackdown on student-led protests. It prohibited new investment in the country by U.S. persons or entities in 1997. The Burma Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 banned all imports from Myanmar, restricted financial services, froze the assets of certain Myanmar financial institutions and extended visa restrictions on junta officia
