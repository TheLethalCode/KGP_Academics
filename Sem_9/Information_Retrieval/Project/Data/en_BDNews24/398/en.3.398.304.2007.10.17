<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Polynesia's pro-independence president Oscar Temaru said he wants Paris to begin talks towards an autonomy accord similar to that signed by New Caledonia in the South Pacific, Tahiti media reported. Temaru, speaking at a South Pacific leaders summit in Tonga, warned of "more instability and unrest" in the main island of Tahiti unless underlying tensions over the territory's political future were settled, the tahitipresse.pf Web site said on Wednesday. French Polynesia consists of some 130 islands stretched across 4 million sq kms of ocean. It has a population of around 245,000. About 80 percent of the population was born in the territory, compared with about 10 percent in France. The territory's economy is dependent on imported goods, tourism, and the financial assistance of France. France has increased its autonomy, giving its local parliament control of education and the public service, but retains control of law and order, defence and the money supply in French Polynesia. Temaru told the 16 nation South Pacific Islands Forum that he wanted Tahiti reinstated on the United Nations list of territories to be decolonised. He called for start of talks to create the "Tahiti Nui (New Tahiti) Accords", modelled on the 1998 Noumea Accords negotiated between France and New Caledonia, which provides for a referendum vote on independence between 2013 and 2018. Temaru said he had just returned from Paris where he met President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss Tahiti's future. He said Paris was planning new laws which would increase instability in the territory by reducing its local parliament's term, forcing new elections in January 2008. Tahiti has been rocked by political instability in recent years. Temaru has been elected three times as president but toppled twice since 2004, as local island politicians, pro-independence and pro-France forces fight for supremacy. "The situation (in Tahiti) is not on the way to improving because the French government and parliament are examining at this moment a new organic law proposal that is going to shorten the mandate of the...French Polynesia Assembly and lead to new assembly elections in January 2008," Temaru said. "I can assure you that if this legislation is adopted...there will be more instability and unrest in French Polynesia," he said. Temaru said the new laws did "not address the roots of instability" and would be "a step backwards for our autonomy". "I believe it is high time for the Maohi (Tahitian) people to engage in a process similar to that of New Caledonia," said Temaru. "Just as France signed the Noumea Accords nearly 10 years ago in 1998, we are asking for the opening of discussions with the signing of the Tahiti Nui Accords with France." Temaru said such an Accord should aim to establish "the inalienable right of the Maohi people to self-determinatio
