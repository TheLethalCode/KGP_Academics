<TITLE> Putin to go ahead with Iran trip despite 'plot' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW/TEHRAN, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin will go ahead with a historic visit to Tehran later on Monday, officials said, despite a report that Russian intelligence had uncovered a plot to assassinate him there. Putin's visit, the first by a Kremlin leader to Iran since Josef Stalin in 1943, has drawn intense interest because of Russia's role as a mediator in six-power talks designed to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Sunday evening, citing a single unnamed security source, that Putin had been warned by his special services of a possible assassination plot during his visit to Tehran this week. Kremlin officials declined to comment in detail on the report, which was repeated on state television channels. They said only that they expected Putin to go ahead with the trip. "According to the schedule, the President (Putin) is coming tonight. We have no information that he is changing his plans." Kremlin deputy spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Tehran. Putin was in Wiesbaden, Germany, on Monday morning opening a civil forum with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and did not comment on the report or on his Iran trip in opening remarks. Iran dismissed the Interfax report as baseless, saying it was "psychological warfare" calculated by Tehran's enemies -- an apparent reference to Western powers -- to undermine Russian-Iranian relations. Putin's trip to Tehran will be watched closely by Western capitals anxious to curb an Iranian nuclear programme they fear masks a drive for an atomic bomb. Iran denies nuclear arms ambitions and is building a nuclear reactor with Russian help. Interfax said in its report on Sunday that Russian security services had discovered several groups of suicide killers were training for an attempt on Putin's life during his visit. It did not say who might be behind such groups. 'ASSASSINATION PLOT' "A reliable source in one of the Russian special services, has received information from several sources outside Russia, that during the president of Russia's visit to Tehran an assassination attempt is being plotted," Interfax said. "I think this is very serious information," the head of the Russian parliament's security committee, Vladimir Vasiliev told the Vesti television news channel. "I hope that through the cooperation of international special services all this information will be verified and the necessary steps taken." Russian television channels said previous plots to kill Putin had been foiled in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2001 and in St Petersburg in 2000. In a historical coincidence, reports of an assassination plot also hung over Stalin's 1943 visit to Tehran for a wartime conference with allies Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. On that occasion, Stalin said Soviet intelligence had uncovered Nazi plans to kill Roosevelt, persuading the American president to move into the Soviet embassy for his stay. Putin is officially in Tehran to take part in a summit of Caspian Sea states. But a planned private meeting with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad could give him a chance to seek a peaceful compromise over Tehran's nuclear programme and to demonstrate his independence from Washington on Middle East issues. Russia says engaging Tehran is a better way of tackling Iran's nuclear programme than isolating it. Moscow sells weapons to Iran, in defiance of US concerns, and is building a nuclear power station for Iran at Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf. Although Washington wants a tougher line taken on Iran and is much more suspicious of Tehran's nuclear objectives than Russia, the United States has repeatedly praised Moscow's cooperation at the six-power talks. Putin has in turn promised during his visit to stick to the established six-party line on Iran -- to encourage Tehran to cooperate fully with International Atomic Energy Authority inspectors and show that its nuclear programme is intended only for peaceful purposes
