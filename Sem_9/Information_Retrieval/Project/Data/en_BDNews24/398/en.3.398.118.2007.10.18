 MUMBAI, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian fashion, with its legacy of handicraft, color and durable motifs, may have evoked global appreciation, but top buyers say homespun designers need better branding and market awareness to attract serious money. Until about a decade ago, pret-a-porter fashion barely existed in India, despite its wealth of fabric and lavish embroideries inspiring Western designers such as Roberto Cavalli and Oscar de la Renta. But, helped by a booming economy and victories by Indian beauty queens at international pageants, Indian haute couture has leapt from the closet to dress a glamorous clientele ranging from Hollywood star Nicole Kidman to pop diva Madonna. The recognition has not, however, translated into big business and the Indian designer industry remains in its infancy, its size estimated at anywhere between $50 million and $250 million in the $35 billion global market. "Indian fashion is like diamonds in the rough," said Albert Morris of London's Browns, who attended one of India's top fashion week events in Mumbai that ended on Wednesday. "There is great talent, but many Indian designers lack awareness of their competition in the West. They are sort of naive in a nice way." The Lakme Fashion Week, where some of India's best talents such as Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Narendra Kumar showcased their lines, attracted dozens of international buyers, but most were retail boutiques that mainly sold to Indians living abroad. Browns, which stocks Mukherjee and is a regular at Indian fashion weeks, was the only A-list buyer at the event. "If someone like Browns keeps coming back what does it mean? It's just the beginning for Indian fashion and things don't happen overnight," said Fern Mallis, senior vice-president of IMG Fashion, which organizes runway shows around the world. LATE ARRIVAL The outsourcing boom saw big Western retailers such as Gap and Banana Republic ordering their clothes from cheap Indian suppliers, but now the country is also seen as a land where high fashion can be found alongside silk saris. Fashion analysts say Indian designers have to move in a consolidated group at assorted fashion fairs to prove the strength of their creativity abroad. "If you compare on a global scale, Indian fashion is a cottage industry driven by a few individuals generating piffling turnovers," said a young designer who did not want to be named. "Come to think of it, we are the country with a rich fashion heritage and we should have arrived a long time back." In ancient India, even the poor used swathes of silk and woven fabrics and the subcontinental legacy of handicraft, ornament, strong color and durable motif has inspired generations of American and European collections. Yet, for years, Indian fashion remained restricted to custom-made wedding attires, while Western designers took to the world the magic of calico, madras, chintz, tie-dye, crewelwork and virtually the entire technique of hand-block printing. International buyers say Indian designers need to understand the minds of Western clients. And that would mean toning down vivid colors and cutting back on extravagant embroidery. Designers like Narendra Kumar say they would also like to tap the huge Indian market of people with swelling incomes. "To me the Indian market is most important," he said. "Foreign buyers will keep coming, but we must sell in Indi
