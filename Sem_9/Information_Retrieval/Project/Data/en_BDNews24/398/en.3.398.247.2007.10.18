<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnew24.com)  Bangladesh would stress striking mutual deals on crime control among the SAARC member countries in the upcoming home ministers' summit, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Thursday. The adviser briefed reporters after a preparatory meeting held at the home ministry on the forthcoming four-day summit to be held in New Delhi on Oct 23-26. The summit will also discuss issues on combating terrorism and trafficking in women and children, money laundering and narcotics smuggling, Iqbal elaborated. The adviser said he would be leading a nine-member Bangladesh delegation at the summit. The envisaged mutual treaties, he said, would centre around mutual security issues such as arresting terrorists and extradition of prisoners between the countries. Anwar said discussion on nascent issues raised in the recent SAARC summit such as raising a SAARC police force and a SAARC immigration authority will also take place at the summit. The adviser said the home ministers will review the recommendations formulated in the recent specialists' meeting held in India. Iqbal hinted that the proposed SAARC police might be a prototype of EUROPOL. The first day of the summit on Oct 23 will keep the SAARC police chiefs busily deliberating over relevant issues. The home secretaries will take the cue from them on Oct 24 to deal with issues at their level. Oct 25 will be the home ministers' day and the last day, Oct 26, will see the plenary session dedicated to integrating all the discussions held at all the three tiers during the preceding days. The nine-member Bangladesh delegation will include the home affairs adviser, home secretary, IGP, deputy secretary (political) to the home ministry and a director general of the foreign affairs ministry. bdnews24.com
