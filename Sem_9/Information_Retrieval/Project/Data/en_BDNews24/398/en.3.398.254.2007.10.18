 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Thursday stayed proceedings in three high-profile cases against BNP minister Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, former state minister Amanullah Aman and former BNP MP Salahuddin Ahmed. The single-member vacation bench of Justice AFM Abdur Rahman delayed proceedings following writ petitions from the defendants' lawyers until the Supreme Court reopens Oct 28. Abdus Sattar Bhuiyan, the brother of Awami League leader Subid Ali Bhuiyan, filed a Tk 5.35 lakh extortion case on March 19 against Mosharraf. The government subsequently included the case under the emergency powers rules on April 16. Mosharraf later filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the legality of the move. Md Humayun Kabir filed a case against former state minister Amanullah Aman with Keraniganj Police Station on March 21, accusing him of extortion, theft, ransacking and making a death threat. Kabir alleged that Aman had entered his poultry farm, stole 370 chickens, ransacked the property and threatened him with death, causing his business to lose Tk 1.68 lakh. The government included the case under the emergency powers rules on April 15. Aman later filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the legality of the inclusion. Abu Yusuf, the headmaster of Jatrabari Ideal High School, filed a case with Jatrabari Police Station against former BNP lawmaker Salahuddin Ahmed on July 3. Yusuf alleged that Salahuddin embezzled huge sums of money, in collusion with other members of the High School managing committee, while he was serving as president of the committee. He also alleged that Salahuddin embezzled Tk 6.60 lakh by purchasing land in his name using school money. Salahuddin is also challenging the legality of including his case under the emergency powers rules. bdnews2
