 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chief justice Mohammed Ruhul Amin Thursday asked judges to spend more time and energy to reach the benefits of a free judiciary to people. He said the desired benefit of a judiciary independent of the influence of the executive would never be available unless the judges came up with collective efforts. The chief justice made the remarks at the inauguration ceremony on the second day of the two-day orientation programme for the district and sessions judges. He was the chief guest at the function organised at the Judiciary Administration Training Institute (JATI) while law adviser Mainul Hosein was the special guest. JATI director general Justice Hamidul Haq chaired the function. Justice MM Ruhul Amin of the Appellate Division also spoke. Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and registrar of the Supreme Court Iktedar Ahmed were present. Mainul said establishing state machinery based on justice, good governance and democracy was not possible without justice. The chief justice said the involvement of people in the criminal trial in the magistracy would be highest as a result of the separation of the judiciary. He urged the judges to see to it that people were not harassed as in the past. Admitting indiscipline in the judiciary, he said if anybody did not want to continue as judge they could resign. He said any misunderstanding and indiscipline in the judiciary must be removed. He urged the judges to watch out for controversy stemming from granting of bail. "You should make decisions on bail in the courtroom immediately after hearing. Don't give a decision after going to the chamber and returning. It creates misunderstanding and gives rise to controversy," the chief justice said. Mainul echoed the chief justice to say that separating the judiciary from the executive wing, the process of which had dragged on for years, was possible due to the favourable environment created by the caretaker government. "The responsibility of separating the judiciary was reposed on us since the constitution was framed in 1972." Mainul said independence of the judiciary meant recognising the people's trust in the conscience and judgement of the judges in delivering justice. It was aimed to ensure justice to helpless people. He said with the separation of the judiciary, the honour of the judges and the nation's status were elevated. The law adviser said in an independent country everybody including judges, ministers and advisers were all accountable to the people. He said despite financial limitations the government acted quickly to fulfil the needs spelled out by the chief justice. bdnew
