 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks bounced back Thursday following market corrections the previous day, buoyed by rising demand for bank shares, specially low-priced bank stocks. "Investors seem to be buying low-priced banking shares because many of the banking sector blue chips are more expensive. Moreover, bank stocks usually rise ahead of the announcement of profit figures in December," said Ahmad Rashid Lali, vice president of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). The DGEN or general index recovered 50.84 points or 1.80 percent to close at 2860.56. The DSE or all-share price index added 43.55 points or 1.82 percent to end at 2425.13. The DSE-20 closed at 2182.18, gaining 30.04 points or 1.39 percent. Turnover declined to Tk 2.41 billion on the trade of 17,649,853 shares. A total of 151 issues advanced, 41 lost and 16 held steady. Trust Bank and BRAC Bank led the gain in bank issues. Trust Bank, the most active issue, surged 9.71 percent to close at an all-time high of Tk 1036.5. BRAC Bank added 2.47 percent to Tk 1523.50 on speculation of its growth prospects. Shahjalal Bank, a low-quality issue that infrequently appears on the turnover table, emerged as the fifth most active scrip and surged 7.82 percent to Tk 337.75. The company, in response to a DSE query, said there was no undisclosed price-sensitive information. Shares of NCC Bank, Southeast Bank and One Bank also gained. Power sector shares closed mixed with Summit Power, a private power generation firm, emerging as the most active scrip in the sector. Summit Power rose 0.79 percent to close at Tk 1656.50. DESCO finished unchanged at Tk 1323. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh dipped. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange advanced, with 92 issues trading higher, 32 falling and five holding steady.
