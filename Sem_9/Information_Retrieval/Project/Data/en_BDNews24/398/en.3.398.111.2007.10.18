<TITLE> A national security council could tackle pre-Jan11 chaos: Moeen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  General Moeen U Ahmed said Wednesday it could be easier to tackle the situation prior to January 11 if there was a national security council. "If there was such a council it would have been possible to maintain balance in the administration in tackling the situation before January 11. If the common people are asked 90 percent of them would not want to go back to pre-1/11 situation." He said an elected government would run the country through next elections. "An election is a must," the army chief told Bangladeshi expatriates at a programme at World's Fair Marina in New York. He said the caretaker government would transfer power to an elected government. Moeen took questions from the expatriates after he delivered a speech at the Harvard University at 8:30pm New York time. Asked to comment on what if the BNP or the Awami League bounces back to power through the elections and reverses the changes the caretaker government made, he said: "We don't want to go back to the days before the Jan 11 changeover." The army chief said there were three options open before the Jan 11 changeover. The first was to stay back and not to intervene in politics. The second was military takeover and the third was to impose a state of emergency to create a proper environment for the elections. Moeen said he did not follow in the footsteps of past military rulers. Asked if the government was giving concession to Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh in its drive against corruption, Moeen said many of the Jamaat leaders' names were on the list of the corruption and terror suspects. "It's not true that the government is giving any incentive to Jamaat," he said. On a question of distortion of history and controversy over independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the army chief said it was beyond all doubts that Bangabandhu was the father of the nation. "Actually, both Bangabandhu and Ziaur Rahman are respected persons. There should not be any controversy," he said. bdnews24.com
