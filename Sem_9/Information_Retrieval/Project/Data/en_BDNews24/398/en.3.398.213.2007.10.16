The ICRC continues its physical rehabilitation services for amputees and mine victims in Myanmar and facilitates some family visits to detention centres, spokeswoman Carla Haddad said. Two weeks ago, the United Nations Human Rights Council asked Myanmar to let its investigator, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, to visit the country for the first time in four years.
