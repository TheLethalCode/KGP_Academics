 Chittagong, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)--A Chittagong court Wednesday rescheduled charge-framing against former state minister and BNP leader Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin and son Mir Mohammad Helal Uddin in two tax-dodging cases for Oct 30. Mirza Md Ayub Ali, acting judge of the Special Divisional Court of Chittagong, issued the order. "There is a High Court stay on the cases until Oct 29. So, the new date comes just after that," AKM Zahirul Haque, lawyer for the state told bdnews24.com. On an appeal from the defendant's lawyer, the court set Oct 17 for charge-framing. On Sept 16, assistant tax commissioner for Chittagong tax zone-2 Bhuban Mohan Tripura filed the cases against Nasir and his son with the Metropolitan Sessions' Judge Court of Chittagong. According to case details, the former state minister and his son suppressed tax information in their wealth statement submitted to the NBR. They were also accused of providing false information. Nasir has been sentenced to 13 and Helal to three years in jail in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Both of them are now behind bars. bdnews24.com/
