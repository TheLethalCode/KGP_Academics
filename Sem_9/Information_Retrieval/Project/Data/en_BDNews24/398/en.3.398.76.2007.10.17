 BEIJING, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has pledged reforms to make the Communist Party more accountable in the face of widespread official corruption, but changes must not come at the expense of the Party's grip on power, a senior official said on Wednesday. Five days away from announcing a new leadership team to run the world's most populous nation and its fourth-largest economy, the Party has also still not confirmed the method by which its members will select the ruling elite.

But Ouyang added that he was convinced that his Party was the only one fit to lead China, and that despite its shortcomings it remained attractive to the masses.
