<TEXT>
 WARSAW, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's main opposition party appeared to be gaining momentum less than a week before a parliamentary election as a poll on Monday showed it may win a majority of seats after a strong showing in a televised debate. In what analysts said may be a turning point in the bitter campaign, opposition leader Donald Tusk scored points in a Friday clash by criticising a backfooted Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski of unfulfilled promises and combative foreign policy. A poll for the Dziennik newspaper showed Tusk's Civic Platform with 46 percent support, which would give it 236 seats out of 460 in the lower house of parliament. Kaczynski's Law and Justice trailed by 14 points, the largest margin in the campaign ahead of Sunday's election. The European Union's biggest ex-communist member is heading for an early parliamentary election on Oct. 21. "It may not be just the debate anymore. It's clear that Law and Justice's campaign has stumbled," political analyst Marek Migalski was quoted as saying by the daily. "The party peaked 10 days too early." Polls have been erratic in recent weeks, but have mostly showed the two top parties running neck-and-neck. Another survey on Monday gave the opposition a one point lead. But some analysts cautioned that polls had underestimated the support for Law and Justice in the last parliamentary election two years ago. If the Civic Platform manages to consolidate its gains, it could be in a position to form Poland's first single party government since the collapse of communism nearly two decades ago with a parliamentary majority. But the centre-right party may seek governing partners, especially the agrarian PSL party, to help it override vetoes from the prime minister's twin brother Lech, the president. Most of the Civic Platform's gains came at the cost of the leftist bloc of former president Aleksander Kwasniewski, which lost four points in the Dziennik poll. Kwasniewski and Tusk face off in a debate on Monday evening. Tusk hopes to build on his television debate with Kaczynski, in which he appeared better prepared and more comfortable. Kaczynski's supporters blamed his weak performance on Tusk's supporters in the audience who jeered the prime minister several times during the debate. Kaczynski skipped campaigning on Sunday and will not appear on Monday, which his staff blamed on an illness. In an interview with the Wprost daily, the prime minister said he would resign if his party received less than 280 seats, or 60 percent of the parliament
