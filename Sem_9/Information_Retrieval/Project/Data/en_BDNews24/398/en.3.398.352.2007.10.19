 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Friday said the Election Commission did not decide yet on which group of BNP it would sit with for talks on electoral reforms. "We have not taken any decision on any group to invite," Huda told bdnews24.com by phone after senior correspondent Biplob Rahman asked him to react to some media reports that the commission would not sit with the expelled faction of the party. Three newspapers, quoting Huda, reported Friday that the commission had decided to sit with the BNP led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain, who was appointed by its detained party chief Khaleda Zia. Delwar has been leading the troubled BNP or its remnant after Khaleda expelled Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan as secretary general on Sept 3, the day she was arrested. Delwar had later said Bhuiyan has no right to represent the BNP while the expelled leader argued that the expulsion was not "acceptable" since it was a "violation of the party constitution". Bhuiyan insists that he originally represents the BNP mainstream. Huda brushed aside the media reports and said: "I haven't spoken to any of the particular dailies at all on the issue." Jugantor, Samokal and The Daily Star covered the issue. "We'll take our decision about the matter only after examining their party constitution." On August 28, the commission published a calendar to hold dialogues with 15 political parties to bring changes to the electoral laws. November 22 has been set for the BNP. Delwar wrote twice to the commission, asking the main polls office to communicate with them for all matters pertaining to the BNP. In September, Bhuiyan sent a similar letter to the commission. bdnews24.com
