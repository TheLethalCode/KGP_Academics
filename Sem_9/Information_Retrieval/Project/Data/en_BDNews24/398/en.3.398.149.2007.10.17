<TITLE> Zillur against expanding council of advisers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Wednesday said he saw no need for an increase in the number of advisers to the caretaker government. "It's not necessary," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home. "I don't think there's any need to appoint more advisers for a few months." "Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed had himself said earlier that an un-elected government should not stay in office for long." The AL leader's remarks came as a reaction to a recent statement by army chief General Moeen U Ahmed that the government was considering whether more advisers could be appointed. Moeen made the remark in London on Tuesday during a press meeting with Bangladeshi journalists working there. The AL leader praised the army chief's statement that he did not intend to be the country's next president. Zillur greeted the country's Hindu community on the occasion of Durga Puja. He also thanked the government for allowing detained party chief Sheikh Hasina to talk to her children who live abroad. Zillur repeated his demand that Hasina be released from jail. bdnew
