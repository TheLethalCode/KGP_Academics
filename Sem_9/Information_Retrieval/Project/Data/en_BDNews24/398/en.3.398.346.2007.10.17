<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  General Moeen U Ahmed has again rubbished talk of a military takeover and said he harbours no ambition to become the country's head of state. The army chief, who was on his way to New York, told reporters Tuesday at the High Commission in London: "I have no such ambition. Rumours of taking over as president are all figment of imagination." But he revealed government plans to appoint more cabinet members to accelerate the pace of work in the administration. "An expansion of the advisory council is being considered. The government is also thinking of appointing consultants," Moeen told Bangladeshi journalists. Moeen said: "A caretaker government gets only three months. It is taken for granted that the caretaker government will transfer power to an elected government after three months, although there is no constitutional binding. This caretaker government will stay on for two years." "It may be difficult for 10 advisers and the chief adviser to run the government by making tough decisions. It's part of the reason the government is thinking of expanding the advisory council." On arrival at Heathrow Airport, he said: "This government came with one missionthat is, a free, fair and credible election." "The Election Commission made a roadmap. The government is moving in that direction. The army is just assisting the government," said Moeen, en route to the US to deliver a lecture at Harvard University. "It's up to the political parties to follow the roadmap and turn it into a reality. Responsibility lies on them," the army chief told London-based Bangla TV, which posted its interview details on YouTube. BBC Radio quoted Moeen as saying there were three options open before the Jan 11 changeover. The first was not to intervene in politics, which would let the Jan 22 elections happen and more bloodshed would follow. The second was military takeover and the third was to impose a state of emergency to create a proper context for the elections. "It was easier to impose a military rule, but we opted for the third choice in line with the constitution." Moeen arrives in New York Wednesday and is set to deliver a lecture at Harvard University, which he said was a matter of prestige for Bangladesh Army. Bangladesh ambassador to the US M Humayun Kabir will host a programme for the army chief in a New York hotel. Bangladesh expatriates will also join the programme. The general will speak to journalists Thursday. bdnews
