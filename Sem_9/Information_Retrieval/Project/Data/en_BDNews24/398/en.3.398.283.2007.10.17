 TOKYO, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Indian Ocean naval mission in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan will likely be halted for two months and possibly up to a year, Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in an interview on Wednesday. The United States has urged Japan to keep supplying fuel and water to ships policing the Indian Ocean for weapons, drug smugglers and terrorists, but a bill permitting this is likely to be voted down in the upper house of parliament, where opposition parties hold a majority and can delay legislation. "Even if we can continue the mission, I think there will be a hiatus," Ishiba told Reuters in an interview at his office at the ministry's complex in central Tokyo. "However much we hurry, I think there will be a suspension of about two months," he said. The mission's current mandate expires on Nov. 1, and Japan's cabinet was set later in the day to endorse a bill continuing it. "In the best case, the opposition would agree to it and we could start again in a month or so," Ishiba said. "But in the worst possible case, there is a possibility it could take up to a year." The Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner are expected to vote the bill through the lower house, where they hold a large majority. If the upper house rejects the bill, as expected, the ruling bloc could enact the measure by approving it a second time in the lower house with a two-thirds majority. But analysts say this could raise hackles among voters and lead to parliamentary gridlock, possibly even sparking a general election. SUPPORT NEEDED Ishiba, at 50 one of the youngest members of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's cabinet and dubbed a defence "geek" by domestic media for his specialist knowledge, said the government would need a rise in public support for the mission before it could take such a step. "Opinion polls show about 50 percent of the people support the mission, about 40 percent are against and 10 percent don't know," he said. "If we can raise support to 60 percent, I think the electorate will accept our voting the bill through a second time. But that would be difficult under the current circumstances." Recent opinion polls on the mission have shown varying levels of public support, but a survey published in the Asahi newspaper on Tuesday showed 39 percent of respondents backed the mission, while 44 percent opposed it. About two-thirds of respondents said they wanted the ruling and opposition parties to compromise on the issue. Main opposition Democratic Party chief Ichiro Ozawa has said that the mission breaches the country's pacifist constitution and that Tokyo could contribute in other ways. "If there is room to compromise, we will take it, but it depends on how the opposition react," Ishiba said. Ishiba said other countries could take over Indian Ocean refuelling duties, but he argued that Japan, which imports 90 percent of its oil from the Middle East, must take an active role in trying to stabilise the region. "It is a question of what role Japan should take in the international war on terror," he said. "If we pull out, we will be taking the same stance as Russia. Is that acceptable?" The Democrats' Ozawa has said Japan could take part in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, a U.N.-authorised, NATO-led peacekeeping mission battling insurgents who are led by the country's former Taliban rulers. Ishiba reiterated the government view that this would violate the constitution and said Japan was in any case ill prepared to take part in such a risky missi
