<TITLE> Ericsson plunge takes Europe stocks down 1% </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ana Nicolaci da Costa LONDON, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell 1 percent early on Tuesday, as a profit warning by telecoms equipment group Ericsson sent its shares tumbling and rattled investors already grappling with renewed credit worries. At 0845 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.96 percent at 1,571.62, adding to its fall in the previous session, when it suffered its biggest daily loss in three weeks. Technology stocks were among the worst performers, as Ericsson fell more than 25 percent after it said it saw third-quarter earnings below market expectations and its own forecasts due to "an unexpected shift in the business mix". Nokia fell 2.1 percent and telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent fell 4.5 percent, also hit by a WestLB downgrade to "reduce" from "hold". Siemens slipped 2.9 percent to lead German losers on market talk the company could issue a profit warning. The company declined to comment. Stocks reacted little to a German investor sentiment survey which showed the outlook for Europe's largest economy held steady in October, outperforming expectations for it to deteriorate. US stocks fell overnight on a gloomy outlook from Citigroup and news that big banks were forming a fund to shore up the commercial paper market, seen by some as a testament to the fact that credit worries had yet to dissipate. "The market realises that we're not going to fix the mess in the US subprime market in just one quarter," said Jean-Francois Virolle, chief strategist at Global Equities, in Paris. FINANCIAL WOES Banks were the worst performers, with RBS down 2.5 percent, Barclays losing 3.2 percent and BNP Paribas shedding 1.4 percent. Lloyds TSB also lost 2.5 percent after US prosecutors filed civil money-laundering charges against the bank and the Bank of Cyprus, alleging both banks helped launder hundreds of million of dollars generated from an alleged securities fraud. Banks also did not seem to take solace from US Federal Reserve comments overnight. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said US financial markets are healthier after a turbulent summer, but a full recovery would take time and the Fed would act as needed to support market stability as well as noninflationary growth. And inflation was at the back of investors' minds with the oil price hitting its third consecutive record high near $87 a barrel. High crude prices are seen as a double-edged sword for stocks because they spur inflation on the one hand but benefit heavyweight energy companies on the other. BP was up 0.6 percent, Royal Dutch Shell gained 1.2 percent, and Total rose 0.9 percent. Among losers, Roche fell 2.8 percent after the Swiss drug maker missed forecasts with nine-month sales rising 12 percent to 33.95 billion Swiss francs but this was below the expected nine-month sales of 34.22 billion francs. Bucking the trend, RWE rose 1.9 percent after the firm's new chief executive said Germany's largest power producer plans to set up a renewable energy unit, to name a well-respected person to head it and to invest heavily in the field. Later in the day, the focus shifts to the US earnings season, with results from companies including IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Yahoo!. "(There are) slightly mixed messages coming out of the US earnings season," said Andrew Bell, European strategist at Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management.
