<TITLE> Mediators to skirt key issue in Kosovo talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BELGRADE, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of Serbia and Kosovo will discuss 14 points of potential agreement next week in Vienna, drawn up by mediators groping for compromise on the fate of the breakaway province. Monday's meeting of Serbs and Kosovo Albanians will be the third face-to-face encounter since a 'troika' of envoys from the United States, Russia and the European Union launched a last-ditch search for a solution in August. The list foresees agreement that Belgrade "will not govern" Kosovo nor "re-establish a physical presence" in the province, where Albanians form the 90-percent majority. But with the clock ticking down to a Dec. 10 deadline, the document makes no reference to the key question -- whether Kosovo Albanians can have the independence they demand, or be left in political limbo legally under Serbian sovereignty. "Without prejudice to the positions of both parties on status, the following principles can open a path to a solution," the document states, according to a copy seen by Reuters. Serbia is offering broad autonomy, saying Kosovo can govern itself provided it remains within Serbian borders. Albanians demand their own state, eight years since NATO bombs drove out Serb forces under late strongman Slobodan Milosevic and the United Nations took control. According to the document, Kosovo would have full authority over its finances and Belgrade would not "interfere" in its relationship with international financial institutions. But the lack of any key pointers to independence will worry Albanian leaders, who are under intense public pressure to declare independence after the talks end in December, and seek recognition from their Western backers. "This is not a list that will define the future status of Kosovo," said a diplomatic source. "These are just points on which the two sides might be able to agree." A Western official said the initiative would put pressure on the Albanians to negotiate, rather than simply wait out the clock and ask for recognition in the absence of a deal. Diplomats say chances of a compromise solution are slim. Between 7,500 and 12,000 civilians died during Serbia's 1998-99 counter-insurgency war, the vast majority Albanians. More than 800,000 Albanians fled or were expelled temporarily. Russia has blocked the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution offering independence supervised by the EU. Washington has indicated it would recognise a unilateral declaration, but the 27-member EU - which is preparing to deploy a police mission to the territory - is split. Analysts warn that a declaration recognised by some but shunned by others would do little to alter Kosovo's limbo status or help it overcome its dire economic proble
