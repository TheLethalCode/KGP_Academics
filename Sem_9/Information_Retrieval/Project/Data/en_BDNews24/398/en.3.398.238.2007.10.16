 TEHRAN, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin, using unusually positive language, said on Tuesday that there had been a "certain transformation" in the US position on missile defence and added that talks would continue. "The latest contacts with the American partners showed that there is a certain transformation in their position and we will continue the dialogue," Putin said in an interview with Iranian media which was released to Russian journalists travelling with him. Putin did not give further details but he held talks in Moscow at the end of last week with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and US Defence Secretary Robert Gates.
