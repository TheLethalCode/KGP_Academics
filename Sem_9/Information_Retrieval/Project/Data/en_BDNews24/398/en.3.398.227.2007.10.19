 PARIS, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The French government struck a pension deal with the main train drivers' union on Friday, driving a wedge between labour groups the day after a strike halted most rail traffic. Transport operators said there was still widespread disruption on Friday. Only a third of intercity trains were running, and half of Paris's metro trains, as a couple of militant unions continued their protest. The nationwide strike was the first big test of President Nicolas Sarkozy's determination to push through reforms needed to help the economy and also a test of union strength after his election this year on a platform of radical change. The overnight deal with the FGAAC letting train drivers retire up to five years earlier than other rail staff infuriated other unions. They had hoped to maintain a united front against plans to end the right of a minority of state workers to retire with less than 40 years of paid-up contributions. "What is very annoying is at the trainworkers' level, there is a category saving its own skin and abandoning the others," said Jean-Luc Gironde, spokesman for the Force Ouvriere union. "Worker solidarity, tell me where it is? That is going to create problems at the heart of the (railway) companies." All eight rail branches took part in Thursday's strike and they are meeting again on Friday and Monday to decide whether to carry on striking. FGAAC spokesman Jean-Michel Namy dismissed criticism from other unions as "theatricals" and said as far as his members were concerned any question of further strikes was "over". BATTLE OF PUBLIC OPINION CGT boss Bernard Thibault said on Thursday future strikes would be effective only if the unions were united and the strikes attracted as many people as Thursday's stoppage, when a record 73.5 percent rail workers walked off the job. The government wants to put state employees paying into so-called "special regimes" on an equal footing with civil servants and private sector workers, increasing their contribution period from 37.5 years to 40 years. However, it had indicated it would still be willing to give preferential treatment to a much smaller group of workers based on an assessment of the strains of their job. Under the terms of the FGAAC accord, drivers will still be able to retire at 50, but on a lower pension. The unions are facing a battle to win over the public. Many leftist politicians agree pensions need reform and an OpinionWay survey for Le Figaro daily showed 67 percent of those asked hoped Sarkozy would not back down. The government is refusing to budge on the key point of increasing the number of years people must work before retiring. "The government is open to dialogue and will continue to find with the social partners the path to an agreement," Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on a trip to the south of France. Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand will meet the main unions involved in Thursday's strike next week. The special pension regimes were introduced after World War Two, mainly for workers in physically demanding jobs. They are running deficits that will cost the taxpayer an estimated 5 billion euros ($7 billion) this ye
