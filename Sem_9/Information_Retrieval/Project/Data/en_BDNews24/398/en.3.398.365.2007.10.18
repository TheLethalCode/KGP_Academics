 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com) - The Goddess Durga had entered into the temple several hours before Harendra Chandra Sarker and hundreds of other devotees lined up to the priest to receive a drop of holy drink at Dhakeshawri Mandir. The deity entered temples on the morning of Thursday, to the accompaniment of bells, drums, conch shell horns and festive ululations on the day of Mahasaptami, which marks the beginning prayers for her blessings. Harendra looked happy after receiving a drop of Chandrabet from the priest. After drinking the consecrated liquid, he wiped his bare hand over his head. "It's a blessing from the Goddess. We all pray to her to receive her blessings," Harendra said. "We pray for the wellbeing of our children. Did mother come to pray? I prayed for the same things that she would have," said an older lady who came to the temple with her son. Subal Krisna Roy and his wife also came with their child. "I've come here for the puja for over 20 years. It gives me a feeling of relief," he said. But Subal was not happy with the morning rain that lessened the fanfare of crowds coming to visit the Goddess. Many others have also gone home during Eid holidays and have not returned, he said. "I love it. I love to see the sculptors and the fair," said young visitor Labannya Chowdhury accompanied by her uncle and younger sister. "I enjoy it. I like the festive mood," said Shahidul Islam who came to visit the puja along with his brothers and sisters. Durga puja, which continues a long tradition of pulling together people from many walks of life, is still able to attract festival fans. Mehnaz, a young visitor, when asked why she had come, shot back, "Why did you come?" She had insisted that her father bring her to see the puja immediately after breakfast. bd
