<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Tuesday said it backed the efforts of the United Nations to resolve the crisis in Myanmar in the wake of the recent violent crackdown on peaceful, pro-democratic movement. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said in a media statement that Bangladesh was fully with the effort of Ibrahim Gambari, special envoy of the UN secretary-general, for an end to the crisis. Gambari is currently on a mission in the region to get all neighbours engaged in his effort. "We are pleased that Mr Gambari has been able to engage all sides in his dialogues," the statement quoted Iftekhar as saying. He made Bangladesh's position clear about Myanmar affairs at a time when Japan announced an aid-cut to the troubled nation and the west cranked up further pressure on the all-powerful military junta for a dialogue with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The European Union Monday stiffened its sanctions and US President George W Bush threatened to follow suit in response to the junta's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, Reuters reported. British prime minister Gordon Brown, however, took another way, promising economic help for the impoverished southeast Asian nation if it began moves towards democracy. Bangladesh has said it has "confidence" in Gambari's capabilities. "I have confidence in his (Gambari's) capabilities and wish his mission all success and reiterate that peaceful efforts should receive (the) highest international priority in stabilising the situation in that country," Chowdhury was quoted as saying in the statement. b
