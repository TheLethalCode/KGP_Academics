<TITLE> Britain to farm more wheat as prices rise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British farmers have been sowing much more wheat this year, driven by record prices, near ideal planting conditions, an end to rules that kept land out of production and the woes of the livestock sector. "We are looking at an increase in the wheat area of maybe 5 to 10 percent," Susan Twining of crop consultants ADAS said. Wheat prices have risen sharply, with November futures on Liffe doubling between early April and its record peak of 197.50 pounds ($402.80) on September 5. The market subsequently has fallen back, with November trading around 157 pounds on Tuesday, but prices remain far above the range of about 65 to 85 pounds in 2005 and 2006. "Winter wheat hectarage is going to increase markedly," said Tim Hirst, Seeds Director for farmers cooperative Grainfarmers, adding seed sales have been strong and certain varieties had been sold out for some time. "That (high price) is encouraging everyone to put more wheat in," he added. Twining said the European Union's decision to peg the set-aside rate at zero for 2008 crops would also boost the area. "The expectation is the majority of that land that comes back into production will go into winter wheat although some will probably be spring barley as well," Twining said. The EU agreed on Sept. 26 to suspend a rule forcing farmers to leave some land fallow, known as set-aside, in a bid to increase grain supply at a time of shrinking stocks. The rule was introduced in the early 1990s as the EU sought to reduce its grain mountains. FEED COSTS Twining also said problems of Britain's livestock sector, with some producers struggling to stay in business due to soaring feed costs, could add to the cereal area. "Because of feeding costs and the relative profitability of arable versus livestock production there is an expectation that some grassland may come back to arable production," she said. Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and bluetongue during the last few months have also added to pressure on Britain's already struggling livestock producers. UK wheat area for this year's harvest was 1.82 million hectares, according to Britain's farm ministry, and so a rise of 10 pecent could see it rise above 2.00 million. "Once you get above 2 million hectares you get a bit of a strain on some of the infrastructure in the cereal industry. You potentially have problems with storage and transport," she said. Mark Isaacson, chief executive of Fengrain, the leading grain cooperative in Britain's major wheat growing area East Anglia, said the rise in that region could be 5 to 8 percent. "Wheat plantings are definitely going to be up. It has gone in extremely well with good seed beds and the right amount of moisture. It looks pretty promising I would say," Isaacson said. Rapeseed area in Britain may slip back slightly as wheat expands although any decline is likely to be modest. "I think rapeseed has a good place in rotations now. I wouldn't necessarily expect too much of a backward step," Isaacson said. UK rapeseed area for this year's harvest rose 20.7 percent to 603,000 hectares, according to Britain's farm ministry. Twining of ADAS said rapeseed remained the most profitable break crop. "At the moment I am looking at a 2 to 3 percent decrease based on early indications," she said. Hirst of Grainfarmers, however, said the great profitability of wheat combined with some rotation and disease concerns after the recent rapid rise in area would cut rapeseed plantings. "I think rapeseed area this year will be down by a good 5 percent," he said.
