<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh are likely to miss the service of defender Nazrul Islam in the FIFA World Cup pre-qualifier tie against Tajikistan on October 28 following Nazrul's determination not to join the ongoing camp. "I am yet to change my mind to join the ongoing camp this time," Nazrul told bdnews24.com Thursday. "Except this one, I can only consider joining the camp in the next assignment of the national team if the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) calls me for the side," said Nazrul adding that he was now giving his time to his sick wife. The booters, having enjoyed the Eid holidays, resumed the residential camp at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) Tuesday, but central defender Nazrul Nazrul did not turn up citing personal problem. It, however, learnt that Nazrul did not join the camp following a small conflict with Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin, who reportedly did not have talks with Nazrul at the camp for a long time. It was reported that Nayeemuddin stopped talking to Nazrul during the camp at the BKSP as Nazrul alleged that the coach had assigned hard task to all players during the fitness training in Cox's Bazar. Nayeemuddin denying the allegation said that he generally talks less with the players. The coach Wednesday night talked to Nazrul after learning that Nazrul might return to the camp if the coach made him request. "I had a discussion for 27 minutes with Nazrul and request him to return to the camp," Nayeemuddin told bdnews24.com Thursday. He said, "I had asked him to talk to me rather than to the media, and I have requested him to join the camp as there is no problem in the camp."
