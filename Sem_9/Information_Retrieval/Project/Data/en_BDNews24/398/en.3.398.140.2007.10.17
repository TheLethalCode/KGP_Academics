 LAHORE, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has not yet received any request to send players or officials to testify at the inquest of former coach Bob Woolmer which began on Tuesday in Kingston, Jamaica. "We have got no request from the Kingston coroner or their police as yet to send anyone. But if they do send us a request we will decide on it then," PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi told Reuters on Wednesday. "We have yet to take a policy decision on what to do if we are asked to send any witnesses but we wouldn't like to push our players or officials to go there." Woolmer died during the World Cup in the West Indies this year after being found unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston one day after the team had lost to Ireland. Jamaican police first said Woolmer had been strangled but in June they announced that he had died a natural death according to independent pathologists. "We see this inquest basically as an internal matter of the Jamaican government and police. Such inquests are part of their legal procedure," Naghmi said. "We are not concerned with the inquest and we also would not like our players or officials to go thorough the entire episode again.
