 NEW YORK, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British girl band Spice Girls 'Greatest Hits' album will only be available in the United States through lingerie chain Victoria's Secret for the first two months of its release. Under a deal announced on Tuesday, Emma, Geri, Mel B, Melanie C and Victoria -- aka Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm and Victoria Beckham -- will also perform at the 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.' Capitol Music Group, part of EMI Group, said 'Spice Girls: Greatest Hits' would go on sale at Victoria's Secret, owned by Limited Brands, on November 13 and that the fashion show would be broadcast on CBS on December 4. The album will be made available elsewhere in the United States from January 15, 2008. Along with 13 of the Spice Girls hits, like 'Wannabe' and 'Spice Up Your Life,' the album will also include two new songs  'Voodoo,' and 'Headlines (Friendship Never Ends),' which will be the group's first new single since 2000. The Spice Girls announced in late June that they were reforming, seven years after they split, and unveiled plans for a 10-date world tour. More gigs are being added to meet demand. The tour starts on December 2 in Vancouver. Over 3 million people registered online to buy tickets, which promoters say suggests that up to 18 million fans want to see the five women in action again.
