 BEIJING, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China is spreading prosperity in Africa where the West failed, a Chinese bank official said on Thursday in a sharp rebuke to critics of his country's growing role in the world's poorest continent. Li Ruogu, president of China's state-owned Export-Import Bank, key funder of China's push into Africa, said roads and radios were more urgent needs for Africans than human rights and freedom, and that China was delivering such concrete benefits.

"Western countries talk about human rights and freedom every day, but if the people there can't even watch television or listen to radio, how can they enjoy human rights and freedom?" Li said. China has recently claimed credit for persuading Sudan to accept U.N peacekeepers in the troubled Darfur region and it has won praise from the United States for its "constructive role" in dealings with Khartoum. ExIm Bank has also been working to address some concerns of international donors, signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank earlier this year to improve coordination of development projects. As one of China's three policy lenders that make loans explicitly in support of government policies, ExIm Bank has invested in some 300 projects across Africa with a focus on building roads, railways, ports and mines. China argues its own rapid growth and experience in lifting more than 400 million people out of poverty over past 20 years could provide valuable lessons to Africans. "I visited Africa 11 times within two years, and I can feel the strong desire of African people and governments to develop the local economy and cooperate with China", he sa
