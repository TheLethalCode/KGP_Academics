 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  Hindus across the country Friday observed Kumari Puja, the rite of making offerings to a young girl who represents the goddess Durga rather than to an icon on Mahashtami or the eighth day of the Puja. A six-year-old girl was selected to represent Durga at Ramkrishna Mission and was placed in the goddess' seat at 11am. Hindu scripture allows girls aged between one year and 16 years to be a model of the goddess Durga during the rite. Students at the Mission said the Kumari was given a bath, adorned with new clothes, and decorated with flower garlands, ornaments and cosmetics before being presented before devotees. Kumari Puja were observed with pomp at a number of maths in Nayaranganj and Dinajpur. Hundreds of people thronged the Mission in the capital to pay their respects to the Kumari. Some were able make darshan , while others, caught in the crowds, paid their respects from afar. Devotees from all over the country came to participate in the Kumari Puja at Ramkrishna Mission. Bharat Krishna Bannerjee came from Dinajpur on a night coach. Bannerjee said he tries to attend the event at the Ramkrishna Mission every year, but missed a few years because he was ill. Asked why he makes the trip to Dhaka even though Kumari Puja is held in Dinajpur, he said, "The Puja is observed centrally in Dhaka mainly at the Mission. When we lived in Dhaka we used to attend this Kumari Puja. I feel good when I come here." "Perhaps it is the wish of the Mother," he said, offering pronam to the goddess. Chameli Mallick, another visitor, said, "Kumari Puja is not held everywhere. So we come to the Mission. We come every year." She said she enjoys the Puja at the Mission and the festive crowds there. Mondops around the country have been receiving worshippers since Friday morning. The Ramkrishna Mission Puja Mandap was overflowing with devotees when the model of the goddess was brought to the math at 11am. Hundreds stood in queue awaiting the blessed offerings being distributed to devotees and visitors. The Mission premises wore a festive look with people of all ages dressed in colourful attire. Announcements to help locate friends and family lost in the crowds kept up a steady chant of names. Outside the Mission math , ice cream vendors, and hawkers selling peanuts, cigarettes, chocolates and toys plied their goods. The sound of children imploring their parents for toys and of parents cajoling and obliging them in turn wafted through the crowds. bdnews24.
