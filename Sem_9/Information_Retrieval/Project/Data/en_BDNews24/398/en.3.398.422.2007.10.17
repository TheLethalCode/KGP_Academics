Critics say razing part of Mabira would threaten rare species, lose a watershed for streams that feed Lake Victoria and remove a buffer against pollution from two industrial towns. Scientists estimate some 20 percent of net global emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, are caused by deforestation, because trees suck carbon from the atmosphere. Experts say Mabira sinks millions of tonnes of carbon. A spokesman for Museveni, Tamale Mirundi, told Reuters new land must be found for the sugarcane. "If the government finds an alternative, I don't think the president has any special interest in pursuing this," he said.
