 BAGHDAD, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bombs targeting an Iraqi army patrol in the capital Baghdad and a police station in the north of the country on Tuesday killed at least 10 people and wounded 100, police said. Three soldiers and three civilians died when a car bomb parked in Sa'adoun Street in central Baghdad exploded by an Iraqi army patrol. Five soldiers and 20 civilians were wounded. A truck bomb in the northern city of Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad, destroyed a police station, killing at least four people and wounding some 75, police said. In the eastern Baghdad district of Zayouna, gunmen attacked a police checkpoint killing three policemen and wounding two. While overall levels of violence in parts of Baghdad and surrounding areas have declined since the US army sent an extra 30,000 troops this year to quell violence, there has been a spate of car bomb attacks on Iraqi police and security forces. Al Qaeda vowed recently to target them and tribal leaders who have begun working with US forces to drive the Islamist militants out of their communities.
