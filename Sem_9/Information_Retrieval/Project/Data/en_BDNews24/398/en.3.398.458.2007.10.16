 RIYADH, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's king renewed the four-year terms of most of the members of a body that draws the oil policy of the world's top oil exporter in a decree published on Tuesday. Only one of the 12 members of the Supreme Council of Petroleum and Minerals was replaced, according to a decree published by the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA). King Abdullah, who chairs the powerful body, appointed Mohammad al-Suwail to replace Saleh al-Azel, and kept key figures including Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi and the head of the state hydrocarbons conglomerate Saudi Aramco as members. Suwail is the former head of the state telecommunications watchdog. The council also includes the OPEC member state's foreign and finance ministers as well as the deputy prime minister.
