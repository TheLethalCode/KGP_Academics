 SEOUL, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president said on Friday he sees the North Korean government as stable and wanting to resolve the nuclear issue to improve relations with the United States. "The reason that North Korea wants to resolve the nuclear issue is because it wants to improve relations with the United States," Roh Moo-hyun told foreign reporters at the presidential Blue House. Impoverished North Korea, which conducted its first nuclear test a year ago, struck a deal in February with regional powers to end its nuclear weapons programme in return for massive aid and ending its status as an international pariah.

They also fear a flood of refugees coming over the border from the North -- whose is economy is less than 3 percent the size of the South's. "There is no such thing as unification costs," Roh said adding the concept was borne out of the Germany's unification in the 1990s and does not apply to North Korea. Earlier this month, at only the second summit of the leaders of the Koreas divided for more than half a century, Roh and Kim agreed to economic cooperation projects where the South would help rebuild the North's creaky infrastructure. As one analyst said Roh is backing a go-slow approach, or "unification on the instalment plan." "To us, North Korea is a vast market in which we can make a great deal of investment," Roh sa
