<TITLE> We are no shaky government: Moeen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moinuddin Naser and Manjurul Islam New York, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  General Moeen U Ahmed has said the interim government backed by his forces is not a "shaky" one as he says people are "happy" with the administration. "Why do you think we are shaky? Do you live in Bangladesh? We are open enough to accept the opinion of others. It does not mean that we are shaky," the army chief said to a questioner as he faced a barrage of queries from expatriate Bangladeshi reporters in New York. "People are happy (with us)." Moeen met local community journalists at the Office of Bangladesh Consulate General in New York Thursday evening (New York time). Bangladesh permanent representative to the United Nations Ismat Jahan and consul general Shamsul Haque were present at the meeting. Moeen arrived in the United States Wednesday from London and is expected to deliver a lecture at Harvard University. On the negation of his being president of the country, he said the statement he had delivered in London was wrongly quoted by the press. Moeen emphasised that he had never said he did not want to be the president of the country, rather he said he "had no intention" to become the president. Replying to a query about if Moeen was in New York as a campaigner, protector or theoretician of the present government, he initially grinned and humbly said: "I am nothing of the government." He said the government had nothing personal against two former prime ministers. "We could set up a military tribunal to try them. But we didn't do so because we want to deliver justice," he said. "Justice should not be denied." He said the military could take over in the wake of the chaos before Jan 11 when president Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency to quell weeks of street violence over political reforms. "But we didn't go by that. We helped install the caretaker government," he said. bdnews
