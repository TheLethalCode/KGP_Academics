 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka stocks soared in midday trade Tuesday, triggered by a surge in Rupali Bank shares amid a buying spree on reports that its future owner would close the deal with the government by November. By 12:53pm, the DGEN or general index rallied 70.61 points or 2.51 percent to 2873.22, the highest level the bourse has ever recorded. The DSI or all-share price index surged 116.81 points or 5 percent to hit its highest at 2449.15 on the first trading day after the Eid.
