 HONG KONG, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks slid on Wednesday after disappointing earnings from big US banks sparked profit worries, but investors bought energy shares such as Woodside Petroleum after crude oil hit another record high. Weakness in equities shored up demand for safe-haven assets including Japanese government bonds, while the yen rose against other major currencies ahead of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries on Friday. Better-than-expected earnings from technology bellwethers Intel Corp and Yahoo, which posted results after the US market closed, had little impact on Asian counterparts but are expected to lift Wall Street on Wednesday. "It's not a situation where we're seeing, say, Advantest really gaining because Intel's shares were strong," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. "But this is helping to keep the market from dropping further in the face of the selling of bank shares and real estate that we're seeing today." By 0219 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had fallen 1.1 percent to a one-week low, while Tokyo's Nikkei average also dropped 1.1 percent to a two-week low. The MSCI index has shed nearly 3 percent from a record high set last Thursday. Financial shares remained a major drag on markets after big US banks including Wells Fargo & Co posted profits that missed Wall Street estimates due to credit losses. Australia's Macquarie Bank lost 1.6 percent, Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ slipped 3.6 percent and South Korea's Shinhan Financial Group dipped 3.6 percent. "Generally, the mood is still a bit sour at the moment on the financial firms" said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Equities. Among technology stocks, only Yahoo Japan was a clear winner, rising nearly 5 percent after Yahoo Inc's results and optimistic outlook. ENERGY Energy stocks once again outperformed the market, benefiting from strong oil prices. Australia's Woodside Petroleum climbed 1.8 percent and Santos added 1.4 percent. After peaking at a record $88.20 a barrel on Tuesday on supply fears and tensions between Iraq and Turkey over Kurdish separatist activity, US crude was trading at $87.47. "The market is still very much focused on the Turkey-Iraq tensions for the short term but I believe it is overvalued by at least $10 and will probably come off within the week," said Makoto Takeda of Tokyo's Bansei Securities. Elsewhere, Sanyo Electric dropped 7.1 percent after giving up on the sale of its semiconductor unit after talks with a private equity firm broke down, while steel maker POSCO slid 6.3 percent, a day after reporting an unexpected fall in quarterly profit. YEN, BONDS FIRM In the forex market, diminished risk appetite was evident, with the yen gaining against higher-yielding currencies such as the euro and the Australian dollar. Investors have been borrowing the low-yielding yen to purchase riskier but better-yielding assets but they tend to reverse or avoid those trades at times of heightened risk aversion. "The market will continue to watch stocks but unless there is significant news or some big event, big moves in currencies are unlikely ahead of the G7 meeting," said a dealer at a Japanese bank. The dollar fell to a 1-1/2-week low near 116.30 yen, while the euro slipped to 164.73 yen, both well off recent highs near 118 yen for the dollar and 167.72 yen for the euro. The Australian dollar was at 88.71 US cents and 103.31 yen, compared with peaks near 90.80 US cents and 106.86 yen on Monday. In this environment, Japanese government bonds (JGBs) shone, pushing yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB slid 3.5 basis points to a two-week low of 1.66 percent. Gold edged up after striking a 28-year high in the previous session. It traded at $762.80 an ounce, near Tuesday's peak of $766.60.
