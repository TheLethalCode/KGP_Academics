 LONDON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Simon Jones is expected to sign a contract with county side Worcestershire this week after deciding to leave Glamorgan. "Naturally we're disappointed that Simon has turned down our offer and decided to leave Glamorgan," Glamorgan chief executive Mike Fatkin told the county's Web site (www.glamorgancricket.com) on Wednesday. "We understand he is going to Worcestershire and we wish him well there." Steve Rhodes, director of cricket at Worcestershire, was quoted by the BBC Web site (www.bbc.co.uk) as saying: "We've been interested all along once we knew Simon might be on the move. But until it's signed, we can't get too carried away, but remain optimistic." Jones, 28, played a major part in England's Ashes win over Australia in 2005 but has struggled with injury since, making just four championship appearances for Glamorgan last season
