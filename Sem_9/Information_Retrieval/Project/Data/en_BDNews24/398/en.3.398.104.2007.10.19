 SARAJEVO, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnia's international peace overseer Miroslav Lajcak imposed a law on Friday simplifying government decision-making and gave a deadline to parliament to streamline its procedures as well. "I am determined to have a functional and efficient state, which adopts laws and works on development policy," he told a news conference. He said he was reducing a quota for quorum in the central government needed to adopt laws. Until now, the absence of ministers has often blocked the passage of important laws. He also urged parliament to adopt by Dec. 1 a set of measures simplifying a complex procedure for passing laws. "Unless these changes are adopted by Dec. 1, I will have no choice but to use my authorities and impose them," he said. Under the Dayton peace accords that ended the Balkan country's 1992-95 war, Bosnia is made up of two autonomous regions, the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic. They are linked by a weak central government whose functioning is often hijacked by ethnic and regional rivalry. Political bickering among Bosnia's Muslim, Serb and Croat leaders has halted reforms over the past 18 months. Only one law relating to reforms needed for European integration was adopted. Serb Republic Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who wants strong regions and a weak central government, said Lajcak's decision to change the government quorum was unacceptable. But Lajcak said opposition to his measures would be seen as working against the Dayton peace agreement. "Those who think they can refuse or obstruct these efforts, work against the Dayton peace agreement and against the common will of the international community," the powerful envoy, who can impose laws and sack officials, told a news conference. "Nobody has yet succeeded at that," Lajcak added.
