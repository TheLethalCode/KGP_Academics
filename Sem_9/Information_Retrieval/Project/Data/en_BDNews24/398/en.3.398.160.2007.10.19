<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  Onion prices rose by roughly 30 percent as most essential commodities became pricier Friday even though government intervention halted spiralling prices towards the end of Ramadan. Soybean oil, onion, atta, potato, broiler chicken and powdered milk prices increased Friday. Only the price of gram decreased. Onion prices registered the steepest rise by more than 30 percent. Local and imported onion prices retained a large difference with local onions going for Tk 50 to 56 and the imported variety for Tk 48 to 52 per kilogram. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) said onion prices rose by 32.5 percent over the course of a month. Onion prices have shot up by Tk 6 to 8 per kg in markets over the last week. A break in the supply of Indian onions for two weeks has caused local prices to go up, sellers said. They said onion prices could decrease after India resumes export. But not by much, as India has reportedly increased the price of the commodity by US$ 50 per ton. The TCB said the price of soybean oil had crossed the government fixed rate of Tk 80 and was selling at Tk 82 per litre Friday. The price of soybean oil rose by more than five percent over a month. According to the TCB, soybean oil was selling for Tk 78 to 80 per litre on the open market but retailers were charging Tk 3-4 more. Broiler chicken Friday sold for Tk 100 to 105 per kg, up from Tk 85 to 95 a month ago. The price of powdered milk has increased by Tk 15 to 20 per kg. Potato prices rose by Tk 1 to 2 per kg while eggs sold at Tk 16 to 17 for a set of four on Friday, up by Tk 1. BDR 'fair price' shops, closed for Eid, are scheduled to reopen Sunday, but their number is expected to be reduced. Col Abdul Halim, in charge of the BDR's operation Daal Bhat, told bdnews24.com, "The shops will open Sunday. During Ramadan the number of shops was increased to 100 but will now be decreased." He said there were 20 shops before Ramadan, and just 40 shops will remain in operation after the Eid holiday. But market supervision and other measures to ensure fair prices will continue, he said. bdnews24
