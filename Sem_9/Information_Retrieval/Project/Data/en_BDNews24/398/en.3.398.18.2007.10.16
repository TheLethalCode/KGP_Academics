<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's parliament approved on Tuesday amendments to a text on constitutional change due to be submitted to voters in a referendum on Sunday, thus averting the risk of a legal challenge to President Abdullah Gul's status. The constitutional changes, which voters are widely expected to approve, envisage Turkey's president being elected in future directly by the people, not by parliament as at present. Gul was elected by parliament in August for a seven-year term. Some legal experts had said he would have to resign and run again for election if voters back the constitutional changes in the referendum.
