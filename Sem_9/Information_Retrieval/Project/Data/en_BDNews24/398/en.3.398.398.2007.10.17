 TEHRAN, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a "special message" to Iran on its disputed atomic programme and other issues, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator told an Iranian news agency on Wednesday without giving details. Putin's visit to Tehran on Tuesday was watched closely because of Moscow's possible leverage in the Islamic Republic's nuclear row with the West. Putin held talks with Iranian leaders including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. "Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his trip to Tehran, had a special message for Iranian officials," Ali Larijani told the official IRNA news agency, adding that the nuclear programme was part of it.
