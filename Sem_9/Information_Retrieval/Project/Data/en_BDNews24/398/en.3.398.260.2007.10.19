 MOSCOW, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia plans to turn the tables on Western critics of its human rights record by setting up an organisation to monitor rights abuses in Europe and the United States, the man behind the project said on Friday. Anatoly Kucherena, a prominent lawyer and presidential appointee to an official council on human rights and civil society, said the organisation would have its headquarters either in Brussels or Germany.

The centre's aim is to facilitate "an exchange of opinions" within the human rights community, not to get into a political confrontation with the West, he said. "Of course there are problems with human rights in Russia," Kucherena said. "But for me personally, as Anatoly Kucherena, I really do not like it when information contained in these reports (by Western organisations on rights in Russia) ... has some kind of ideological subtext. "To be honest, it is unpleasant when our country is ranked in 145th place in some index (of human rights) and it is not clear what methodology was used for that ... Of course that upsets m
