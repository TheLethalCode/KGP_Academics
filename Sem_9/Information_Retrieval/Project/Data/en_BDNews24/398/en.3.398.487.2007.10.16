 Dhaka, October 16 (bdnews24.com)Five-day celebrations of Durga Puja, the major Hindu religious festival, take off Wednesday. The goddess arrives from her husband's to her father's domain in a palanquin through the Shashti Puja and will return riding an elephant, according to a calendar followed by Hindu priests and religious scholars to determine rites and rituals. It is said that such arrivals occasion afflictions for humans on earth, but as the deity makes her return trip on an elephant, the good earth becomes replete with the fullest of granaries. Then come the Shaptami, Ashtami, Nabami and Dashami, the days the goddess stays on earth to conduct a war against the evil forces of Ashur. The Durga Puja begins just after the greatest Muslim religious festival of Eid-ul-Fitr. With puja preparations almost complete by now, the environs now reverberate with celestial chants to usher in the mighty deity. A total of 21,649 puja pavilions, outnumbering the 2006 count by 134, have been built to celebrate the arrival of the great goddess. Dhaka city alone boasts 162 pavilions located in 21 areas. Security has been beefed up all over the country to ensure a safe and peaceful environment for the festivities. A 6,000-strong RAB and police force has been deployed to ensure safety. bdnews24.co
