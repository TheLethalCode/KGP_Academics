 MILAN, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Part of the San Siro stadium will be closed for Inter Milan's next Serie A home game as punishment for offensive banners their fans displayed during Napoli's visit 10 days ago. "Fans of the host club grouped in the second tier of the north stand showed large banners with statements insulting to the rival fans and, above all, their city of origin," the Italian Soccer League said in a statement on its Web site (www.lega-calcio.it). "In the second half chants of a similar derogatory tone were heard from the same sector of the stadium." One of the banners read: "Naples, Sewer of Italy". As a result the second tier of the San Siro's north stand, the Curva Nord, will be empty for Genoa's visit on Oct. 31. Inter were also fined 30,000 euros. Napoli fans had been banned from travelling to the Oct. 6 game, which champions Inter won 2-1, because it was considered a high-risk encounter but around 1,000 of them still managed to buy ticket
