<TITLE> Merkel keen to allay fears, build Baltic gas link </TITLE>

 WIESBADEN, Germany, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and Germany hope to build a trans-Baltic gas pipeline on time and are keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. "As far as the Nord Stream natural gas line is concerned, we've just intensively talked about that again in the German-Russian governmental consultations," Merkel told a news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "The project is politically desired. Where there are problems implementing it economically, we can help -- if political talks help. If investment conditions need clearing up, that must ensue at a company level," she added. Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom has teamed up with Germany's BASF and E.ON to build the 5 billion euro ($7.12 billion) link, which will run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The Nord Stream project is run by Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder, who has been criticised at home for accepting a lucrative job from Gazprom soon after leaving the office. Nord Stream is key to Gazprom's policies of diversifying export routes after its pricing disputes with Ukraine and Belarus led to major cuts in gas and oil deliveries to Europe over the past two years. Russia supplies one quarter of Europe's gas and is also an important source of crude for the European Union. Some countries, including the former Soviet Baltic republics and Poland have raised concerns about the environmental safety of Nord Stream, which recently agreed to change the route to place it away from the known World War Two munitions dump sites. Poland is also concerned that it could be more vulnerable to cuts in Russian supplies of gas for its own use, once the Baltic route provides Moscow with an alternative to pipelines across Polish soil as a means of exporting gas to Europe. Merkel said Moscow and Berlin were ready to soothe differences with transit states. "We see no need to act at the moment, so I can only say that in my view the project will go ahead, and that ways and means will be found to talk to one another about the difficulties there still are with transit countries," she said. "As far as Germany is concerned at any rate, we want to see this project completed and economically implemented," she added. Russian Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko told reporters that talks would continue to resolve the concerns of countries that have criticised the pipeline. "The project is going according to plan, but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with Baltic Sea littoral states in relation to the Convention on the Law of the Sea," he said. "We are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline," said Khristenko, adding that Russia's existing Blue Stream gas export line under the Black Sea to Turkey provided ample proof.
