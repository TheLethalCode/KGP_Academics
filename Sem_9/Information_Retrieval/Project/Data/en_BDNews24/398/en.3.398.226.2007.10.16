 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Ittefaq Group of Publications has decided to remove Anwar Hossain Manju as publisher of the Bangla-language newspaper Ittefaq, his brother and information adviser Mainul Hosein said Tuesday. "The board of directors (of Ittefaq Group of Publications) decided against him (Manju) because he was convicted in a narcotics case and is absconding," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. At a meeting on October 10, four company directors voted 3-1 for the removal of Manju, Mainul said. Two directorsManju himself and wife Tasmima Hossainwere absent from the meeting. They are on the run. "We did this in order to keep the newspaper afloat. Under the law, if a publisher is convicted of criminal charges and remains on the run for more than six months, the newspaper's declaration will be cancelled," the adviser said. There was no clear decision on Manju's post as editor. Mainul said: "We will decide that later." Rahat Khan is acting editor of the newspaper. Mainul, also publisher of the English-language daily The New Nation, said the deputy commissioner's office had already been informed about the planned changes in the newspaper's management. Saju Hosein, the information adviser's wife, will take over Manju's responsibilities as publisher for the time being. Manju was sentenced to five years in jail in a June 26 verdict by a Dhaka court. bdnews24.com/
