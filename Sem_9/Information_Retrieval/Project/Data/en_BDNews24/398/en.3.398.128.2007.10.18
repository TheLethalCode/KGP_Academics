 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government is exploring new markets for manpower export following the recent 'ban' on Bangladeshi workers by the Malaysian government. The probable new manpower export destinations are Romania, Poland, Nigeria, Angola, and Republic of the Russian Federation, said a government statement Thursday. The ministry is considering an integrated policy to fill gaps in the labour market created by an ageing population in Europe and America, said the statement issued by the Ministry of expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment. The ministry also suggested those interested in going to Europe needed better skills and command over English and other European languages. The statement was issued in the wake of newspapers reports of the manpower situation following the Malaysian freeze on Bangladeshi workers, the ministry said. According to ministry figures, 630,000 workers have so far been selected for jobs overseas and over 428,000 have departed Bangladesh. bdne
