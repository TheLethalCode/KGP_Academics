 PARIS, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba has said he wants to quit Chelsea three years after joining the Premier League club. "I want to leave Chelsea. Something is broken with the club," Drogba told the France Football magazine due to be published on Friday. The 29-year-old, who has scored 43 Premier League goals for the west London side, was one of the players most affected by Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho's departure last month. The coach, who led Chelsea to back-to-back league titles in 2005 and 2006, has been replaced by Israel's Avram Grant. Mourinho spent 24 million pounds ($49.06 million) when he bought Drogba from Olympique Marseille in July 2004. The striker took a while to settle before finding his form with a vengeance last season, scoring 33 goals for the Stamford Bridge club. Drogba became Chelsea's attacking talisman as they achieved an FA Cup-League Cup double in 2007. He scored in the 1-0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final at Wembley and was on target twice in the 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final in Cardiff
