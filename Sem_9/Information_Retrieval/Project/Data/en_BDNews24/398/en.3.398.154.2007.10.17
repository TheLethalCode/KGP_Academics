<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com) -- The National Board of Revenue Wednesday approved a plan to file cases against seven high-profile people for dodging tax, said NBR chairman Badiur Rahman. "The board has given the approval. We're going to file the cases immediately," Rahman told reporters in his office, without disclosing the names of the accused and the date for filing the cases. Cases against yet another eight people are awaiting approval, Rahman said. The NBR has so far approved cases against 39 tax-dodgers. Of them, 31 cases were filed. Courts handed down verdicts on 21 cases and the High Court stayed three, according to NBR statistics. The NBR chairman also disclosed data on the first quarter's revenue collections. A total of Tk 9,135.87 crore was collected in the July-September period, an increase of 19.17 percent from Tk 7,665.97 crore for the same period a fiscal year ago. Income tax collections grew 42 percent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago, largely paced by about Tk 600 crore in earnings from taxes on undisclosed money. The tax administration earned Tk 1,838.66 crore from income tax in the first quarter, which was Tk 1,293.24 crore in the same period of last fiscal year. NBR's collections from value-added tax during the period were Tk 3,144.04 crore, a 14 percent increase from last year. The tax collector earned Tk 4,080.8 crore from customs duties, up from Tk 3,548.38 crore in the same period a fiscal year back. On his much-talked-about transfer as NBR chairman, Rahman said he is yet to know anything on the issue "formally". bd
