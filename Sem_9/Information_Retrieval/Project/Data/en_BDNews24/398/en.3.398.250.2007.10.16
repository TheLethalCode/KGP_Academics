<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet committee on public purchase Tuesday cleared imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice, an adviser said. After a meeting of the committee, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the move was meant to deal with any food crisis in the country. India had earlier halted exports of rice to Bangladesh, sending a chilly message that the prices would be higher if the country needs to buy rice from other sources such as Myanmar and Thailand. But the government later ruled out any imminent crisis, saying India's step would hardly make any impact on the local market. The government had said it had taken a string of alternative measures for a good stock of rice and wheat. Azizul said Tuesday a Singaporean company would supply the rice since it became the lowest bidder. "The company will collect rice from various countries," he said after the meeting held at the Cabinet Division. Azizul said one kilogram of rice would cost Tk 22.31 that includes the cost of transportation to Chittagong seaport. People will be able to buy one kg rice for Tk 23.16, he said. The committee turned down a proposal by a Chinese company to set up a 150-megawatt power plant in Shikalbahar of Sylhet. "We have sent the proposal back for re-evaluation," he said. The body also discussed some road development projects. bdnew
