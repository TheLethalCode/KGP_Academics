 WARSAW, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's ruling Kaczynski twins touted concessions in a new EU treaty as a victory for their tough negotiating stand on Friday as opinion polls gave the edge to the pro-Europe opposition ahead of a snap election. The parliamentary election on Sunday could end the turbulent two-year grip of the fiercely nationalist Kaczynskis over the government in the country of 38 million, the biggest former communist country in the European Union. Polls showed the Law and Justice party of Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski between 4 and 12 percent behind the centre-right Civic Platform, which had the support of up to 43 percent of Poles. Financial markets favour the Platform. Kaczynski said his brother Lech, the president, had succeeded in treaty talks at a summit in Lisbon.

Poland won a protocol in the long-awaited treaty to reform EU institutions which lets small groups of countries delay EU decisions if they are just short of the votes to stop them.

Financial markets, betting the Civic Platform will lead a new government and enact reforms such as privatisation, took heart from the opinion polls. The zloty hit a new 5-1/2 year high. Poles are generally pro-European but the Kaczynskis' strong stand on Europe plays well to their core electorate -- strongly Catholic older Poles who better remember the horrors of Nazi occupation and communist oppression. The parliamentary election was called after the collapse of the prime minister's last coalition in a row over a corruption investigation. The president does not face re-election until 2010. The fight against what the Kaczynskis call a corrupt post-communist elite is at the heart of the campaign and they have stepped up attacks as their Law and Justice party has flagged in recent polls. Opponents accuse them of using the anti-corruption drive to smear rivals, particularly after the release of video footage showing a former Civic Platform deputy taking a bribe. She says she was set
