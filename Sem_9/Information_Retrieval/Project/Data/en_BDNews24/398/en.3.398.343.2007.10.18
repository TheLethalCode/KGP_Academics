 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein approved a change in the land registration rules Thursday, which allows the fees to be paid through pay orders. Mainul also directed the land registration directorate to supply the buyer's land documents immediately after registration to avoid unnecessary delays, said a law ministry press statement. From now, two copies of the documents will be taken from the buyer at the time of registration, with one of the copies returned on completion of the formalities. bdnew
