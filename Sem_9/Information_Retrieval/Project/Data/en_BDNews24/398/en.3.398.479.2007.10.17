<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission Wednesday said it was considering appointing election officials to the UK to oversee voting operations for non-resident Bangladeshis. Election commissioner Sohul Hossain told reporters about the new step to enable UK-based Bangladeshis to vote in elections, after a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in the foreign office. "Our manpower at the high commission in the UK is insufficient. Many expatriates have said they are interested in helping to make a voter list with photographs. We may have to appoint a few officials under supervision of the high commission. We'll finalise the matter after our UK tour," he said. Sohul and election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain are set to travel to the UK in November to look into the enfranchisement of expatriates there. Sohul said: "We have asked the foreign affairs adviser for assistance on the enfranchisement of Bangladeshi expatriates in the UK. He assured us that he would provide cooperation and support through the Bangladesh mission there. The high commission will assist in the necessary preparation of a voter list with photographs." The two commissioners will meet and exchange views with expatriate Bangladeshis in London, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchesterthe cities with the largest concentrations of Bangladeshis. A media campaign is being planned to invite expatriates in the UK to become voters. The EC plans to ask local expatriate organisations to help with the voter registration process. Asked whether opening a desk at the high commission would be enough to get the job done, Sohul said: "We will decide on how everybody can be registered to vote after the tour." bdnews24
