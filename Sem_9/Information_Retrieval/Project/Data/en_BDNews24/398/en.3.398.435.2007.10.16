 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government Tuesday raised the export earnings target by $2.0 billion to $14.5 billion for the current fiscal year. Last year, exports fell 2.58 percent short of the target of $12.5 billion. The target was set Tuesday in a meeting of the commerce ministry chaired by commerce and finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam at the secretariat. Commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed along with representatives of various ministries and trade bodies were present at the meeting. The adviser told a press briefing that the new export goal had been set after evaluating last year's export situation and based on suggestions from the trade bodies. The adviser said that last year some sectors failed to achieve their targets. "Export figures fell last year. Three months of this fiscal year have already passed. Business has been resilient despite the odds. So it is possible to achieve the target," he said. According to the commerce ministry, exports amounted to $12.12 billion in fiscal 2006-07, falling short of the target by 2.58 percent. The frozen food export target has been set at $600 million for fiscal 2007-08, up from $495 million of fiscal 2006-07. Earnings from the sector came to $515.32 million in fiscal 2006-07, far above the target. The woven garments sector also followed the better-than-expectations trend. The sector earned $7 million more than the target. This year's target has been set at $5.4 billion, compared with $4.65 billion for the last fiscal year. The home textile sector earned $256.97 million last fiscal year although the target was only $175 milliona success that led the government to set the target at $310 million. The underperforming sectors last year were tea, agriculture, knitwear, jute and leather. Tea exports amounted to only $6.94 million compared to the target of $12 million. The target for this year has been set at $8 million. Agriculture could only earn about $87.82 million from the target of $130 million. The target for this year has been adjusted down to $100 million. The target for knitwear earnings has been set higher at $5.47 billion from last year's $4.85 billion. The sector posted $4.55 billion in last year's earnings. Jute target earnings for fiscal 2007-08 have been set at $350 million compared with last year's $415 million. Last year's jute earnings stood at $320.78 million.
