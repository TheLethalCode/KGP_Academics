 MUMBAI, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bowler Brad Hogg's incisive variations proved invaluable for world champions Australia in a crushing 4-2 one-day series victory over India. Left-arm leg-spinner Hogg befuddled the Indians, traditionally good players of spin, claiming 11 wickets in the seven-match series at an economy rate of 4.56. The Indian batsmen found it difficult to pick Hogg's 'wrong one' delivery, which looks like it is going one way but goes the other, especially when trying to score runs off him when the field restriction was still in place. Skipper Ricky Ponting usually brought Hogg on for his first spell during the second powerplay and the 36-year-old one-day specialist often responded to the challenge. "He has got a very good wrong one, there is no doubt about that," Ponting said. "That is one of his best deliveries and I think he is tending to bowl a lot better and a lot more that he used to as well." Hogg, who was a tremendous success at the 50-over World Cup in the Caribbean in March, took four wickets in the key middle overs of the sixth match to help the visitors seal the series with a game to spare. He dismissed Irfan Pathan (caught at point), Saurav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid (both caught at long-on), and Yuvraj Singh (lbw) to derail the hosts. "Hogg is a pretty underrated player in our team. He sort of sneaks under the radar a lot, he had an unbelievable World Cup, has got better as this year has gone on," Ponting said. Hogg, who spent several years in the shadow of Shane Warne, took 21 wickets at this year's 50-over World Cup to emerge the fourth highest after retired team mate Glenn McGrath (26), Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan and fellow Australian Shaun Tait, who took 23 wickets a piece. "If you look back at the World Cup, he undid a lot of batsmen through that tournament with that wrong one as well," Ponting said. Hogg, who made his test and one-day debut in 1996, became a regular member of the one-day side only after Warne quit that form of the game in 2003. "He's learning all the time, even though he is 36-37, he is still learning all the time," Ponting said of Hogg, who has taken 144 wickets from 113 one-dayers. The teams meet in a Twenty20 international on Saturday
