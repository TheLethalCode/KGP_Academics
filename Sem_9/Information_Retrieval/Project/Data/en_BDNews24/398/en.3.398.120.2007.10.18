<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The new-look National Cricket League, the country's only first-class cricket league, gets underway Friday with three matches on the opening day in as many venues. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali will declare the ninth edition of the meet open prior to the match between hosts Dhaka and Khulna at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Rajshahi host Sylhet at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium while hosts Barisal take on Chittagong at Shaheen Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. This season's Ispahani Mirzapore Tea NCL has caused a stir because of the introduction of match fees, a new system of point distribution, and the possibility of broadcasting highlights of matches on television and score-updates by radio. "Advertisements for the NCL is being broadcast by satellite in Rajshahi for the first time, and it has created a huge enthusiasm among the inhabitants of the city," Rajshahi Division's captain Khaled Mashud Pilot told bdnews24.com Thursday. The former Bangladesh captain said local authorities also brought out a procession ahead of the national league for publicity. To shrug off the 'picnic image' of the NCL, the BCB has also announced a number of new prizes for cricketers and teams in a bid to make the league more attractive to players. The initiatives have doubled the total cost of the NCL to Tk 4.15 crore from the previous budget of Tk 2.56 crore. The points distribution among the participating teams has been substantially altered. The winning team will get eight points instead of six. A team with first innings lead will get six points instead of four points if the match is drawn. Along with the fixed points, a team can add bonus points by scoring more runs and taking more wickets than their opponents. A 200-250 score will fetch one bonus point and a further bonus point is up for grabs for each fifty after 250 up to 350. A score above 351 will give a team a total of four bonus points. In addition, a team will receive four bonus points if it can bowl out the opponents, as well as three bonus points for taking eight to nine wickets, two bonus points for getting six to seven batsmen out and one bonus point for the first five wickets. All bonus points however are only applicable for the first innings. In line with the new system of one-day internationals, the committee has also introduced free hits for the batsman, keeping a fielder outside the circle in the second or third power play, and a new ball after 35 overs in the 50-over-a-side game. Private FM station Radio Foorti is planning to update its audience at least five times a day during the four-day matches. "I spoke to Radio Foorti executives on Thursday. They have promised to update the audiences at least five times in a day during the four-dayers," BCB media committee chairman Ahmed Sajjadul Ahmed Bobi told bdnews24.com. Bobi also said there was a possibility that highlights of one-dayers will be broadcast from different venues: "Three private channels, Channel i, ETV and Boishakhi, as well as BTV have shown interest in the NCL." Despite light to moderate rain across the country over the past 24 hours, all three venues in Dhaka, Bogra and Rajshahi are set to host matches Friday, said tournament committee member-secretary Hafizur Rahman Joarder. According to the met office, the light to moderate rain may continue Friday across the country due to a depression over the Bay of Bengal. The weather, however, should improve from Saturday, it forecast. bdn
