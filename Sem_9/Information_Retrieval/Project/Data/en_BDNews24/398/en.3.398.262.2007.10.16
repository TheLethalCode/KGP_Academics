 LAHORE, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa coach Mickey Arthur has backed his most experienced allrounder Shaun Pollock to do well in the one-day series against Pakistan after he was overlooked for the two-match test series. The 34-year-old Pollock, who has played in 107 tests and 290 one-day internationals, was not selected for the test series which South Africa won 1-0. "I am not worried about Polly's form. Polly is number one in the world rankings at the moment. He gets our full support and backing," Arthur told reporters on Tuesday. "I back Polly hugely in one-day cricket. I am pretty sure Polly will be up for it. I am pretty sure he is going to be right up there for the first game on Thursday." Former South African captain Pollock, who has taken 383 wickets and scored 3,279 runs in one-dayers, said last month he was disappointed to be dropped from the test squad but respected Arthur's decision. Arthur said South Africa hoped to carry the momentum from the test series into the five one-day games. "We have no illusions because one-day cricket is a totally different game. Pakistan will probably bring the momentum of their Twenty20 form into the series. But I am very confident because I think we have a very good side," he said. "I see ourselves in with a good chance as we have a good mixture of youth and experience and we have guys who know their roles well." bdnews24.com/orp/1914hrs.
