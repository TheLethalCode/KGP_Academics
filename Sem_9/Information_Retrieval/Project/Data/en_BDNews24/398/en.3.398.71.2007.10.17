<TITLE> Virgin vows to fight "tooth and nail" at Heathrow </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic said it expected tough competition on transatlantic routes in the future as it unveiled a new Heathrow airport check-in aimed at retaining its key business travellers. "We will fight tooth and nail to ensure we can remain the number two carrier at Heathrow," Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Steve Ridgway told reporters at the check-in, which bypasses the security delays that have plagued the London airport since last August. Virgin and British Airways' traditional dominance of the transatlantic market will be tested next year when routes between Europe and the United States are liberalised and other airlines flock in. Air France-KLM and Delta Airlines said on Wednesday they were teaming up to capitalise on the "open skies" agreement. BA, which says it is keen to hook up with a big US player, will move to its own dedicated T5 terminal at Heathrow early next year. "There's no doubt some other US carriers will be announcing Heathrow services," Ridgway told Reuters. "They'll learn Heathrow is a very tough place to operate from. We'll out-serve and out-product many other airlines." Liberalisation of transatlantic routes has been complicated by congestion at Heathrow after security was tightened when police uncovered a plot to bring down transatlantic airliners using liquid explosives last August. Virgin's new check-in with a dedicated security channel promises to get first-class passengers from their car to the departure lounge in under 10 minutes, which Virgin claims is the world's fastest. Ridgway appeared to play down the possibility of Virgin teaming up with a US airline. "We're determined to remain very distinctive and very individual," he said.
