 LAHORE, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa vice-captain Justin Kemp is expecting a tough test in the upcoming five-match one-day series with Pakistan, despite their victory over the home side in the test series. "The guys played unbelievably well to win in Pakistan, but we also know it is going to be tough in the one-day series," said Kemp, who was appointed vice-captain for the one-day event on Monday. "Pakistan is a very good one-day side and they have done well in the Twenty20 World Cup." Kemp leads the team on Tuesday in the one-day match against the Patrons eleven with Jacques Kallis, Vernon Philander and captain Graeme Smith not playing. Philander, who joined the team in the test series as a replacement for the injured Morne Morkel, is nursing a hamstring injury and is a doubtful starter for the first one-dayer on Thursday. Kemp said the match would allow the players coming down for the one-day series, including himself, to acclimatise and adjust to the pitches and the weather conditions. Kemp is making his first tour of Pakistan and was one of the four replacements announced for the one-day rubber with Albie Morkel, Johan Botha and Charl Langeveldt. Despite failing to win the big tournaments, South Africa had done fairly well in one-day series over the last two years," Kemp said. "I don't think there is too much pressure on us going into this series because our form in one-day matches has been good." Kemp saw the coming series as a good opportunity for the younger players to establish themselves in the side. "It is a case of taking responsibility and the few of the younger guys are doing really well.
