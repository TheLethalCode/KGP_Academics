<TITLE> Focus on cricket not vengeance, says Australia's Ponting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, India, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting is focused on his team returning to top form rather than seeking revenge against India for defeat at last month's Twenty20 World Cup. Australia, who are 50-over world champions, have taken a winning 4-1 lead in the seven-match one-day series with only Wednesday's game left. The opening match was washed out. "Coming after a long break, I think all the guys were really keen to get back to playing some very good cricket again," Ponting told a news conference on Tuesday. "We didn't play our best in Twenty20 but since we have been here, I don't think we could have done much more," he said. Australia, returning after a six-month break, were beaten by surprise winners India in the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. In India they have made few mistakes, however. "We played some excellent cricket, probably highlighted by the last couple of games that we have played. So all in all we were not coming here trying to seek vengeance on anybody," Ponting said. A final decision on opener Matthew Hayden's fitness will be taken on the morning of the match. In-form Hayden missed the previous game in Nagpur with a sore hip. "At the moment he's not certain of playing but we are not ruling him out either," Ponting said
