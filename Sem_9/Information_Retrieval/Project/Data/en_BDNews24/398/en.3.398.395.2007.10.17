 NEW YORK, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil thundered more than $2 to a new peak above $88 a barrel on Tuesday, extending a nine-dollar rally since last week on tight supplies, strong demand and growing tensions in northern Iraq. The record surge raised alarm bells for producer group OPEC, which voiced concern over the high price and blamed rampant speculation by big money investors rather than any shortage of supply. "While the Organization does not favor oil prices at this level, it strongly believes that fundamentals are not supporting current high prices and that the market is very well supplied," it said in a statement. At 1620 GMT, U.S. crude was up $1.71 at $87.84 a barrel after rising as high as $88.20. London Brent was up $1.60 at $84.35 a barrel. Oil, which has set records for three straight days, is closing in on the inflation-adjusted high of $90.46 seen in 1980, the year after the Iranian revolution and at the start of the Iran-Iraq war. Prices this year have averaged $67. Investors said oil's rally was supported by tensions between Turkey and Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq, sturdy world energy demand growth, tight inventories in consumer nations heading into winter and unprecedented weakness in the U.S. dollar. "This market has it all right now," said Peter Beutel, president of energy trading consultant Cameron Hanover. "It has supply concerns, projected increases in demand, dollar weakness, momentum and political fears." The Turkish cabinet asked parliament Monday for permission to launch an attack on Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq, dimming hopes for a recovery in Iraqi oil exports via Turkey, which have been sporadic since 2003. Turkey is also now a major conduit for Caspian oil exports to the Mediterranean. FREIGHT TRAIN The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that the market needs additional oil from producer group OPEC, only days after the top oil official of the United States said another hike may not be needed. OPEC officials said they had heard no discussion within the organization about raising output beyond the 500,000 barrels per day agreed in September, which takes effect on Nov. 1. "The market fundamentals are in balance. There is too much money coming into the market," Indonesia's OPEC governor Maizar Rahman told Reuters. Moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and add billions of dollars of temporary reserves to the banking system have added liquidity that is finding its way into oil, seen by some as a one-way bet. "We suspect massive long-side commitment by sidelined money has had more to do with it," said Edward Meir of MF Global. Oil has climbed from below $70 in mid-August and surged 10 percent since October 9. The rally has also been aided by fund buying as a hedge against a weaker dollar. Gold has hit a 28-year high and platinum breached record levels. Oil prices have more than quadrupled since 2002 and climbed 43 percent since the start of 2007. "Barring a massive sell-off, the path of least resistance seems to be higher still, although like many others out there, we are hard-pressed to justify such high valuations," MF Global's Meir said. "Still, we learned long -- and many dollars -- ago that it is best not to take on a speeding freight train."
