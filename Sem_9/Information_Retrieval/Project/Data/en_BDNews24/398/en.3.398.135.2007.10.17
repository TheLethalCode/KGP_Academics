 KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations urged Southeast Asian nations on Wednesday to do more to push military-ruled Myanmar toward democracy after its bloodiest crackdown on pro-democracy activists in almost 20 years. The UN special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, said during a diplomatic tour of the region that the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) should go beyond its recent condemnation of the crackdown by its member state.
