 LONDON, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- US activist investor Knight Vinke stepped up its assault on HSBC Holdings by urging Europe's biggest bank to consider "radical solutions" such as liquidating the majority of its investment bank arm. "There are some issues that need to be addressed and we think the board needs to consider some radical alternatives to current strategy to unlock the value that we think lies in HSBC," Martin Forrest, director of communications at Knight Vinke, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. "We're long term investors, some of our investments have taken up to four years to come to fruition after our campaigns. We're patient and we're in it for the long term ... we're not expecting things to happen overnight," Forrest said. His comments followed an open letter to HSBC shareholders published in UK national newspapers on Tuesday, which said the bank was obsessed with diversification and had failed to achieve scale in retail or investment banking. "The Emperor needs to be told that he is not wearing any clothes: there are almost no synergies associated with being the 'world's local bank'," it said in the letter, citing HSBC's marketing slogan. Knight Vinke, headed by Eric Knight, went public on Sept 6 with a call for HSBC to revamp its strategy to increase its focus on Asia and consider selling businesses. It has since taken its case to 40 of HSBC's biggest shareholders. "The responses we received were far more supportive than we had been led by HSBC to expect," it said, saying only two shareholders refused to meet. "Most of the rest agreed that there are real areas of concern to be addressed by the board concerning strategy, execution and/or governance." Knight Vinke said HSBC's investment bank business lacks scale and its "emerging markets led and financing focused model is risky "as it combines a global cost base with a regional revenue sourcing strategy". The business also uses a lot of capital, it said. "We feel either they should develop it fully, which would probably require a merger with another bank, or the total withdrawal from investment banking," Forrest said. The bank's retail and commercial banking strategy was also spread too thin, the activist said. "HSBC's obsession with diversification has also resulted in a substantial portfolio of minority stakes in companies which it does not fully control." Knight Vinke has a stake of about 0.3 percent in HSBC and wants to get backing from other investors for its plans -- a strategy it has followed with past campaigns. HSBC has rejected the calls from Knight Vinke, saying its board backs its strategy and it is already in the process of increasing its focus on Asia and other emerging markets. "The strategy is well understood and widely supported by our shareholders and we believe the principal points made by Knight Vinke have already been addressed," an HSBC spokesman said. HSBC shares closed down 0.5 percent at 949.5 pence, valuing the bank at about 112 billion pounds ($228 billion).
