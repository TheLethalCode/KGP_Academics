 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The enquiry committee on Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) press box roof collapse Thursday sent samples to the BUET laboratory to find out the real reason for the cave-in. "Despite inclement weather Thursday, we have collected four samples  face pipe, welding pipe, slab and beam  from the press box debris for laboratory tests," National Sports Council (NSC) director (planning and development) and enquiry committee leader Abdur Rahman told bdnews24.com Thursday. "We sent all collected samples in sealed packets to the BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) and hope to get the reports in a maximum of two to three days after the university reopens on October 24 following the Durga Puja vacation," said Rahman. The BNS press box roof collapsed some three hours after the FIFA World Cup pre-qualifying match between Bangladesh and Tajikistan on October 8, and the NSC, administrator of the stadium, formed a five-member enquiry committee the next day. The committee has already submitted its preliminary report to NSC chairman and army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, on October 10. The investigation, however, will be completed only after availability of the lab reports.
