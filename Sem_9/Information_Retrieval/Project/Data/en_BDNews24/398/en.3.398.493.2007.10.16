 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)Voter registration begins at 200 centres of 90 wards of the Dhaka City Corporation in December, an election commissioner said Tuesday. "The EC will begin work on voter listing with pictures and national IDs in the DCC area in December which continues into January," election commissioner Sohul Hossain told reporters in his office. The commissioner said that media campaign would include advertisements on television, in newspapers and public announcements over loudspeakers in the city. Cell-phone companies would notify their subscribers through sms. As the majority of city dwellers are service holders, the commission would conduct listing work until 9.00pm-10.00pm, he added. More will be done on weekends. "Data collectors will go from door to door to gather information. To facilitate their access everywhere they will be provided with ID cards," he added. Different schools in the DCC area would be used as voter registration centre, he said. "Schools in the DCC area will be notified by the education ministry when they need to cancel their classes. We will also request them to reschedule their exams for two months." Sohul is to travel to London with colleague Sakhawat Hossain to explore the possibility of voter registration for Bangladeshi expatriates in Britain. He said, "The EC plans to open electoral desks in Canada and North America also. We will decide the matter after coming back from London." bdnews
