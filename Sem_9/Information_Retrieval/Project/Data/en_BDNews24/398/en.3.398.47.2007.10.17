 BETHLEHEM, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The search for peace in the Middle East took U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Bethlehem on Wednesday, where she toured the Church of the Nativity and met ordinary Palestinians. "Peace Be With You," read an Israeli Tourism Ministry sign on a high concrete wall Israel has constructed near the entrance to the city of Jesus's birth, a barrier that Palestinians consider a hated symbol of Israeli occupation. Residents of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank just down the road from Jerusalem, looked on with seeming indifference as Rice's motorcade swept into the city with sirens blaring.

Unemployment in the town is estimated at about 65 percent. More than 3,000 Christians, about 10 percent of the community in Bethlehem, have left the city since 2000, according to United Nations statistics. After her visit to Bethlehem, Rice was to travel to the West Bank city of Ramallah for further talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whom she last met on Monday. She held talks in Egypt on Tuesday, where a senior US official travelling with her said she had made progress in mustering Egyptian support for the Annapolis conference, making it easier to mobilise broader Arab backing.
