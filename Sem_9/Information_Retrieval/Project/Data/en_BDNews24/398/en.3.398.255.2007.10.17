<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  The investigation report in the GATCO scam case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia is nearly complete, and the investigating officer said Wednesday that the file would be placed before the authorities by mid-November. The graft case involves a wrongdoing in awarding contracts to operate two container terminalsone at Kamalapur Railway Station and the other at Chittagong Seaportduring Khaleda's term in 2003. Zahurul Huda, a deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission, said he had taken statements from 65 people during his investigation into the alleged wrongdoing that was brought to light last month. "People who were directly linked with the matter will be asked to testify," Huda told bdnews24.com by phone. Huda said he took the testimony of former finance secretary Zakir Ahmed Khan, now serving as Bangladesh's alternate executive director to the World Bank. "Since he (Khan) is abroad, I quizzed him over the telephone. I received a document of answers from him before Eid. He explained in detail his role as the then finance secretary," he added. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 and accused of misuse of power in awarding the contracts to local company Global Agro Trade Company without going through the standard tendering process. She is being held in a makeshift jail inside the parliament complex, pending trial. Her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco is also an accused in the case along with 11 other people. Coco has been in jail since Sept 3. Khaleda and Coco were arrested at their Dhaka cantonment home hours after an ACC official filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station. On Oct 11, during a second interrogation, Khaleda reportedly claimed innocence in the case. Earlier, Khaleda repeatedly insisted she was innocent, saying the corruption charges were a conspiracy to destroy the image of her family and party. The investigator had earlier questioned five ex-ministers, nine bureaucrats including a former cabinet secretary, high officials of the Chittagong Port Authority, and officials in various ministries and departments. bdnews24.com/e
