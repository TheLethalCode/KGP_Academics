<TITLE> `Cottage industry' revives legendary sound of 70s </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BLITHBURY, England, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The mechanism inside the Streetly M4000 looks more like some kind of weird lawnmower or factory contraption than a magical mystery music machine. There's a wheel that's spinning, a bicycle chain, rows of springs and slithers of magnetic tape wrapped around a drum. But when Martin Smith taps out the familiar "doot doot doot doot doot doot doo-doo" flute of the opening bars of the Beatles classic song "Strawberry Fields Forever, his garage fills with the unmistakable psychedelic sound that defined a generation. The M4000 is, says Smith, "the first new cycling mellotron in nearly 40 years", and some of the world's leading musicians are beating a path to the garage workshop in his back garden behind his cottage to get their hands on one. "This is a cottage industry. Literally," he says, welcoming a reporter with a milky cup of tea. Cows are lowing in the nearby field and the place smells vaguely of manure. Smith and his partner John Bradley have so far built just three M4000's, but already have more than 20 on order. Number three was sent to the big Canadian band Arcade Fire. Number four, still half-built, is almost ready for Paul Weller, former frontman of the seminal punk rock band The Jam. "Paul loves his mellotrons," says Smith. Icelandic group Sigur Ros has just joined the waiting list, and John Medeski of jazz fusion group Medeski, Martin and Wood ordered his after coming out to the garage to test drive it. "He attacked the machine. He just went straight at it and played it like a demon," says Bradley. "Once people try it they have to have one." "Mellotron" is a brand name for one of the weirdest musical instruments ever devised. Before digital sampling synthesisers, it allowed keyboard players to make the sounds of strings, flutes, clarinets or even, famously, an eight-voice mixed choir. The sounds are all recorded on eight-second scraps of magnetic tape. Pressing a key makes a wheel drag the tapes over a playback head and out comes the sound. ICONIC For years after the public first heard that iconic psychedelic "doot doo-doo" on the Beatles Magical Mystery Tour album in 1968, Mellotrons produced the eery and grandiose orchestral sounds that characterised "progressive rock". The Moody Blues, Genesis, Yes, King Crimson and Led Zeppelin made Mellotrons one of the quintessential sounds of the 70s. By the 1980s styles had changed and synthesisers often replaced electro-mechanical keyboards. But playing a Mellotron is nothing like playing a digital synthesiser, says Bradley. "If you record everything into a sampler, it would play everything exactly the same way every time. Once you drag tape over a magnetic head, there is an interaction with the player." Mellotrons are Bradley's family business. His grandfather and father owned Streetly Electronics, the Birmingham factory that built them. Bradley worked there for a decade from 1976. "In the early 70's they couldn't make 'em fast enough. The wagons were coming every week to take them away," he recalls. But by the mid 1980s, orders slowed to a trickle and eventually the factory shut in 1986 and went bust. Bradley set himself up in business repairing the old machines with Smith who bought his first Mellotron in 1970 -- one that had belonged to Moody Blues flute player Ray Thomas. Their business means they get to meet their childhood idols. In the middle of their garage is a big double-keyboard Mellotron they are repairing for Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music. On the wall is a portrait of Bradley, Smith, a Mellotron and Paul McCartney. The brand name Mellotron was sold to a company which licenses it to a Swedish manufacturer who makes his own version. But Bradley and Smith say their Streetly M4000 is better because it holds eight sets of tapes instead of just one. They still use the original recordings for sounds, along with new recordings, featuring famous musicians like King Crimson's Ian McDonald on flute and Adrian Belew on guitar. A new M4000 with 24 sounds will set you back about $9,000. Musicians looking for similar sounds can save a lot of money by buying a digital synthesiser. Smith says he isn't worried. "You can get digital samplers that sound like every single piano ever made. Yet they still make piano
