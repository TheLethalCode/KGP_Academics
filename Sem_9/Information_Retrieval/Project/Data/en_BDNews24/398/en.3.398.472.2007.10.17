 TOKYO, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan is considering buying Eurofighter Typhoons to replace part of its ageing air force fleet, Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in an interview on Wednesday.

A scandal erupted this year when Japanese naval officers were reported to have leaked classified information about the Aegis radar system used on US and Japanese missile-defence capable ships.

So I feel strongly that Japan's information management system is not good enough," Ishiba said, adding that tougher penalties and more reliable ways of detecting leaks were need
