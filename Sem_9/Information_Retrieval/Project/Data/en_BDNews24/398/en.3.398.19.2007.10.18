<TITLE> UK watchdog sees mobile calls on planes taking off </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mobile phone users might be able to make telephone calls on UK-registered aircraft from 2008 under new proposals published by telecoms and media regulator Ofcom on Thursday. Ofcom suggested that aircraft could provide an on-board base station as part of its proposals, developed jointly with other European Union countries, aimed at encouraging companies to develop innovative technologies to use radio spectrum. To ensure that mobile phones did not interfere with other terrestrial mobile networks, they would still have to be switched off during take-off and landing. But Ofcom said once the aircraft had reached a minimum height of 3,000 metres, handsets could use the aircraft's network to make and receive calls, which would be routed via a satellite link to the network on the ground. Calls would be billed through passengers' normal service providers. Ofcom, which is calling for industry comments by November 30, suggested amending the aircraft operators' existing Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 licences to enable a service that already operates in countries such as Australia. Some airlines already offer in-flight outbound telephone services via their own network. However, Ofcom's proposals will enable passengers to use their own handsets.
