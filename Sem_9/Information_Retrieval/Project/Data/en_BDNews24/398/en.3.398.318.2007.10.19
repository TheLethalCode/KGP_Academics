<TEXT>
 LISBON, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission will postpone to January proposals on emissions trading and on renewable energy, a spokesman for the EU executive said on Friday. "It won't be for December but for January," Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger said on the sidelines of a summit in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. Laitenberger said the delay would allow the EU to take into account the outcome of a U.N. meeting on climate change due in Bali in December to shape a global deal for when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. The EU agreed in March to cut emissions blamed for global warming by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels and 30 percent if the rest of the world joins in. The Commission said earlier this year it would issue a plan in December that lays out how the targets should be distributed. That legislation, often referred to as "burden sharing," will then have to be endorsed by national governments. The draft legislation will include changes to the bloc's emissions trading scheme and national targets for another EU goal of having 20 percent of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020. Laitenberger said the Commission was currently involved in consultations with EU member states on its proposals. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Soccer-England roundup-Torres could feature in Merseyside derby LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in the English Premier League: Liverpool's Spanish striker Fernando Torres, who injured an adductor muscle while on international duty last week, could face Everton in the Merseyside derby, coach Rafael Benitez has hinted. "He has been training with the ball," Benitez said. "I need to decide if he will be really fit, or whether it will be a risk." Torres has scored a total of seven goals for Liverpool this season including the last minute equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur in a 2-2 draw two weeks ago. Everton meanwhile are hoping Australian midfielder Tim Cahill, who has not played this season because of a foot injury, could be fit to return after resuming training this week. League leaders Arsenal will be without leading scorer Robin van Persie for Saturday's home match against struggling Bolton Wanderers at the Emirates Stadium after he hurt a knee playing for the Netherlands on Wednesday. Arsenal fear the injury could sideline him for a month. Swiss defender Philippe Senderos, who scored against Sunderland in Arsenal's last match, is out for at least two weeks with a back injury while Manuel Almunia is expected to continue in goal even though Jens Lehmann is now fit. Bolton travel to Arsenal with coaching co-ordinator Archie Knox in temporary charge of the side following the departure of manager Sammy Lee on Wednesday. Bolton could be without midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson who injured an ankle playing for Sweden against Northern Ireland on Wednesday. Former Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka is also doubtful after injuring a thigh while with France this week. Champions Manchester United resume their pusuit of Arsenal at the top, with the best record of any club in the first game back after the last eight international breaks dating back to the start of last season. They travel to Aston Villa having won all eight matches they have played immediately after an international break. In comparison Villa have won just one. Moustapha Salifou of Togo could make his debut for Villa after finally receiving his international clearance after signing for the club in the summer. Chelsea travel to struggling Middlesbrough looking for their second successive away win after beating Bolton 1-0 two weeks ago. Michael Essien has said he has been impressed by new coach Avram Grant, in contrast to the view of Didier Drogba who says the club is "broken", adding: "I can't wait to leav
