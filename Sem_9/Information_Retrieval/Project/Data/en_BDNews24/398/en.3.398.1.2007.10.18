 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  New judicial magistrates will start work on Nov 1, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Wednesday. "The procedure to separate the judiciary from the executive is already over. The judicial magistrates will join work on Nov 1," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. As many as 179 people were made judicial magistrates on Oct 9 as part of an effort to carve out a free judiciary. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed told bdnews24.com that his office sent letters to district judges four days ago to make sure judicial magistrates have enough seating arrangements and other facilities. bdnews2
