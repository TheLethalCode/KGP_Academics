<TITLE> EU, Russia tiptoe around energy access fight </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jeff Mason BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Top energy officials from Russia and the European Union tiptoed around their disagreements about access to each other's markets on Tuesday while putting up a united front about gas prices and security of supplies. A meeting between EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and Russian Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko tackled a range of issues affecting the trading partners, including an early warning system in the event of disruptions to flows of fuel. But they agreed to put off, essentially, a dispute about investment access in the gas and electricity sector sparked by recent European Commission proposals. The Commission proposed last month to break up big utilities that control power supply, generation and transmission, but inserted a loophole to prevent foreign firms such as Russia's Gazprom from buying up pipelines and power grids. The draft legislation would bar foreign companies from controlling European networks unless they play by the same rules as EU firms and their home country has an agreement with Brussels. Russian officials blasted the draft rules as protectionism and threatened to retaliate. Piebalgs said on Tuesday, however, that the two sides would establish a group of experts to look at the proposals and that Khristenko had agreed to take a "political position" on them after the group's work was done. "I appreciate this very pragmatic approach," Piebalgs told a news conference after the meeting. "We are interested in active consultation with our European colleagues on new energy initiatives," Khristenko said. TENSION But tension was palpable. Piebalgs, known for his pleasant demeanour and frequent smile, was straight-faced at the news conference and both men kept their answers brief and blunt. Khristenko also suggested European companies were investing more in Russia than Russian companies were in the EU, batting down arguments that Moscow has more limits on foreign investment in Russia than the EU has at home. Both sought to reassure consumers, however, that gas flows would continue uninterrupted in the coming months. Russia is the 27-nation bloc's biggest supplier of gas. "I have no doubts about security of supply for this winter," Piebalgs told the news conference. He said storage capacity was in place and shrugged off the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices. "There is a formula related to oil prices, but it doesn't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations," he said. "Today's spike perhaps will be gone in a week's time." Khristenko said high oil prices would not have a big effect on gas prices. "I don't expect major price changes compared to the current situation," he said.
