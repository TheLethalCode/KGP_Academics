 BEIJING, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The next Communist leadership of China, the land of Mao Zedong, is likely to include a man who as a student mixed with democracy advocates and learned the ideas of wigged English judges at a university that fostered dissent. Li Keqiang, 52-year-old Party secretary of the northeastern province of Liaoning, is widely tipped to emerge from this week's Communist Party Congress as a member of the Standing Committee, the country's inner circle of power. Li's rise through the Communist Youth League, that also nurtured President Hu Jintao, and postings in big, tough provinces have marked him for higher things. His widely expected elevation will put him in contention to succeed Hu or government chief Premier Wen Jiabao five years hence. But Li's past as an intellectually voracious law student during an era of liberal ferment would mark a break with the staid engineers who have run China since the 1990s. He was at the elite Peking University from the late 1970s, when calls for free speech and democracy sprouted in the ideological disillusion left by Mao's Cultural Revolution. He plunged into campus politics as reformist ideas galvanised students, befriended free thinkers who went on to notoriety as exiled dissidents, and co-translated "The Due Process of Law" by Lord Denning, the famed English jurist. Li's past need not make him a harbinger of radical liberalisation. Accounts depict a political chameleon who stayed carefully within the system and paid his dues as a submissive functionary while classmates studied abroad or embraced increasingly radical dissent. But his background seems sure to fuel questions about whether the Communist Party can ensure its future leaders avoid the radical impulses of their youth as they negotiate dramatic economic change and calls for democratic reform. "Being a university student is an age when a person's value framework is set," said Zhang Zuhua, a former Youth League official who closely observes politics. "That period certainly had a huge impact on his outlook. The question is whether he is able to use it or has to struggle against it." COMMUNE TO COURTROOM Even before university, Li amassed unusually rich political experience. Born in rural Anhui province in July 1955, his father was a local court official, according to Zhang, the analyst. Li worked on a rural commune in Fengyang County -- notoriously poor even for Mao's China and one of the first places to quietly dismantle commune control and revive private incentives in farming in the late 1970s. By the time he left the land, Li was already a Communist Party member and secretary of his production brigade. He was among the first university students to win their places in intensely competitive entrance exams revived in 1977, as Deng Xiaoping and other rehabilitated reformers began to shed Mao's radicalism. Li arrived at a campus that was historically the country's most respected and most liberal. Peking University was among the first Chinese schools to restore law teaching after the Cultural Revolution. And Li attached himself to a professor whose classes became a seedbed of then exotic liberal ideas. Professor Gong Xiangrui, an expert on Western constitutional law who had studied in Britain in the 1930s, organised Li and two other students to translate Lord Denning's book. Outside class, Li mixed with radical thinkers and joined an intellectual "salon" that included Wang Juntao, later condemned as a counter-revolutionary "black hand" after the 1989 purge, Wang recounted in a memoir. Another exiled dissident, Hu Ping, recalled that in 1980 Li, then in the official student union, backed controversial campus elections contested by Hu Ping and other pro-democracy activists. Party conservatives were aghast at the radical experiment. "After the election, I talked to him about elections, democracy and the political future of China," Hu told Reuters. "At that time it seemed that we shared many ideas about what sort of democracy China should become." But Li stayed within the system, climbing the Party hierarchy. In 1983 he joined the Youth League's central secretariat, headed at the time by Hu Jintao. After the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989 ended ideological relaxation, Li was marooned in the League and tainted by his liberal associations, said Zhang, the analyst. "For a long time, there was a negative impact on Youth League officials, including Li," said Zhang. "They were held back by the burden of that liberal background and 1989." After biding his time, in 1998 he was sent to Henan province, a poor and restless belt of rural central China, rising to become Party secretary for two years. He also completed graduate degrees in economics at Peking University. In late 2004, he was made Party chief of Liaoning, a rustbelt province striving to attract investment reinvent itself as a modern industrial heartland. Some of Li's former friends have voiced hopes that his student past has left him more open to bold democratic reform than Hu's generation. But Wang, the exiled dissident, wrote that the Party's powerful norms of conformity and caution would probably win out. "It's not that I don't trust Li Keqiang," wrote Wang. "It's that I don't trust China's politics and system.
