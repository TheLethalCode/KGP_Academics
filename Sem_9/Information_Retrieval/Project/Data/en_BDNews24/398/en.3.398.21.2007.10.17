<TEXT>
 MANILA, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ordered a "quiet" inquiry into fresh bribery allegations in her government, her spokesman said on Wednesday, a week after lawmakers were given cash after a meeting with her. Ignacio Bunye said Arroyo asked the Presidential Anti-Graft Council to find out who was responsible for the distribution of money to lawmakers, governors and mayors at the presidential palace and determine the source of the funds. "The inquiry started on Friday but it was kept quiet," Bunye told reporters, declining an explanation on why a number of the president's allies apparently received 200,000 pesos to 500,000 pesos ($4,525-$11,310) in cash after separate meetings last week. "We would like to assure you that no government funds changed hands," he added. It is the latest in a series of scandals facing Arroyo and has attracted the ire of the powerful Catholic church. But Arroyo seems safe because of her dominance of the House of Representatives, disunity in the opposition and solid support from the military, political analysts said. Lawmakers and other officials have told newspapers that palace officials came up to them after meetings with the president and handed them brown paper bags filled with currency notes. No receipts were given. The opposition has demanded an inquiry and has said the payments amounted to bribery since, at the meetings, Arroyo discussed an impeachment complaint against her which is being dealt with by the House of Representatives. Arroyo herself has not commented on the issue. "Our country is not only suffering from economic bankruptcy but also moral bankruptcy, disappointingly being shown by our leaders," Archbishop Angel Lagdameo, the head of the powerful Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, said in a statement. WEATHER THE STORM Political analysts, however, believe Arroyo can weather the storm. "As long as she has the support of the military and police and her political coalition remains intact, she's very safe," Earl Parreno, an analyst at the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms, told Reuters. Parreno said there were also other factors contributing to Arroyo's relative stability -- a strong economy and the fragmented political opposition. Since August, Arroyo's government has been on the defensive, avoiding senate inquiries into political killings, election fraud and corruption in government contracts. Last month, Arroyo's husband was named in a kickback scandal involving a multi-million dollar broadband project and his golfing partner -- the head of the elections commission -- quit his job. Last week, a senior official of Arroyo's political party, Kampi, was fired after he allegedly offered bribes to opposition lawmakers to support a weak impeachment complaint against her, thereby shielding her for at least 12 months from any other impeachment motion. Since 2001 when she was swept into power in an army-backed popular uprising, Arroyo has survived two impeachment motions and two attempts by rogue soldiers to grab power. Parreno said Arroyo was adept at avoiding lasting damage from such scandals, but the charges were beginning to pile up. "She's walking on shifting sand without a solid rock foundation," he said. But he added that her opponents would not try to bring her down after next year. "After 2008, the politicians would settle down and focus on the 2010 presidential elections. It would be a waste of time and money to focus on a president about to step dow
