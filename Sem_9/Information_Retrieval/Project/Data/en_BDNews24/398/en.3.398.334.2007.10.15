 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday to try to bridge his differences with Israel over the scope of a US-led conference on Israeli-Palestinian peace. Statements from Israeli and Palestinian officials after Rice began a four-day visit on Sunday suggested major gaps remained over a joint document that would set the parameters for the international gathering expected to be held late next month. Rice has cautioned against expecting any major breakthrough on the paper during her visit and said she expected to return to the region for further talks before the conference gets under way in Annapolis, Maryland. Both Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, whom Rice saw on Sunday, have said they hoped the meeting would be a launching point for negotiations on Palestinian statehood. Olmert, however, has sought to address only in general terms the most divisive aspects of the Middle East conflict -- borders of a Palestinian state, the future of the holy city of Jerusalem and the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees. Israeli-Palestinian talks on those issues collapsed in 2001 amid a surge in violence. Abbas has been pressing for a document with a timetable for dealing with "final-status" matters. Olmert has rejected setting a timeframe. The prospect of renewed talks on Palestinian statehood has stirred opposition from Olmert's right-wing coalition partners, and Abbas has been weakened by the takeover of the Gaza Strip in June by Hamas Islamists opposed to his peace moves with Israel. Palestinian officials said Abbas would raise objections in his talks with Rice to Israel's plans to build a new road in the occupied West Bank near the large Jewish settlement of Maaleh Adumim on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The Israeli army said the road would help connect Palestinian communities. Palestinian officials accused Israel of creating "facts on the ground" that would divide the West Bank into cantons and ultimately deny them a viable state. "The success of Rice's efforts requires reaching a clear statement that will include the final-status issues, in addition to stopping the settlement projects that aim to isolate Jerusalem and divide the West Bank," Nabil Abu Rdainah, an Abbas aide, said on Sunday. Olmert told Rice on Sunday it was his "clear hope" a joint statement would be agreed in time for the conference but added "that's not a condition for the meeting taking place", his spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said. Underscoring tight security for the visit, Rice's motorcade pulled to the side of the road for about 20 minutes on the short drive from Jerusalem to the West Bank city of Ramallah as security agents checked out a suspicious vehicle. It turned out to be harmless.
