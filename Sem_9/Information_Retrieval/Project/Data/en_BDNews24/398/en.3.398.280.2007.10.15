<TITLE> Shanghai's Xi tapped as troubleshooter, again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Married to a famous singer and in charge of China's richest and most glamorous city, troubleshooting Shanghai Communist Party boss Xi Jinping has emerged as dark horse contender for the top echelons of power. Picked not once but twice to bring a troublesome part of the country under control, Xi is set for promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee at a key Party Congress which opened on Monday, sources with ties to the leadership have said. Xi was promoted to governor of the southeastern province of Fujian in August 1999 after a string of provincial officials were caught up in a graft dragnet. And in March this year, the portly Xi secured the top job in China's commercial capital after his predecessor, Chen Liangyu, was caught up in a huge corruption case that has implicated more than a dozen senior city officials and businessmen. Xi shot to national fame in the early 1980s as Party boss of a rural county in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing. He had rare access to then national Party chief Hu Yaobang in the leadership compound, Zhongnanhai, west of the Forbidden City. He moved on to Fujian, a strategic province lying across the strait from democratic and self-ruled Taiwan, in 1985. Xi, 54, is the son of former reformist vice premier and parliament vice-chairman Xi Zhongxun, making him a "princeling" -- one of the privileged sons and daughters of China's incumbent, retired or late leaders. A native of the poor, inland province of Shaanxi, home of the terracotta warriors, Xi graduated in engineering from Beijing's elite Tsinghua University, which educated many top leaders, including Party boss Hu Jintao. Xi also has a doctorate in law. A SIMPLE LIFE Xi is married to Peng Liyuan, a renowned singer who is arguably more popular in China than her husband. "He's the best," Peng gushed in an interview with a state-run magazine earlier this year, describing him as frugal, hardworking and down-to-earth. "When he comes home, I've never thought of it as though there's some leader in the house. In my eyes, he's just my husband. When I get home, he doesn't think of me as some famous star. In his eyes, I'm simply his wife," she added. Xi was transferred in 2002 to the affluent, freewheeling eastern province of Zhejiang, where the economy is overwhelmingly dominated by private business. Considered a reformer and pro-business, he is regarded as a friend by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who has described him as "the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line". As Shanghai Party chief, he walked a fine line between supporting Hu Jintao and former leader Jiang Zemin, whose power base is in the city. Now, some say he may be tapped to succeed Hu. "He's acceptable to both sides," one source with ties to the leadership said, referring to Hu and Jiang. In a speech shortly after taking over Shanghai, Xi vowed loyalty to Hu's agenda pushing for more balanced development to even out disparities between rich coastal areas and the poorer hinterland, summed up in Hu's calls for a "harmonious society". Chen was known for his relentless promotion of Shanghai, including grandiose projects such as a $350 million Formula One race track, a vision backed by Jiang. "General Secretary Hu Jintao ardently hopes that Shanghai will lead the way in transforming the mode of economic growth," Xi told city officials, laying down Hu's vision while promising to lift the city's competitiveness and international clout
