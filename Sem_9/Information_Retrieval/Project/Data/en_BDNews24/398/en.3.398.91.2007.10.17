<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto confirmed she would fly home to Karachi on Thursday to end more than eight years of self-exile and lead her party into national elections due in early January. "Tomorrow at this time we will be on board the plane for Karachi, which is a day that I and all the people in Pakistan who love democracy and who believe in fundamental human rights have been waiting for," Bhutto told a newsconference in Dubai on the eve of her departure. The leader of the country's biggest opposition party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), has refused to be put off by requests from President Pervez Musharraf to delay her return, or by threats of assassination from Pakistani Taliban fighters. There is strong speculation that she will reach a post-election power-sharing agreement with General Musharraf.
