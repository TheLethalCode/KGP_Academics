 Dhaka, 17 Oct (bdnews24.com)  Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Wednesday made it clear to the EU presidency in Dhaka that Bangladesh did not support EU and US initiatives to impose tougher sanctions on Myanmar. The adviser said Bangladesh would forge ahead with plans to construct a Bangladesh-Myanmar highway. He said negotiations with Myanmar on allowing Bangladeshi agriculturists to farm Myanmar land on a contractual basis would continue. "Bangladesh fully supports the efforts undertaken by UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari on Myanmar and hopes for a peaceful resolution of all concerned issues," Chowdhury said in a statement on his meeting with Netherlands Ambassador BM ten Tusscher at the foreign affairs ministry. The Netherlands represents the EU presidency in Dhaka because current EU president Portugal does not have a mission here. The press statement said the adviser and the Dutch ambassador discussed regional issues including the Myanmar crisis. In September, the UN secretary-general sent his envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar to convince the country's military junta to end a recent crackdown on pro-democracy activists. Protests by Buddhist monks and common people against Myanmar's military rulers over rising commodity prices in August and September led to a brutal military crack down. "We have extended support to the initiative of the UN to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari has also been accepted by the Myanmar government," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "We will continue with plans to construct the Myanmar-Bangladesh friendship road, and continue negotiations on 'contract' farming." Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a deal in August to construct a 23-kilometre cross boundary road from Teknaf in Bangladesh to Bowlibazar in Myanmar. The Myanmar government also agreed to allow Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to farm Myanmar land on a contractual basis. The final deal is yet to be signed. Myanmar's second-in-command was scheduled to visit Dhaka in August but the trip was cancelled because of domestic unrest in Myanmar. bdnews
