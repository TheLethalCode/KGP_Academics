 WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World trade talks are making good progress and appear to be edging close to a deal, Brazil's ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday. "I think on the Doha round, we are extremely close to an agreement," Ambassador Antonio Patriota said in a speech to the US-Brazil Business Council. Patriota said U.S. President George W Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had spoke by phone about the Doha round on Tuesday evening. Patriota said he had not been briefed on that call yet, but was optimistic about the fate of the round following recent meetings between Bush and Lula at the United Nations and other high-level talks between the United States and Brazil. "I think we have seen sufficient movement on the part of all participants to be relatively assured that we will be able to reach a satisfactory result very, very soon," Patriota said. Brazil, as a leader of the G20 developing countries, has been pushing the United States for deep cuts in its trade-distorting farm subsidies as part of the deal. In turn, the United States has urged Brazil and other advanced developing countries such as India and South Africa to do their part by agreeing to open their agriculture and manufactured goods market to more imports. The leaders of Brazil, India and South Africa are holding a summit meeting in South Africa on Wednesday and the Doha round is one of the topics on their agenda. Just last week, U.S. and EU officials warned that the nearly six-year Doha round was in danger of failing because advanced developing countries were seeking more opt-outs from proposed manufacturing tariff cuts rather than negotiating on the basis of a compromise text released in July. Since then, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told Bush in a telephone call on Monday that the compromise manufactured goods text could be the basis for discussions on a deal. Patriota told reporters after his speech that Brazil also was prepared to negotiate on the basis of that text, even though many developing countries believed that it was too demanding compared to the agriculture text. "I think it is recognized that Brazil played a role in preventing the NAMA (non-agricultural market access) text in being rejected," Patriota said. "So, to that extent, I think you can interpret that as meaning we're ready to discuss the road map that is presented by that paper." Brazil is keenly awaiting the revised NAMA text at the end of the month and also wants to see how proposed farm subsidy cuts would affect individual US commodity programs, such as for cotton, Patriota sa
