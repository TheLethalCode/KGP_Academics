<TITLE> Spain seizes US treasure ship at gunpoint - firm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GIBRALTAR, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Spanish warship seized a US treasure-hunting vessel Madrid suspects of taking gold and silver worth millions of dollars from a sunken Spanish galleon on Tuesday, the US crew said. The Spanish Navy corvette blocked the path of the Odyssey Explorer after it left Gibraltar, a British colony on the southern tip of Spain, and threatened to open fire when the captain refused to let police board. The warship then escorted the boat, which belongs to US company Odyssey Marine Exploration, to the Spanish port Algeciras so police could carry out a search. "They threatened that we must obey or they would use deadly force," Ali Nessar, a company representative on the boat, told Reuters by phone. "We were forced at gunpoint to come to Algeciras." Spanish Civil Guard Police boarded the vessel once it docked in Algeciras, then escorted sailors off the vessel one by one. Police allowed two engineers to stay on board but seized cameras and mobile phone chips, Nessar said. Police officials were not available to comment on the raid. In a statement from its US headquarters, Odyssey Marine said it was waiting for word from the Spanish judge who ordered the search about results of the inspection. Madrid suspects the US company of recovering treasure from Spanish waters or from a Spanish galleon in international waters, either of which would give Spain a claim to the booty, the government says. Odyssey Marine Exploration has said it has legally discovered gold and silver coins worth an estimated $500 million while working on a wreck code-named Black Swan at a secret location in the Atlantic Ocean. The Odyssey Explorer had been berthed at Gibraltar's British naval base since May, under threat of arrest by Spanish police if it left the colony. It was not clear what its original destination was on Tuesday. It is the second time Spanish police have stopped an Odyssey Marine Exploration ship. In July police searched the vessel Ocean Alert, also on its leaving Gibraltar, confiscating computer hard drives from the crew and journalists.
