<TITLE> South Korea ready for trains to North: rail chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea is ready to roll freight trains across the heavily armed border with North Korea anytime the communist state's military gives clearance, the South's railway chief said on Friday. President Lee Chul of Korea Railroad also said in an interview he will be in talks with China later this month and with the North soon to work out the details of sending a joint Korean cheering squad to the Beijing Olympics next year. Lee was part of South Korea's delegation to the North when President Roh Moo-hyun met North Korean leader Kim Jong-il for the divided Koreas' second only summit earlier this month. The two leaders agreed to start a cargo train service between Kaesong -- a light industry peace project just north of the border -- and the South, to move goods produced by South Korean firms there using cheap North Korean labour. "If a military guarantee is secured at talks between prime ministers and defence ministers in November, we can immediately send cargo trains in, even today," Lee said. "I hope that we use this opportunity to make such a guarantee a permanent one, if only for railway operations." The guarantee refers to approval by the North's military needed to cross the Demilitarised Zone border. When the two Koreas exchanged test trains in May for the first time in 56 years, the North's military limited the approval to a single run. Lee said freight train services joining the South and Kaesong will sharply cut costs for South Korean businesses and help reduce tensions between the two sides, which remain technically at war under a truce after the 1950-53 hostilities. "Cutting transport costs to one-third, one-fifth, actually, this will be a revolutionary change," he said in his office overlooking Seoul Station, home to Korea Railroad's 300-km (185 miles hr) KTX bullet trains. Lee, a three-term former member of parliament, has pushed for reconnecting the two Koreas' train services, which has not been an easy job given the reclusive North's reluctance to open up. But he said there is fresh momentum following the Oct. 4 Korean summit to use greater commercial ties as a way to reduce lingering military tensions. "The Korean peninsula has been the world's last ammunition depot, and its western region is where tension is highest." South Korea, mindful of the hundreds of billions of dollars it would cost to reunify with its impoverished neighbour, has sought to gradually bring the two together. Critics have said it is too slow and the North's intentions were questionable. Lee said much of the North's railway network is in serious disrepair but it did not need a complete overhaul to work with the South's modern and automated system or with China's railway, as some experts have said. However: "The costs are not a laughing matter." Roh said on Friday investment for joining the two Koreas' railways will largely come from the private sector. "But because it will be very difficult for such a project as the trans-Korea railway to make a profit in the initial stages, some sort of combination of private funds and public funds will be required," Roh told foreign reporters. For Lee, the significance of the project goes far beyond any short-term cost-benefit analysis. "The Korean peninsula has been more isolated than any island, but at last, we'll become one with the continent and the road to the Eurasian continent will be wide ope
