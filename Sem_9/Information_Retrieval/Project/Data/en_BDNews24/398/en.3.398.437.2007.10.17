 Eric Auchard SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Google shares are trading just three percent below a record high ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday, but many investors are looking past the strong results expected and focusing on whether it can diversify revenue to sustain growth long-term. The shares' record high of $641.41, set early last week, was fuelled by the company's accelerating market-share gains in the Web search market, which drives its search ad business. The short-term question for investors is whether Google shares can hold onto recent gains. The stock is up nearly 30 percent since mid-August, when money managers fled a U.S. mortgage meltdown into "safe" tech names. "Google has done most of its earnings pop over the past couple of weeks," said Todd Greenwald, an analyst with Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco. "The chances that the stock trades up from Q3 results are even less likely," said Citi analyst Mark Mahaney, who nevertheless recommends investors buy the stock. The shares have shot by his current target price of $600, but he will consider revising that after Google reports. Investors are looking for clues for when the Internet leader's push into new markets, especially video and corporate brand advertising and the mobile Internet, might pay off. Video advertising is likely to take 18 months to materialize, Mahaney estimates. A second huge market could be mobile advertising, but he forecasts this area could take three years to become a material contributor to Google earnings. Wall Street is beginning to focus on valuing Google beyond current 2008 estimates, which are in the process of upward revision. Analysts have raced in recent weeks to raise share price targets above $700. The average target price by analysts for Google shares is $655.70, ranging from $740 at the high end to as low as $545. "The Street's current view on valuation could prove too conservative once valuations and price targets are moved toward a year-end 2008 time period," Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said in a research note last week. Google's third-quarter report Thursday will cap a week when many of the biggest technology companies report results. Analysts expect Google revenue to grow 54 percent from a year ago to around $4.13 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. But ever-larger advertising sales numbers mean Google's growth rate has slid from 70 percent in the 2006 third quarter and 96 percent in 2005. EYE TO INVESTOR DAY Google, which is famously loath to provide financial projections to investors, may be more circumspect than usual in the conference call that follows its results on Thursday. It may wait for an analyst meeting on October 24 at Google headquarters to detail some of its future growth plans. Mahaney said the key question for Google is what will halt its steady year-to-year slide into tech stock maturity? His answer is that faster growth in new markets or existing business may halt the deceleration in revenue or margins. Alternatively, Google, which has spent heavily on new staff, could curtail spending to drive up cash flow. Data from research firm comScore showed Google's hold over the market for consumer Web searches accelerated to 57 percent of the U.S. market in September from around 54 percent in the June quarter. Internationally, its share is even stronger. Google trades around 31 times the consensus earnings profit estimate of $20 a share. While a consensus over 2009 numbers is only beginning to emerge, Google trades at a manageable 25 times earnings, Greenwald estimates. By contrast, Amazon Inc is trading at 59 times 2008 consensus forecasts. Yahoo, growing at one-fifth the rate of Google, is valued around 26 times next year's expectations, including its Japanese and Chinese holdings, Greenwald says. Twenty-three brokerages and advisers have some form of "buy" rating on Google stock, two tell investors to "hold" their positions and only one advises shareholders to "sell" Google stock, according to Reuters Estimates.
