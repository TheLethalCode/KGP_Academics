 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  The bickering BNP camps Wednesday said they would revamp the party before rolling out reforms. BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah said secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain planned to reactivate the party's Dhaka City wing before going for reforms nationwide. "I gathered from the secretary general that party reorganisation will start in Dhaka before moving out across the country," he said, referring to his meeting with Delwar Tuesday. Hannan remained highly critical of the government's refusal to open the BNP's central office, terming the move a "dual policy". "We would like to see the party office open and functional, even if that means excluding some elements in the party," said Hannan to reporters at his Mohakhali DOHS home. "The Jatiya Party has its factions, the Awami League also has its divisions, but the government is keeping the mainstream BNP locked out of their office." "We don't understand how the government can keep the BNP office under lock and key at the request of Mannan Bhuiyan, an ousted party leader." "The caretaker government has failed to hold the election within three months of assuming power," he alleged. "However, emergency rule was necessary in the face of actions of some political parties," Hannan added. ZA Khan, the BNP chairperson's other adviser, told reporters at his Gulshan home that no party council should be convened until the party grassroots had been revamped. "We would like to convene a council meeting after getting the chairperson's consent. We are waiting to meet Khaleda Zia," said Khan. "If we fail to meet the chairperson we will proceed according to the party constitution," he added. bdnews2
