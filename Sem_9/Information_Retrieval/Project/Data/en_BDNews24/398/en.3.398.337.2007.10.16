 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks jumped to all-time highs Tuesday, with indices recording remarkable one-day gains. The surge was triggered by a buying frenzy in shares of Rupali Bank on reports that its future owner Prince Bandar will close the deal with the government by November. Rupali grew 57 percent to reach an all-time high of Tk 3124.5 before the Dhaka Stock Exchange halted its trading to examine the reasons behind its unusual rise, while BRAC Bank, along with most other banks, added extra pace to the market. The main DGEN or general index finished at an all-time high of 2871.10, up 68.50 points or 2.44 percent. The DSI or all-share price index surged 115.49 points or 4.95 percent to touch its highest mark at 2447.84. The DSE-20 blue chip index added 39.46 points or 1.83 percent to 2195.90. Operators said fund inflows into the market have increased due mainly to lack of alternative investment avenues. Low credit demands encouraged banks with surplus funds to invest here. A portion of investors, including those previously invested in savings instruments, are also cashing in on the tax-free capital gains after the government imposed taxes on earnings from savings certificates. Yawer Sayeed who helps manage about Tk 1.0 billion funds at AIMS of Bangladesh attributed the rise to the rally in bank stocks. "I am concerned because I have a feeling many new investors are putting in money without much thinking. It's is not a healthy sign," he said. Gainers outnumbered losers 130 to 64. Some eight issues held steady. Turnover stood at Tk 2.58 billion from trading of 18,327,601 shares. BRAC Bank, the most active share, climbed 6.78 percent to touch an all time high of Tk 1533.5, reporting that it had signed an agreement with Dubai-based firm to set up a credit rating agency for small and medium enterprises in Bangladesh. BRAC Bank will have 15 percent equity participation in the proposed agency, it said. Rupali Bank, the second most active share, surged 57.26 percent to finish at its higher ever at Tk 3124.5, on hopes of its speedy handover as Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Mohamed Abdulrahman Al-Saud, the winner of a 93 percent stake in the state-run bank, plans to finalise the deal with the government by November. A deadlock in the handover of the bank had earlier depressed investors. Institutional buying drove Trust Bank up 7.13 percent, to close at its highest value of Tk 968.5. Prime Bank, UCBL, the other active shares, also advanced but AB Bank declined as investors locked in profits. Summit Power, most active in the power sector, grew 9.2 percent to end at an all-time high of Tk 1678.50, after it reported signing agreements with the government regarding establishment of four plants with a total power generation capacity of 110 MW. Rumours of high dividends pulled DESCO shares 7.5 percent up to close at its highest ever level of Tk 1368. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh declined on profit taking. AIMS 1st mutual fund also declined due to profit-taking. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied with 74 issues advancing and 33 losing. A total of 3,622,881 shares of Tk 319.55 million traded.
