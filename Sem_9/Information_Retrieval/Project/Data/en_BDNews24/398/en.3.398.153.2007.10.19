 DAKAR, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A team of European Union experts will arrive in Dakar next month to discuss technical and financial assistance for Senegal to try former Chadian leader Hissene Habre on human rights charges, sources said on Friday.

Western ambassadors are due to meet Senegalese ministers next month to discuss progress towards the trial, after human rights groups have denounced a lack of political will on the part of Senegal, where the wealthy Habre has many influential allies particularly among the Muslim clerics or marabouts.
