<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The elections to the local government bodies across the country will be held in phases from March next year, the chief election commissioner said Thursday. "Though the local government elections were scheduled to start in January, we are going to include those who reached the age of 18 years on January 1, 2008 in the voter list with photographs," ATM Shamsul Huda said to journalists at his office. "Some time will also be required for correction of the voter list. So the local body elections across the country will be held from March-April." The announcement means the Election Commission is going to overlook the criticism by political parties that it is constitutionally mandated to hold national polls, not the local government ones under a caretaker government. The CEC announced a roadmap to local elections at a press conference on July 15. According to the roadmap, the elections to the local bodies including city corporations, municipalities, upazilas and union parishads were scheduled in phases from January 2008. Huda said he would ask the government to relax the state of emergency before the local body polls. "I will definitely appeal to the government in time." He said advertisements would be aired in the radio and television channels urging people to get enlisted as voters with photographs. Besides, mobile phone companies would highlight the issue in their own advertisements. At the local level, the NGOs through the Election Working Group, a platform of NGOs to create polls-related awareness, had been circulating leaflets and posters, he said. Huda dismissed criticism by the political parties that the Election Commission was not independent. "The present Election Commission is very much independent. We are not facing any problem in our work. Nobody is interfering with our work. 'Those who say that we are not independent should specify in which areas we are dependent and what should be the criteria for an independent Election Commission." He said a draft on the independent Election Commission act had been sent to the government for approval. "I hope it will soon become a law. We have also prepared a draft on what should be the eligibility of the election commissioners. However no laws will work if any political government wants to cripple the Election Commission. "So those who are involved with election and politics should discharge their responsibilities properly." Asked whether there were doubts over the participation of the two major political parties in the ongoing electoral reforms dialogue, he said, "I think the political parties will participate in the dialogue in their own interest." bdnews24.c
