 Dhaka, October 18 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP minister Mirza Abbas Wednesday threatened a cameraman and a reporter of the state-owned Bangladesh Television, where his beaming face would often flash during his party's latest term that ended last year. Abbas, who served as housing and public works minister in 2001-2006, threatened to damage the camera as the media crew tried to film him after he arrived at Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court as an accused. BTV reporter Nuruzzaman Iqbal and his crew were the victims. Witnesses said Abbas got furious and blurted out angry words as they prepared to shoot. Abbas reportedly behaved same way Wednesday with Channel-I reporter Mostafa Mallick and its cameraman. It happened after he had reached the veranda of the court of Judge M Azizul Haque. Thursday was the day for the police to submit a final investigation report against Abbas in a case involving illegal possession of foreign currency. Abbas was taken to the court from the Dhaka Central Jail at 11am. On February 4, the joint forces raided Abbas's home in the city's Shahjahanpur and seized foreign currencies without any valid document. Later, a case was filed against Abbas, also a former mayor of the Dhaka City Corporation. Judge Haque had earlier directed police investigator Rafiqul Islam to submit a fresh investigation report after another judge transferred the case to him. The case is being handled under emergency powers rules. Judge Haque Thursday set November 8 for next hearing of the case as the investigating officer failed to submit his report. bdne
