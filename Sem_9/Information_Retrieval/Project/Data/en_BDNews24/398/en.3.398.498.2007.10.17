<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  An overwhelming majority of participants in a survey rejected Bikalpadhara chief AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury's proposal of a national consensus government for two tenures. In the regular opinion poll of bdnews24.com, 730 respondents or 70 percent of the 1,039 said they did not support the unity government. Only 30 percent or 309 respondents agreed on the former president's proposal. Badruddoza had floated the idea of forming a "government of national consensus" at an iftar congregation which a number of politicians attended. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman initially agreed with the proposal and the issue triggered political debate after BNP reformist leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan supported the proposal. Zillur, however, withdrew support, saying it was "too early". BNP also trashed the idea. bdnews24.
