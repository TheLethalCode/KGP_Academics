 PARIS, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained ground on Wednesday morning, as rising tech and banking shares helped the market reverse a two-session fall, with Dutch chip equipment maker ASML surging on positive results. But gains were limited by mining stocks which fell after Rio Tinto said it failed to stop a decline in the United States and Australia in mined copper output, which fell 6 percent in the third quarter because of lower metal content in its ore. Rio lost 2.6 percent, while Anglo American dropped 2 percent and Xstrata shed 1.1 percent. Miners were among Europe's biggest laggards. At 0840 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,579.10 points. Europe's benchmark index, beaten down this summer on fears over a squeeze in the credit markets, has gained nearly 2 percent so far this month, and is up 6.4 percent on the year. "We've had a pretty solid rebound that came faster than expected. There is some consolidation at this point and it's good for the market. We should continue to rise this year," said Jean-Luc Buchalet, strategist at FactSet, in Paris. ASML gained 5.5 percent after it said bookings rebounded in the third quarter and the average price of new orders reached a record high, driven by demand for its most advanced lithography machines. Shares of oil and gas producers retreated along with oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures dipped but remained within sight of a record high of $88.20 on supply concerns and on mounting tension between Turkey and Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq. Total dropped 1 percent and BP shed 1.3 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.06 percent, while both the UK's FTSE 100 index and France's CAC 40 were up 0.2 percent. Danone gained 3 percent after the French food group repeated its outlook for annual sales and profit margin growth despite showing the slowest underlying sales growth in more than five years in the third quarter. DS Smith rose 8.6 percent after the packaging company said first-half underlying profit will rise by at least 70 percent and that it expects to make "substantial progress" over the full financial year. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on the US consumer price index as well as on housing starts for September, expected at 1230 G
