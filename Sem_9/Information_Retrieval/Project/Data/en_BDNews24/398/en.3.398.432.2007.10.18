 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission may charge Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina with irregularities in signing agreement with Canadian oil and gas exploration company Niko Resources Ltd and causing huge financial loss to the state, an official hinted Thursday. ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman did not name the prime ministers but said charges would be brought against former heads of the governments if allegations were proved. At a news briefing at the ACC office in Segunbagicha he said some ministers and bureaucrats of the past regimes would not be spared either. The secretary said a thorough investigation was on to dig out irregularities involving the Niko deal. "It is being investigated if anybody is personally benefited from the deal with Niko," he said. He accused both the regimes under Khaleda and Hasina of causing huge loss to state coffer by declaring some newly-found gas fields, Feni and Tengratila, as abandoned. Two investigating officers have been appointed to investigate two regimes, he said. Asked whether separate cases would be filed against Khaleda and Hasina, the ACC secretary said, "How many cases would be filed can be determined after getting the investigation report." He hoped the investigation report would be available by November. The draft of the agreement with Niko was prepared during the former Awami League government and the deal was signed during the tenure of the BNP-led coalition government, he said. The Bangladesh government in December 2005 demanded compensation from Niko for two blowouts at a gas field that caused devastating fires that damaged trees and crops. Two separate government investigations had found that the Calgary-based Niko Resources Ltd. was responsible for two blowouts, one in January and another in June, 2005. The fires burned billions of cubic feet of gas at the Tengratila field in Sunamganj district. Petrobangla, the state-owned oil and gas regulatory body, sent a compensation claim to Niko's authorities in December that year, demanding the company supply 8.89 billion cubic feet (0.25 cubic million meters) of gas free of charges to the national grid. Authorities also demanded that Niko pay 845.5 million takas (US$13 million, euro11.03 million) to cover environmental damage. Bangladesh has proven natural gas reserves of up to 15 trillion cubic feet (425 billion cubic meters). Foreign companies have invested millions of dollars (euros) to explore and produce gas alongside state-run companies. In June 1997, a huge gas fire at Magurchhara field in neighbouring Moulvibazar district burned for 23 days, causing millions of dollars of damage to villages, forests and railway tracks. bdnews24.c
