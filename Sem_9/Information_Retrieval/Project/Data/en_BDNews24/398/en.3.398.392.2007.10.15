 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)  A clear low has formed in the north Bay of Bengal, setting off thunderstorms in coastal zones and gusty winds over seaports. Chittagong weather official Abdur Rahman told bdnews24.com's bureau in the port city that coastal districts including Chittagong had been experiencing light rains since morning. The squally weather has caused Chittagong Port Authority to suspend the operations of smaller vessels, port official Manzur Parvez said. Large ships have been asked to be cautious during movement, he said. Airport officials said Chittagong air traffic was normal. bdnews24.com correspondent Alasdair Macdonald reported from Kuakata in the coastal district of Patuakhali where the weather has washed out expected holiday business: "It's terrific. It's raining constantly. There is no electricity where we are. Tourism is badly affected." Macdonald said shopkeepers, who were expecting good business during the Eid vacation, are disappointed: "It's now gone." Morshed Ali Khan, a journalist who has a tourism project in Kuakata, said some fishermen had ventured out to sea despite the bad weather. "We're seeing large swells. It's quite a rough sea," he said. Strong winds and driving rain have battered the area's tourism industry. Booked hotel rooms remained empty as the rain, which picked up just before nine Sunday night, interrupted holiday plans. "Nobody can go out because of the torrential rain." "There is no traffic and no motorcycles to carry passengers to their destinations," Khan told bdnews24.com by phone. bd
