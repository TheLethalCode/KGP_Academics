 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank is worried that the FY 2007-08 budget deficit could grow if expected foreign aid does not arrive. It will be difficult to finance the debt if expected foreign assistance is not disbursed, said a combined first and second quarterly report for FY 2007-08 published Wednesday. The economy will be hit by 'alarming' increases in commodity prices and rising fuel prices in the international market, the central bank report said. The bank had set a target budget deficit of Tk 25,581 crore for the current fiscal year. This includes, for the first time, Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation dues worth Tk 7,523 crore. If the BPC dues are deducted then the budget deficit would be slashed by a quarter. Expected outlays to repair damaged infrastructure following floods this year could also notch up the deficit. But high value export-oriented activities had hardly been affected by the floods, the central bank said. Foreign sources accounted for just 3 per cent of deficit financing for the first month of FY 2007-08. Net foreign aid flow in the first month of FY 2007-08 came to just US$ 5.8 million (Tk 397.1 crore). The amount was US$ 12.2 million (Tk 83.5 crore) during the same period in FY 2006-07. Domestic financing accounted for Tk 1,414 crore of the total budget deficit of Tk 1,454 crore for this period. The government's debt to the banking system accounted for Tk 1065.20 crore of domestic financing while the remaining Tk 349.34 crore came from other sources. According to FY 2006-07 budget statistics the deficit in the main budget was estimated at Tk 14,690 crore. In the revised budget the amount rose to Tk 16,901 crore. bdnews2
