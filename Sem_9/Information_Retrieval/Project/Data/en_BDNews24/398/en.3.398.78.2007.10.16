<TITLE> Harbhajan hungry for success in Australia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Off spinner Harbhajan Singh is keen to emulate his domestic success against Australia when India embark on their test tour starting in December. Harbhajan, 27, proved a handful for the Australians on their last two trips to India, but has played just one test in Australia. He bowled 35 overs and took one wicket in the drawn first test in Brisbane on India's last tour in 2003-04 before a finger injury forced him out of the remainder of the tour. The Sikh has an impressive haul of 53 wickets against Australia in his last six tests at home over two series, but said outwitting them in Australia was his biggest goal. "That's the tour that people want to go on and do well," Harbhajan told Reuters. "They (Australia) play tough cricket and it gives you a lot of satisfaction when you do well against that sort of a side, especially in their conditions." India are scheduled to play four tests in Australia from Dec. 26 before a tri-nation one-day series also involving Sri Lanka. Although India next host Pakistan for a one-day and test series, there is already fevered anticipation of the Australia tour following verbal exchanges between the players during the current seven-match one-day series in India. Australia have secured the series 4-1 with a game to spare after the opening fixture was washed out. The final game will be played in Mumbai on Wednesday. TOUGH CRICKET Harbhajan was dropped following the shock first round exit from this year's 50-over World Cup in March, but featured prominently in last month's Twenty20 win after a useful stint with English county Surrey to stage a one-day comeback. Although the most economical Indian bowler in the ongoing series, he has taken just three wickets in five games. He rejected criticism he was more keen to restrict runs. "I always look for wickets, but in one-day cricket a lot depends on the situation you are bowling in. "(Captain Mahendra) Dhoni wanted a few overs of me during power play, in the middle-overs and at the end in most matches," added Harbhajan, who has taken 238 test wickets and 177 one-day wickets in a 10-year career. Harbhajan, who captured 32 wickets in three tests to spark India's comeback home series triumph over Australia in 2001, was hopeful the team would draw inspiration from previous Australia tours when they travel there. "The last time, I remember Anil (Kumble) had a great series there," he said of the leg-spinner who took 24 wickets in three tests to help India draw the four-match series 1-1. "Sure there will be some tough cricket on the field (this time), but they can expect the same from us." Harbhajan also took 21 wickets and Kumble 27 scalps on Australia's 2004 tour, but the tourists won 2-1 to clinch their first test series on Indian soil for 35 years. "I did well in 2001 and 2004, and there will be a lot of expectations," he said. "I hope I can repeat it in their conditions.
