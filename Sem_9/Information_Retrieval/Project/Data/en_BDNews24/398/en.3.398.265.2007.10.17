 MUMBAI, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com) - India edged a fluctuating final one-day international by two wickets in Mumbai, as the series ended 4-2 to Australia. Murali Kartik took 6-27, the best ODI return by a left-arm spinner and three batsmen fell first ball, although Ricky Ponting hit a 63rd one-day fifty. Australia mustered 193 all out but India were soon 8-2 inside four overs. Robin Uthappa gave them hope with two sixes in a fluent 47, and an unbroken 52 stand between Zaheer Khan and Kartik led them home with four overs to spare. The hosts omitted former skipper Rahul Dravid, who had made only 51 runs in the series, including two ducks, although Mahendra Dhoni insisted he had been merely rested. Left-armers Zaheer Khan and RP Singh found considerable movement with the new ball, but struggled to control it, sending down 14 wides between them. But Zaheer did strike with his very first delivery, pitching on middle stump and moving in to trap Clarke lbw bang in front, umpire Aleem Dar having no hesitation at the start of his 100th one-day international. After his 130 in the opening match of the series, it was a second successive first-ball dismissal for 26-year-old Clarke. Ponting was the one batsman to look in touch, striking three fluent boundaries in one over from Singh and playing his customary array of attacking strokes. Although he had faced much less of the strike, in the seventh over Gilchrist had only two to his name when he was dropped by Robin Uthappa at second slip off Zaheer. The left-hander hit three fours in six balls but was well caught at third man when he skewed an extremely wide delivery from Irfan Pathan that barely pitched on the cut strip. After Kartik had Brad Hodge caught at slip in his second over, he claimed the key wicket of Andrew Symonds next ball when the burly all-rounder slashed a long-hop low to Sachin Tendulkar at point. Ponting slashed at a wide one from Singh and edged behind in the 27th over, before a pivotal 32nd over of the innings from Kartik. An arm ball accounted for Brad Haddin, and though Brad Hogg was unfortunate to be given out caught at short-leg when the ball hit nothing but his pad, there was no doubt next ball when Lee prodded to gully and was the eighth wicket to fall. That left Australia with 10 minutes to negotiate to avoid having to field before the interval scheduled to take place between innings. They managed that, and Mitchell Johnson hit a six and a four in three balls off Harbhajan Singh as the final two wickets added 31. Under the full effect of the floodlights, Australia new ball pair Lee and Johnson found equally prodigious movement to trouble the India batsmen. Sourav Ganguly wafted recklessly at one that moved away from him and Dinesh Karthik, in for Dravid, also departed for a duck when he got a thin edge to a full ball from Johnson. Tendulkar sent Johnson for sumptuous consecutive boundaries through the off-side but was twice fortunate with inside edges that flew inches past the stumps for runs. Lee thought he had been the victim of another and was standing with his head in his hands unaware the leg bail had been dislodged. When Dhoni feathered a thin edge attempting to force off the back foot it was 63-5 and sections of the ever fervent crowd began to disperse. stepping down the wicket as James Hopes came in to bowl and launching him over mid-off for six, though initially it appeared to be merely to lift the India followers But the runs continued as the Australia slow bowlers struggled with their accuracy, the 100 came up in the 27th over and the 50 partnership was recorded from 60 balls With 65 needed from 18 overs, umpire Dar gave Uthappa out pushing well forward to left-arm slow bowler Clarke, and when Harbhajan was smartly caught by Ponting in a solitary wide slip position it was 143-8 and further sections of the crowd left the stadium. Still India were not beaten and Zaheer and Kartik joined forces. Lee was certain Kartik had feathered a catch to Gilchrist, but the keeper did not appeal and much to the chagrin of the paceman and the captain, umpire Dar said no. Kartik drove a full toss to the boundary next ball and Zaheer flicked an irate Lee straight back over his head for six. Courtsey : BB
