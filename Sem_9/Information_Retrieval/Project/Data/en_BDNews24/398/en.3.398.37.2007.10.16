 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)  A launch capsized on the Meghna river as it headed toward Char Alexander in Luxmipur from the southern district of Bhola against a warning of rough weather. ML Bhabanipur-1 sank around 8:00pm after a travel of one hour, Golam Moula, owner of the launch, told bdnews24.com by phone. There were no immediate details on the casualties. The river accident came as the well-marked low over the north Bay of Bengal intensified into a depression, setting off thundershowers and gusty winds. The depression moved slightly northwards, the weather office said in a bulletin. Another launch, ML Bhabanipur-2, returned to the shore with all passengers safe after nervy hours in the stormy weather, said Golam Azam, owner of the vessel. Bhola deputy commissioner Belayet Hossain told bdnews24.com: "There were no casualties from ML Bhabanipur-2. Police and the upazila nirbahi officer have been asked to rush to the scene." The weather office said: "The sea will remain moderately rough." The meteorological department sounded the signal No. 3 for maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla. Chittagong weather official Abdur Rahman told bdnews24.com's bureau in the port city that coastal districts including Chittagong had been experiencing rains. The squally weather has caused Chittagong Port Authority to suspend the operations of smaller vessels, port official Manzur Parvez said. Large ships have been asked to be cautious during movement, he said. Airport officials said Chittagong air traffic was normal. In the south, two fishermen went missing after they fell off their trawler into the choppy waters of the Meghna near Charfashion, fishermen said. Local people said as many as 17 fishing trawlers went missing in mid-river. But there was no official confirmation. bdnews24.com correspondent Alasdair Macdonald reported from Kuakata in the coastal district of Patuakhali where the weather has washed out expected holiday business: "It's terrific. It's raining constantly. There is no electricity where we are. Tourism is badly affected." Macdonald said shopkeepers, who were expecting good business during the Eid vacation, are disappointed: "It's now gone." Morshed Ali Khan, a journalist who has a tourism project in Kuakata, said some fishermen had ventured out to sea despite the bad weather. "We're seeing large swells. It's quite a rough sea," he said. Strong winds and driving rain have battered the area's tourism industry. Booked hotel rooms remained empty as the rain, which picked up just before nine Sunday night, interrupted holiday plans. "Nobody can go out because of the torrential rain." "There is no traffic and no motorcycles to carry passengers to their destinations," Khan told bdnews24.com by phone. bdnews24.c
