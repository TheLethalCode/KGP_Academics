"Pancham's (RD Burman) mother was seriously ill since the death of her husband, acclaimed music director SD Burman. Pancham took care of her until his death," Meera's daughter-in-law and playback singer Asha Bhosle told reporters here, PTI reports. "Her condition was deteriorating over the years due to advanced age and had to be frequently hospitalised. I had just brought her from Lilavati Hospital, two days ago, to her Santacruz home," Bhosle said. Bhosle had shifted Meera to Sharan, an old-age home for rehabilitation of paraplegics in Mumbai's Vashi area, about seven months ago.

She was a music student of Amita Sen, who was trained in Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan. SD Burman, born to the royal family of Tripura, fell in love with Meera when he met her at the All India Music Conference in Allahabad in 1937. Meera became Burman's student and married him the same year. Burman died in 1975. RD Burman died in 1994.
