<TITLE> Fallout of Ericsson Q3 profit slump </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ericsson, the world's biggest mobile network maker, Tuesday unexpectedly issued preliminary results which showed operating profit fell 36 percent to 5.6 billion Swedish crowns ($876 million) due to disappointing sales of upgrades and expansions. A Reuters survey of 33 analysts had forecast 8.9 billion crowns in operating earnings. Here are some facts about the fallout from the surprisingly weak results. -- Ericsson shares plunged almost 30 percent in their biggest intraday fall on record. The previous record, in October 2000, was a 27.8 percent decline. The decline put the stock down about 32 percent since the start of the year. -- The share fall shaved off more than 120 billion Swedish crowns ($19.9 billion) from Ericsson's market capitalisation, robbing it of its position as Sweden biggest company by market value. Its market cap now amounts to $44 billion, surpassed by clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz's $48 billion. -- The news from Ericsson weighed heavily on the stocks of rivals such as Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia as well as some of its listed owners, notably Swedish investment firm Investor AB whose stock fell 4.3 percent. -- The Swedish crown weakened 0.3 percent to 9.148 on the euro while retreating around 0.7 percent to 6.464 the dollar. -- At the peak of the IT boom Ericsson, which then included the handset business since folded into joint venture Sony Ericsson, had 107,000 employees of which 44,500 worked in Sweden. After extensive cuts following the bursting of the IT bubble, Ericsson now employs 67,500 people worldwide, 19,300 of whom work in Sweden.
