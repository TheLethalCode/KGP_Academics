<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Marvin Avila scored twice as Guatemala came from behind to beat a youthful Mexico side 3-2 in a bad-tempered friendly on Wednesday in which both teams ended the game with nine men. Guatemala took the lead at the Coliseum when Rigoberto Gomez hooked home an Avila cross from close range but two quick goals put Mexico in charge. Cesare Villaluz found Carlos Vela in the 31st minute and the striker made no mistake, screwing his shot past Guatemala keeper Paulo Cesar Motta to bring the scores level. A minute later Villaluz was on target with a fine left-foot drive from the edge of the area to give Hugo Sanchez's side the lead at the break. Both sides were reduced to 10 men in the 53rd minute when Villaluz and Guatemal's Carlos Ruiz were sent off following a fracas on the half-way line. Nine minutes later Mexico were down to nine men when Gonzalo Pineda was dismissed for elbowing an opponent and Guatemala took full advantage of their extra man. The Mexico defence's attempt to clear a corner fell only as far as Yoni Flores who hooked the ball into Avila's path and the Guatemala striker produced a superb first-time shot with the outside of his left foot that curled into the far corner. In the 73rd minute Mexico defender Hector Moreno made a hash of an attempted sliding back pass and the ball fell to the alert Avila who slotted home from close range. Guatemala had defender Lionel Noriega dismissed with six minutes remaining but held firm for an impressive victory. (Reporting by Simon Evans in Miami
