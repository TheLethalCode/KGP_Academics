 MANILA, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine army, responding to strong criticism of its poor human rights record, has cut down on combat operations against communist rebels and is fighting them politically, the army chief said on Tuesday. Lieutenant-General Alexander Yano said the army is helping with the development of impoverished communities and using propaganda to fight the communist New People's Army (NPA) rebels. Yano also disputed a recent United Nations report blaming the military's counter-insurgency strategy for a surge in political violence in the Philippines since 2001, resulting in the deaths of between 100 and 800 people. "I cannot agree on that," he told Reuters in an interview at an army base in Manila. "We have shifted to a benign effort which is more focused on the civilian-military operations side, or the left hand approach." The U.N. report, released in August, said the counter-insurgency operations have resulted in extra-judicial killings. "In some areas, the leaders of leftist organisations are systematically hunted down by interrogating and torturing those who may know their whereabouts and they are often killed following a campaign of individual vilification designed to instil fear into the community," it said. Yano said there could be some rogue elements in the military, but it was not state policy to allow extra-judicial killings and disappearances to fight communist rebels, Muslim separatists and other dissident groups. "Our focus now is not on the physical destruction of our enemies. It's more on trying to sway public opinion, trying to inform our people of the true nature of the insurgency so that they will be forewarned about the real threats." Yano, a trim, 54-year-old who plays badminton twice a week, said the change in the military's anti-rebel strategy was not only to improve its human rights image, but also in response to the NPA's attempts to win the attention and sympathy of the urban elite. "We feel the effort of the other side is very much heavy on the aspect of ideological, political and organisational works, so we have to re-tailor our efforts to confront them," he said. "We now rarely see big formation of armed groups. I would say only about 15 to 20 percent of their efforts are concentrated on the armed struggle. That's why we also have to adjust our thrust to be able to address the shifting strategies of our enemies." The Maoist-led NPA, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, has waged a protracted rebellion since 1969 that has killed more than 40,000 people and slowed growth in rural areas of one of the poorest states in Southeast Asia. The 6,300-member NPA operates in 100 politico-military bases in 69 of 81 provinces across the country, but President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has vowed to reduce them from being a national security threat to a mere peace and order problem by 2010. Yano said the military would face a challenge when a new set of rules will be imposed next week by the Supreme Court to help stop the killings and disappearances of leftist activists. The rules would force the military to hand over documents, open their detention facilities and force them to explain in details cases involving murders and abductions of activists, journalists and suspected rebels. "In my view, it will add to the challenge of the military considering that we will be opening some, if not all, our camps to inspection," Yano said. "We have to operate within the bounds of the law," Yano added, however. "It has become more of a challenge on our part because we cannot do shortcuts. We have to have that moral ground as the legitimate armed force
