 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews214.com)  Bangladesh dropped in the inward foreign direct investment performance index to 121 in 2006 from 119 a year ago, according to the World Investment Report 2007 released Tuesday. But Bangladesh's position in outward FDI performance index improved, ranking 103rd in the 2006 outward FDI performance index, up from 105th in 2005. The WIR 2007 prepared by UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) observed that FDI in Bangladesh had dropped 6 percent to $792 million in 2006 from $845 million a year ago, mainly due to political unrest, volatility and changes in governments. Bangladesh finished third in attracting FDI among South Asian countries after India and Pakistan, the report said. "Despite political unrest, volatility, and in the government especially in the second half of the year, investors had shown their confidence in Bangladesh. It was speculated that the FDI would fall drastically," said Mohammad Mohsin, executive chairman of Board of Investment, at the launch of the WIR 2007. Investors from the US, Egypt, the UAE, Norway and UK contributed 66 percent together to the total FDI inflows in 2006. Major FDI inflows came for telecoms, energy and power, trade and commerce and manufacturing sectors. BOI and UN Information Centre released the WIR 2007: Transnational Corporations, Extractive Industries and Development in Bangladesh in favour of UNCTAD. The WIR 2007 observed that global FDI flows rose by 38 percent to $1,306 billion in 2006. FDI inflows to South, East and Southeast Asia grew 19 percent to $200 billion with China and Hong Kong, Singapore and India received the largest FDIs. India has emerged as the second most attractive location after China for global foreign direct investment. "China is the most preferred investment location, followed by India, the US and then the Russian Federation and Brazil," the report said. On Bangladesh, the BoI executive chairman said an actual FDI survey for the January to June period 2007 was in progress, referring to the FDI trend of 2007. "The primary indicators do not show a very good sign though. But the government has come up with a number of regulatory reform initiatives to make the business operations transparent, investor-oriented and free from any rent seeking activities," Mohsin said. The government, in public-private partnership, will set up a Better Business Forum and Regulatory Reform Commission, he said. bd
