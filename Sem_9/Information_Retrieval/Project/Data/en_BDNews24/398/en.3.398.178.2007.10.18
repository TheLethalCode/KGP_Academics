 BAGHDAD, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq wants Kurdish separatist guerrillas based in the north of Iraq to leave the country as soon as possible, Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said on Thursday. Zebari told Reuters in an interview the Iraqi government was not comfortable with a Turkish parliamentary vote this week giving its military permission to cross into northern Iraq to hunt down members of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK). He also said he did not expect Turkey to launch a major military operation anytime soon, saying that if it were to attack it would probably just be airstrikes on suspected PKK positions within northern Iraq.
