 Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The BBC is expected to announce sweeping job cuts on Thursday, capping a bad year for the broadcaster as it adapts to a new media age. Here are some highs and lows in the corporation's history. The British Broadcasting Company, as it was originally called, formed in October 1922 by a group of wireless manufacturers.

An inquiry led by British law lord Lord Hutton condemned the broadcaster and the corporation's top two executives stood down. In the latest crisis, the BBC has admitted faking the results of some high-profile competitions and apologised to Queen Elizabeth for wrongly implying she had stormed out of a photo shoot.
