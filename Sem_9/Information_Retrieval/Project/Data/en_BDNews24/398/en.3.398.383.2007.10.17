<TITLE> Ericsson warning casts shadow over networks sector </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Georgina Prodhan FRANKFURT, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tuesday's profit warning from Ericsson, the world's biggest maker of mobile networks equipment, shows that the roots of a slowdown initially blamed on sector consolidation run deeper than feared. The Swedish company blamed its 36-percent drop in quarterly profits and subdued outlook on a slowdown in spending in western Europe and North America, echoing remarks made by rival Alcatel-Lucent in its latest warning last month. The troubles of loss-making Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens Networks, both created in the past year, had been largely ascribed by the companies and analysts to teething problems and merger costs, as well as some pricing pressure. Ericsson had been seen as a winner, grabbing share of the $55 billion market while its competitors were distracted with integration issues. The battle for market share deflected attention from a lull in the overall telecoms equipment market. "It wasn't foreseeable that the situation would change so quickly," said Gerrit Rohleder, technology portfolio manager at DWS Investments, part of Deutsche Bank. "In general, investors have to be more careful about investing in the sector." Ericsson said it expected current conditions to prevail into next year. Adding to the challenges facing the likes of Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, Nokia-Siemens, Nortel and Motorola is ambitious Chinese competitor Huawei. Huawei is making inroads into Europe and won its first US contract last year. Competitors complain Huawei is undercutting their prices as it aims to increase its share of the global wireless equipment by half to 30 percent in one to two years. Alcatel-Lucent Chief Executive Patricia Russo is to present a make-or-break plan to the board on October 30. If she lets them down, her leadership could be questioned, analysts say. Asked to comment on Tuesday's developments, a company spokesman said: "As we are in a quiet period, we have no comment to make." SURPLUS CAPACITY While emerging nations with little infrastructure are racing to build new networks  a trend on which Ericsson is capitalizing, boosting its sales but doing little for profits so far  most mature markets have more capacity than they need. Operators have been stung by the fact that demand for third-generation services beyond voice and SMS text has picked up only slowly after they sank well over 100 billion euros ($142 billion) into 3G licenses and networks in Europe alone. Jason Chapman, analyst at research firm Gartner, said demand for services such as mobile email and messaging on social networking platforms would eventually drive operators to expand their capacities -- but not yet. "Look at the biggest industry event of the year, Apple's iPhone," he said. "That's not running on 3G ... the average consumer doesn't have data needs that will make a big impact on the networks." Gartner sees the mobile infrastructure market flat next year and declining in terms of sales after that until 2010. A spokesman for Deutsche Telekom's mobile arm, T-Mobile, said the company was satisfied with its software upgrades that have speeded up many of its 2G and 3G networks. Such software upgrades and associated services provide high-margin business for infrastructure providers, but overall spending is on a far smaller scale. The T-Mobile spokesman said there would be incremental upgrades, but nothing like the spending that was seen at the turn of the century. "It's too early to talk about what the next generation is. That won't be an issue for another five years or so." US carrier AT&T, singled out as one of the culprits for Ericsson's woes by analyst Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets, denied it was slowing down its network upgrade plans. "We're still moving forward with our rollout of 3G in additional markets," a spokesman said. "Our spending is on target. We haven't changed our capex guidance." But the picture is far from uniform. An official at another operator said: "The days of building out 3G networks in Europe are over."
