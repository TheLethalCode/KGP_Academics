<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government is amending the Bangladesh Civil Service Recruitment Rules to allow candidates to seek re-evaluation of their BCS examinations score, a top civil servant said Wednesday. "The government is amending a number of sections of BCS recruitment rules on the recommendation of Public Service Commission. The provision of challenging BCS marksheet is a significant one," establishment secretary Md Abdus Salam Khan told bdnews24.com by phone. "The draft proposal on the BCS recruitment rules has been finalised. We will soon send the draft to the secretary committee for approval. "Then it will go to the law ministry for vetting and the ministry will send it to the chief adviser and the president for approval," Salam said. The secretary explained that the amended rules, once approved, would allow a candidate to seek a reevaluation of his/her marking by paying a fee. The current provisions consider the BCS scores confidential and do not allow a reevaluation. "The amended draft proposes that the application forms of BCS exams can be submitted to the district commissioner. A candidate can submit the application to the DC office of his/her district," Salam said. A PSC source said authorities had asked the government to amend several provisions of the BCS recruitment rules as the BCS exams had been questioned over the last few years. The proposed amendments seek to update the test system and ensure fairness, transparency and accountability of the exams. The PSC also proposed to the government to consider ways to reduce harassment, time and money of the job seekers. bdnews24.c
