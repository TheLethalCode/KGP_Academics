<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will use the services of top Australian hockey consultant Ric Charlesworth to help revive the national game, a hockey official said on Tuesday. Charlesworth, a senior International Hockey Federation (FIH) coach, captained Australia in the 1980's before coaching their women to Olympic triumphs in Atlanta in 1996 and in Sydney four years later. The FIH hopes to resurrect the Indian game to its former glory. Despite having won the Olympic hockey gold eight times, India failed to secure an Asian Games medal for the first time in Doha in 2006. "The FIH has recommended him as part of their project," Indian federation secretary K.Jothikumaran told Reuters. "He is going to help the entire hockey structure across all levels." Chief national coach Joaquim Carvalho, who competed alongside Charlesworth, has already held discussions with him, he said. Charlesworth will also work with the women's national team. Indian hockey has steadily declined since winning their last Olympic gold in Moscow in 1980 in the absence of many contenders due to a United States-led boycott of the Games. Their last significant win came at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok. Fresh hopes were raised when they retained the Asia Cup at home last month. However, India need to win an Olympic qualifying tournament in Santiago, Chile in March to guarantee them a berth at the Beijing Games
