 LONDON, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson has been restored to the England squad by Fabio Capello for the friendly with France in Paris on Wednesday. Robinson, who lost his England spot in the final Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia last year and also found himself demoted at club level, comes in for the injured Scott Carson. Carson, on loan to Aston Villa from Liverpool, was withdrawn on Saturday after his team's home defeat by Sunderland. Robinson was not named in Capello's initial 30-man squad on Thursday. West Ham United defender Matthew Upson was also forced out by injury when Capello trimmed his squad to the 23 listed by the FA on its Web site (www.the-fa.com). Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas, who scored the first goal of Capello's reign against Switzerland, is not in the revised squad after missing his club's Premier League victory at home to Portsmouth on Saturday. Portsmouth striker Jermain Defoe, who was ineligible to play against his old club Tottenham, was also cut from the squad despite his good form since leaving Spurs. Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips and Aston Villa strike duo Gabriel Agbonlahor and Ashley Young were also deemed surplus to requirements along with Middlesbrough defender David Wheater. Several members of Capello's squad will be in action on Sunday when leaders Manchester United host Liverpool and Chelsea welcome London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League. David Beckham has retained his place in the 23 with the 32-year-old in line to win his 100th cap. Squad: Goalkeepers: David James (Portsmouth), Paul Robinson (Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Kirkland (Wigan Athletic) Defenders: Wayne Bridge (Chelsea), Wes Brown (Manchester United), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), Glen Johnson (Portsmouth), Joleon Lescott (Everton), John Terry (Chelsea), Jonathan Woodgate (Tottenham Hotspur) Midfielders: Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Gareth Barry (Aston Villa), Owen Hargreaves (Manchester United), Joe Cole (Chelsea), David Bentley (Blackburn Rovers), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), David Beckham (LA Galaxy), Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough) Forwards: Michael Owen (Newcastle United), Wayne Rooney, (Manchester United), Peter Crouch (Liverpool), Theo Walcott (Arsenal
