<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sports news in brief from around the world: Ronaldinho needs a bit of affection from the rest of the squad if he is to return to top form at Barcelona, according to team mate Silvinho. "Ronnie needs our support and affection," the Brazilian fullback was quoted as saying in Spanish media on Tuesday. "He needs us to feel that we are with him and for us to give him a hug. We need him to come back as soon as possible as he is a very important player for us." Ronaldinho has been plagued by injury and fitness problems this season and has only been in the starting line-up for 13 of the club's 29 league matches this season. Next year's Malaysian Formula One Grand Prix is likely to become the sport's second night race after Singapore, with organisers saying they were eager for a new challenge. "After 10 years as F1 hosts, it is a natural progression for Sepang to prepare to switch to a night race and we want to do it next year if it is feasible," Sepang circuit general manager Azmi Murad told Malaysia's Star newspaper. Real Betis owner Manuel Ruiz de Lopera has defended himself against an accusation from the state prosecutor's office that he has siphoned off capital from the club. "The prosecutor has been misled because he has only been given certain documents," Lopera was quoted as saying in the Spanish media on Tuesday. "I'm very calm about the matter because my lawyers will provide the missing documentation. I've got nothing to hide." Portuguese Paulo Duarte has been named as coach of Burkina Faso's national team, the country's soccer federation has announced. Duarte, a former player with for Boavista, Salgueiros and Maritimo in the Portuguese league, will take charge ahead of Africa's 2010 World Cup qualifiers in June. Paradorn Srichaphan is set to return to the tennis court for the first time in 14 months as part of Thailand's Davis Cup team, local media reported on Tuesday. The former world number nine has been sidelined by a persistent wrist injury but is expected to return to face Australia in next month's Asia/Oceania second round tie. Paradorn, 28, whose career has been dogged by injuries, has said he will attempt one more comeback before retiring. Cycle Collstrop, formerly Unibet, have been invited on the Paris-Roubaix and Liege-Bastogne-Liege classics, organisers ASO said on Tuesday. Unibet were barred from entering last year's Tour de France by ASO because of a French law against online betting. All ProTour teams, except for Astana, feature in the 25-strong roster for the one-day races. Paris-Roubaix will be held on April 13 and Liege-Bastogne-Liege on April 2
