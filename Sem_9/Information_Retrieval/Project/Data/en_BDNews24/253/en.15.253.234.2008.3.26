 SINGAPORE, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian share markets mostly fell on Wednesday, with Japan down nearly 1 percent, and the dollar sagged after the biggest drop in US consumer confidence in five years cast doubt on the economy's resilience in the face of a housing and credit slump. The dollar's fall sparked a rally in commodity and oil prices, and also lifted bonds, as investors took refuge in safer assets on concern the weak US consumer outlook could exacerbate the housing market. Metals, mining and oil companies rose, including Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining, and Australia's Woodside Petroleum, helping some resource-heavy indexes, such as Australia's S&P/ASX 200 notch up a slim gain. "There was a good rebound in commodities and that gave a bit of confidence back, but fresh worries about the health condition of the US market will always be there," said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Equities in Sydney. "The US is obviously in recessionary mode, much as they would like to think otherwise. There is light at the end of the tunnel but it is still a little bit cloudy." On Wall Street on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.6 percent. A Conference Board report showed US consumer confidence fell sharply in March, raising concerns Americans are tightening their purse strings. Japan's Nikkei index -- heavy with exporters, such as Canon Inc -- fell 0.9 percent by the midsession on concerns about weaker demand for its products. Manufacturers, including television maker LG Display and Hyundai Motor, were also weaker in South Korea, although its benchmark index managed to notch up a 0.1 percent gain. Markets in Singapore and Taiwan also fell initially but recouped in late morning trade. MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan hovered in and out of the red and by 0153 GMT was up 0.2 percent. The index is still down 14 percent this year. GOLD GLEAMS A weakening dollar sparked interest in a range of commodities that had been sold off last week. Despite a weaker US consumer outlook, analysts gauge that global demand for many commodities remains intact. Gold extended gains, with spot prices rising to $940.50/941.50 an ounce from $934.60/935.40 late in New York on Tuesday, although prices remain below an all-time high of $1,030.80 on March 17. US crude oil futures advanced, helped by the falling dollar and weakening stocks, with US crude for May delivery up 61 cents at $101.84. The dollar dipped to 99.74 yen from near 100.00 yen, while the euro was little changed from late US trade at $1.5638 having risen 1 percent against the dollar on Tuesday. The dollar had gradually pulled up from record lows against the euro and a 13-year low versus the yen in the past week as investors have hoped the worst of the financial crisis stemming from the United States may be over after the collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns Japanese government bond futures extended their gains, with June futures up 0.53 points at 141.03
