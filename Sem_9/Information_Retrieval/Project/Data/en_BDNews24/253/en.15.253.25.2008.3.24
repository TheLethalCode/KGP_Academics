 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Legislation is being prepared to turn the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board into the Bangladesh Telecom Company Limited, a government official said Monday. Further moves in the proposed legislation will see responsibility for the submarine cable transferred to a separate company, which will oversee the maintenance, operation and marketing of the vital communications link, telecommunication secretary Md Iqbal Mahmood told bdnews24.com. An official of the ministry told bdnews24.com that the BTCL ordinance states that the separate submarine cable company will take up to two months to come into being following the promulgation of the law. "The time is required to fix the remit of the new company; its manpower and how the property is to be shared out," said the official. "It has not yet been decided whether the new company's work area would be limited to the submarine cable landing station at Cox's Bazar or include the optical fiber cable in Dhaka," he said. The council of advisers took a decision in principle to turn the BTTB into the BTCL in a meeting on March 2. Chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, the meeting asked the authorities to present a proposal to a cabinet meeting by April 30. Ministry officials say the separate submarine cable company is being created to ensure equal opportunity to the public and private sectors. Currently, only BTTB runs the cable and allocates bandwidth to different firms. Recently the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has given licences to three private firms for setting up as many international gateways (IGWs), international telephony infrastructure. PSTN and mobile calls first terminate in the ICX (interconnection exchange) and processed in the IGW, followed by getting routed overseas via the submarine cable station. A similar path is followed for inbound overseas calls. Under the proposed legislation the newly formed BTCL would also have to take band allocation and pay the fixed amount of money from the separate submarine cable company. Since the submarine cable was opened in May 2006, the optical fibre cable, covering 437 kilometres from Cox's Bazar to Dhaka, has been snapped 23 times. BTTB said eight of those failures were due to deliberate sabotage. bdnews
