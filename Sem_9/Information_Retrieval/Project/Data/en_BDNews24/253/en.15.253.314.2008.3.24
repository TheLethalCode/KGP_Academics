 CHENNAI, India, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa begin a tough test series in India on Wednesday determined to shrug off a selection row and claim an Asian treble. Graeme Smith's side thumped unfancied Bangladesh 2-0 this month following their win in Pakistan late last year but they will face a far stronger India. India aim to cash in on their traditional home advantage after their strong showing in Australia, where they climbed to second in the test rankings despite losing the close series 2-1 against the champions. South Africa, fourth in the list, can displace India as number two if they win the three-test series. Indian captain and leg spinner Anil Kumble will team up with off spinner Harbhajan Singh on the traditionally slow pitches, backed by a young pace attack and an experienced batting lineup which clicked in Australia. The tourists, on a high after reeling off six test series wins in a row since their defeat in Sri Lanka in August 2006, are confident they have the firepower to rattle India, despite the row centred on their new ball attack. CONTROVERSIAL OMISSION They arrived for the series amid a controversy following the omission of paceman Andre Nel to fulfil the team's quota of non-white players. Nel was furious, prompting speculation he could quit the international game and Charl Langeveldt, a mixed-race player chosen in his place, also backed out saying he did not want to be picked on the basis of his colour. South Africa also called off their only warmup game but the team management is confident they will be ready. "The myth that South African batsmen cannot play spin doesn't exist anymore," said all rounder Jacques Kallis, who scored three hundreds in four innings in Pakistan last year. The focus will be on 24-year-old fast bowler Dale Steyn, who has captured 54 wickets with pace, swing and accuracy in the last three series, emerging as man of the series each time. He will join the experienced Makhaya Ntini with Kallis, the top test all rounder, and youngster Morne Morkel backing up. Smith leads the batting fresh from setting a world record first wicket partnership of 415 with Neil McKenzie in the second test in Bangladesh this month. India can turn to former South Africa opener Gary Kirsten, who begins his tenure as the new coach, to help them rekindle the spark at home. Although their overseas record has steadily improved, India have been unable to dominate at home. They struggled to beat Pakistan 1-0 late last year and only managed 1-1 draws against Pakistan and England in the previous two major home series. Indian batsmen came good in Australia where opener Virender Sehwag made a strong test return and former skipper Rahul Dravid found a semblance of his form. However, India's pace attack will again be reorganised in the absence of teenager Ishant Sharma, the find of the Australia tour, and experienced Zaheer Khan due to injuries. However, left-arm Rudra Pratap Singh will return after missing the Australia tri-series due to a hamstring injury. The second test will be played in Ahmedabad and the final game in Kanpu
