<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) -- The island nation of Singapore has seen an explosion in the number of Bangladeshi tourists in recent years, said a visiting tourism official from the city state Tuesday. With an 85 percent increase in tourists from Bangladesh from 2004 to 2007, the Singaporean government is keen to encourage the trend. According to the Singapore government, Bangladeshi tourists are one of the highest spenders in the country. "There is the world's largest observation wheel, the Formula 1 competition and world class dining," SiewKheng Kang, the Singapore Tourism Board's regional director for South Asia, Middle East and Africa, told reporters at a press conference at the Hotel Sonargaon. Kang has come to Dhaka in a bid to drum up further tourist interest in the city-state, which aims to earn $30 billion from the sector by 2015. "The number of Bangladeshi visitors is not so high, but the growth rate is very encouraging," she said. Visitors can have their visas within five working days following an application, she added. bdn
