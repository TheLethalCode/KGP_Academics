 Moroni, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Comoros government said on Tuesday its African Union-backed troops had retaken the capital and airport of the rebel island of Anjouan in a morning assault. Government spokesman Abdourahim Said Bacar said the troops quickly seized the capital Mutsamudu and two other towns, Domoni and Ouani. "The airport in the town of Ouani is already under control," he said. There was no independent confirmation from Anjouan, one of three islands in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
