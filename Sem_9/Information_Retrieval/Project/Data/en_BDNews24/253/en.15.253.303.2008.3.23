<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The verdict in a case against controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun and his wife, accused of illegally amassing money and property worth around Tk 111 crore, will be delivered on Mar 27. Judge Md Sirajul Islam, of Special Judge's Court-7, fixed the date Sunday following closing arguments from opposing counsels. Mamun, a close friend and confidant of Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman, has already been sentenced to a total of 13 years behind bars, while his wife Shahina Yasmin remains on the run. A court sentenced Mamun to three years imprisonment last June for failing to submit a wealth statement within the allotted time to the Anticorruption Commission. Shortly after, he was sentenced to a further 10 years behind bars for possession of illegal firearms. Anticorruption Commission assistant commissioner Mohammad Ibrahim filed the current case with Cantonment Police Station in May last year against both husband and wife. The case details accused Mamun and his wife of amassing wealth of Tk 62.21 crore through illegal means. However, after investigation, the commission said the couple's illegal earnings in fact totalled Tk 110.96 crore. Counsel for the state Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told the court that the allegations had been proved beyond doubt and called for an exemplary punishment to ensure such an extreme case of graft was never repeated. However, defence lawyer Fakrul Islam claimed his client had been the victim of a "deep conspiracy". "The state side has completely failed to prove the allegations brought against my client. I appeal to the court to acquit him of the charges," said Islam. The discredited businessman is currently facing trials in two other corruption cases, and in addition facing separate charges of extortion. bdnews24.
