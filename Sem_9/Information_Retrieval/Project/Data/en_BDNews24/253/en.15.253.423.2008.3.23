<TITLE> Bijoy Sarani extension to open Dec 16 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23(bdnews24.com)--The extended section of the Bijoy Sarani road will open to the public on Dec 16, acting secretary of the housing and public works ministry ASM Rashidul Hye said Sunday. Speaking to reporters at his office, the secretary said construction work on the extension had begun -- though the main obstacle to the project's completion remained Rangs Bhaban. "Demolition of Rangs Bhaban will be completed by October, after which the road will be open to traffic," said Hye. On a separate issue, the secretary said former members of parliament who were occupying NAM flats on Manik Mia Avenue and at Nakhalpara in Tejgaon would have to vacate their residences by Mar 31. "A letter was sent to the parliamentary secretariat in this regard, although we have received no reply yet," said the secretary. He said the secretariat would take the necessary measures to have the flats vacated and the public works ministry would not be communicating again with the former lawmakers regarding the move. "However, if they want to remain living there under a rental agreement they can do so under a fixed rent." "In that case they must make new applications," said Hye. bdnew
