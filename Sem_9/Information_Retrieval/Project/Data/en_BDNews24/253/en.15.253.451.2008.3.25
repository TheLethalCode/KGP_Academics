 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Signs of life in the US housing market combined with JPMorgan's vastly improved bid for Bear Stearns to lift prices sharply higher across global equity markets on Tuesday, although the dollar remained weak. European shares, reopening after a four-day weekend, were up close to 3 percent, following on from strong gains in Asia. Euro zone government bond prices fell sharply as equities rose. Markets were being driven by Monday's report of a surprising rise in sales of U.S. pre-owned homes last month. It was taken by some investors as a sign that the worst may be over for the US housing sector, which has been behind much of the economic and credit worries of recent months. In addition, JPMorgan lifted its offer five-fold for Bear Stearns to $10 a share, alleviating some concern about other banking shares. "It gives people hope that maybe the darkest period is over," said Hans Kunnen, head of investment markets research at Colonial First State in Sydney. But he added, "But the market is just operating like a yo-yo within a band. I refuse to get carried away." MSCI's benchmark world stock index was up 1.7 percent with its emerging markets counterpart gaining 2.2 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 gained 2.7 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average closed up 2.1 percent at 12,745.22. Investors remained cautious, however. "This could be a temporary relief. To be convinced that this is the floor, we need more indications that the credit market is stabilizing," said Arthur van Slooten, strategist at Societe Generale, in Paris. WEAK GREENBACK The dollar fell broadly as investors snapped four days of gains, with persistent nerves on US economic health dominating sentiment. "The negative dollar environment persists, there was positive housing data but apart from that there is no solid news to say that there will be a sustained dollar recovery," said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. The euro was up 0.65 percent to $1.5532 after falling as low as $1.5341 in the previous session. The single currency is down from a record high of $1.5904 hit last week. Euro zone government bond prices took a hit as equities rose. The June Bund future was down 81 ticks on the day at 116.73. The interest-rate sensitive-year Schatz yield was up 18 basis points at 3.440 percent, while the 10-year Bund yield rose by 8 basis points to 3.841 percent. Gold prices ticked higher. Spot gold was quoted at around $930 per ounce, up around $10, but well below the all-time peak of $1,030.80 an ounce touched earlier this mon
