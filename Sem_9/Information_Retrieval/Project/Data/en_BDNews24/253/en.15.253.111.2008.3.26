 UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A UN envoy handed Greece and Macedonia fresh proposals on Tuesday on an agreed name for Macedonia but there was no immediate end to a dispute that could delay Skopje joining NATO and the European Union. "The positions of the two governments are still different. There isn't a meeting of the minds on what a name would be," envoy Matthew Nimetz said after talks with Greek ambassador Adamantios Vassilakis and Macedonia's Nikola Dimitrov. "I used the opportunity to give my views to the parties and outline what I thought a reasonable solution would be," Nimetz told reporters, declining to detail his proposals. Pressure to resolve the 17-year-old dispute has intensified recently because Macedonia wants to join NATO. Greece has threatened to veto the move unless Macedonia changes its name, which is the same as Greece's northernmost province. Diplomats say the solutions proposed involve Macedonia, which adopted that name when it became independent in 1991 following the breakup of Yugoslavia, using different names in different contexts. Last week, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyanni said they would study new ideas to resolve the row put forward at talks in Brussels hosted by US Assistant Secretary of State Dan Fried. Macedonia hopes for a solution in time for an April 2-4 NATO summit in Bucharest to invite it to join the 26-member military alliance alongside Croatia and Albania, whose invitations were agreed in principle in March. NATO and the EU are eager to see a solution to the row for the sake of stability in the Balkans. "Both governments have a very strong desire to resolve this issue," Nimetz said. "I think what I suggested to the parties is fair, I think it's honorable, I think it has a geographic dimension and I very much hope that both governments look at it seriously ... Hopefully it can be a basis of a settlement." Skopje uses the name Macedonia in bilateral ties with the United States, Russia, China and Canada but at the United Nations it is called "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." NATO and the EU also use the acronym FYROM. Nimetz said there was no time limit for a response from Athens and Skopje. NATO diplomats have said they expect the issue to go down to the wire in Bucharest, and possibly be resolved after the opening dinner on April 2. One NATO diplomat said last week a fall-back option being considered was to give Macedonia a conditional NATO invitation, making clear that ratification of its accession would be subject to prior resolution of the name issue. Macedonia has been hoping for a green light later this year to open EU membership negotiations
