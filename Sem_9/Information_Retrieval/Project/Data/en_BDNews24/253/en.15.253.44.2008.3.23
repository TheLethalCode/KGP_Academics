 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)World Meteorological Day was being observed in Bangladesh Sunday. The international meteorological community and 188 member countries of the World Meteorological Organisation flagged the day with the message'Observing our planet for a better future'. Defence secretary Quamrul Hassan inaugurated the day's programmes organised by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. "The met office has undertaken a number of projects lately to expand its weather monitoring activities, and ensure accurate and timely weather forecasts," Hassan said. "These are aimed at strengthening the country's socio-economic development by minimising loss of lives and property." Joint secretary of the defence ministry Shah Md Sultanuddin Iqbal, Bangladesh Meteorological Department director Dr Samarendra Karmakar and deputy director Arjumand Habib spoke at an assembly convened at Abhawa Bhaban conference room. "With the advancements in science, the weather monitoring and weather data gathering technologies and equipment are also undergoing changes," said Iqbal. "A Doppler radar will be set up by 2009 at Moulvibazaar for efficient flash flood forecasting. More observatories will also be established increasing the number and frequencies of forecasts," the joint secretary said. Dr Samarendra Karmakar said state-of-the-art technology had to be used for observation to ensure accurate weather forecasts. "To reduce loss of lives and assets during natural disasters, there's no alternative to raising awareness of people," he added. People must be made aware of the dangers, the met office director said, so that they may attach due priority to weather forecasts and respond and react accordingly. The setting up 14 new observatories and forecast centres will soon be completed by the weather department, to enhance the quality and frequency of monitoring, Samarendra said. "Another five class-one meteorological observatories and seven agro-meteorological observatories are also being set up," he added. "These will surely improve the quality of weather forecasts in the near future." The daylong programmes include a technical session and exhibition of weather monitoring equipment alongside charts and satellite images. The World Meteorological Organisation was founded on March 23, 1950. It was recognised as a special agency of the United Nations System a year later, since which time the WMO's founding day has been observed globally as World Meteorological Day. bdnews2
