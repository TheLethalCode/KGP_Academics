<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)The High Court will deliver a verdict on April 10 on a writ petition filed by former prime minister Khaleda Zia over the invitation of the Election Commission to election dialogue. The court put freezes on the hearing of another petition filed by ex-student leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim. The bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman fixed the verdict date and stayed the hearing. Khaleda's lawyer AJ Mohammad Ali had earlier told the court the writ petitions could be disposed of separately. EC's lawyer Dr Kamal Hossain questioned the necessity of hearing the petition of Asim saying the twin petitions had been filed on the same issue. Mohammad Ali protested Dr Kamal's comment in court and said: "A further hearing on the petition is necessary." Khaleda filed the writ petition with the High Court on Nov 18 challenging the legality of EC's invitation to BNP's disputed acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed to dialogue, scheduled for Nov 22. The HC had put freezes on the invitation in line with the petition. The EC sent the letter on Nov 5 to the faction of the troubled BNP, led by former finance minister M Saifur Rahman. bdnew
