 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)  Liberation War sector commanders and others observed a one-minute blackout from Tuesday midnight, demanding the trial of "war criminals" as the nation was poised to mark Independence Day. The campaigners stood in silence at the Central Shaheed Minar, a common rallying point, followed by the lighting of candles in a symbolic programme to protest the genocide that took place 36 years ago. The Sector Commanders' Forum, a platform of 1971 war veterans, revived a movement for the trial of the "war criminals" and urged people to rally behind them. The latest protests were timed with the beginning of Independence Day, a day to remember the three million people who had made the ultimate sacrifice for the dream of a new nation to come true. As the clock struck the zero hour, the street lights around the Shaheed Minar were switched off for a minute with the protesters standing in the moonlight in the leafy neighbourhood. "The war criminals must be tried to free the nation of crime and corruption. War crime is a crime against humanity," said AK Khandker, deputy commander-in-chief of the liberation forces in 1971. Independence Day and National Day will be marked with a wide range of events sponsored by the government, cultural groups, social organisations and political parties. A 31-gun salute will herald the beginning of the day at the Savar National Memorial. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed are set to lay wreaths at the mausoleum. At 8.30 in the morning, representatives of the armed forces and security agencies will participate in a parade at the National Parade Square. Later, the president will host a reception at Bangabhaban for freedom fighters, politicians, teachers, civil servants and members of the armed forces among others. As in previous years the capital will see many of its main thoroughfares festooned with the national flag. Many national dailies have planned special supplements to mark Independence Day, while Bangladesh Radio and BTV have scheduled a special broadcast for the occasion. Iajuddin, in his Independence Day message to the nation, called upon Bangladeshis at home and abroad to unite behind the economic development of the country. In his message, Fakhruddin said: "It is everyone's expectation that a welfare-oriented government and a meaningful democratic order will be established in the country through a free, fair and acceptable election." bdnews24
