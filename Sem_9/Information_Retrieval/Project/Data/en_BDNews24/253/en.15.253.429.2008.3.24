<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)Laws will be altered further to incorporate a provision for punishing Armed Forces members accused of committing electoral offences, said an election commissioner Monday. "The agencies such as Armed Forces, Bangladesh Rifles and police deployed during the polls are being included in the electoral offence prosecution net by amending regulations," EC M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters in his office. Section 84 of the 1972 Representation of the People Order mentions a provision for prosecuting police personnel and other officials on charges of breaching electoral regulations and awarding a maximum punishment of five years in jail The RPO did not mention anything about trying electoral crimes committed by the members of the army, navy, air force and BDR. During the 2001 national parliamentary elections, the Armed Forces were deployed for the first time as a 'striking force' alongside BDR, police and Ansar. After the necessary provision is incorporated into the regulations, an election offence allegedly committed by a member of the law-enforcement agencies will be investigated and the report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities with recommendations for punishment to the offender in line with rules, Sakhawat said. "The arresting authority of the Armed Forces personnel will remain as before, but they have to hand over an arrestee to police," said the commissioner. The amended laws will ensure that the law enforcers take immediate action in case of breaching election regulations including erecting gateways and posting posters on walls, he said. The members of Armed Forces will be deployed during elections to city corporations and municipalities. bdnew
