 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Defending hockey champions Abahani Limited Sunday almost completed refiguring their team on the first day of club transfers, which remains largely unchanged from last season's line up. Of the six pool-players, Abahani brought Mohammedan's defender Mamunur Rahman Chayan, Mariner's Mosharraf Hossain Kuti and retained their own striker Rasel Mahmud Jimmy and playmaker Ehsan Rana. They also confirmed the services of Razib, Faruque, Khokon, Firoz, Rony and keeper Ainul. Title contenders Mohammedan roped in pool-player Isa Mia and Shuvo (Jr), while Musha Mia is set to sign up for Sonali Bank, who remain a threat following their giant-killing season last year. The Bank signed up Mohammedan's defender Biplob, striker Shishu and Usha's midfielder Nannu to complete half of their six-player pool quota. In addition, they roped in Krishna, Rimon, Chandan and Prince. bd
