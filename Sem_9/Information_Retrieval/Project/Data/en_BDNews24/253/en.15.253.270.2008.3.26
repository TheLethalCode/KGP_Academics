 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose towards $102 a barrel on Wednesday as a weakening US dollar prompted some investors to shift money back into commodities after last week's steep decline. Gold also gained as the falling dollar encouraged funds to move money back into the precious metal, which like crude oil is used by investors as a hedge against inflation. US crude rose 77 cents to $101.99 a barrel by 0913 GMT, extending a 36-cent gain in the previous session. London Brent crude rose 60 cents to $101.20. "The dollar's fall has prompted buying but traders are reluctant to take large positions ahead of the end of the quarter," said Shuji Sugata, a manager at Mitsubishi Corp Futures and Securities Ltd in Tokyo. Oil's gain on Tuesday snapped a losing streak in which prices tumbled from an all-time high of $111.80 on March 17. Analysts said a worker strike in Gabon that had halted 60,000 barrels of daily output from a Shell subsidiary in the West African nation also encouraged oil's gains. The market is now shifting its focus to the US government's weekly report on crude oil inventories to be released at 1430 GMT. Oil analysts polled by Reuters expect this week's government data to show a third consecutive increase in weekly US crude oil stocks, up 1.7 million barrels. Gasoline stocks were forecast to show a decline of 800,000 barrels, while distillates were expected to fall 1.7 million barrels
