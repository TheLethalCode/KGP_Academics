 ISMAILIA, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt released 33 members of Hamas who had been detained after Palestinian militants breached the border in January, security sources said on Sunday. The men were held for possession of arms in Egypt, but subsequent investigations cleared them of "involvement in any terrorism in Egypt", the security sources said. The men were driven to the Rafah crossing where they then travelled into the Hamas-held Gaza Strip, the sources added.

Shalit, then 19, was captured by Palestinian gunmen in a cross-border raid into an Israeli army base in June 2006. Hamas has said it will not release Shalit unless Israel frees nearly 1,400 Palestinian prisoners, including 350 with life sentences. Israel has rejected these terms. Human rights groups say torture is systemic in Egyptian jails and police stations. The government says it opposes torture and prosecutes torturers if evidence is found. Hamas militants blew open Gaza's southern border wall with Egypt in January to break an Israeli-led siege on the territory, home to 1.5 million Palestinians, allowing Palestinians to flood into Egypt to buy supplies. The border has been resealed. Egypt previously released around 50 Hamas members also detained after the border was breach
