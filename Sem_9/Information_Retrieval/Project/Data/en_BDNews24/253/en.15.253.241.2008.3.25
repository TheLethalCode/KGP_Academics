<TITLE> McCain seeks solutions to US housing crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Santa Ana, Calif., March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain, looking to bolster his economic credentials, called on Tuesday for quick meetings of mortgage lenders and accountants to begin to tackle the U.S. housing crisis. McCain, who has been criticized as weak on the economy, said he was open to a variety of solutions to ease problems in U.S. housing markets but did not specify an immediate approach. "I will not play election year politics with the housing crisis. I will evaluate everything in terms of whether it might be harmful or helpful to our effort to deal with the crisis we face now," the Arizona senator said in prepared remarks for a speech to business leaders in southern California. "I will consider any and all proposals based on their cost and benefits. In this crisis, as in all I may face in the future, I will not allow dogma to override common sense," he said. McCain has clinched the Republican nomination to face the winner of the Democratic race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in November's presidential election and has turned his attention to building support and finances for that battle. Democrats have pounced on his past comments that he knows less about economics than about foreign policy and national security to paint him as a risky and out-of-touch choice for the White House at a time of U.S. economic uncertainty. McCain received the same criticism from fellow Republicans before the won the battle for the party's nomination. Looking to counter that impression, McCain outlined in the speech the problems facing the U.S. housing market and said he would not back steps that rewarded those who had acted "irresponsibly" in feeding turmoil in the housing market. "I have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers," he said. "Government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy," McCain said. He said the government could do two things right away -- convene separate meetings of accounting professionals and of mortgage lenders to begin to hash out solutions to the housing crisis. McCain's speech came one day after Clinton offered a plan in Pennsylvania to ease uncertainty in U.S. housing markets. Clinton and Obama have competed to be seen as the most reliable stewards of the economy amid a potential recession and turmoil in housing and financial markets. Clinton, a New York senator, and Obama, an Illinois senator, appear headed to at least two more months of their hard-fought Democratic presidential battle. Obama has a lead in pledged delegates who will help pick the nominee at the August party convention, but neither will reach the 2,024 needed to clinch the nomination without the help of a majority of nearly 800 superdelegates -- party officials and insiders who can back any candidate. The next battleground in the back-and-forth nominating fight is Pennsylvania on April 22. Having clinched the Republican nomination, McCain can concentrate on proving his grasp of policy and building toward the November election. He just returned from a trip to Iraq, the Middle East and Europe. In his speech in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, he said any government assistance in the housing crisis should be temporary. "In our effort to help deserving homeowners, no assistance should be given to speculators. Any assistance for borrowers should be focused solely on homeowners, not people who bought houses for speculative purposes, to rent or as second homes.
