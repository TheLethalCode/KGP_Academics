 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British housebuilder Bellway Plc said on Wednesday reservations had fallen further as first-time buyers struggle to get mortgages, and reported a 4 percent fall in first-half profit, in line with forecasts. "Bellway's sales teams are armed with a full basket of incentives to offer prospective clients and have recently reported a pleasing visitor rate to sites although this has not, as yet filtered through to encouraging reservation levels," finance director Alistair Leitch said. Bellway, which focuses on the lower end of the market, said reservations to March 17 were 9 percent lower year-on-year, a worsening from its first four months when sales to end-November were down 7 percent. Leitch said Bellway had revised its target for full-year sales down to "five to 10 percent" below the 7,638 units sold in 2006/07, but had secured sales or reservations for 88 percent of that revised figure. Bellway made a pretax profit of 96.9 million pounds ($193 million) in the six months to end-January, on turnover up 1 percent to 581.5 million pounds. It sold 3,252 homes, versus 3,264 a year earlier, with the average price rising to 174,800 pounds from 173,300 pounds. The interim dividend was raised 10 percent to 18.1 pence. Britain's housing market, which enjoyed a decade-long boom, had been slowing before the global credit crisis began last August. Housebuilders' share prices have fallen sharply. Leading house price indicators have shown prices falling over the winter months. "Particularly hard hit are first-time buyers who are having to find larger deposits in order to make their first step onto the housing ladder as a result of changes in loan to value criteria announced by lenders," Bellway said. Bellway shares fell 1.1 percent to 801 pence in early trading in a falling market. SILVER LINING Leitch said the land market was showing signs of softening and Bellway was well positioned to take advantage given "the strength of the group's balance sheet coupled with a relatively low level of gearing". Several sites Bellway had rejected because of cost were now coming back into the frame, he said. Overall, the company has a land bank of 23,000 plots with planning permission and 16,900 in the pipeline. Landsbanki analyst Simon Brown said: "The strengths of Bellway are already showing through in this tough market. A well spread operational geography, astute land assembly in prior years and a cerebral approach to the market ensures its performance against its peers should remain well above average." He rates Bellway stock a "hold". Leitch said Bellway was "performing well in Scotland and the southern part of England where demand and keen pricing in the affordable sector of the market has meant that these divisions are operating at, or close to, our original aspirations". Bellway said buyers in London with lower budgets, as mortgage lenders revise the income multiples on which they will lend, were being drawn to its Thames Gateway sites. "Elsewhere, especially in the Midlands, Yorkshire and North West, the market remains challenging," he said
