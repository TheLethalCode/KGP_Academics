 TBILISI, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian opposition leaders and activists on Tuesday ended a hunger strike at the parliament building in the capital Tbilisi after an appeal from the country's religious leader Patriarch Ilia II to end it. About 50 opposition members have been on a hunger strike for 17 days, protesting against the Jan. 5 presidential election results, saying it was rigged and demanding a fresh vote. The patriarch personally pleaded with the hunger strikers to end their protest. "It's damaging your health and that's a sin," he told them. A majority of Georgians belong to the Georgian Orthodox Church and are deeply respectful of the views of the patriarch. One of the opposition leaders, Mamuka Katsitadze, who was on hunger strike, told a crowd of several thousand people that they would continue their fight against the government. "We are starting a war together with you against the leadership of our country," Katsitadze said. Georgia's opposition has complained the Jan. 5 election was unfair -- Western monitors judged it flawed but an accurate expression of the will of the Georgian people -- and have organised mass rallies since, though numbers have tailed off. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said on Tuesday a radical section of the opposition wanted to hamper the May 21 parliamentary election
