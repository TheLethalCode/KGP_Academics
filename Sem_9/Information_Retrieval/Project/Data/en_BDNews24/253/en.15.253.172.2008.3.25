 COLOMBO, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's navy battled a Tamil Tiger insurgent fleet early on Tuesday as troops killed 13 separatist fighters and air force planes bombed a rebel supply dump, the military said. Just days after the Tigers sank a navy patrol boat with 10 crew still missing and feared dead, the navy said fast attack ships fought a fierce battle with a small fleet of rebel boats trying to slip past off the northeast coast.

The military said 13 rebels and one soldier had also been killed on Monday in the northern Vavuniya, Jaffna and Mannar districts, along a loose frontline separating rebel from government territory.

A spokesman for The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was not immediately available for comment on the latest clashes in a bloody civil war the military has vowed to end by December.
