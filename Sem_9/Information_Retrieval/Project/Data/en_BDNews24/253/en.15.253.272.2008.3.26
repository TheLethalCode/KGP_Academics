 NOUAKCHOTT, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Mauritanian rights activist said French police threatened her, strip-searched her and detained her for 24 hours for protesting at the treatment of an illegal migrant being deported. Fatimata M'Baye, head of the Mauritanian Human Rights Association, said around 20 police boarded her flight on March 11 and threatened to beat her and doctor Pierre-Marie Bernard after they complained about the condition of the shackled Mauritanian, who was being forcibly restrained by officers. When protests from other passengers forced police to remove the young man from the Air France flight, the officers also ordered M'Baye and Bernard to disembark and detained them at Paris' Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport, she said. M'Baye, a lawyer and a Muslim, said she was subjected to an invasive strip-search and was considering legal action. "All my personal effects were taken away, including the scarf that I wear on my head. They told me I could use it to strangle myself or attack police officers!" she told a news conference late on Monday. "The most painful part of this affair was the body search. I was stripped completely naked and they searched my intimate parts, without any reason. It was humiliating. I consider it like a rape," M'Baye said. French police accused the Mauritanian activist of obstructing the repatriation of an illegal immigrant, considered an offence under French law, M'Baye said. French foreign ministry officials were not available for comment. Mauritanian civil rights groups issued a statement on Monday calling on French police to show respect for human rights when carrying out deportations. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's tough line on illegal immigration has earned him many critics in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in former French colonies where many people dream of a better life in Europe. Earlier this month, oil-rich Gabon -- a long-time haven for French business interests -- threatened to take reciprocal action by deporting French citizens after two Gabonese students were repatriated when their visas expired
