 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) - An all-round performance from skipper Salma Khatun Tuesday powered the Bangladesh women's cricket team to a massive 109-run win over Hong Kong counterparts at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Bangladesh bundled visiting Hong Kong out for 140 in 48 overs after posting a challenging total of 249 for five in 50 overs. The hosts now take 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Put in to bat first, Bangladesh fell in trouble to lose three players for 66 runs, but Panna Ghosh (80) and Salma (86) played a superb fourth-wicket partnership contributing 156 runs and the hosts ended up at 249 for five in the stipulated overs. In reply, Hong Kong openers Chnnie Wong (26) and Kennu Gill (62) gave a solid start putting on 89 runs for the opening stand before Sathira Zakir broke the stand in 25th over. The dismissal of Wong triggered a rapid collapse and lost the last nine wickets 51 runs in the face of superb bowling from the hosts bowlers to end their innings at 140 all out with two overs to go. Romana Ahmed (3/30), Sathira (3/33), Thitly Rani Sarkar (2/20) and Salma (2/8) shared all ten wickets and Salam was adjudged player of the match.
