 VATICAN CITY, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict celebrated an Easter Mass for tens of thousands of people in driving rain on Sunday as Christians around the world commemorated Christ's resurrection. The wind and rain that has whipped most of Europe did not spare Rome as the German pontiff said Mass while the huge, drenched crowd huddled under umbrellas.

Allam, who has been living in Italy for 35 years, has said he was never a very devout Muslim. Still, his conversion to Christianity came as a surprise.
