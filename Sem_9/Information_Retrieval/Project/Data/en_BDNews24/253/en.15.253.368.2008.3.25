 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Banks led European shares sharply higher by midday on Tuesday as investors saw a raised buyout offer for Bear Stearns as a signal that financial sector valuations had been battered excessively. At 1126 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 3 percent at 1,263.64 points. Financial stocks were the top gainers with HSBC, up 4 percent, the biggest points contributor to the benchmark. Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, UBS and Allianz all jumped between 6 and 10 percent, while HBOS soared 14 percent. The rally, coming after a four-day Easter break, followed strong gains in US stocks on Monday after JPMorgan boosted its offer for Bear Stearns to $10 a share from $2. The deal has the backing of the Federal Reserve. "People are thinking that this is the bottom, the worst has already been seen on financial stocks," said BNP Paribas strategist Edmund Shing. "And they see that the Fed remains the buyer of last resort, ready to pull all the levers it can to stop the downward spiral." Energy shares rose on Tuesday, as oil prices hovered around $100 a barrel. BP jumped 3.7 percent, Royal Dutch Shell rose 3.1 percent and Total gained 2.3 percent. Miners also surged along with base metal prices. Rio Tinto gained 3.3 percent, BHP Billiton added 4.8 percent and Xstrata rose 5.9 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 3.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 3.6 percent and France's CAC 40 up 3.5 percent. TORRID QUARTER Financial stocks have been the worst hit in a forgettable quarter for European shares in general. Despite Tuesday's sharp rally, the FTSEurofirst 300 is down about 16 percent in 2008, hit over the past few months by worries over a global credit crisis and the prospect of a U.S. recession. It is on track for its worst quarter since the third quarter of 2002 and its third successive quarter of losses. Financial stocks listed on the DJ Stoxx European Banking index have lost nearly 18 percent this quarter after a similar fall during the whole of last year, driven by massive writedowns at top banks. Worries over financials have spread to the wider economy, and investors anxiously await any signs of a recovery. Later in the day, they will train their sights on US consumer confidence data for March and the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index for January. "People are not expecting a big rebound in consumer confidence and that might take some of the euphoria out of the market," said Shing. "The question people are asking is: will this rally be sustained? We've had plenty of one-day moves of this size...but momentum can be self-fulfilling if investors who are on the sidelines see 3-4 days of buying." Arthur van Slooten, strategist at Societe Generale, in Paris, said that to be convinced that this was the floor, investors needed more indications that the credit market was stabilising. "Until that happens, equities will remain under pressure, so this could be a small rally in a bear market," he said. European credit spreads were tighter on Tuesday, helped by efforts to support the US mortgage market and following the increased bid for Bear Stearns. By 1107 GMT, the Markit iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, was at 538 basis points, according to data from Markit, 55 basis points tighter than last Thursd
