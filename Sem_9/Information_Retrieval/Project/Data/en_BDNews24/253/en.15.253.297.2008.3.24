<TITLE> Exports must rise before signing FTAs: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Monday said exports had to be increased before any free trade agreement was entered into with another country. The adviser cautioned that there was little point in expanding trade options without sufficient exportable products. "What is the point of opening up new markets if we only have two or three exportable commodities", he said to reporters following a regional seminar on trade issues at the BRAC centre in Mahakhali. In 2003, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka all proposed signing separate FTAs with Bangladesh, although Dhaka is yet to make a decision on the agreements. Meanwhile, the Nepalese and the Sri Lankan delegations at the seminar highlighted some poor results from their FTAs with India. Zillur said Bangladesh should take lessons from the experiences of the two countries. Nepal delegate Navin Dahal drew attention to Indian companies that had invested in Nepal utilising zero-tariff facilities under the FTA. "Indian companies imported raw materials required for vegetable ghee without tariff, and exported the finished product to India without tariff," said Dahal. "The ghee industry is almost totally automated, and only a handful of job opportunities were created." "Some corporate industries received the benefits of Indian investment. But what did Nepal get? Nothing," added Dahal. The South Asia Network on Economic Modelling, Delhi-based CUTS International and the Commonwealth Secretariat jointly organised the seminar. bdn
