 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)- The government will definitely look into what the people want regarding the trial of war criminals, army chief Moeen U Ahmed said Tuesday. "We have got independence, now we need to ensure economic independence," Moeen said after a reception for freedom fighters at the National Parade Square. Following the army chief's speech the freedom fighters chanted slogans demanding trial of war criminals. However, they commented favourably on the works of the present government and the army, and assured their continued support. Earlier, during the reception, Moeen said: "We got independence because the freedom fighters fought the war." "Last year the country faced five disasters," he said without saying what the five disasters were. "We succeeded in facing those as we all worked unitedly." The army chief said: "Now the main problem is the price spiral of essentials." "To solve the problem production has to be increased. This year the production of potatoes increased as we all worked well." "The boro production is also expected to be good. It will reduce food shortfalls." "Any disaster can be faced if all work together," Moeen repeated. He also said the army would solve the problems regarding allowances for the freedom fighters. General-officer-commanding of the ninth division Maj Gen Ahsabuddin, adjutant general Motiur Rahman, acting secretary of the liberation war affairs ministry CQK Mostak Ahmed and freedom fighter contingent commander Md Shawkat Ali were among those present at the reception. It was announced at the function that 130 freedom fighters would participate in the Independence Day Parade on Wednesday. bdnews24
