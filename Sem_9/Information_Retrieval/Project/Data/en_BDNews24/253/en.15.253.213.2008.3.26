 CAIRO, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Egyptian court sentenced a newspaper editor to six months jail with labour on Wednesday for publishing false news about President Hosni Mubarak's health, but let him go free pending appeal, judicial sources said. The court in the Boulak district of Cairo found Ibrahim Issa, outspoken editor of the independent daily Al-Dustour, guilty of damaging the national economy. It let him go free after he paid a bond of 200 Egyptian pounds ($37). The sentence came from a low-level misdemeanours court, and Issa is expected to appeal to a higher court. Issa has been free and working normally throughout the trial, one of several recent prosecutions of newspaper editors for publishing offences. Press freedom and human rights group said the prosecutions are an attempt to silence critics. Rumours about the health of Mubarak, 79, were widespread in late August and early September but subsided when he appeared repeatedly on television. The case against Issa is that his reports on Mubarak led to short-term capital flight. Central bank officials told the court that investments worth $350 million did leave the country on Aug. 29 and 30, the days on which al-Dustour published reports on the rumours. But they also said they could not be certain there was any link between the outflow and the rumours. One of them said the short-term outflow could have been damaging if it had continued. The capital flight coincided with concern about the international impact of the liquidity crunch caused by losses in the US home loan market. Shortly before the rumours began, bankers said that foreign investors had dumped about a third of their Egyptian treasury bills, worth about $1.7 billion. Issa, who regularly attacks Mubarak and his family in print in a way that would not have been possible in previous decades, has had several run-ins with the courts. He was one of four Egyptian editors sentenced to one year in jail and fined 20,000 pounds last September for defaming Mubarak and his politician son Gamal. In that case too, the editors avoided going to jail by paying a bond
