 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka Stock Exchange is set to double its trading capacity by upgrading the main automated trading system. Trading will remain suspended on Thursday due to the installation of new hardware in the automated trading system. The bourse's trading capacity is currently at 50,000 contracts a day, DSE vice-president Ahmad Rashid Lali told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "However, the bourse can manage up to 75,000 contracts a day with the existing hardware," he added. Currently, the trading system's main engine is being run with two CPUs. The DSE is adding two more CPUs to the main engine which would enhance the capacity officially to 100,000 contracts. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com Tuesday that the move to close trading on Thursday came to help install the new hardware. "The new hardware arrived yesterday and it would take four days to set up the whole thing," he said. bdn
