 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government has cut the size of the annual development programme to Tk 22,500 crore from Tk 26,500 crore as implementation was not satisfactory, an adviser said Monday. The National Economic Council approved the revised ADP Monday at a meeting chaired by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam as alternate chairman of the country's highest economic policymaking body. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, chairman of the NEC, was scheduled to preside over the meeting but asked the finance adviser to chair the sitting as the CA cut short his work schedule for the day after he felt unwell. After the meeting, the finance adviser said: "ADP was not implemented completely anytime in the past. A revision of the ADP is a continuous process. The ADP has been cut down to Tk 22,500 crore." Mirza Aziz said a review of ADP of the last couple of years showed that programmes worth up to Tk 18,000 crore had been implemented in a year. The adviser said the downward revision would not affect the development activities in the country. On implementation of the revised ADP, the adviser said: "We will try to implement it completely. Let's see what happens." Asked if the ADP for fiscal 2008-09 would be lofty like this year's, Mirza Aziz said no decision had been taken on the matter. "A new ADP will be designed considering the overall situation," he said. According to a report on the revised ADP placed at the NEC meeting Monday, the ADP was revised down in consideration with internal resources, foreign financing and the overall economic situation, availability of resources and use of allocated funds in different sectors. The report estimated internal resources at Tk 13,550 crore, down Tk 3,150 crore from the original ADP, and foreign financing at Tk 8,950 crore, down Tk 850 crore. Although the ADP dwindled, the number of projects increased, according to the report. In the revised ADP, the number of projects increased to 1,058 from 931. The interim government has used only 25 percent of the total allocation of the ADP in July-January of the current fiscal year while it was 29 percent in the same period of the previous fiscal year. Agriculture, rural development, rural institutions and water resources sectors were allocated 24 percent of the revised ADP funds. Education and religion got 13 percent, power 13 percent, transport 11 percent and health, nutrition, population and family welfare received 11 percent. According to the Bangladesh Economic Review, the size of the ADP for fiscal 2006-07 was Tk 26,000 crore but at the end of the year the plan had been slashed by Tk 4,400 crore. In fiscal 2005-06, the ADP was Tk 24,500 crore but later it had been cut down to Tk 21,500 crore. But the government could not even implement the amended ADP in the previous fiscal years. bdnews
