<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Approaching each test match as if it were his last helped England batsman Andrew Strauss to forget his poor run of form and score his 11th test century on Monday. Strauss had not scored a century in his last 30 test innings and was dropped for England's tour of Sri Lanka, but he grafted a highest score of 173 not out on Monday to take his side to 416 for five on day three of the third test against New Zealand. The visitors have a lead of 501 and have all but batted New Zealand out of the test and the series. "It's been a pretty long time since I last got a test hundred so there was a lot of emotion and relief," Strauss told reporters about his celebrations when he scored his century. "There was a lot of relief to see that ball go through the covers. "Once I got left out of the side for the Sri Lanka tour, I made quite a conscious decision not to think too much about the next test. "(I thought) If I got back in the England side, my goal was to enjoy each test as it comes and play it like it is your last. "I think that was one of my problems prior to Sri Lanka. I was thinking to much about 'well if this happens, what will happen?' "You always have those negative thoughts but I pushed them to the back of my mind." Strauss said the McLean Park pitch had played well on a sun-baked day in Napier, and it would probably play true for the batsmen for the rest of the match. "I don't think it will change a huge amount (over the next two days)," he said. "I think when they took the new ball, Chris Martin got a little bit more bounce and nip and if we hit the wicket hard there will be a little bit more for us with the new ball. Asked what it would take for England to win, he said: "It will be about building up pressure. If New Zealand have to bat 5 or 5  sessions there is a lot of pressure on them and hopefully the rewards will come
