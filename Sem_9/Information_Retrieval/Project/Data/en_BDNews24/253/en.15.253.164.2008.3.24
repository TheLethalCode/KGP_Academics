 BANGKOK, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai rice farmers are guarding paddy fields and hurrying to bring in their crops after a granary theft last week fuelled rumours of bandits lured by surging rice prices, officials said on Monday. Reports of widespread paddy theft, although unsubstantiated by police, spread quickly after the theft of 100 kg (220 lb) of premium quality fragrant rice from a farmer's granary in the province of Kalasin, 500 km (310 miles) northeast of Bangkok.

Some farmers in the white rice growing province of Sing Buri have slept in their paddy fields after rumours spread of a 1,000 kg heist. However, police have received no formal complaint. "There are many rumours, but no one has come forward to tell police that they were robbed," an Ang Thong police official, who declined to be named, told Reuters. Nevertheless, the rumours have been strong enough to prompt many farmers to harvest their crops as quickly as possible. "Most of the rice grown in Suphan Buri has already been harvested. It's around 10-20 days earlier than expected," said an agricultural official in the mostly white rice producing province 100 km north of Bangkok. Thailand, the world's biggest rice exporter, is expected to to produce around 6 million tonnes of paddy in its second smaller crop usually harvested in Apr
