<TITLE> Dollar gains vs euro as oil and gold slide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rika Otsuka TOKYO, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar rose against the euro on Monday, extending its recovery from a record low hit last week as investors sold commodities such as oil and gold and bought back the U.S. currency before the end of the first quarter. The dollar was also supported by the Federal Reserve's aggressive efforts to ease the credit crisis. Activity was subdued in Asia, however, as markets in many parts of the region as well as in Europe remained closed, with investors waiting for U.S. trade to resume later in the day. "Investors are taking profits on any assets that have rallied in the past months ahead of the end of the first quarter," said a senior forex trader at a big Japanese bank. "This could last for a few more days." "The euro is likely to slide further as many still hold long euro positions with hefty unrealized profits," the trader added. The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.5360 from around $1.5445 in late Asian trading on Friday, slipping further from a record high of $1.5905 struck on electronic trading platform EBS last week. The single currency hit a record peak versus the U.S. unit after the collapse of U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns earlier this month fanned concerns about the spreading credit crunch. But confidence in U.S. assets was partially restored after the Fed unveiled steps to relieve the credit crisis, helping the dollar. Among an array of initiatives, the U.S. central bank pushed JPMorgan Chase to acquire Bear Stearns, started lending directly to securities firms for the first time since the Great Depression and lowered the benchmark fed funds rates by 75 basis points to 2.25 percent. Despite the dollar's broad rise in past sessions, many traders expect further gains to be limited. The Fed and the Bank of England denied a report on Saturday that they were in talks over possibly using public funds to make mass purchases of mortgage-backed securities -- key financial instruments which have plunged, wreaking havoc on banks' balance sheets and shares -- to ease the credit crisis. "One can hardly say that fundamental problems in credit markets have been resolved, thus it is still too early to chase the dollar higher," said Hiroshi Yoshida, a forex trader at Shinkin Central Bank. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against the yen to 99.85 yen keeping distance from a 13-year low of 95.77 yen hit on EBS early last week. Many market players believe the U.S. currency is unlikely to fall below that 13-year trough in the short term as the Bank of Japan is not expected to raise benchmark interest rates soon from the current 0.5 percent -- the lowest among industrialized nations. Government data showed on Monday that big Japanese manufacturers' confidence in business conditions tumbled to a new low in January-March, adding to the view that the BOJ will stand pat for a while. At the same time, the dollar is not expected to rise sharply above the psychologically key 100 yen level as Japanese exporters, many of which are worried that the dollar is still in a downward trend, are seen likely to sell it above that level. The dollar jumped 0.9 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.0177 franc The U.S. currency struck an all-time low around 0.9630 franc early last week.
