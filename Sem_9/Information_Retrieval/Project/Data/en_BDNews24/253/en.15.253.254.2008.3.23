<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh has said the much-anticipated train service between Dhaka and Kolkata starts on April 14. "It is certain that the train [service] will start from April 14 (Pahela Boishakh). The Indian railway minister has informed this to the Indian parliament. There is no problem from Bangladesh too," Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty told reporters Sunday. He made the announcement after his meeting with communications adviser Ghulam Quader at the secretariat. Communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman was present while the high commissioner was briefing the reporters. "The train will be launched as per a deal between the two countries. There is no possibility of shifting the inauguration date of the train service," Rahman said. Both countries are almost through with the formalities for the launch of the train service from April 14, according to officials of the two countries. But they acknowledged that there were some technical and infrastructure problems. The secretary said the two sides were trying to resolve the outstanding problems but did not elaborate on the problems. "There are some problems and efforts are on to solve the same," Chakravarty said. The high commissioner said for the safety of the passengers the trains would pass through a barbed security cage while crossing the border at Darshana-Gede point. "The existing relations between Bangladesh and India will improve further after the launch of the train," he said. The envoy said the disagreement on import of rice from India would not hamper the bilateral relations. Rahman said Bangladesh was constructing another station at the Darshana border. Both Bangladesh and India will construct a 150-metre barbed security cage from the zero line inside their borders and the trains will pass through the 300-metre cage, he said. bdnew
