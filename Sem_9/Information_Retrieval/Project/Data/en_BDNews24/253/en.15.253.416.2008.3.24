 BERNE, Switzerland, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Familiarity is likely to breed respect on Wednesday when Germany take on a Switzerland side brimming with Bundesliga players in a friendly warm-up for Euro 2008. A third of the 21-man Swiss squad named by Koebi Kuhn last week play their club football in Germany, throwing up the prospect of some interesting clashes across the pitch as both sides continue their preparations for the June tournament. Switzerland's Germany-based contingent was reduced by one on Saturday when Stuttgart defender Ludovic Magnin was forced to withdraw from the Basel encounter with an ankle injury sustained during his club's 4-1 win over Hansa Rostock. Kuhn still has six Bundesliga players at his disposal however, along with 10 squad members playing for top division teams in England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. "I will be pointing out to my team what clubs the Swiss players play for," Germany coach Joachim Loew told Switzerland's Tages-Anzeiger newspaper on Saturday. "Lazio, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund, two at Arsenal - that says it all about the Swiss. They are well trained, they are playing in important leagues and they are an international team with a completely different mentality than before." While Switzerland's squad includes just four home-based players, the situation is reversed for the German squad, all but four of whom play in the Bundesliga. Loew's men have lost just one competitive match since clinching third place at the 2006 World Cup on home soil. A 3-0 win over Austria in Vienna last month somewhat flattered the Germans, however, with three second-half goals helping to brush over a poor opening half in which the unfancied home side often held the upper hand. LAST CHANCES Loew is expected to stick roughly to the team he fielded that night but could give chances to recalled defenders Robert Huth, Marcell Jansen or Clemens Fritz as he looks to finalise the Euro 2008 squad which he plans to announce on May 16. But many of Loew's first-choice players are struggling. Bayern Munich striker Miroslav Klose is in a slump while Lukas Podolski has hardly had any playing time behind Italy's Luca Toni. Midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has had a dreadful season for Bayern while Philipp Lahm and Marcell Jansen are also far from their form of 2006. Werder Bremen defender Per Mertesacker has also been below par in 2008. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, who looked shaky against Austria, has also been stuck on the bench at Arsenal this season. The one bright spot for Loew has been VfB Stuttgart striker Mario Gomez, who scored his 15th goal of the season on Saturday against Hansa Rostock and trails league leader Luca Toni by one. Kuhn is likely to rely heavily on his German-based players, in particular with the welcome return of Dortmund striker Alex Frei following his year-long absence through injury. Switzerland qualified automatically as Euro 2008 co-hosts, along with neighbouring Austria, but could do with a strong performance in Basel after an indifferent 2007 saw them lose five and win just four of the 10 friendlies they played. A far from disgraceful 2-1 defeat against England at Wembley last month means that Switzerland have also now lost their last three matches in a row. Victory over their big neighbours from the north on Wednesday would certainly boost Switzerland's pre-tournament spirits but the records suggest it will be a tough night for Kuhn's men. Since their first meeting in 1908, the Swiss have beaten Germany on just eight occasions, drawing six matches and losing 35. Probable teams: Switzerland: Diego Benaglio, Stephan Lichtsteiner, Steve Von Bergen, Philippe Senderos, Christoph Spycher, Goekahn Inler, Tranquillo Barnetta, Gelson Fernandes, Hakin Yakin, Alex Frei, Eren Derdiyok Germany: Jens Lehmann, Heiko Westermann, Per Mertesacker, Arne Friedrich, Philipp Lahm, Bernd Schneider, Michael Ballack, Thomas Hitzlsperger, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Kevin Kuranyi, Miroslav Klo
