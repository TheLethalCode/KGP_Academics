 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed called upon people from all walks of life Tuesday to come forward with a view to building the country in the spirit of the Liberation War. "The people of Bangladesh have huge potential. They can bring a change to the country if they get the opportunities and a favourable atmosphere," the chief adviser said while addressing the Independence Award 2008 ceremony at Osmani Memorial Auditorium. The Swadhinota Padak (Independence Award) winners for 2008 are professor Rehman Sobhan, Dr Shamsuzzoha (posthumous), professor Gobinda Chandra Deb (posthumous), and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), for their contribution to the independence of Bangladesh. Rehman Sobhan received his award in person. Sabiha Joha Khan received the award on behalf Dr Shamsuzzoha, while Dhaka University vice chancellor SMA Fayez took the award on behalf of Prof Gobinda. BDR director general Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed received the medal for Bangladesh Rifles. "The people of this country joined the war of independence with a vow to build a democratic country," Fakhruddin said. "It is unfortunate that their dream has not come true; full-fledged democracy is yet to be achieved." "Good governance is out of the reach of common people," the chief adviser said. The country's freedom fighters presented us an independent and sovereign nation, he said, adding: "The duty of the present generation is to implement the unfinished works of the martyrs." "It is my firm belief that we will be able to build our dream country with integrated efforts." "We can only pay back the blood of 30 lakh martyrs through honesty, efficiency and patriotism in our respective fields," the chief adviser said. The CA paid tribute to the liberation war martyrs and congratulated the medal winners. bdnews24.com/mk
