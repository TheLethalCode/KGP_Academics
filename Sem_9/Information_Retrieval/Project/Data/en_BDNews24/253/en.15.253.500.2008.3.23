 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Better Business Forum has received 73 recommendations from its working groups on ways to create a more business-friendly environment in the country, a BBBF member said Sunday. The BBBF will finalise a strategy within two weeks following an investigation into the recommendations, said Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Hoque addressed his comments to reporters following a meeting of the forum, chaired by finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, who co-chairs the organisation. "The BBBF decided to finalise a complete plan in 15 days. Related ministries or departments will then start work on their implementation," Hoque said. However, no forum members were willing to elaborate on the proposals, although the BKMEA chief hinted that some of the recommendations related to an amendment of National Board of Revenue legislation. Hoque said initiatives would be taken to implement the changes after finalising a complete plan and identifying the key obstacles to their implementation. The 38-member forum, comprising representatives from both government and nongovernmental organisations, was formed on Nov 25 last year with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed as its chief. bdnews
