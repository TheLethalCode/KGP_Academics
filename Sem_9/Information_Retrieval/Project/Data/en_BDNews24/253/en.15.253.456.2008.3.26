<TITLE> Australia`s Rudd trip to juggle China, US ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will have to juggle warming ties with China against commitments to traditional ally the United States on his first major overseas trip, analysts said on Wednesday. Rudd leaves on Thursday on a tour that will take in the United States, London, Bucharest for a summit on Afghanistan, and four days in China. It will be his biggest foreign policy trip since his centre-left Labor Party won power last November. Analyst Michael Fullilove said Rudd would want to reassure President George W. Bush that the United States would remain Australia's top ally, despite Rudd pulling frontline troops out of Iraq and pushing to strengthen trade ties with China. "He will emphasise the continuity in our alliance," Fullilove, from Australia's Lowy Institute and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in the United States, told Reuters. "That's one thing that President Bush wants to hear, and that's one thing Prime Minister Rudd will say." Australia's 57-year military alliance with the United States is at the core of Australia's strategic policy. Australia is the only country to have fought alongside U.S. forces in every major conflict of the 20th century and into the 21st century. Australia's former conservative Prime Minister John Howard was a staunch personal ally of Bush and strong supporter on Iraq, but Rudd won power by promising to pull combat forces out of Iraq, focusing instead on the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. At the same time Rudd, a former diplomat who speaks fluent Mandarin, wants to strengthen business and trade ties with a booming Chinese economy, which has now surpassed Japan as Australia's biggest trading partner. CHINA-US BRIDGE Geoffrey Hawker, head of international relations at Sydney's Macquarie University, said Rudd's 17-day trip signalled his ambitions for Australia in the world, and his push for Australia to be a bridge between China and the United States. "People talk about the China-US bridge, and Australia being in the middle. I think he is projecting that image of Australia as a middle power," Hawker told Reuters. However, he said Bush would be likely to seek a commitment to continuity on the U.S.-Australia relationship, ensuring the military alliance was in good shape for a new administration in Washington after the November presidential elections. He said Rudd's decision to pull about 500 frontline troops out of Iraq would not upset Washington, as Australia sent forces at the start of the war five years ago and would maintain about 1,000 troops in Iraq to provide security and training. Rudd will use his trip to hold talks with United Nations Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon, Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and to attend a NATO summit in Romania, where he will urge NATO alliance members to commit more troops to Afghanistan. Australia, with about 1,000 troops in Afghanistan, has the biggest military contribution to the country of any non-NATO power, but has called for a re-think of the tactics used to fight resurgent Taliban militants and to combat the country's drugs trade. Australia wants European NATO members to increase troop numbers in Afghanistan and relax conditions placed on their deployment, and to focus more on ways to help rebuild the troubled country
