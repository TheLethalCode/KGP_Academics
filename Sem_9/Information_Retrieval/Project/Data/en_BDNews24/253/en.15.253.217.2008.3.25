 NEW DELHI, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Supreme Court ordered a fresh probe on Tuesday into one of India's bloodiest Hindu-Muslim riots in 2002, responding to calls for an independent inquiry into the killing of nearly 2,500 people. Human rights groups had expressed fears of bias in investigations into the religious riots in the western state of Gujarat and led by the National Human Rights Commission petitioned the top court in 2002 to order a new probe and move all the cases out of the state. Last month, India's central government told the court it would have no objection if investigations into the riots were moved out of Gujarat. After years of delay the court finally ordered the setting up of a special five-member investigation team on Tuesday and asked them to submit a report within three months. Human rights activists welcomed the fresh probe into the riots. "In the course of investigation and even after the filing of charge sheets, the police sedulously avoided arresting persons who were members of the political party or of a private army owing allegiance to that political party which held the reins of government in the state," Teesta Setalvad, an activist said in a statement on Tuesday. Tensions between Muslims and Hindus spiralled into a month of rioting in 2002 in Gujarat after a suspected Muslim mob burnt alive 59 Hindus, mostly religious activists inside a train in February 2002. In retaliation, thousands of people, mostly Muslims were hacked and burned to death and woman raped, rights groups said. Officials say that 4,252 cases were registered in Gujarat, but more than 2000 cases dropped for lack of evidence, which activists blamed on the Gujarat government, saying witnesseses were being threatened and intimidated. The Supreme Court had earlier condemned the state's government, led by Narendra Modi, as modern-day Neros in their conduct during the riots, referring to the Roman emperor remembered in legend as playing the lyre as Rome burned. Tuesday's move could further embarrass the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party which ruled the state then and has held power ever sin
