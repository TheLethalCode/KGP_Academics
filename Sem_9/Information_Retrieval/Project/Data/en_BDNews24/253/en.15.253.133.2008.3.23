 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews23.com)The government Sunday imposed a ban on the election to the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), but lawyers vowed to press on with the polls as scheduled. An order signed by Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional deputy commissioner Shamsunnahar asked the association to refrain from holding the election, scheduled for March 24. The order issued to the Supreme Court Bar Association secretary said that no permission had been sought from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police for the election, which the DMP said was necessary in line with the emergency powers rules. The SCBA rushed a meeting and its president barrister Amir-ul Islam said they would hold the election on schedule. Those who attended the meeting included barrister Shafique Ahmed, advocate Khandker Mahbub Hossain and election candidates. bdnews24
