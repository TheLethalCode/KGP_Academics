<TITLE> Iran to hold run-off parliament votes April 25 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will hold run-off votes on April 25 for parliamentary seats not decided in a first election round earlier this month, Iranian media said on Wednesday, but the outcome will not threaten a conservative majority. More than 200 of parliament's 290 seats were decided in the first round and the Interior Ministry said over 70 percent of those went to conservatives, who call themselves "principlist" for their loyalty to the Islamic Republic's ideals. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may not get an easy ride even though he shares the "principlist" tag because the camp is broad and includes political rivals who may use parliament as a springboard for next year's presidential race. Some conservatives have also joined the president's staunchest critics, reformists, in questioning Ahmadinejad's economic management, blamed for double-digit inflation. The Guardian Council, a supervisory body of clerics and jurists, said run-offs would take place on Friday, April 25, the official IRNA news agency reported. IRNA did not spell out how many seats would go to a second round but said they would take place in 43 constituencies, which can have more than one seat in each. Officials have not given a precise breakdown but previous comments indicated about 208 seats were won in voting on March 14, suggesting about 82 seats will go to run-offs where hopefuls did not win enough votes in the first round. Reformists who seek political and social change secured roughly 40 seats in the first round, retaining their small minority. They will contest some run-off votes. Political leaders in the pro-reform camp requested a vote recount in Tehran, after complaining of bias even before any voting began because many of their candidates were barred from running by a pre-election screening process. The conservative-controlled Guardian Council, which was ultimately responsible for screening candidates, has said it would re-check random ballot boxes in the capital. The council denies bias in the vetting process, which involved checking hopefuls met criteria such as commitment to Islam and the Islamic system of rule, among others. The election result will not have a direct impact on major policy areas such as nuclear, oil and foreign policy, as ultimate responsibility for these lie in the hands of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top authority. But analysts say the more moderate conservatives could team up with the reformist minority in scrutinising Ahmadinejad's economic policies, an area where parliament has more control
