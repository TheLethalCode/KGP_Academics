<TITLE> US news video contradicts Clinton on Bosnia visit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - CBS News Video from Hillary Clinton's 1996 visit to Bosnia as first lady contradicts a more dramatic description the Democratic presidential candidate gave in a recent campaign speech. In news video shown on CBS on Monday, Clinton is seen casually walking from her plane and greeting a young girl. CBS said the pictures were recorded at a greeting ceremony when the plane landed. At a recent campaign event, Clinton, who was accompanied by her daughter Chelsea, said she remembered landing under sniper fire. "There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base," Clinton said. At the time of the trip, the Bosnia war was over but hostilities continued. CBS reported that Clinton aides said the video "was not quite as dramatic as Clinton put it." "She meant that there was fire on the hillside around the area when we landed, which was the case," campaign spokeswoman Lissa Muscatine told CBS.
