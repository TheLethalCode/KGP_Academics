<TITLE> Lunch time meeting inspired England, Sidebottom says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A chat at lunch between England's bowlers had helped motivate them to ensure the third and final test against New Zealand did not slip away from them, Ryan Sidebottom said on Sunday. New Zealand, who had dismissed the visitors for 253 early on the second day, raced to 93 for one at lunch with Stephen Fleming and Jamie How well set to capitalise on the good pitch. Sidebottom, however, bowled 13 overs unchanged and took five for 33 in the session, before England bowled the hosts out for 168 shortly after tea. Sidebottom ended with career-best figures of seven for 47, while Stuart Broad took three for 54. "I think when you're taking wickets, the adrenaline keeps you going. I don't think I've bowled a session before," Sidebottom told reporters. "We didn't have a telling off but we did have a get together and said we needed to pull our fingers out because the match was slipping away," he said of their lunch meeting. "You don't expect it to go so well but I think we pulled it together as a team. Sidebottom, who returned to test cricket last year after a six-year absence and has been a first choice ever since, has now taken 23 wickets in the series, making him the most successful England bowler on a New Zealand tour. "It's going well," Sidebottom said of his international return. "I'm not going to change much because things can change quickly. But if I keep putting the ball in the right areas then you're always a chance. "I don't bowl 88-90 mph... I've just tried to get the ball in the right areas and if it seams around or swings, then you're always a chance." New Zealand's How said his side were disappointed with their batting, with several wickets falling to careless shots. "It was some really bad batting," said How. "They weren't great shots today and maybe were we too aggressive. "There were too many soft dismissals today and there is a lot of batsmen in the shed not too happy with how they went. "While we are really disappointed with our batting today we are still in the game if we put in a good bowling performance we back ourselves to chase anything on what will still be a good deck.
