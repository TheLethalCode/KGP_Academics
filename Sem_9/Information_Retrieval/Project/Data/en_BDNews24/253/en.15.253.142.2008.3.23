<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England extended their lead to 176 runs at the close of play on the second day of the deciding third test after Ryan Sidebottom ripped through New Zealand's batting lineup on Sunday. Sidebottom finished with career-best figures of seven for 47 and took his series tally to 23 wickets, while Stuart Broad chipped in with three for 54 to bowl the hosts out for 168 shortly after tea, an 85-run lead on first innings. Sidebottom, who took a hat-trick and a 10-wicket haul in the first match in Hamilton, has surpassed the 19 wickets taken by Darren Gough (1996-97) and Andrew Caddick (2001-02) to become the most successful England bowler in a series in New Zealand. England lost captain Michael Vaughan for four when he was caught by Brendon McCullum from a Chris Martin delivery in the first over before Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss consolidated. Cook was dropped by McCullum off Daniel Vettori on 34 but he fell shortly afterwards when the wicketkeeper held on to an edge off Jeetan Patel to dismiss the left-hander for 37 and end the 72-run stand with Strauss. FURTHER WICKETS Strauss (42) and Kevin Pietersen (seven) ensured England did not lose any further wickets and went to stumps on 91 for two with their side in firm control of the match and series which is level at 1-1. The hosts had bowled the tourists out early on the second day for 253 with teenage pace bowler Tim Southee taking five wickets. However, they threw away a strong position after Stephen Fleming and Jamie How had guided them to 103 for one before Sidebottom went on the rampage after lunch. The left-armer bowled 13 overs unchanged and took five for 33 in the afternoon before he wrapped up New Zealand's innings after tea when Vettori was the last man out for 14. Fleming top-scored with 59 and How was dismissed for 44, the pair sharing a 102-run second-wicket stand. New Zealand won the first test by 189 runs and England the second by 126 runs
