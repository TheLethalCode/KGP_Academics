 KARACHI, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board on Monday released the itinerary for next month's hastily-arranged one day series against Bangladesh. Bangladesh will tour Pakistan from April 6-20 to play five one-day internationals and a twenty20 match, replacing Australia, who postponed this month's tour citing security concerns. Pakistan has also invited Sri Lanka for a five match one-day series. However, a PCB official said Sri Lanka had asked to make sure the series dates did not clash with the Indian Premier League, starting from April 18. Several leading Pakistani and Sri Lankan players are due to play in the IPL.
