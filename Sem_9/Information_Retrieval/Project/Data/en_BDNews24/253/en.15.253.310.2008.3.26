 WASHINGTON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US prosecutors are working with the State Department in its probe of unauthorized snooping into the passport records of presidential candidates, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. The department's role was disclosed after leading senators urged Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the incidents and criticized him over remarks that he would await developments before getting involved. The State Department last week said three contract workers and one staff member improperly viewed passport records of the two Democratic candidates, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and Republican candidate Sen. John McCain. The incident is an embarrassment to the Bush administration and revived memories of a controversy that erupted in 1992 after State Department officials searched former President Bill Clinton's passport and citizenship files when he was the Democratic presidential candidate. "We ask that you take immediate action to look into this matter," Sens Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in a letter to Mukasey. "The Justice Department should not wait to be handed 'a box full of evidence,' ... before determining whether federal laws were broken," they said. Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said prosecutors on Friday had met with officials from the State Department Inspector General's office regarding the passport snooping. The prosecutors were "coordinating" with the office on its investigative efforts, he said. Officials declined to provide specifics but characterized the prosecutors' activity as consulting or review. Mukasey had told reporters on Friday, before the meeting by prosecutors, that the State Department had not as yet sought Justice Department involvement. He said one option would be to wait for a formal referral from State and joked that another would be "if somebody walked in here with a box full of evidence." The State Department said last week that two contract employees had been fired and a third disciplined over the snooping. A regular department employee was "admonished" for having looked at Clinton's file but was not fired. Earlier this year, the State Department announced plans to expand access to the passport database to entities including foreign governments, Interpol and the federal departments of homeland security and justice. The expanded "routine" access would be used for purposes including counterterrorism, border security and fraud prevention
