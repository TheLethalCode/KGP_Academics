 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)  The nation is commemorating the 37th anniversary of independence Wednesday amid a renewed call to try war criminals and build a democratic society through a free and fair election. The day began with a 31-gun salute while President Iajuddin Ahmed and Chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed placed wreaths at the Savar National Memorial at dawn. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, Chief Justice Md Ruhul Amin, Deputy Speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui also placed wreaths at the memorial to show respect to the freedom fighters who had sacrificed their lives during the nine-month war against the Pakistani military. Various political parties, including the Awami League and the BNP, also observed the day by placing wreaths and holding other programmes. Thousands of people then streamed into the memorial to show respects to the three million people who had made the ultimate sacrifice for the dream of a new nation to come true. In the morning, members of the armed forces and security agencies staged a parade at the National Parade Square in the capital. The President will host a reception at Bangabhaban for freedom fighters, politicians, teachers, civil servants and members of the armed forces, among others, later Wednesday. Many of Dhaka's main thoroughfares were festooned with the national flag. The President, in his Independence Day message to the nation, Tuesday called upon Bangladeshis at home and abroad to unite behind the economic development of the country. In a separate message, the Chief Adviser said: "It is everyone's expectation that a welfare-oriented government and a meaningful democratic order will be established in the country through a free, fair and acceptable election." Meanwhile, Liberation War sector commanders and others observed a one-minute blackout from Tuesday midnight, demanding the trial of "war criminals". The campaigners stood in silence at the Central Shaheed Minar, a common rallying point, followed by the lighting of candles in a symbolic programme to protest the genocide that took place 37 years ago. The Sector Commanders' Forum, a platform of 1971 war veterans, revived a movement for the trial of the "war criminals" and urged people to rally behind them. bdnews24
