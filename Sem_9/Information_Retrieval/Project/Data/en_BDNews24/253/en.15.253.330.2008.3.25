 Ismailia, Egypt, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US warship fired on a motor boat in the Gulf of Suez on Monday, killing one Egyptian and wounding two others, Egyptian security sources and witnesses said. The U.S. ship Global Patriot fired on the Egyptian vessel after it ignored calls to stay away, the sources said. The Egyptian vessel was carrying goods to sell to ships passing through the Suez Canal, a transit for U.S. ships heading to the Gulf, the sources said. The U.S. ship had been awaiting permission to pass through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, the sources added.
