 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)Most of the members of the mixed crowd who were regular 'Ramna' restaurant-goers in early 1971 were gradually dropping in at that establishment during the fateful evening of March 25, to join their habitual tables. We, too at our table, were busy dissecting the country's political situation -- Sheikh Mujib's dilemma, rumours of looming military action in our eastern wing of the country, divided opinions within the army, and so on. Everybody was apprehensive about what form of West Pakistani intimidation would rain down on the Bangalees of the then East Pakistan. Then Humayun Kabir and Sultana Rebu turned up; two of the most brilliant students to pass out of the Dhaka University Bangla department, they had graduated a year before us. Both were cheerful and full of zeal. But everyone being a little uneasy and rather gloomy, the eerie feeling hanging around us that evening could not be dispelled by Humayun's hearty laughter. We suggested they leave early. 'Why?' Humayun demanded, forgetting that he was escorting young Sultana home. 'People are talking about an imminent military crackdown,' I said. I knew very well that Humayun bhai would not hesitate for even a second before drawing his revolver. But this was no time for displays of bravado or camaraderie. The moment was at hand when everyone would be on one's frantic own. My friend Tuku (poet Abul Hasan) and I managed to push Humu and Rebu out at around ten. We ourselves decided that instead of returning that night to my room at Jinnah Hall (now Surya Sen Hall), we'd take cover at my cousin Panna's residence at the BCSIR Laboratory quarters in Dhanmondi. We took a rickshaw ride to New Elephant Road and stopped at the Pia eatery to sample the khichuri and delicious duck curry. We had hardly begun eating, however, when a group of local boys rushed in and started carrying the tables and chairs out onto the street. From their conversation, we gathered that they were putting up barricades on Elephant Road to block members of the Pakistani military who were reportedly on their way to the East Pakistan Rifles headquarters. That ended our dinner, and we bolted out after paying. We caught the grocer Ghafur Miah, known to us, just as he was pulling his shop shutters down. Having collected some provisions, we turned into the alleyway (now Science Laboratory Road ) to reach the BCSIR lab residential quarters. Panna and other members of their bachelor officers' den were all wide awake. They, too, were harping on similar themes to those we had been going over earlier that fateful night. Tuku and I smiled to each other. Not returning to the desolate Dhaka University hall might have turned out to be a good decision. 'Yes, why must you go back to the same hole every night, even when your exams are over? Aren't you supposed to spend some happy hours outside?' Panna joshed with us, and ordered his aide Ali to lay dinner for us. We had hardly finished eating, when people chanting the 'Joi Bangla' slogan were heard from the Elephant Road intersection. 'Let's go to the rooftop and see what's happening. But I won't allow either of you to go out tonight,' said Panna. I sauntered into the kitchen to help Ali and after ten minutes, I was carrying a coffee flask, snacks, and cigarettes upstairs. As I stepped out onto the semi-dark rooftop I found Panna and Tuku speechlessly crouching behind the two-foot high surrounding wall, peeping cautiously at the spectacle down below. I followed suit, crouching beside them. I saw around forty youths shouting slogans: "Paki troops, go back", "Bangla is not for you". But soon, a distant hum drew near and we guessed Pakistani military tanks were approaching. The crowd soon fell back towards New Market and the tanks rolling onto the scene smashed and pounded everything in their path. The tanks swerved left and took the road leading to New Market, Balaka cinema and Peelkhana or East Pakistan Rifles headquarters. They were followed by a contingent of armoured personnel carriers. Multi-coloured flares were fired, which reaching a height above us burst into brightly coloured pools of light, illuminating the area so that the passing occupation troops could spot any unruly elements and shoot wildly. Unending barrages of shelling from the advancing tanks, and mortar shells coupled with rifle fire were shooting past our heads. Many innocent people were killed and properties damaged during that endless night of shooting and shelling, though it was meant to be just a show of military force by the Pakistani army. The morning found us crouching in the same position, sipping coffee, as Tuku said: 'Look towards your Jinnah Hall." "Thank me that I suggested we spend the night somewhere other than our regular resting place.' Panna and I were shocked to see that heavy, dense rings of smoke were billowing from the area around Dhaka University arts faculty, where lay my hall of residence. The skies there were alight... I barely remember how we descended from the roof that dawn or when we fell asleep. We woke again at about nine in the morning to the news of indefinite curfew being imposed... It wasn't until almost two days later, when the curfew was lifted briefly, that we found out the full extent of the massacre and destruction wrought that dreadful night. bdn
