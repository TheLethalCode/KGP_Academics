 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Sunday approved Local Government (City Corporation) Ordinance 2008 and Local Government (Municipality) Ordinance 2008 allowing political leaders and private school teachers to participate in the elections as contestants. The ordinances also provide for holding elections 180 days before the expiry of the tenure. The cabinet also approved the proposed Local Government Commission Ordinance 2008 to oversee the local government system. The council of advisers in its regular weekly meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in the chair gave the approval, in principle, to the three proposed ordinances. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim informed briefed the media in the evening on the outcome of the meeting. The caretaker government last year formed a seven-member committee led by adviser AMM Shawkat Ali to make the local government bodies dynamic and the ordinances have been prepared in light of the recommendations of the committee. The ordinances provide for same law to be applied to all city corporations following the recommendations of the committee to remove discrimination. According to the common city corporation and municipality ordinances, the tenure of elected representatives at all levels would be five years. If election cannot be held 180 days before the tenure expires, the government can appoint an administrator for a limited time. The ordinances make those holding political offices and teachers of private schools, colleges and madrasas eligible to contest the polls in contrast to the committee recommendations to disqualify them. However, the ordinances say, once elected, a person would have to relinquish their political office or teaching position. The law also bars a person from running for several offices at a time; for instance, the mayor of a city cannot run in parliamentary elections. The ceiling on election expenditure for every level is being fixed and a candidate would be made accountable if they exceed the ceiling. A candidate for a position in local government body will have to be a citizen of Bangladesh, not less than 25 years of age, a registered voter and a resident of the ward they would be running for. Candidates will be disqualified if they lose citizenship, are announced insane by a competent court, sentenced to at least six months in prison for criminal offence and being bank loan defaulter. Besides, a person will also be disqualified if he or she loses job for corruption or any other crime. If a person is adjudged a war criminal by a national or international court or tribunal the person would be barred from contesting local government elections. The proposed Local Government Commission Ordinance suggests formation of the commission with a person having pertinent experience as its chairman. It will have two members with experience in administrative and legal fields. The chairman of the Public Service Commission would be ex-officio chairman of the recruitment committee for the selection of persons for the commission. The comptroller and auditor general and the secretary to the Local Government Division will be members of the commission. The president will appoint the commission chairman and members from the panel selected by the recruitment committee. According to the recommendations, the Local Government Division would ensure funds for the union, upazila, zila, municipality and city corporation.
