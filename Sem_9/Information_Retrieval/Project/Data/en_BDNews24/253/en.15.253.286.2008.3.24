<TITLE> Bhutan holds first parliamentary poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Thimpu, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan holds the first parliamentary elections in its history on Monday, ending a century of absolute royal rule. Polls open at 9 am (0300 GMT) and close at 5 pm Preliminary results are expected on Monday evening, with a final declaration of results due in the morning of Mar 25. Sandwiched between India and China, Bhutan is the only independent Himalayan kingdom and is known by its mainly Buddhist people as Druk Yul, the Land of the Thunder Dragon. It is roughly the size of the Netherlands, with the population of around 600,000 people. Only two parties have been allowed to take part in the vote. The People's Democratic Party promises "service with humility" while the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa says it stands for "growth with equity and justice". Both manifestoes are based on the idea of "gross national happiness", which stresses quality of life, tradition and the environment as well as economic development. The Election Commission has registered 318,465 voters in 47 constituencies. The largest constituency in the south of the country has 11,803 voters and the smallest, in the northern mountains, just 768. Two mock elections were held last year as a dress rehearsal for the real thing. In December and January voters elected 20-members for a 25-member National Council meant to act as an upper house of parliament. Five are chosen by the king. None are allowed to belong to political parties. More than 100,000 Bhutanese, mostly southern Hindus of ethnic Nepali origin, are confined in refugee camps in Nepal. Most fled Bhutan or were expelled after protesting against discrimination and for democracy in 1990. The United States has offered to resettle up to 60,000 refugees and has already taken a handful of families. bdn
