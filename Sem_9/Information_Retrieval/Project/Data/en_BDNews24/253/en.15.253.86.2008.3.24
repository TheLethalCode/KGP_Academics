 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  Four detained BNP leaders were returned to jail from hospital Monday morning, after prison authorities seized a number of banned items from the prison ward of BSMMU hospital, prison officials said. Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, Abul Hashem, Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu and Salahuddin Ahmed had been undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddique told bdnews24.com that they were taken back to Dhaka Central Jail Monday. Prison authorities rushed to move them after SIM cards and an ipod were seized from some VIP detainees at the prison ward of BSMMU hospital Sunday. On Sunday, they shifted former BNP MP Mosaddak Ali Falu and former Jamaat-e-Islami MP Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher back to jail from hospital. "Six of those involved in illegal activities, like talking on cell phones, have already been taken back to jail," Siddiqui said following a meeting of hospital and prison officials. "Some are still in the hospital and it is being investigated how necessary it is for them to stay in hospital." He added, however, that every detainee would be provided with proper treatment in hospital. Siddiqui said the meeting -- with BSMMU pro vice chancellor Abu Taher, superintendent of the hospital Dr Zahiruddin Ahmed and inspector general of prisons Md Zakir Hasan -- imposed some codes of conduct for doctors and detainees of the hospital prison ward. According to new codes decided in the meeting: No doctor, nurse or other individual in possession of a mobile phone will be allowed to meet detainees. A list of the prison ward's doctors, nurses and employees will be published. Not more than one detainee at a time may be taken out of the ward for tests or checkups. Prisoners will not be allowed to meet relatives while they are outside the prison ward for tests or checkups. Doctors are no longer allowed to recommend food from outside for detainees. Prison authorities must be informed instantly if anybody violates the rules. Siddiqui said they also decided to keep lights on in the prison ward at all times, and the light switches be installed outside the ward. Two cellular phone SIM cards and an ipod were seized from BNP leaders Salauddin Quader Chowdhury and Mosaddak Ali Falu Sunday. Two mobile phones were seized from police guards on duty outside the room of detained BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman. Authorities also alleged that Tarique had used a cell phone belonging to his doctor KMH Sirajuddin Ahmad. The doctor admitted that he entered Tarique's room with his cell phone but denied that Tarique had used it. bdnews24.c
