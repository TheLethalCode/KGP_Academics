<TITLE> BTRC chief seeks to hike fine for breaching rules </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)The telecoms regulator has proposed amending legislation in the sector to ensure the law meets the demands of the modern industry, said the BTRC chairman Tuesday. "Many aspects of the existing telecommunication act need modernising," said BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam at a ceremony to issue five new licences to the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. The proposed changes will also see the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission strengthen their role and vastly increase the maximum fine they can impose on companies that violate the law. "A proposal for amending the Telecommunication Act 2001 was sent to the post and telecommunication ministry on Sunday," said Alam. "A number of amendments were suggested, including increasing the administrative and economic powers of the BTRC," he said. The BTRC chairman said the regulator had proposed to have the maximum fine they can impose on the violators of licence conditions increased to Tk 500 crore. "Of course we hope everyone will abide by the law, but in the existing law the maximum fine is exceptionally low," he said. Alam said the BTRC is a specialised organisation and its manpower needed to be highly trained, but the government salary scale would never attract the right kind of employee. He said with the proposed legislation the industry regulator would enjoy greater autonomy, which would give the commission much needed impetus. The BTTB was issued the licences in line with the International Long Distance Telecommunication Policy 2007. Alam said he hoped a level playing field would be created among all telephone operators including the BTTB, as they had all been given their licences on the same conditions. Acting BTTB chairman Ashraful Alim said: "We will try to survive the competition and ensure a quality service." bdnews
