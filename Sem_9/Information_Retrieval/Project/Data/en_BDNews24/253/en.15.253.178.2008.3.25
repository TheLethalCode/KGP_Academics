 Damascus, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would be sending low-level representation to this week's Arab League summit in Damascus, confirming fears that an Arab rift over Lebanon would undermine the annual meeting. The Saudi permanent representative at the Arab League said he would represent his country at the summit, meaning that influential King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal would be staying away. Saudi Arabia blames Syria for the failure of Damascus-allied Lebanese opposition forces to reach a deal with the Lebanese government and end political deadlock which has prevented the election of a new president for four months. In Beirut, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Syrian-backed opposition leader, announced the 17th delay in the presidential vote, postponing the election from Tuesday to April 22. The delay means that there will be no Lebanese president to attend the March 29-30 Arab summit. Lebanon's political crisis was expected to hit the level of turnout at summit. "I will head Saudi Arabia's delegation to the summit," Saudi representative Ahmad bin Abdelaziz Qattan told reporters after a meeting of Arab League representatives in the Syrian capital. "We meet today without a president in Lebanon due to the continued and unjustifiable delays in the election. We look forward to an effective Syrian role in achieving a Lebanese national reconciliation," Qattan told the meeting. NO BREAKTHROUGH The Arab League had expected no last-minute breakthrough in the political deadlock. "What we have not succeeded in building in the last several months I don't think we will succeed in doing in the next 24 hours," Arab League chief Amr Moussa told Reuters in Cairo before Lebanon announced the latest delay. Lebanon has been without a president since Emile Lahoud's term ended in November. The Lebanese rivals have agreed that army chief General Michel Suleiman should fill the presidency but his confirmation has been derailed by a dispute over the make-up of the cabinet to be formed after his election. U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Egypt say Syria is blocking the election in Lebanon and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is also not expected to attend. Syria says a solution to the crisis is in its national interest. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said turnout at the Arab summit could be poor if the session of the Lebanese parliament to select a president was again postponed. "If we go into the summit and Lebanon is not present in its seat or is present with a very low-level representative, and there is no Lebanese president, I think there are Arab powers that perhaps would not be happy with that," he said. A Syria government daily accused the United States of trying to undermine the summit by pushing its Arab Middle East allies not to attend. "America is barely hiding its attempts to disrupt the summit and lessen its importance," Tishreen newspaper said.
