 Singapore, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rose in holiday-thinned trade on Monday, led by a 4 percent gain for Taiwan after an opposition win in the presidential election boosted expectations for better trade ties and less political tension with China. Oil fell back towards the $100 mark a barrel as top producer Saudi Arabia reassured consumers of its plans to boost supply and gold fell back, giving respite to the battered U.S. dollar and easing concerns about inflation. "Unreasonably high commodities prices are returning to normal and this, along with the perception that U.S. financial markets have hit bottom, is boosting investor sentiment," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. Activity was subdued in Asia, however, as markets in many parts of the region as well as in Europe remaining closed for the Easter holiday, with investors waiting for U.S. trade to resume later in the day. U.S. stock index futures signalled that Wall Street would likely extend last week's gains. Shares in Seoul added 0.6 percent and Singapore's benchmark climbed 2.5 percent. MSCI's index of shares outside Japan rose 1.3 percent, although it is still down 18 percent so far this year. The MSCI ex-Japan index of financials extended gains to notch up a 1.4 percent rise by 0617 GMT after a report in the New York Times said JPMorgan Chase & Co was in talks to quintuple its offer to buy Bear Stearns Cos to $10 per share, suggesting that there may be more value in financial assets than previously thought. JPMorgan's original agreement on March 16 to pay $2 per share for the stricken Bear, was widely considered a fire-sale price after the Wall Street bank saw the value of its investments pummelled by a meltdown in the subprime mortgage market. "It (the new price) could be a relief for financial stocks and maybe a sign that the worst for the mortgage-backed debt market has passed," Chua Hak Bin, director Asia-Pacific economics and markets at Citigroup. Tokyo's Nikkei index traded in and out of the red to end the session flat, although gains in financial stocks, such as Mitsubishi UFJ, cushioned the fall. Investors were braced for the upcoming corporate results season. Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said sentiment at manufacturers has deteriorated as expected as rises in the yen and crude oil prices have weighed. "Japanese firms will face a severe situation in terms of profits around the first half of fiscal 2008-09," he said. TAIPEI CELEBRATES Taiwan markets surged the first trading day after Ma Ying-jeou of the more China-friendly Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT) won the presidential poll, boosting hopes for a greater flow of tourists, trade and capital between Taiwan and China. Ma has pledged to boost business ties with rival China to jumpstart the economy of the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own. Taiwan's main TAIEX jumped more than 6 percent at the open -- its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than seven years -- before easing back to a gain of 4 percent. The Taiwan dollar also jumped to a 10-year high of T$30.218 against the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in the currency markets the dollar rose 0.2 percent against the yen to 99.87 yen keeping distance from a 13-year low of 95.77 yen hit on electronic trading platform EBS early last week. Confidence in U.S. assets was partially restored after the Federal Reserve unveiled steps to relieve the credit crisis. Among an array of initiatives, the U.S. central bank pushed JPMorgan Chase to acquire Bear Stearns, started lending directly to securities firms for the first time since the Great Depression and lowered the benchmark fed funds rates by 75 basis points to 2.25 percent. The yuan hit a fresh post-revaluation high against the dollar at 7.0508 for an eighth straight day on expectations that China would ensure relatively fast appreciation in the near term to fight inflation. Oil fell nearly $2 dollars, with U.S. light crude for May delivery down $1.16 to $100.66 a barrel. Prices dropped by almost $9, about 8 percent, last week as investors fled the commodities complex on fears that gains had been overdone, giving a lift to the beleaguered dollar in the process. Spot gold changed hands at $909.00/909.80.
