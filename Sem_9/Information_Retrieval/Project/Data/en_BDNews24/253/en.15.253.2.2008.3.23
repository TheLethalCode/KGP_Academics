<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews23.com)The government Sunday imposed a ban on the election to the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), but lawyers vowed to press on with the polls as scheduled. An order signed by Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional deputy commissioner Shamsunnahar asked the association to refrain from holding the election, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. The order sent to the Supreme Court Bar Association secretary AM Aminuddin said that no permission had been sought from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police for the election, which the DMP said was necessary in line with the emergency powers rules. The SCBA rushed a meeting and its president barrister Amir-ul Islam said they would hold the election on schedule. Announcing the decision on behalf of the lawyers, barrister Amir said the election committee would take the decision on how the election would be held. "There is no legal barrier to holding the election. The government can obstruct meetings, rallies and processions. But we are not holding meetings Monday. We will cast ballots wherever the election commission keeps the ballot box," he said. Barrister Amir claimed that the notice on the polls ban had been taken either without understanding or to tarnish the image and popularity of the government. He urged chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda to observe the election. SCBA has arranged transparent ballot boxes to ensure transparency in the election. Barrister Amir said the government should not do anything, which amounts to intervention in the independent judiciary. "Intervening in the independence of the Bar means interfering with the independence of the judiciary," he said. Those who attended the meeting at the South Hall of the association included barrister Shafique Ahmed, advocate Khandker Mahbub Hossain, secretary candidate barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, Nurul Islam Sujon, barrister Badruddoza Badal and other election candidates and lawyers. bdnews24
