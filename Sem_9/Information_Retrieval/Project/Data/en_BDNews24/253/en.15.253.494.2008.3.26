 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain said on Tuesday the human rights situation in China was poor and urged Beijing to hold a meaningful dialogue with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The criticism in the British foreign ministry's annual report on human rights comes as China faces international pressure over its crackdown in Tibet in response to protests against Chinese rule. The report covers the 15 months to the end of last year and does not refer to the latest Tibet unrest. At a news conference to launch the report, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said worldwide concern over the situation in Tibet was "justified and proper" but he spoke out against boycotting this year's Beijing Olympics. "I don't believe a boycott of the Olympics is the right thing to do ... A wrecked Olympics is actually not going to do anything for human rights in China," he said. The Foreign Office report said that despite the Chinese government's "stated commitment to protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and significant progress over the past 20 years, the situation in China remains poor." "With only limited reforms introduced since autumn 2006, violations of basic human rights continue to overshadow China's otherwise remarkable development," it said. Violations of human rights continued in Tibet, it said. "We continue to make clear our view that the best way to improve the situation in Tibet is through meaningful dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama and his representatives, without preconditions, to achieve a long-term peaceful solution acceptable to the people of Tibet," it said. DRIVE FOR TRADE British Prime Minister Gordon Brown launched a drive this year to increase trade and investment with China. But he has risked Chinese anger by saying he will meet the Dalai Lama when he visits Britain in May. The Dalai Lama has criticised the violence in Tibet and said he wants negotiations with China on autonomy, but not independence, for his homeland. China blames him for rioting it says killed 19 people. Tibet's government-in-exile says 130 people were killed and that Chinese troops opened fire on protesters. The Foreign Office said its concerns about China included the scope of the death penalty, torture, lack of an independent judiciary, obstacles to fair trials, ill-treatment of prisoners, harassment of worshippers, "restrictive regimes" in Tibet and the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang, and limitations on freedom of expression and association. Other countries singled out for criticism in the report included Iran, where it said serious human rights violations had continued. It said there had been a "worrying and rapid increase" in the rate of executions there. The report said there had been a "shrinking of the democratic space" in Russia and voiced concern at allegations of malpractice during the December 2007 parliamentary election. Anglo-Russian relations plunged into crisis last year when Moscow refused a British request to hand over London's chief suspect in the murder of Russian emigre Alexander Litvinenko
