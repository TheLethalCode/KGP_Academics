 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com) - A superb four-scalp from Salma Khatun guided the Bangladesh women's cricket team to an emphatic eight-wicket win over visiting Hong Kong counterparts in the four-match series opener Sunday. Bangladesh reached home making 39 for two in 13.2 overs in reply to Hong Kong's paltry total of 38 all out in 22.2 overs at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Opener Shathria Zakir topscored with 22 while Ayesah Akter and Panna remained unbeaten on eight and four to steer Bangladesh home. Earlier, put in to bat first, pacer Shamima Akter made the inroads into the visitors' batting lineup with Betty Chan and Charlotte Chan returning to the dressing room with ducks, leaving the side at eight for two in 3.3 overs. Then, Panna Gosh dismissed Keennu Gill (6) and Jahanara Alam removed top-scorer Neisha Pratt (16) while skipper Salma wiped out the tail to stop Hong Kong below 40 runs. Six Hong Kong players got duck as skipper Salma returned four for two runs in 6.2 overs.
