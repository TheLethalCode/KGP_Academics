 MANILA, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former commander of the Philippine Marine Corps and seven subordinates were charged on Wednesday with selling government-issued sub-machine guns, government prosecutors said. Brigadier-General Percival Subala, two soldiers, a police officer and four civilians were charged with graft over the loss of 72 Heckler and Koch MP5 sub-machine guns that were later sold. The prosecutors said the guns were part of a large cache of weapons seized in October 2000. Early this month, a two-star army commander was suspended on corruption charges after he was accused of extorting money from fresh recruits on the southern island of Mindanao. Graft is a major problem in the Philippine military. In 2006, the military's chief finance officer, Major-General Carlos Garcia, was sentenced to two years hard labour for using government funds to buy an apartment in New York's Manhattan area. Garcia, his wife and two sons are facing separate criminal cases before the anti-graft court after U.S. authorities seized a large amount of cash from the general's children at an airport in California in 2004
