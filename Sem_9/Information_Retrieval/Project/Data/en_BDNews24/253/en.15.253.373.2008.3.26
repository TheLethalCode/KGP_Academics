<TITLE> UK regulator toughens act after N Rock failings </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog will boost its oversight of the country's largest banks after admitting that its supervision of Northern Rock was unacceptable and failed to highlight the mortgage lender's vulnerability. In an internal report published on Wednesday, the Financial Services Authority said its supervision of the lender, brought into public ownership last month, was insufficient and failed to follow up key issues, including the bank's business model and increased risks as market conditions deteriorated. It also highlighted insufficient internal FSA checks over its work -- blamed on a lack of continuity in heads of department and on staff turnover -- and said it had inadequate resources focused on the bank. The crisis at Northern Rock, which has borrowed 25 billion pounds ($50 billion) from the Bank of England since last September, left the FSA facing the biggest crisis since it was set up -- accused along with other regulators of failing to do enough to prevent the first run on a UK bank in over a century. "It is clear from the thorough review carried out by the internal audit team that our supervision of Northern Rock in the period leading up to the market instability of late last summer was not carried out to a standard that is acceptable," FSA Chief Executive Hector Sants said on Wednesday. "Although whether that would have affected the outcome in this case is impossible to judge." MORE STAFF, TIGHTER OVERSIGHT The watchdog said it now planned to employ a new group of supervisory specialists to review oversight of "high-impact" UK retail and investment banks, boost staff numbers and implement a minimum team size for key firms, as well as improve training. The FSA has focused on having fewer, but better employees, but Wednesday's internal review found that poor staffing levels and the need to prioritise resources meant some fundamental elements were "squeezed out" of its oversight process. The FSA expects to boost staff numbers by 100, taking its number of supervisors to 625 by March next year. It said on Wednesday that supervisors should review banks' business and strategic plans annually, something they failed to do for Northern Rock, but also increase the rigour of everyday supervision of the firms. The watchdog said it would also increase its focus on liquidity, particularly for high street banks, and raise the emphasis on the competence of banks' senior management. The FSA is already reviewing liquidity rules, having last year highlighted areas of concern including the stress-testing, or the tests carried out by banks to ensure they can survive both extreme and lengthy liquidity crises. In the case of Northern Rock, the bank remained solvent after August's crisis but was unable to fund lending after the summer's liquidity crunch became chronic and long-lasting. The FSA said it had compared its supervision of Northern Rock with that of other banks and found some of the same shortcomings elsewhere, though Northern Rock was "at the extreme end of the spectrum" and combined most failings. Wednesday's report, presented to the FSA's board last month, is the first internal examination of the watchdog's handling of the crisis last year. Since September, the FSA has shaken up its management, with several supervisors set to leave. It has also beefed up its supervision of banks and a hiring drive currently underway is expected to boost its ranks. The report was commissioned in October and covers the FSA's supervision of Northern Rock from January 2005 to July 2007, before the August crisis
