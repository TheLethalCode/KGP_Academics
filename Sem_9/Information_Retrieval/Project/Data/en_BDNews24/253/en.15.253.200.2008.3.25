 Bush eyes continued anti-terrorism work with Pakistan Washington, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush called Pakistan's new prime minister on Tuesday and the two agreed to maintain their alliance against Islamic militants, the White House said. Bush called Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani hours after he was sworn in on Tuesday by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a vital U.S. ally in the campaign against terrorism who has seen his power wane dramatically over the past year. "They both agreed that it's in everyone's best interest to continue to fight extremists, so we feel comfortable that we'll be having a continued good relationship with the Pakistanis in this regard," said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. Pakistan's new National Assembly overwhelmingly backed Gilani, a top official from assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto's party, to become prime minister on Monday. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher are visiting Pakistan to establish relationships with the Muslim country's new coalition government leaders. Some of those leaders have suggested starting talks with the militants responsible for a wave of suicide attacks. Such calls have raised questions about whether Pakistan will remain a staunch U.S. ally against militancy.
