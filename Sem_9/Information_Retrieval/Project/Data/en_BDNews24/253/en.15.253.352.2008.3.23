<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid earned a rare 2-1 win at 10-man Sevilla on Saturday thanks to goals by Argentine forwards Maxi Rodriguez and Sergio Aguero to tighten their grip on fourth place in the Primera Liga. The victory, Atletico's first in over 15 years at the Sanchez Pizjuan, puts them on 50 points, five clear of fifth-placed Sevilla and only three behind Villarreal who visit basement side Levante on Sunday. Clashes between the two sides have traditionally been fiery affairs and this was no exception with Sevilla midfielder Enzo Maresca receiving his marching orders on the hour after headbutting goalscorer Aguero. Atletico took the lead midway through the first half when Maxi squeezed a precise shot inside the far post after a cross from Portugal winger Simao Sabrosa found its way to him on the far side of the area. Sevilla had the lion's share of possession, but never looked comfortable as Atletico snapped at their heels in midfield. However, they caught Atletico cold at the start of the second half, winger Diego Capel steering the ball in at the far post after Atletico goalkeeper Christian Abbiati had pushed a Frederic Kanoute shot into his path. Atletico remained focused and restored their lead before the hour, Aguero stroking the ball past keeper Andres Palop on the volley after he had sneaked in behind two defenders to meet an Antonio Lopez cross. Sevilla appeared unhinged by the new setback and substitute Maresca was sent off two minutes later for headbutting Aguero after he was fouled by the Argentine. RELEGATION FEARS Real Mallorca eased their relegation fears with a 1-0 win at home to Deportivo Coruna that pushed them up to 10th place. Venezuelan striker Juan Arango scored the winner midway through the first half when his free kick from wide on the right flew over a huddle of defenders, bounced in front of keeper Dudu Aouate and ended up in the back of the net. Deportivo, a shadow of the side that beat Real Madrid 1-0 last weekend, suffered an additional blow when striker Riki was sent off for a second booking deep into injury time. Defeat left the Galicians just two points above the relegation zone with all their immediate rivals yet to play.
