 BASRA, Iraq, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heavy fighting erupted on Tuesday in the southern oil city of Basra where Iraqi security forces launched a major operation against powerful militias, military officials and witnesses said. A Reuters witness in the city reported seeing columns of black smoke over northern districts and hearing the sound of explosions and machinegun fire. Television pictures showed Iraqi troops running through empty streets and taking cover. Major Tom Holloway, a spokesman for British forces in Basra, said Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was in the city to oversee the operation. Troop reinforcements had been sent from across Iraq, he said. Rival factions of Iraq's Shia majority and criminal gangs are competing for control of Basra, Iraq's second city and gateway to the Gulf, along with its oil fields, which are the source of most government revenues, officials say.

Basra residents said Tuesday's operation was concentrated in six northern districts where Sadr's powerful Mehdi Army militia is known to have a strong presence. Harith al-Ithari, the head of Sadr's office in Basra, called for calm and accused the Shi'ite-led government of deliberating targeting Sadrists. Sadr's political bloc pulled out of Maliki's Shi'ite-led government last year.
