<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah said Sunday ordinary people, not bureaucrats, can decide who will do politics and echoed demand for release of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina before Independence Day. He called upon the "nationalist forces" to unite in the present situation of the country and expressed concern at the staggering rise in the prices of essentials. "Though people don't want to return to the pre-1/11 situation they want the price regime that existed before 1/11 to return. The trend of the price spiral of essentials is not acceptable," he said at a views exchange meeting at the National Press Club. Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) organised the meeting titled "The significance of Independence Day in present context". BJP president MA Matin presided. The speakers at the meeting stressed building national consensus to restore democracy. Jatiya party (JP) secretary general Sheikh Shahidul Islam urged Jamaat-e-Islami to ask the nation to pardon the party for their role in 1971. Liberal Democratic Party leader Anwarul Kabir Talukder said: "Introduction of the caretaker government system was a suicidal decision for the politicians." Matin said the political leaders would have to unite to build up people's unity like the one on March 25, 1971. He questioned the neutrality of the chief election commissioner. BJP acting secretary general Abu Naser Md Rahmat Ullah moderated the meeting. bdne
