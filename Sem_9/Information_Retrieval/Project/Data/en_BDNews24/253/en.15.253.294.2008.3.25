 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gordon Brown said on Tuesday that Labour MPs will have a free vote on three "ethical" parts of proposed legislation on embryo research after reports said some cabinet ministers could resign over the issue. The prime minister ruled out a free vote on the whole of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, due before the House of Commons in the coming weeks. He said Labour MPs could vote according to their conscience in three controversial areas: fertility research, inter-species "hybrid" embryos and the creation of "saviour siblings" to help a sick brother or sister. Brown said the legislation would allow research that could eventually help find cures for cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Scientists say it will keep Britain at the forefront of embryo research, while opponents, including senior Catholics, have condemned it as unethical. Brown said: "I have always said that although I attach huge importance to this legislation, in saving lives and helping to cure and treat diseases, that we will respect the conscience of every MP as they decide how to cast their vote on this." Brown had faced a potential revolt from some MPs and ministers who oppose the science behind embryo research. Newspaper reports said Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly and Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy were concerned by parts of the bill and may even have considered their positions. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland Cardinal Keith O'Brien said hybrid research was "a monstrous attack on human rights, human dignity and human life". Supporters say it will give scientists the large number of embryos they need to make stem cells to help find cures for a range of diseases. Researchers create inter-species hybrids by injecting human DNA into a hollowed-out animal egg cell. The resulting embryo is 99.9 percent human and 0.1 percent animal. Scientists in China, the United States and Canada have carried out similar work, the same technique used to create Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned mamm
