 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Parents of children joining the International Turkish Hope School's Uttara campus playgroup have complained of a huge hike in the monthly tuition fees. Angry parents say the fees have shot up from Tk 3,000 to Tk 15,000 a month for new entrants to the school in one go. A guardian of one student at the school, who preferred not to be named, told bdnews24.com: "If the tuition fees continue to rise at this rate it will be difficult for rich people to afford this school, let alone the less well-off." "I think the school's authorities want to reduce the number of Bangladeshi students. Otherwise why such a huge jump in the tuition fees?" she said. Merina Ahmed, International Turkish Hope School's administrative officer, confirmed to bdnews24.com Monday that the school had restructured its fees system. "Now there are no campus fees: so new entrants' monthly tuition fees have been fixed at Tk 15,000," said Mrs Ahmed. "However, those who have already been admitted to the school will continue to enjoy the earlier fee structure of Tk 3,000." "Besides, tuition fees at our Gulshan campus remains at Tk 3,000 as the school building there is rented," she said. Mrs Ahmed claimed higher maintenance costs at the main Uttara campus had led to the rise in tuition fees. The International Turkish Hope School was established in 1996, and in March of the following year Turkish president Suleyman Demirel formally inaugurated the institution. bdnews
