<TITLE> Britain seals $25 bln air tankers deal-sources </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain is set to announce a deal to buy Airbus A330 refuelling tankers after a bank loan rescued plans for the world's largest public-private funding project, sources close to the deal said on Wednesday. The deal is most likely to be announced on Thursday during a state visit to Britain by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, although it is not officially part of his programme, and comes weeks after a deal to supply similar jets to the United States. "The financing is fully committed," a source close to the deal said. Others said plans for a bond to cover the initial financing phase worth $2 billion or more had been dropped due to recent market turmoil and had been replaced with a loan. The project is expected to be worth at least $25 billion over its lifetime. Britain is buying the planes under its Private Finance Initiative, a funding scheme more frequently used to lease public services such as hospitals from the private sector. Industry officials say it is the world's biggest such public-private partnership. In 2005, the Royal Air Force selected a consortium of European aerospace firms to buy the aircraft from Airbus and lease them to the Ministry of Defence when needed, but talks over the financing have dragged on far longer than expected. The AirTanker consortium includes Cobham, Rolls Royce and VT Group of Britain, the UK subsidiary of French electronics firm Thales and EADS, the Franco-German-Spanish parent company of planemaker Airbus. A spokesman for AirTanker declined comment. Britain's defence ministry said it could not confirm the deal or announcement plans. The specially converted Airbus passenger jets will replace decades-old models like the VC10 and can alternate between aerial refuelling and troop transport. The planes carry fuel in their normal wing tanks and have space for some 200 seats. Under the deal, AirTanker will be able to rent out the planes when they are not needed for defence, raising the prospect of charter tourists flying aboard refuelling planes. Critics of the PFI policy, pioneered by a previous Conservative administration in the 1990s, say it leads to short-cuts on spending and has put patients' health at risk in hospital schemes. Air forces worldwide are racing to renew their aerial refuelling fleets as military planners adapt to dispersed threats to their security further away from their home base. Britain's purchase of European tankers comes on top of orders from Australia, the UAE and Saudi Arabia and most recently the U.S. Air Force which selected Airbus over Boeing, sparking a row in Congress over security and jobs. FUNDING SNAGS Britain's 13 billion pounds ($25.8 billion) tanker replacement plan, dubbed Future Strategic Air Tanker, is one of several big-ticket defence projects that have been subject to doubts over funding or possible cuts in defence budgets. Others include a plan to build two aircraft carriers in co-operation with the French, who plan their own carrier. Britain opted to go ahead with its own carriers last year but France is unlikely to finalise its own plans to build a carrier until after a defence review due this Spring. Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are likely to discuss French calls for more European defence coordination, which Paris wants to promote when it holds the European Union's rotating presidency in the second half of this year. France aims to boost the role of the EU's fledgling European Defence Agency in rationalising competing military programmes, while maintaining its own fighter jets and nuclear deterrent. European leaders are also concerned about delays of 6-12 months in the A400M military heavylifter, the region's biggest future military project which, like tankers, is led by EADS. Sarkozy has signalled France may be ready to return to NATO's military structures after 41 years, but analysts say Paris is likely to want progress on establishing a stronger European defence identity during its EU presidency. Diplomats say Britain is unlikely to do or say anything that would compromise its close defence and industrial ties with the United States or else provoke domestic eurosceptics as a controversial EU reform treaty works its way through parliamen
