<TITLE> Kostunica tells Serbs they must defer place in EU </TITLE>

 BELGRADE, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbs should be prepared to defer European Union membership for "many, many years" in order to fight for the reversal of Kosovo's unilateral independence, nationalist prime minister Vojislav Kostunica said. Kosovo, not the EU, should be the country's priority, he told state television on Monday evening. Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian majority province broke away from Serbia five weeks ago, after nearly 9 years under United Nations administration. They declared independence with the backing of most EU members and the United States. Until the West reverses that recognition, Kostunica said, Serbia should "cooperate with" the EU without becoming a member, as Norway or Switzerland do. Serbia is now last of the former Yugoslav republics in the queue to join the EU. Its former Soviet bloc neighbours Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are all EU members. It is questionable how well his call for EU postponement will go down with Serb voters in the general election due on May 11, in which pro-Western parties will argue that EU membership must be the country's priority. Norway and Switzerland rank in the world's top 10 richest countries by GDP per capita. Serbia ranks 104th, and Serbs are impatient for the prosperity that EU membership would promote. At the same time, voters are torn over the emotional issue of Kosovo, the land where Serb history goes back 1,000 years. Kostunica said joining the EU ought to be a partnership which respects the integrity of member states -- except that in case of Serbia the EU had so far failed to say if it will do so. "Regarding EU membership, that will come in many, many years, and that's why we should use the time to clear those things," he said. PLAYING 'THE BIG SERB' Kostunica rejected the criticism that his hardline policy would lead Serbia into isolation. "By that logic, you could say Norway voted for isolation by voting against joining the EU." The prime minister, now heading a caretaker government following the collapse of the coalition this month, marked the anniversary of NATO's bombing of Serbia on Monday by accusing the West of grabbing Kosovo. He said it was "more than obvious that the cruel destruction of Serbia during the NATO bombardment had only one aim: to turn the province of Kosovo into the world's first NATO state". NATO bombed Serbia for 78 days in 1999 to force the late Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops from Kosovo. The Western allies said they would not stand for another Milosevic-inspired ethnic cleansing bloodbath in the Balkans. A moderate Kosovo Serb politician, Oliver Ivanovic, said Kostunica's party was playing populist election games with its latest proposal, to have Serbia administer separate justice and social services for Serb communities in Kosovo. "In the north it's easy to play the big Serb and score cheap points, but it will cost the Serbs of central Kosovo dearly," he told the Novi Sad daily Dnevnik. Scattered enclaves south of the Kosovo Serb stronghold of Mitrovica, which adjoins Serbia, would feel lost, he said. "That feeling of being abandoned would be intolerable for them, and would inevitably increase the migration of Serbs from Kosovo," Ivanonvic sa
