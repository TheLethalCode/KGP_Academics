 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)Saudi Arabia restarts issuing visas for Bangladeshi workers from Wednesday, after a short halt, said the Saudi ambassador in Dhaka Monday. The Saudi embassy in Dhaka stopped issuing visas for Bangladeshi workers a couple of weeks ago for what ambassador Abdullah Al-Obaid Al Namla said was for "technical reasons". Namla said his government would soon invite foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury to visit Saudi Arabia. "We could not issue visas to Bangladeshis owing to technical faults. I hope we will start issuing visas to Bangladeshis from Wednesday," Namla told reporters after his farewell call on Iftekhar at the foreign ministry. The ambassador is leaving Dhaka, ending his eight-year assignment in Bangladesh. "The pressure of issuing visas is so huge that we will be forced to give at least 5,000 visas (starting on Wednesday)," Namla said. Neither the foreign affairs adviser nor the ambassador made comments on the reported police action against some Bangladeshis in the kingdom. The Saudi government said its missions in different countries could not issue visas as some technical faults were detected with the IT system. Hundreds of Bangladeshis feared job losses in Saudi Arabia as they could not manage visas to travel to Saudi Arabia in time. bdn
