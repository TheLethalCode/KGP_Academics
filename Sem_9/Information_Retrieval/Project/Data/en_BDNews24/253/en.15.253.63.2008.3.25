 NEW YORK, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock futures pointed to a higher open on Tuesday ahead of data that could show the housing crisis has ebbed, while financial shares may benefit further from a raised buyout offer for Bear Stearns. Wall Street surged on Monday on news that JPMorgan Chase boosted its offer for Bear fivefold to $10 a share and on a surprise jump in February US existing home sales data. European stocks rose sharply on Tuesday, boosted by gains in the financial sector, which saw the raised buyout offer for Bear Stearns as a signal the credit crisis has bottomed out. "The combination of the Bear Stearns bid ... and just the stability of the market for financials has given confidence to a lot of people," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "Today looks like more of the same with bank rallies in Europe and the rally in Asia." Underlying confidence in the market is still shaky, however, as Monday's data showed the steepest year-on-year drop in home prices since 1968. The S&P 500 stock index has fallen about 8 percent this year, weighed down by a slide in a financial sector battered by the growing impact of the credit crunch on balance sheets. JPMorgan said it expects additional write-downs in Merrill Lynch's mortgage portfolio, and it lowered its earnings forecast for the brokerage. Merrill Lynch said in January that as of the end of 2007, it had about $3.45 billion of exposure to bond insurers for portfolios of asset-backed securities. Meanwhile, major mortgage financier Freddie Mac said the single-family delinquency rate for all home loans rose in January from December. "Things are looking a little better ... but at the same time there is a lot that has got investors unnerved," said Peter Dunay, chief investment strategist at Meridian Partners in New York, adding: "There probably will be some sharp declines ahead as we work out and build this bottom for the financials." Nevertheless, investors were hopeful ahead of a monthly index of US home prices and a gauge of US consumer confidence, which has waned in recent quarters. S&P 500 futures were up 1.40 points, above fair value, a formula to evaluate pricing taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 4 points, and Nasdaq futures gained 6.75 points. Standard & Poor's is due to release the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT), followed by the Conference Board's March index of consumer confidence at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT). Last month's S&P/Case-Shiller data showed housing prices fell the most in the 20-year history of the index in the fourth quarter of 2007 from a year earli
