<TITLE> WFP launches emergency appeal as food costs soar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)The World Food Programme has launched an "extraordinary emergency appeal" to governments to donate at least $500m in the next four weeks to avoid rationing food aid in response to the spiralling cost of food, a report said Monday. The WFP, the United Nations agency responsible for relieving hunger, said in a letter to donor countries that if fresh money did not arrive by May 1, it might cut "the rations for those who rely on the world to stand by them during times of abject need". The Financial Times reported that the letter had been sent to donor countries over the Easter holiday and shows that the threat of a cut in aid is real and imminent after several warnings from the WFP. "We urge your government to be as generous as possible in helping us to close this gap  which stood at $500m on February 25 and has been growing daily," wrote Josette Sheeran, WFP executive director. The WFP's funding gap is now about $600m-$700m, officials said, after a 20 percent jump in food costs in the past three weeks, the rise in the oil price to about $100 a barrel, and a surge in shipping costs. The US is the largest WFP contributor, having donated about $1.1bn last year, mostly in food shipments. The European Union, with $250m, and Canada, with $160m, are the second- and third-largest donors. If the minimum $500m extra funds arrive, the WFP budget is set to rise this year to $3.4bn, about double the $1.7bn the agency spent in 2000. Food prices are rising on a mix of strong demand from developing countries; a rising global population; more frequent floods and droughts caused by climate change; and the biofuel industry's appetite for grains, analysts say. The WFP provides food to about 73m people in nearly 80 countries. The WFP said the unprecedented situation meant some of the world's poorest people faced going hungry. Sheeran said the steadily climbing cost of food means that people are "simply being priced out of food market". Soaring food prices are affecting millions of people across the world, most of all those living on the edge of poverty and hunger. For an organisation entirely dependent on voluntary contributions, the impact of rising food and fuel prices represents nothing less than a global emergency, WFP said in an early report. "Current price rises mean that the world's poorest people will have to spend a larger proportion of their income on food. This may mean they will buy less food, or food that is less nutritious, or they may have to rely on outside help to fulfil their nutritional needs," WFP said. Al Jazeera contributed to the report.
