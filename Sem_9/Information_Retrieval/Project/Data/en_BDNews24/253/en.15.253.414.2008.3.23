<TITLE> Govt to widen rice OMS: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to expand open-market sales of rice (OMS) in the wake of soaring prices of foodstuff, food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said Sunday. As many as 540 dealers have been appointed across the country to sell the staple, he said adding that new dealers were being appointed. A final decision was yet to be taken on how much rice would be sold through OMS. Shawkat Ali also said the expansion of the OMS would not affect the rice stock. "We have a stock of six lakh tonnes of food at the moment. Despite this, the government is importing more," he said. Two dealers were selling the foodstuff through OMS in every upazila and the number of dealers would be raised to three to four. They would be supplied with additional foodstuff, the adviser added. On selling potato with rice through OMS, Shawkat Ali said there were no frozen storehouses to preserve potatoes in many areas of the country, forcing the government to think twice about selling potatoes in open market. The supply of daily essentials to the BDR markets in divisional cities would be boosted as well, the adviser said. The BDR has 200 outlets selling rice, pulse, oil and essentials. bdne
