 Beijing, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tibet authorities have arrested 13 people for taking part in a protest with "reactionary" slogans and a banner on March 10 in the regional capital Lhasa, the Tibet Daily reported on Tuesday. The report said the 13 were among a crowd involved in a demonstration near one of Lhasa's main Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, the report said. The protest came days before rioting shook Lhasa and spread to other areas, killing at least 19 people, according to authorities. The report said the crowd "yelled reactionary slogans and held a self-made banner of snow-mountain lions to gather a crowd and stir up trouble." The lion banner has been used by protesters as a symbol of calls for Tibetan independence. The report did not say whether those arrested were Buddhist monks.
