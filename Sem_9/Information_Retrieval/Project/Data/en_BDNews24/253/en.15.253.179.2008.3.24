 ABIDJAN, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dozens of soldiers shot their guns in the air and took to the streets of Duekoue in western Ivory Coast on Monday after robbers killed one of their comrades, a police officer in the volatile town said. Duekoue, a trading centre for coffee and some cocoa in the top cocoa grower, has long been a hotbed of ethnic tension between locals and immigrant farmers from further north which helped ignite a 2002-3 civil war that split the country in two.

Mamadou Kone, who farms coffee and cocoa on the outskirts of Duekoue, said soldiers had started shooting at around 7 a.m. (0700 GMT). "The town is paralysed; no cars can circulate, the shops are closed and people are staying at home," he said. Duekoue lies on the southern edge of a buffer zone established when fighting subsided and patrolled until last year by United Nations peacekeepers and troops from former colonial power France. The buffer zone was dismantled under a year-old peace plan to disarm fighters from northern rebel and southern government sides, and distribute identity papers to all those entitled to them ahead of long-delayed presidential and parliamentary polls. Among those to be disarmed are thousands of fighters from pro-government militias which have been most active in the west of the country around Duekoue, Guiglo and Toulepleu, near the border with Liberia. President Laurent Gbagbo has set the end of June as a deadline for the elections, in which he is expected to seek a second term in office, but he said this month it would not be a disaster if they had to be delayed a little long
