 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)March 25 should be the officially declared as 'Genocide Day', said participants of a programme Tuesday, in honour of the liberation role of East Pakistan Rifles, now Bangladesh Rifles. The programme was organised by Muktijoddha Gano Parishad at the martyrs' altar of BDR headquarters. Freedom fighter Maj Gen (retd) Amin Ahmed Chowdhury recalled the night of March 25, 1971: "About 150 EPR members became martyrs on that night alone." "During the nine-month long liberation war, about 14,000 EPR members were killed. Their contribution in the liberation war is immense." The dreams of those who participated in the liberation war and sacrificed their lives on the black night of March 25 have not yet materialised, said Muktijoddha Gano Parishad Ishtiaque Aziz Ulfat. "We got a map, a flag but still the people of this country remain starved, half fed." Speaking at the discussion on 'Genocide Day' organised by the parishad at Bangladesh Rifles headquarters, he said, people still dreamt of a happy, prosperous Bangladesh. "On the night of March 25, 1971, the then EPR members built up resistance against the Pakistani occupation forces," Ishtiaque recalled. "Many of the young generation do not know this history. He said the state should take initiatives to tell them, remind them, of the real history." Language movement hero Abdul Matin, expressing his frustration, said: "The country is not stable at all. No government till now has tried the war criminals." "The evil forces must be eliminated from the society at any cost. Otherwise there will be no development in the country." The present government is ambivalent regarding trial of the war criminals, Matin said. "However, if the government does not try them common people will." At the start of the function floral wreaths were offered at the martyrs' altar paying respect to the martyred freedom fighters including the EPR members killed on March 25, 1971. Freedom fighter Kamol Siddiqui Bir Uttam, chairman of the Genocide Day Observance Committee Shahid Bablu, families of 1971 martyrs and people from all walks of life attended Tuesday's programme in honour of EPR heroes. bdnew
