 DOHA, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Qatar are banking on their strikers to upset Asian champions Iraq in their Asian zone World Cup Group One qualifier in the Qatari capital on Wednesday. Qatar, the Asian Games champions, lost their first group match 3-0 to Australia while Iraq were held to a 1-1 draw by China. The optimism of Qatar coach Jorge Fossati stems from the fact that his attack will be bolstered by the return from injury of naturalised Uruguayan striker Sebastian Soria and the inclusion of in-form forward Marcio Emerson, a naturalised Brazilian. "Some of my key players will be back for the Iraq match. After our defeat to Australia we had more than a month's time to prepare for this match. We played two friendlies, against Bahrain and Jordan, and our confidence is high," Uruguayan Fossati told reporters. The Qatar coach said former Asian Player of the Year Khalfan Ibrahim was doubtful. "Khalfan's chances of playing are 50-50. But Sebastian is likely to start," Fossati said. "I see no reason why we should not defeat Iraq. We are playing at home and, with all due respects to our opponents, it should be advantageous to us," Fossati said. Iraq's hopes will be carried by captain and key striker Younis Mahmoud, who plays for Qatari champions Al Gharafa Sports Club in the Q-League. He has not fully recovered from an injury suffered in the match against China last month. Iraq will also miss the influential Nashat Akram who is suspended for the Doha clash after getting two yellow cards. "It's difficult to predict the outcome of the match," Iraq coach Adnan Hamad said. "We are in a difficult group and the draw against China makes it more difficult for us.
