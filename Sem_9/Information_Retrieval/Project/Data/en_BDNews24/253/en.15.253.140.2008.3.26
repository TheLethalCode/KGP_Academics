 GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States should be more forceful in speaking out against the violence in Tibet, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday, while declining to call for a boycott of the Olympic Games in China. "I think that what's happening in Tibet is deeply troubling, and this is a pattern of the Chinese government with respect to their treatment of Tibet," she told reporters after a campaign event in Pennsylvania. "I don't think we should wait until the Olympics to make sure that our views are known," Clinton said, while saying she did not have an opinion now on whether the US team should not go to the games. Clinton said President George W Bush's administration should be more forceful about the Tibet issue. "I think we should be speaking out through our administration now in a much more forceful way and, you know, supporting people in Tibet who are trying to preserve their culture and their religion from tremendous pressure by the Chinese." Reports on Tuesday said at least two people died in fresh protests in a Tibetan part of western China as authorities made arrests in Tibet's capital Lhasa in an effort to reassert control over the region
