 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com) Newly elected FBCCI president Annisul Huq took over his new post Monday with a vow to work for the economic development of the country. "We have taken over the responsibility of FBCCI at a sensitive time for the country in terms of politics and economy," the new president said in the handover ceremony of the newly elected representatives at the FBCCI building at Motijheel. The Annisul Huq-led panel won a big-margin victory to the governing body of FBCCI in its biennial election on March 17, gaining the posts of president, first vice president and vice president. Annisul, a former BGMEA president, said: "The country is going through a state of emergency. Prices of essentials are skyrocketing." Annisul said businessmen were the engine of the country: "Around three crore people are connected with business in Bangladesh. "The businessmen have been losing faith and investment has been gradually decreasing." But, he added, the government had taken initiatives to improve the situation. "We will work with utmost sincerity so that the economic conditions can recover their potential," he said. Outgoing FBCCI administrator Syed Manzur Elahi transferred posts to new president Annisul Huq, first vice president Abul Kashem Ahmed and vice president Abu Alam Chowdhury. "FBCCI is facing a big challenge in the era of globalization," Elahi said. "I hope the new team will be able to handle the challenge if they work through mutual cooperation." bdnew
