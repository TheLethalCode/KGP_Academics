 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has decided to transfer a number of services from the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation to the private sector as part of the initiative to develop the country's tourism industry, the BPC chairman said Monday. "We want to encourage domestic and foreign organisations involved with the industry to further develop Bangladesh's tourism," Parjatan chairman Shafique Alam Mehdi said at a discussion meeting at the BPC office in Tejgaon. "We will hand over hotels, motels and transport now under the BPC to private sectors," he said, admitting the shortcomings of the corporation. "However, the caretaker government will enact an ordinance by December this year in order to reinforce Parjatan," Mehdi said. Two committees are working in this regard, he added. He asked people to vote for Cox's Bazar and the Sundarbans to attain positions on the list of the seven natural wonders of the world. "The corporation will arrange a voting system by Internet for that purpose," the Parjatan chief said. The tourism industries and travel agencies in Bangladesh should be registered in order to reach acknowledged international standards, Mehdi said. There are numerous natural sights in Bangladesh apart from the Cox's Bazar sea beach, Sundarbans, Ramsagar Dighi in Rangpur and Moynamoti in Comilla, he said. "The Parjatan Corporation is operating surveys to identify those spots." Mehdi said the government would work to ease immigration complications and visa procedures so that foreign tourists could travel more easily to Bangladesh. On corruption within the state-run corporation he said the concerned authorities would take action against any and all officials who had practised corruption in the last 35 years. bdnews
