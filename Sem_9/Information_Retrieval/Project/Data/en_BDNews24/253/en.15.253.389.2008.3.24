 LISBON, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani have been ruled out of Portugal's Euro 2008 warm-up with Greece in Duesseldorf, Germany on Wednesday due to injuries, the Portuguese Football Federation said on Monday. Ronaldo and Nani, who both scored in United's 3-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday, are suffering from leg muscle problems, the federation said on its Web site (www.fpf.pt). "We proposed to coach (Luiz Felipe Scolari) that the players be released from the squad and he accepted," squad doctor Henrique Jones was quoted as saying. No replacements were named. Portugal are in Group A with Czech Republic, co-hosts Switzerland and Turkey in the Euro 2008 finals in June
