<TITLE> Litvinenko widow wants jury to get police evidence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The widow of poisoned Russian emigre Alexander Litvinenko wants an inquest into his death to be held before a jury and examine the evidence gathered by British police, her lawyer said on Tuesday. Marina Litvinenko filed a formal request last Friday to resume a London inquest that opened after her husband's death in November 2006 but adjourned while police conducted a murder investigation, in a case which badly hurt Anglo-Russian ties. Given Russia's refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoy, who British prosecutors suspect of poisoning Litvinenko with radioactive polonium, she believes there will be no trial and wants police to disclose for the first time the evidence uncovered in their investigations. "Clearly the inquest would be meaningless unless that happens," her lawyer Louise Christian told Reuters. In a letter to the London coroner in charge of the inquest, Christian said it should resume as soon as possible and examine evidence that Marina Litvinenko believes shows the Russian state's involvement in the poisoning. Russia strongly denies deathbed accusations by Litvinenko that he was murdered on the orders of President Vladimir Putin. Litvinenko, a former officer in the KGB and FSB security services, had become an outspoken Kremlin critic and protege of exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky, whom Moscow accuses of financial crimes and coup-plotting. Anglo-Russian relations plunged into crisis last year when Moscow refused a British request to hand over Lugovoy, another former KGB man, who denies killing Litvinenko. Each side kicked out four of the other's diplomats in a Cold War-style exchange. An inquest would attract huge publicity and could make it harder for the two sides to quietly draw a line under the affair, hampering prospects for a thaw in relations under Russia's president-elect Dmitry Medvedev. MEDVEDEV INTERVIEW In an interview with the Financial Times, published on Tuesday, Medvedev said Moscow was "open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent", but "time will show" if this could be achieved. Christian told Reuters the inquest should take place before a jury because issues of public safety were at stake. The episode sparked a major health alert as traces of radioactive polonium were found at restaurants, offices, on planes and even at Arsenal's soccer stadium. Over 750 people were tested for exposure to the rare element. More than 130 were found to have come into contact with it, but only 17 -- including Marina Litvinenko -- at levels that might slightly increase their long-term cancer risk. Mrs Litvinenko and her supporters believe it can be proven forensically that the polonium was manufactured at a top-security state laboratory in Russia, and that this would strengthen their charge of official complicity. She told Reuters late on Monday she had decided to pursue the inquest because there was no chance of extraditing Lugovoy. "We just need this justice ... I just need to feel one day we will receive this truth," she said. An official at the St Pancras coroner's court in London said it had not yet received her request, noting that postal and public services had been closed over the Easter holiday weekend. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said police would hand over any information sought by the coroner, but declined further comme
