<TITLE> Steyn aims to build on consistency in India series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The key to retaining his vein of good form in India will be consistency, South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn said on Monday. The 24-year-old is on a hot streak after grabbing 14 wickets in the 2-0 rout of Bangladesh this month, becoming the quickest South African to reach the 100-wicket mark. Steyn was the architect of South Africa's success in their last three test series, taking altogether 54 scalps with pace, swing and accuracy to claim the man-of-the-series award each time. He can emulate compatriot Allan Donald, instrumental in ending India's 13-year unbeaten streak in home test series in 2000, and help South Africa achieve an Asian treble after wins in Pakistan, late last year, and Bangladesh. "Once you find the recipe for success it's best to stick to it, so I won't be changing much," Steyn told reporters after practice for the first test which begins on Wednesday. "It's worked so far so hopefully I can take that form into this test match and the whole tour. "I'm under no pressure," he added. "That's been the beautiful thing about the season so far. "(Captain) Graeme Smith has never put me under any pressure. I've been given the ball to do a job and I've been fortunate enough to be able to do it." Steyn said he wanted to model himself on compatriot Shaun Pollock and Australia's Glenn McGrath, whose success was due to consistency. "End of the day, guys like Polly (Pollock) and McGrath have shown that you don't really need to have the speed to become the world's best bowler. It is where you bowl the ball that counts. "They have led by example, I can take what they used, line and length, and then add the speed into it. "Maybe then you can become an even better bowler.
