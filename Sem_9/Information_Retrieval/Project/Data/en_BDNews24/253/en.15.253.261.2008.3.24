<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  The knitwear sector is likely to bring in $5.4 billion in earnings for the current fiscal year, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Fazlul Hoque said Monday. Knitwear has been the main sector in exports for the last one year, claimed Hoque, who was elected president of BKMEA for a third term in the March 22 polls. Hoque told bdnews24.com that the knitwear sector had grown by 69 percent in 2007 and earned $4.5 billion in foreign currency in the last fiscal year. "Our target is $5.4 billion for the current fiscal year," he said. Hoque hoped that Bangladesh would surpass China within years in knitwear exports if the sector continued to grow at the current pace. "The government's help is necessary to develop the knitwear industry further," he said. He stressed interest rate cuts on loans, creating a knitwear village and the need for making the process of bond licensing easy. "Some problems the sector is now facing should be solved immediately," he emphasised. bdnew
