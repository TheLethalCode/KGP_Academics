 TRIPOLI, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An organisation led by a son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi denied on Sunday that it was negotiating the release of two Austrians believed held by al Qaeda in north Africa. The Gaddafi Foundation charity was responding to a report by Carinthia governor Joerg Haider on Saturday that its chairman Saif al-Islam was in touch with the kidnappers in Mali to try to obtain the release of the hostages. "Gaddafi Foundation affirms that it has not undertaken any measures or efforts or contacts, whether direct or indirect, with the kidnappers despite the Foundation, and its chairman, having received several demands to do so."

Austria has launched an intense diplomatic campaign to try to obtain the release of Andrea Kloiber, 43, and Wolfgang Ebner, 51, sending a diplomatic envoy to the Malian capital Bamako and seeking the help of regional states like Libya. The Austrian envoy in Bamako, Anton Prohaska, said on Saturday he remained hopeful the two would be freed unharmed. Mali's government has been trying to help Austria obtain the release of the two tourists. Local military sources believe they are being held at a Saharan Islamist hideout in Mali's remote northeast region of Kidal that borders with Algeria and Niger.
