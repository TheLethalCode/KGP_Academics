<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Bar Association Monday deferred its elections by one month to April 28-29, in the face of a government ban, a candidate for SCBA president said. Khandakar Mahbub Hossain told bdnews24.com that SCBA president Amir-ul Islam had signed a MoU with law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and attorney general Fida M Kamal. "The MoU states that the elections will be held on April 28-29. The misunderstanding between the government and SCBA has been resolved," he said. The elections were originally scheduled to begin at 10.00am Monday. Attorney general Fida M Kamal replying to reporters in his office on the deferment of the election said: "Only the date of voting has been changed. No new permission from the government will be necessary then. The charge of the executive committee of the association will be handed over in April." Asked whether the government piled pressure on the SCBA to defer the election, he said: "The government did not mount any pressure for deferring the election." Asked why the election was deferred, another president candidate, barrister Shafique Ahmed, who was present at a conciliatory meeting between the government and SCBA, said: "It took time to reach a consensus on the basis of discussion. That's why the date of the voting has been shifted." "The government side is satisfied that the election did not violate the emergency powers rules. The government has also accepted the election code of conduct." Barrister Shafique Ahmed said: "The election is necessary for the Bar to work as a subsidiary force for protecting the independence of the judiciary." Following a morning meeting, SCBA president Amir-ul Islam, convenor Nizamul Haque Nasim and election candidates tried to resolve the election stalemate through consultation with the government. The government Sunday imposed a ban under emergency powers rules on the elections to the Supreme Court Bar Association, but lawyers vowed to press on as scheduled. An order signed by Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional deputy commissioner Shamsunnahar asked the association to refrain from holding the polls, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. The order, sent to SCBA secretary AM Aminuddin, said that no permission had been sought from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police for the elections, which the DMP said was necessary in line with emergency powers rules. bdnews24.com
