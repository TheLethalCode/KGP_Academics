 SEOUL, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's ruling party chief pleaded on Monday for unity around President Lee Myung-bak's economic agenda as the party struggled to avert a break-up ahead of a parliamentary election about two weeks away. Lee, in office for a month, has seen his popularity dwindle and is desperate for his conservative Grand National Party to gain a majority in the liberal-controlled assembly to pass sweeping reforms aimed at reviving the world's 13th largest economy.

Public opinion polls last week showed GNP candidates in some traditional conservative strongholds struggling to keep their lead, with some nominees trailing breakaway former members or opposition candidates. Lee has outlined an ambitious set of policy initiatives that called for streamlining government and rolling back regulations he feels stifle business. He wants Asia's fourth-largest economy to grow by 6 percent a year. Analysts said a solid GNP victory in April would also help the passage through South Korea's parliament of an ambitious free trade pact Seoul reached with Washington.
