 MORONI, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troops from the Indian Ocean archipelago nation of Comoros seized control of the rebel island of Anjouan on Tuesday after a seaborne assault backed by the African Union, government officials said. The forces attacked at dawn to topple self-declared leader Mohamed Bacar, a French-trained former gendarme who seized power in 2001 and clung on after an illegal election last year on the wooded, hilly island of 300,000 people. "Anjouan island is under total control of the army," Major Ahmed Sidi told reporters at a joint press conference with the African Union on the neighbouring island of Moheli. "So far we have no dead or wounded to lament. The rebel chiefs have all run away, and none has yet been found." With phone connections cut, there was no independent confirmation or news of rebel leader Bacar's whereabouts. A government spokesman said he was believed to have dressed up as a woman and to be trying to escape by boat to the nearby French-run island of Mayotte. Anjouan is one of three islands in the coup-prone archipelago that won independence from France in 1975. The total population of the spice and perfume producing islands is about 700,000. A presidential official said about 400 AU troops joined the initial assault. The bloc had sent a total force of about 1,350. Analysts say the African Union is hoping to secure a relatively easy victory in Anjouan to earn some international prestige to offset the struggles of its peacekeeping missions in Sudan and Somalia. Others say the tough AU stance on Anjouan, which tried to break away from the other islands in 1997, reflects its aversion to any secessionist moves on a continent where borders were often drawn arbitrarily by colonial masters. The central government accuses Bacar of secessionist aspirations, although he maintains he is fighting for more autonomy rather than independence. ELECTION PROMISE A statement said Comoros President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, an Islamist businessman, was committed to holding new elections on Anjouan as soon as possible. Lying off Africa's east coast, the Comoros islands -- which grow vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang, a flower whose oils are used in aromatherapy -- were first settled by Arab seafarers 1,000 years ago, then later became a pirate haven. A Comoros government spokesman said troops quickly occupied Anjouan's capital Mutsamudu and two other towns, Domoni and Ouani, after arriving by boat at dawn. A statement said there was "a brief clash" in Ouani, while Mutsamudu fell "after a short exchange of fire." In Domoni, "there are scenes of fraternisation between the population and the Sudanese troops," it added. Government spokesman Bacar said troops were at the door of the Anjouan leader's village home in Barakani near the capital. "Some of the soldiers have been given orders to look for him," he said. "(But) we know that during these past months he didn't sleep in his home. He was afraid." Anjouan inhabitants could hear gunfire and explosions from early morning, said Aboulatuf Mohamed, a former resident speaking to people there by satellite phone. "The assault began at 4 a.m. (0100 GMT). In Domoni, the army has taken the town. The airport and the port have been taken also," said Mohamed, vice-president of a local rights group. After suffering some 20 coups or coup attempts since independence, Comoros is trying to shrug off a history of instabili
