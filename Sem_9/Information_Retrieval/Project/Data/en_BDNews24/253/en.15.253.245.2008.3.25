 BASRA, Iraq, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi security forces fought fierce gunbattles with powerful Shia militias in Basra on Tuesday in a major operation aimed at bringing the southern oil city under government control. Police and health workers said at least 12 people were killed in the fighting in districts of central and northern Basra where the Mehdi Army militia of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has a strong presence. The Mehdi Army, which has thousands of fighters, has kept a relatively low profile since Sadr called a ceasefire last August. But the militia has chafed at the truce and on Tuesday there were signs that the unrest was spreading. Sadr threatened a countrywide "civil revolt" if attacks on the Mehdi Army continued, and police sources said his supporters had seized control of five districts of the southern Iraqi town of Kut. In Baghdad, Sadr followers ordered police and soldiers off the streets of his Sadr City stronghold and smoke could be seen over the Green Zone after an apparent mortar or rocket attack. In Basra, a Reuters witness reported seeing columns of black smoke and hearing explosions and machinegun fire. Television pictures showed Iraqi troops running through empty streets and helicopters flying overhead. "There are clashes in the streets. Bullets are coming from everywhere and we can hear the sound of rocket explosions. This has been going on since dawn," resident Jamil told Reuters by telephone as he cowered in his home. Police imposed curfews in the southern towns of Kut, Hilla and Samawa, capital of Muthanna province. In Sadr City, a sprawling slum of about 2 million people, residents said armed Mehdi Army fighters had appeared on the streets and ordered police and soldiers out of the district. Police said fighting erupted in several Sadr City neighbourhoods between Mehdi Army fighters and the Badr Organisation, the armed wing of a rival Shi'ite faction. In several other districts, Mehdi Army militiamen continued what they called a "civil disobedience campaign", forcing shops to shut. Hundreds of protesters marched in two districts demanding the release of Sadrists in detention, witnesses said. In a statement read out by a senior aide on Tuesday, Sadr called on Iraqis to stage sit-ins all over Iraq and said he would declare a "civil revolt" if attacks by U.S. and Iraqi security forces continued. He also threatened a "third step", but said it was to early to announce what it would be. An Iraqi army commander in Basra told Reuters "many outlaws" had been killed in the operation to reassert government control over the semi-lawless city, whose surrounding oilfields hold 80 percent of Iraq's oil wealth. Two ambulance drivers said they had transported eight bodies to Basra's Sadr Education hospital. A police major at al-Mawana hospital said four bodies and 18 wounded had been received. MALIKI IN BASRA "These operations are not targeting the Sadr party. There is a campaign to disarm unauthorised weapons and there are no exceptions at this point," Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Al Arabiya television. "The government is determined to hit with an iron fist anyone using weapons and threatening citizens," he said. But analysts said the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who was in Basra to oversee the operation, would struggle to overcome the militias. "It will be very difficult for the central government to regain control," said Joost Hiltermann, an Istanbul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group think-tank. "You have many armed groups that are looking to keep hold of their share of the oil wealth." Sadrists and the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, the two most powerful Shi'ite factions in Iraq, have been vying for control of Basra along with a smaller Shi'ite party, Fadhila, which controls key oil industry jobs in Basra. Basra's oil fields are the source of most government revenues. Iraqi oil industry sources said the fields, which exported 1.54 million barrels of oil per day in February, were operating normally on Tuesday. "We are ready to negotiate," said Harith al-Ithari, the head of Sadr's office in Basra, calling for calm and accusing Maliki's government of trying to crush the Sadrist movement. The British military said no British ground forces were involved in the operation, but warplanes from the US-led coalition were carrying out aerial surveillance. Iraqi security forces took control of Basra from British forces in December, although 4,100 British troops remain at an airbase outside the city to offer assistance if need
