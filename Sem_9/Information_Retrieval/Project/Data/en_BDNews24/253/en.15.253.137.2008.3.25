<TITLE> South Africa ready for challenging season, says Smith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Winning the test series in India would be the perfect start to a challenging season which includes tough tours of England and Australia, South Africa captain Graeme Smith said on Tuesday. "It is the start of what is basically the three biggest challenges in world cricket, all away from home," Smith told reporters ahead of Wednesday's first test. "We're really looking forward to playing our brand of cricket and executing it in the next five days." South Africa, aiming for their third straight series win in the sub-continent after defeating Pakistan and Bangladesh, were prepared to counter the humidity and a slow Chennai pitch, the left-handed opener said. He said the tourists had to work hard in Pakistan for their 1-0 win and the experience would help the team in India. "I think you got to have the team capable of winning series' away from home. I believe we have that. "We're a confident team at the moment. This Indian team is one of the better teams they've had, very experienced and wonderful players." Smith has been in good form with the bat, setting a world record opening partnership of 415 with Neil McKenzie in the second test against Bangladesh this month. "One of the toughest jobs around is to open the batting and captain," he said. "I'm feeling good with the bat, had a really good run this season. I'd just like to make that count." Smith warned India that in-form paceman Dale Steyn, who took 14 wickets in the 2-0 rout of Bangladesh, would be a big threat. "Our whole attack has done well, allowed Steyn to bowl the way he does," Smith said of the 24-year-old. "The thing about Dale is he's really motivated. And one or two Indian batsmen have made comments about him that have motivated him a bit more." South Africa rallied to beat India 2-1 at home early in 2007 and Smith said his bowlers had once again done their homework to counter India's formidable batting line up. The tourists are likely to include left-arm Paul Harris as the lone spinner alongside pacers Makhaya Ntini, Morne Morkel, Steyn and all rounder Jacques Kalli
