<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has shifted its election to 2pm Monday, in the face of a government ban order, a member of the SCBA election sub-committee said. AKM Abdul Hakim told reporters Monday they had shifted the polls from the earlier reported time in the face of the government embargo. SCBA election sub-committee convenor Nizamul Haque Nasim had earlier told reporters that the polls would start at 11.30am. Following a morning meeting, SCBA president Amir Ul Islam, convenor Nizamul Haque Nasim and election candidates left to resolve the election stalemate through consultation. The polls were originally scheduled to begin at 10.00 am Monday morning. The government Sunday imposed a ban under emergency powers rules on the election to the Supreme Court Bar Association, but lawyers vowed to press on as scheduled. An order signed by Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional deputy commissioner Shamsunnahar asked the association to refrain from holding the polls, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. The order, sent to the Supreme Court Bar Association secretary AM Aminuddin, said that no permission had been sought from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police for the election, which the DMP said was necessary in line with emergency powers rules. The SCBA rushed a meeting and its president barrister Amir-ul Islam said they would hold the election on schedule. Announcing the decision on behalf of the lawyers, barrister Amir said the election committee would take the decision on how the polls would be held. "There is no legal barrier to holding the election. The government can obstruct assemblies, rallies and processions. But we are not holding an assembly or a rally." "We will simply cast ballots wherever the election commission keeps the ballot box," he said. He urged chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda to observe the election process. SCBA has arranged transparent ballot boxes to ensure transparency in the polls. Barrister Amir said the government should not do anything, which amounts to obstructing an independent judiciary. "Intervening in the independence of the Bar means interfering with the independence of the judiciary," he said. Those who attended the meeting at the South Hall of the association included barrister Shafique Ahmed, advocate Khandker Mahbub Hossain, secretary candidate barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, barrister Badruddoza Badal and other election candidates and lawyers. bdnews24.com
