 LONDON, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hard-pressed consumers are being forced to ditch retirement savings to meet the soaring cost of living, a survey showed on Monday. A tenth of people saving for their retirement -- almost 2.4 million Britons -- say they will have to stop or reduce contributions in the next 12 months due to the worsening economic outlook.

Director of corporate affairs Charlotte Black said: "Given tighter credit conditions, it seems likely that pension payment breaks will become increasingly prevalent as the immediate pressures of servicing mortgages and dealing with credit card debts take their toll. "This will result in a further depletion of pension pots that have already suffered by the government's decision in 1997 to remove tax credits on dividends in pension funds." She warned that even the "shortest" payment break could have "serious consequences" for income in retirement. A 32-year-old man aiming to retire at 58 and saving 400 pounds per month into his pension fund could expect to have a total pension pot of 791,760 pounds in 2034. A payment break of just a year would save him 4,800 pounds now, but could cut the final pension pot to 756,201 pounds -- an eventual loss of 35,559 pounds.
