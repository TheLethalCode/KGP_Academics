 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)  A six-member delegation of the German Parliament arrived in Dhaka Wednesday on a four-day official visit to discuss economic cooperation between the two nations, an official statement said. Parliamentarian Thilo Hoppe is heading the delegation of the Committee for Economic Cooperation and Development of the German Bundestag (German Parliament), the statement by the Germany Embassy in Dhaka said. It said the parliamentarians would hold talks with caretaker advisers, representatives of various non-governmental organisations and human rights watchdogs, donors and major political parties. Mujtoba Ahmed Murshed, press and political adviser of the German Embassy, told bdnews24.com by phone that the mission would basically hold talks on economic cooperation. "But they will sit with politicians of major political parties," Murshed said. "In that case the embassy would not make any statement on the talks with the politicians," he said. The delegation will meet foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam and Economic Relations Division secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan Thursday. In the evening, they will sit with the politicians, Murshed said.
