 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A better-than-expected German business sentiment report helped lift the euro and European stocks on Wednesday, but ongoing worries about the world's biggest economy kept the dollar under pressure. A weakening greenback helped fuel interest in a range of commodities such as oil and gold that had sold off recently. Global demand for many commodities is seen remaining intact thanks to booming economies such as China despite a softer US outlook. German corporate sentiment improved in March as firms took a more optimistic view of the economic situation, according to a closely watched report from the Ifo institute, helping lift some of the gloom surrounding the global economy. "This is the third consecutive month that the Ifo has come out on the strong side of expectations," said Audrey Childe Freeman European economist at CIBC World Markets. "It sort of backs up a continued decoupling story for Germany and the euro zone as a whole," she said, adding that it also supported views that the ECB would not cut rates soon. The Ifo economic research institute said its business climate index, based on a poll of around 7,000 firms, rose to 104.8 from 104.1 in February -- easing investors' flight to safety and knocking safe-haven euro zone government bonds off early highs. The report came a day after US consumer confidence fell to a five-year low in March, while a separate US report revealed a record drop in home values in January, raising concerns Americans are tightening their purse strings.. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares pared early losses and briefly popped into positive territory before edging 0.2 percent lower. Germany's DAX was flat, while London's FTSE 100 index shed 0.3 percent. Swiss miner Xtrata was among the biggest losers, shedding about 9 percent, after takeover talks with the world's largest iron ore miner Vale broke down. Just a day earlier, European stocks had risen about 3 percent with banks in the lead after JPMorgan raised its offer to buy rival Bear Stearns five-fold, helping ease worries about a sector hit by the credit crunch. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.3 percent, but MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets added 0.6 percent. MSCI world equity index edged up 0.2 percent. DOLLAR SOFTER The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies, struggling amid ongoing concerns about the health of the US economy. The dollar index fell 0.6 percent, while the euro rose half a US cent on the back of the Ifo report to around $1.5646. Among government bonds, the 10-year Bund yield was little changed at 3.872 percent, while the benchmark 10-year yield for US Treasuries lost 2.4 basis points to 3.517 percent. US light crude for May delivery climbed 73 cents to $101.94, while gold edged up to $940.50 an ounce from around $934.60 an ounce late in New York on Tuesday
