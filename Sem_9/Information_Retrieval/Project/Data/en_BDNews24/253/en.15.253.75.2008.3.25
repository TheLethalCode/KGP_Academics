 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court will resume proceedings against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and five others on April 9 in a graft case involving the purchase of MiG-29 fighter planes. Judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder, of the Special Divisional Judges' Court, on Tuesday ordered the accused to appear before the court that day. The Appellate Division on March 18 upheld an earlier High Court verdict against Hasina's petition to halt the trial of the case in the lower court. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official with the now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the case on Dec 11, 2001, accusing Hasina of corruption in the purchase of the war planes during her term as prime minister. According to the case documents, the state treasury lost Tk 700 crore on the back of the 1999 deal. The other accused in the case are former air force chief Jamaluddin Ahmed, former army chief Mostafizur Rahman, former defence secretary Syed Yousuf Hossain, former joint defence secretary Mohammad Hossain Serniabat, former air commodore Mirza Akhter Maruf and Unique Group managing director Noor Ali. bdnews24
