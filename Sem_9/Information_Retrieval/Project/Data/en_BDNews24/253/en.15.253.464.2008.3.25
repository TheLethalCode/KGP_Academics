<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Ten hockey players Tuesday asked the Bangladesh Hockey Federation to release them from the national team after they failed to secure club places this season on the last day of the three-day player transfers. "In total ten players submitted separate letters to the federation asking the game's governing body to release them from the national fold for personal reasons," national playmaker Shahidullah Titu, who is one of the players, told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The BHF had earlier announced a 26-member pool, allowing each club to rope in a maximum of six players from the pool quota at the Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. Title contenders Abahani Limited and Mohammedan SC each signed up their maximum six pool players, while Sonali Bank recruited three players from the pool list. The remaining 11 players from the pool failed to join any club, as giants Usha Krira Chakra and Mariners decided against signing any pool players this season. "We will also resign from the national team in a couple of days, as we have some obligations at the club," said national medio and pool player Ehsan Rana, who signed for Abahani Limited. National goalkeeper and pool player Rasel Khan Bappi, who will also play for Abahani this year, said that they would announce their next course of action in a few days. BHF general secretary Sajed AA Adel said: "The federation can do nothing as the clubs have introduced the pool system through the league committee." "All clubs should be responsible for this failure," said Adel, adding that the players should announce a boycott of the league or player transfers instead of seeking their release from the national team. "I can assure you that I will sit with the players to solve the matter as well as talking to the respective clubs," said Adel, who is also general secretary of Mohammedan hockey team committee. Players who did not take part in the transfer are now being considered as still playing for their previous clubs. "How it is possible for a pool player to play for a club in exchange of just TK 75,000 this time, where he signed up for Tk 3.5 lakh last season," said a national player seeking anonymity. Last season's joint-champions Usha Krira Chakra backtracked from their decision to fulfil the pool quota Monday night despite confirming their players from last year's pool. Mariners Young Club general secretary Alamgir Kabir said that they have just formed a simple team following their financial crisis. "Why would a club spend money forming a strong team when no teams will be relegated this year," said an Ajax SC official. Ten players who failed to join any club are Jahid Hossain, Mahbubullah Shakil, Shamsuddin Tuhin, Mostafizur Rahman Dinar, Tabib A Noor, Khandokar Hasan Ahmed, Shahidullah Titu, Rahul Kanti Roy, Jahidul Islam Rajon and Maksud Alam Habul. bdn
