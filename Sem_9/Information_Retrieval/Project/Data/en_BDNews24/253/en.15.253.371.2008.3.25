<TITLE> Kuwait grills former MPs over Hezbollah ceremony </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kuwait, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kuwait's prosecutor questioned two Shi'ite Muslim former lawmakers, a lawyer said on Tuesday, over their participation in a ceremony that has highlighted sectarian tensions in the mainly Sunni Muslim country. Sayyed Adnan Abdul-Samad and Ahmad Lari were among prominent Shi'ite figures who angered the government for taking part in a memorial ceremony for Imad Moughniyah, a leader of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group, who was assassinated last month in Syria. The questioning was made possible after the two men lost their parliamentary immunity earlier this month when the ruler of the Gulf Arab state dissolved parliament following the government's resignation and called for new elections. The prosecutor earlier this month asked parliament to lift the immunity of the two politicians. "They are being questioned by the prosecution," attorney Abdul-Karim Haidar told Reuters, without giving further details. Kuwait, where one in every three nationals is Shi'ite, has accused Moughniyah of involvement in the hijacking of a Kuwait Airways plane in 1988 and the killing of two passengers. Interior Minister Sheikh Jaber Khaled al-Sabah and four lawyers filed a lawsuit last month against the two MPs after the ceremony. Before the dissolution, Abdul-Samad has said he may seek to question Sheikh Jaber over the arrest of Shi'ites for holding the memorial. Abdul-Samad said then that the minister was accusing him and his colleague of belonging to a Hezbollah-style Kuwaiti group accused of trying to destabilise the country. Several other prominent Shi'ites were also questioned after the ceremony. Moughniyah was wanted by the United States and Israel for his role in a string of kidnappings, hijackings and attacks targets that killed hundreds in the 1980s and early 1990s. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the assassination, but Israel said denied any involvement. Tension between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims has been on the rise in the Middle East since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 empowered Iraq's Shi'ite majority and increased the influence of Shi'ite Iran.
