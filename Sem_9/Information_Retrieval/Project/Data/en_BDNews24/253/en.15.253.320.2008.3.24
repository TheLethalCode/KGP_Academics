 BEIJING, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese dissident Yang Chunlin, who called for human rights to take precedence over the Olympic Games, has been sentenced to five years in jail on charges of inciting subversion, his family and lawyer said on Monday. The unemployed factory worker from the northeastern city of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang province went on trial in February after he helped nearby villagers issue a petition about disputed land last year that declared: "We don't want the Olympics, we want human rights."

China's leadership is hoping the Games, which start in Beijing on Aug. 8 will showcase the country's economic prosperity and social unity.
