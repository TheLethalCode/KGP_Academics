<TITLE> Zimbabwe not to force price cuts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's government has told businesses it will not try to impose pre-election price cuts in the inflation-ravaged country despite President Robert Mugabe's campaign threats to do so, business leaders said on Tuesday. Mugabe, facing his toughest election battle since coming to power in 1980 because of economic crisis and ruling party defections, had told a campaign rally on Monday he would push for cuts in prices, the state-run Herald said. But a government team met business leaders on Tuesday and while raising concerns over soaring prices, said there would be no forced cuts, Zimbabwe's main business group said. "We have been fully re-assured that there is no price blitz coming," Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president Callisto Jokonya told a briefing when asked about Mugabe's comments. "The situation as it is at the moment is about elections." Prices of milk, bread and other key goods have been rising weekly, especially since a June 2007 government edict to cut prices led to panic buying, prompted storeowners to stop stocking shelves and worsened a food crisis in what was once one of Africa's top agricultural producers. Some companies have not recovered from the price crackdown, which was intended to arrest soaring inflation -- currently above 100,000 percent and the highest rate in the world. The Herald said Mugabe wanted prices reversed to Feb. 12 levels when teachers and state workers were awarded pay rises. The business leaders told the government they would keep prices at March 18 levels. Mugabe says price increases are part of a plot to force voters to turn against his ruling ZANU-PF in the March 29 presidential, parliamentary and municipal elections. US VOICES CONCERN His critics say the former liberation war hero has mismanaged Zimbabwe's economy and is bereft of solutions to end the crisis in a country whose economy was once one of the strongest in Africa. "We want them (businesses) to reduce prices to those which were in effect before the salary hikes," Mugabe told a campaign rally on Monday in Hwange, a town in northwestern Zimbabwe. "We are going to read the riot act to them," Mugabe said. Analysts said such a move would only further fuel inflation. "Rolling back prices will see a massive rise in inflation," Tony Hawkins, professor of business studies at the University of Zimbabwe, said. "Government domestic debt has risen 65 times in a couple of weeks, which is what is driving prices." Opponents accuse ZANU-PF of trying to buy the election. Equipment has been handed out to poor black farmers and public buses have been christened at pro-Mugabe rallies. The government is expected this week to give 400 new vehicles to doctors who have been striking to protest work conditions. In Washington, the US State Department voiced concern about reports of violence toward Zimbabwe's opposition parties, inaccurate voter rolls, bias by government-controlled media and politicized distribution of government-controlled food. "We are concerned that actions of the Zimbabwean government will preclude free and fair elections," US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a written statement. "We call on the government ... to take concrete actions to address these significant shortcomings." Asked what were the chances of Zimbabwe having a free and fair election, McCormack told reporters: "The situation doesn't look promising." The 84-year-old Mugabe is being challenged by former ruling party finance minister Simba Makoni, running as an independent, and rival Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main faction of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). All candidates are promising to end the severe economic crisis, marked by high unemployment and chronic shortages. Zimbabwe's agricultural sector, once the cornerstone of its economy, has been decimated since 2000 when Mugabe's government began seizing thousands of white-owned commercial farms and redistributing them to poor blacks. The MDC accuses Mugabe of planning to fix the election
