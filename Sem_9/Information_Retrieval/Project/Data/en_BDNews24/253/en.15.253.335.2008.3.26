 WELLINGTON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji's post-coup government needs to accelerate work to ensure democratic elections are held as promised early in 2009, South Pacific foreign ministers said on Wednesday. The ministers meeting in Auckland said progress by Fiji's military-installed government on arranging free and fair elections for the first quarter of next year was too slow. "We were at pains to demand from Fiji that they set out the roadmap, the milestones, the actual programme forward, let us know what that is, what the timetable is," New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters told Radio NZ. Peters said Fiji told the meeting it would soon appoint an election supervisor and expected to have a detailed election timetable by the middle of April. Fiji's current prime minister and military leader Frank Bainimarama, who staged a bloodless 2006 coup, promised last year that free and fair elections would be held by early 2009. Bainimarama ousted Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase claiming Qarase's government was corrupt and soft on people involved in a 2000 coup. Qarase had assumed power after a failed coup in 2000. Fiji, an island chain home to about 900,000 people, has been hit by four coups and a military mutiny since 1987. New Zealand and Australia have led criticism of the Bainimarama's military-backed regime and have imposed travel bans and sanctions on military leaders and officials. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Fiji's minister objected to the continued travel bans at the meeting. "They complained about it and we said we weren't proposing to change it, unless and until they showed substantial progress towards the conduct and holding of full, free and fair elections," Smith told reporters. The South Pacific ministers meeting also voiced concern about reported abuses of human rights in Fiji by the military, press freedom and judicial independence. Last month Australian publisher Russell Hunter was deported after his Fiji Sun newspaper ran articles about the tax affairs of a member of the interim government. Fiji, a former British colony, has had its membership of the Commonwealth suspended and aid from the European Union has only continued on condition elections are held
