<TITLE> European shares led lower by miner Xstrata, banks </TITLE>

 PARIS, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks slipped in early trade on Wednesday, giving up some of the previous session's sharp gains, as miner Xstrata sank 8 percent after bid talks with Brazil's Vale broke down. But the fall was cushioned by gains in the telecoms sector, with Vodafone up 2.4 percent. The world's largest mobile phone company by revenue said it expects to start receiving dividends from its U.S. joint venture Verizon Wireless next year. At 0950 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.36 percent at 1,261.50 points. The index surged 3.2 percent on Tuesday, lifted by a rally in banks, Wednesday's biggest sectoral loser. "I think that we are reaching a floor, at least for now. Historically, when the market starts pricing in a recession, there is a 20 percent drop in stocks. And this time, equities were not overpriced when the downturn started," said Jean-Luc Buchalet, CEO of Pythagore Investissement, in Paris. "There is usually a low point after six months, so this will probably be sort of a short-term rally as a lot of bad news has been digested. But we can expect to fall to a new low sometimes around June." The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost 16 percent since the start of the year and is down 23 percent since reaching a multi-year high last summer, as fears of a US recession and worries over the impact of a global credit crisis hit stock markets worldwide. Xstrata was Europe's biggest laggard on Wednesday after Vale, the world's largest iron ore miner, said talks to buy Swiss rival Xstrata had failed and that Vale would look at other potential takeover targets. In the banking sector, Deutsche Bank fell 1.9 percent after the German lender said the disruption to revenues and writedowns on assets stemming from the global credit crisis could put its profit goal for this year at risk. The bank said its business in corporate and investment banking, the areas most directly affected by financial market turbulence, was likely to be considerably lower in the near term. "This can almost be seen as a profit warning. They said they may need to make further writedowns and that is not good news at the moment," one trader said. "(But) the share price might also turn over the course of the day as markets may see it as a positive sign that Deutsche Bank cleared the air," he added. The DJ Stoxx European banking index was down 0.8 percent, with HSBC down 1.2 percent, BBVA down 0.6 percent and Credit Agricole down 1.6 percent. Banking shares have been hit over the past eight months by worries over the impact of rising mortgage delinquencies in the risky US subprime market that have forced banks to write down assets. BRIEF BOOST FROM IFO The FTSEurofirst 300, on track to record its worst quarterly performance in nearly six years, briefly turned positive shortly after an unexpected rise in the German Ifo business sentiment index, but quickly gave up gains. The headline Ifo index rose to 104.8 in March from February's 104.1 and against a consensus forecast for a fall to 103.4. "The data will come as a setback to the credit market and curve-steepening prospects," David Brown, chief European economist, fixed income at Bear Stearns wrote in a note. "However, we do not see the rise as a sign that the economy is likely to escape the slowdown in global growth. With many other areas of the Eurozone economy struggling we still believe that the ECB will ease rates in the next few months." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.2 percent, the UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.3 percent
