 Taipei, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan opposition candidate Ma Ying-jeou was elected president over the weekend with nearly 60 percent of the vote, pushing an economic platform of stronger trade and economic links with political rival China. Here are some key facts about the economic policies of Ma, whose Nationalist Party (KMT) also won a large parliamentary majority in legislative elections in January: Ma supports a "common-market", similar to the European Union's, between China and Taiwan Ma has said he would open up regular direct flights between Taiwan and China and would conclude a deal opening up Taiwan to significantly more mainland Chinese tourists by July 1 Ma has said he would push for a pact similar to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) that Hong Kong has with China, but not use the "CEPA" label for political reasons Ma said he aims to raise per-capita GDP to $30,000 and to lower the unemployment rate to less than 3 percent from the current 3.95 percent Source: Reuters
