 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  Arch-rivals Mohammedan SC and Abahani Limited have almost confirmed their super league berths Monday defeating their respective rivals in the seventh round encounters of the Premier Division Cricket League. An unbeaten 53-run knock from Junaed Siddique propelled leaders Mohammedan to win seventh straight triumph, handing a convincing eight-wicket defeat to City Club in a low-scoring match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Second-placed Abahani recorded their sixth victory with an emphatic nine-wicket win over Old DOHS in a curtailed-over match at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground-2. Victoria SC registered their second win in seven matches when they defeated Young Pegasus by six wickets at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium while Sonargaon Cricketers tasted their first win beating Partex SC by 69 runs at the BKSP ground-1. Rains ruined the match between Biman Bangladesh and Kalabagan at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium and it will take place Tuesday at the same venue. Mohammedan vs City Club Put in to bat first, City Club faced heavy blow from pacer Dollar Mahmud, who ripped through top order to return three for 11. Afterwards, Pakistani Aqeel Arshad (4/20) broke City Club's middle order before left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo (3/11) cleaned the tail to stop City at 91 all out in 36 overs. In reply, Mohammedan faced no trouble though opener Imtiaz Hossain fell on 9, but national team's opener Junaed and captain Mohammad Ashraful put on 44 runs before Ashraful was out for 24, leaving the side at 71 for two in 23.4 overs. Junaed along with Faisal Hossain (6) took Mohammedan home making 94 for two in 29.3 overs as left-handed opener Junaed remained unbeaten on 53 off 81 with the help of seven fours. Abahani vs Old DOHS After being invited to bat first, DOHS openers Sakib Razzak (58) and Wasiur Rahman gave a fine start before the latter fell on 14. Middle orders Anisur Rahman (31) and skipper Mehrab Hossain (30) kept the momentum, but the tail failed to carry on it and DOHS eventually folded at 177 in 35.4 overs as Abahani trio spinners Arafat Sunny (2/23), Mohammad Rafique (2/31) and Rejaul Karim (2/35) shared six wickets. Abahani, in reply, reached easily 180 for one in 31.2 overs as Jahirul Islam struck an unbeaten 78 and one-down Nazimuddin made 48 not out. Jahirul smashed seven fours and two sixes playing 90 balls while Nazimuddin smacked four sixes in 72 balls. Earlier, Jahirul and Mahbubul Karim gave a fine 62-run opening stand before being separated. Victoria vs Young Pegasus Victoria raced to 141 for four in 25.1 overs in reply to Pegasus 139 for eight in the stipulated 30 overs. Gazi Salahuddin (63) and Farhad Hossain (41) played the key role in giving Victoria the second win after opener Kaisar Iqbal gave a blazing 18-ball 21 start. Pegasus's Sumon Shaha top-scored with 44 followed by openers Rahat Sadek on 27 and Rabiul Islam on 16 as Rubel Hossain (2/16) and Kaisar Iqbal (2/27) took two wickets each. Sonargaon vs Partex Sonargaon put up a challenging 220 for six in the stipulated 39 overs, riding on fifties from Mostafizur Rahman (58) and Sharifullah (54), after being put in to bat first. Arafat Chowdhury and Arman Hossain hit 38 and 37 respectively to help Sonargaon go beyond the 200-mark. Partex, in reply, were bundled out for 151 in 32.1 overs with Pakistani Rashed Hanif topscoring 39 in the face of superb bowling from Saif Ahmed (3/32), Elias Sunny (2/28) and M Azim (2/11).
