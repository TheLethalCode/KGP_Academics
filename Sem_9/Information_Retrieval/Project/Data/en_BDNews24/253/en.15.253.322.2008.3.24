 MIAMI, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Mahela Jayawardene compiled a patient 136 to put Sri Lanka in a strong position at the close of the second day of the first test against West Indies in Georgetown, Guyana, on Sunday. Sri Lanka declared at 476 for eight midway through the final session of the day and then claimed the prize wicket of West Indies captain Chris Gayle as West Indies finished on 29 for one at the close.
