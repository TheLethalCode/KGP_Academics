<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and Armenia will maintain close relations, the newly elected presidents of both countries said during their first meeting in Moscow on Monday. "This is your first foreign visit after the polls and we see it as a symbol of the high priority that Russian-Armenian relations have," Russia's Dmitry Medvedev, elected on March 2, told Armenia's Serzh Sarksyan, elected on Feb. 19. "We hope that under your leadership we can continue relations we enjoyed in the past years," the Russian president-elect said, welcoming his Armenian counterpart in the Kremlin. Sarksyan will be inaugurated on April 9, while Medvedev will take over the presidency on May 7. Landlocked Christian Armenia is one of the staunchest Russian allies among ex-Soviet states. It hosts a Russian military base and receives Russian gas at preferential prices. Sarksyan intends to establish close ties with Medvedev. He will also meet President Vladimir Putin later on Monday. "I hope your taking over the presidential power will contribute to our traditionally close ties," he told Medvedev. Russia takes part in sensitive, though so far fruitless, international efforts to mediate in a row between Armenia and its ex-Soviet Muslim neighbour Azerbaijan over the breakaway province of Nagorno-Karabakh. The predominantly Armenian-populated Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan after a war in the early 1990s. Armenia openly backs Karabakh separatists, but denies Azeri charges of occupying the region and some surrounding districts. Western recognition of Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo, opposed by Russia, has sparked separatist sentiment in the former Soviet Union, including in Armenia and Karabakh. Armenia's outgoing President Robert Kocharyan said last month Yerevan should recognise Karabakh as an independent state if Azerbaijan does not change its approach to peace talks. Russia has not reacted to the idea. Earlier this month it voted in the United Nations against a resolution demanding Armenian forces withdraw from occupied Azeri territories. The election of Sarksyan, a long-time Kocharyan ally, sparked violent protests by the opposition, who say the vote was rigged. Riots in the capital Yerevan prompted the government to introduce a state of emergency that was lifted at midnight on Thursday. Eight people were killed and about 200 injured in the post-election clash
