<TITLE> Japan PM`s support slides to 24.7 pct: media poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's support rate slid to 24.7 percent in a poll by private broadcaster TV Asahi released on Monday, the latest sign of doubts about his leadership that are raising questions about his future. Fukuda's falling popularity -- he initially boasted support rates of about 60 percent -- has sparked speculation that his ruling party may try to replace him before an election that could come this year. But analysts say ousting a premier is difficult. "Somebody has to take the initiative and draw out the knife," said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University. "It takes a bit of courage to do this." Public backing for 71-year-old Fukuda has taken a hit from his apparent failure to cope with a political deadlock born of a divided parliament that has already left a vacancy at the top of the Bank of Japan. The stalemate is also threatening tax measures needed to fund national and state budgets for the fiscal year from April 1. The main opposition Democratic Party and smaller allies control parliament's upper house and can delay laws and veto appointments such as that of the Bank of Japan governor. A survey by the Nikkei financial daily published the same day showed Fukuda's support among voters had slid nine points to 31 percent, in line with other recent polls. A rating of at least 30 percent is seen by many analysts as key to government's survival, but previous premiers have hung on with less support. Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masaaki Shirakawa became acting governor last week after the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament rejected two government nominees for the job. Ruling and opposition parties are also locked in a battle over a provisional gasoline tax that the government wants to extend when it expires on March 31 to avoid revenue gaps. The ruling bloc has called on the main opposition Democratic Party to hold talks on what it calls a compromise plan. A senior opposition party executive on Monday dismissed the proposal as an attempt to deceive the public because it first calls for enactment of budget-related bills including the gas tax in time for the start of the new fiscal year on April 1. "This is the same as talks on not revising (the bill)," Democratic Party executive Kenji Yamaoka told reporters. The Democrats, however, have not benefited much from Fukuda's woes. Asked which party they supported, 30 percent of respondents to the Nikkei survey picked the Democrats while 40 percent opted for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. In addition, 65 percent of respondents to a survey by the Yomiuri daily said they did not rate Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa highly. About 865 voters responded to the March 21-23 Nikkei poll. The Yomiuri survey on March 15-16 covered 3,000 people.
