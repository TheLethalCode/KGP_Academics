 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)  As the night of March 25 comes upon us once more, we present an extract from the journal of intellectual and noted essayist Abdul Huq. Huq describes the dreadful blackout night of March 25, 1971, when the occupying Pakistani forces began the indiscriminate killing which resulted in genocide. "The clock struck 11.30 pm, as I was getting ready for sleep. All of a sudden, I heard the persistent sound of firing from Rajarbagh police lane. "The sound was not like an attack being carried out en masse. "I heard people shouting the slogan 'Joy Bangla' at some places, but it was sporadic. "I saw a few people walking from the nearby main road, but they were not hurrying. "People were saying police and EPR (East Pakistan Rifles) were going to take up positions throughout the city. "Then I began hearing more frequent sounds of machinegun, stein gun and cannon. "Within a few minutes I realised that police, EPR and the Pakistan army were involved in clashes near the police lane. "The sound of fire continued for a long time. The dark night sky turned to red like flames. "I went to the roof and saw that Rajarbag police lane was burning. "Some areas near the rail station and the High Court were also afire. "Bullet tracers were seen running through the sky. "Scores of men and women were running from the police lane. "I feared that the bullets would reach our house. I tried to ensure that everyone in the house was safe. "Monju was screaming, I told her to stay in the bathroom for a while, thinking no bullets could reach her there. "The houses of the surrounding area were dark, but nobody was sleeping. "After a long time we understood that the army had fully occupied the police lane [] [] Later we heard that, the police, EPR and the army had been involved in clashes not only in Rajarbagh, but in numerous places throughout Dhaka. bdnews24.
