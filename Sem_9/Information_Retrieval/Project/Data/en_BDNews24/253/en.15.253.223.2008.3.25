 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Signs of life in the US housing market combined with JPMorgan's higher bid for Bear Stearns to push global equity markets up sharply on Tuesday, and sent corporate debt demand soaring. The dollar remained weak, however, while euro zone government bond prices took a hefty hit as equities rose. European shares, reopening after a four-day weekend, were up 3 percent, following on from strong gains in Asia. Markets were driven by Monday's report of a surprising rise in sales of US pre-owned homes last month. Some investors took this as a sign that the worst may be over for the US housing sector, which has been behind much of the economic and credit worries of recent months. In addition, JPMorgan lifted its offer five-fold for Bear Stearns to $10 a share, alleviating some concern about other banking shares. "It gives people hope that maybe the darkest period is over," said Hans Kunnen, head of investment markets research at Colonial First State in Sydney. "But the market is just operating like a yo-yo within a band. I refuse to get carried away." MSCI's benchmark world stock index was up 1.9 percent with its emerging markets counterpart gaining 2.2 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 gained 3.1 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average M.N225 closed up 2.1 percent at 12,745.22. CORRECTING A lot of crisis pricing in markets appeared to be correcting, although investors remained cautious. "This could be a temporary relief. To be convinced that this is the floor, we need more indications that the credit market is stabilising," said Arthur van Slooten, strategist at Societe Generale, in Paris. Credit markets were among the main movers. European credit spreads surged tighter following a similar move in U.S. credit spreads on Monday. The Markit iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated European credits, was at 540 basis points, 53 basis points tighter than last Thursday before the holiday weekend. The investment-grade iTraxx Europe index was at 112.5 basis points, 19.5 basis points tighter. "I am almost speechless. I saw U.S. stocks yesterday and thought maybe we'd open 5-10 basis points tighter, but this move ... maybe it's overdone," said one trader. Credit analysts said that increasing actions by governments and regulators to deal with the credit crisis were finally affecting spreads, although some still doubted how effective the rescue moves would be. BONDS HIT Euro zone government bond prices fell as equities rose. The June Bund future was down more than 1 point on the day at 116.29. The interest-rate sensitive-year Schatz yield was up 24 basis points at 3.488 percent, while the 10-year Bund yield rose by 13 basis points to 3.890 percent. The dollar fell broadly following four days of gains, with nerves about U.S. economic health still dominating sentiment. "The negative dollar environment persists. There was positive housing data but apart from that there is no solid news to say that there will be a sustained dollar recovery," said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. The euro was up 0.9 percent to $1.5568 after falling as low as $1.5341 in the previous session. The common currency is down from a record high of $1.5904 hit last week. Gold prices ticked higher. Spot gold was quoted at around $933 per ounce, up around $13, but well below the all-time peak of $1,030.80 an ounce touched earlier this mon
