<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)  Communications adviser Ghulam Quader said Tuesday that the caretaker government was intending to hold its talks with the political parties soon. "But the government does not intend to push the agenda. The political parties' agendas will be discussed in the talks," Quader told reporters at the secretariat. He, however, added that no preconditions were being considered ahead of the dialogues. The adviser was asked what the interim administration's position on possible political party demands for relaxing the anticorruption drive. "The government will not allow any let-up against those accused of corruption. The government will continue the anticorruption drive," said Quader. "The corrupt are responsible for the present condition of the country. The people will decide whether their punishment should be relaxed," he said. Earlier, the adviser met with Asian Development Bank director-general for South Asia Kunio Senga. Quader said his discussion with the ADB director-general focused on the regional development bank's role in transforming Bangladesh Railway into a public limited company. "We also discussed construction of the Padma Bridge. The ADB assured me that it would continue its assistance on these matters," he said. The adviser said the long-term decision making process regarding Bangladesh Railway's transformation into a PLC would be the responsibility of the next elected administration. The ADB director-general said the caretaker government was doing a "good job", and an elected government should work on what it had achieved. bdnew
