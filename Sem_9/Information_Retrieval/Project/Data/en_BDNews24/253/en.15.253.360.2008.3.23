 LONDON, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A group of Gregorian chanting monks are on the cusp of international fame, after being signed by one of the world's biggest music labels. The Abbey of the Holy Cross monks, whose heavenly notes are enjoyed by Pope Benedict, have signed with London-based Universal Records, the company told Reuters on Monday. The record giant, home to international artists including Amy Winehouse, Bryan Adams and Eminem, will produce the Austrian-based choir's album, which is due for worldwide distribution later this year, it said. The company discovered the choir, from the world's second oldest Cistercian monastery and based 15 km (10 miles) west of the capital Vienna, after they responded via YouTube to advertisements calling for medieval chanters.

Label bosses had placed the adverts in various religious publications after discovering a resurgence of interest in the Gregorian chant, thanks to a best-selling computer game. The Xbox space-age Halo game, which has sold more than 16 million copies worldwide, uses Gregorian chant within its main soundtrack. The chant, traditionally sung by choirs of men and boys since the early Middle Ages, is one of the oldest known forms of written music. "They are, without question, the best we heard," Universal artist and repertoire manager Tom Lewis, told Reuters. "We are excited about the prospect of having a very beautiful and special record on our hands." He said it was an unusual way of signing an artist but the company was looking for something "particularly extraordinary". Their first album is due for release by the British summ
