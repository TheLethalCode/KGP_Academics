 London, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British New York-based hip-hop singer Estelle has ended Duffy's five-week reign over the UK singles charts but the Welsh newcomer has held on to the number one album spot, the Official Charts Company said on Sunday. Featuring hip-hop star Kanye West, Estelle's single "American Boy" was the top-selling single after entering the charts a fortnight ago at number 72, and then dropping out of the top 200 last week. "It has done it on digital downloads alone, selling over 50,000 units," said a spokeswoman for the charts company. Soul singer Duffy's "Mercy" fell to two after a five-week stint as the number one single, while British X-Factor winner Leona Lewis and her Sport Relief charity single "Better in Time/Footprints in the Sand" slipped one place to three. Elsewhere, there was little movement in the top 10 singles chart, with pop diva Madonna's "4 Minutes" featuring Justin Timberlake a new entry at seven. Duffy had some consolation in the album charts where he held on to top spot for a third week running with "Rockferry", fending off the challenge of Devon rockers Muse and "Haarp", a new entry at number two. Colorado pop rock band OneRepublic "Dreaming Out Loud" dropped one to three, while Lewis's album "Spirit" was a non-mover at four. There were four other new entries in a fluid top 10, with British rockers Elbow's "The Seldom Seen Kid" in at five, just ahead of Canadian rocker Bryan Adams's "11". In at nine was "Music of the Spheres" by musician Mike Oldfield, best known for his best-selling 1970s album Tubular Bells, with Irish rocker Van Morrison's "Keep it Simple" coming in at 10.
