Meetings with Democratic White House hopefuls Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could take place. Brown's relationship with US President George W Bush has been less cosy than that enjoyed by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who was caricatured as "America's poodle" by British media and some politicians.
