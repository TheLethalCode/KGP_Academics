 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 60 years after they were sent down the coal mines at the height of World War Two, a group of "Bevin Boys" were receiving a badge of honour on Tuesday for their vital work. Prime Minister Gordon Brown was presenting 27 men, including broadcaster Jimmy Savile and actor Brian Rix, with their awards at a Downing Street ceremony.

They took their nickname from Ernest Bevin, the Minister of Labour and National Service in Winston Churchill's government who devised the scheme. "The service that the Bevin Boys gave to this country was incredibly important," Brown said in a statement. "(They) not only helped us to win the war but also to rebuild our country after the war." Between 1943 and 1948, nearly 50,000 men aged from 18 to 25 became Bevin Boys. Four out of 10 were conscripted directly into the mines by ballot, while the rest chose to mine rather than join the armed forces.

Campaigners have sought official recognition for the miners' important role for decades. Other famous Bevin Boys included the late comedian Eric Morecambe and playwright Peter Shaffer. About 3,000 people have applied for one of the new badges, bearing the words "Bevin Boys Veterans" with a profile of a miner and a pithead in red, silver and black. The ceremony coincides with the 60th anniversary of the last miners being demobilis
