 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Premier Division Cricket League springs to life Monday when the national cricketers start playing the seventh-round encounters. The national cricketers were out of the fray until the sixth round because of their engagements against South Africa and Ireland. The clubs, however, were given the go-ahead to play their top cricketers in the place-deciding and final matches of the Premier Division Twenty20 League on March 15 before start of the ODI series against Ireland. "The national cricketers will play until the 11th round before leaving here for Pakistan on April 6 to play five-match ODI series," said league co-coordinator Kabir Hossain. League leaders Mohammedan are getting big boost with five national players returning to their fold while title contenders Abahani Limited and Biman Bangladesh also will welcome back a couple of players from the seventh round. Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful will captain unbeaten Mohammedan, who lost all matches in Twenty20 League to quit from the group stage, against fourth-placed City Club at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Last year's runners-up Mohammedan get the services from Aftab Ahmed, Junaed Siddique and Raqibul Hasan. Second placed Abahani Limited, the Twenty20 champions, face struggling two-time champions Old DOHS at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground-2. The Dhanmondi-based outfit will look to boost the batting line-up with the return of in-form opener Shahriar Nafees and Nazimuddin. Joint-second placed Biman will also get the services of opener Tamim Iqbal and pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza when the national flag carrier take on Kalabagan KC at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Three-time champions Victoria Sporting Club will also see Mahmudullah Raid and wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh in their side when they face Young Pegasus at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is set to take the field for BKSP, who take on promoted Surjo Torun comprising Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mashud, Mohammad Sharif and a bunch of young cricketers. Partex SC play against winless Sonargaon Cricketers at the BKSP ground-2. Mohammedan lead the point table with 12 points, followed by Abahani and Biman each on 11 points, after the sixth round. BKSP has 9 points, City Club 7 and DOHS 6 playing as many matches. b
