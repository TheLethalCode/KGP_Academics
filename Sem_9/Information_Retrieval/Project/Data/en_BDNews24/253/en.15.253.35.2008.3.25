The twin decisions came at a meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his office.

In the Supreme Court section, the posts will be of additional attorney general, deputy attorney general and assistant attorney general. In the district section will be district attorney, additional district attorney, joint district attorney and assistant district attorney. The ordinance has been sent to the law ministry for further scrutiny. The ordinance will be presented back at a cabinet meeting for final approval. Referring to the VIP expatriates' policy, the press secretary said: "They can use VIP lounges in airports. And they will be invited to national functions at Bangladesh missions abroad." "The government will give them special identity cards," he said. bdnews24.com/a
