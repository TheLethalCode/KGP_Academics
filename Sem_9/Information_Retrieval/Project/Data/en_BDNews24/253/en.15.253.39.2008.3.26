 TEGUCIGALPA, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 26 people died in Honduras on Tuesday when a bus ran off a road and plunged over 1,600 feet (500 metres) into a ravine, rescuers said. The accident happened between San Isidro and Jesus de Otoro, 93 miles (150 km) west of the capital, Tegucigalpa. "There are 26 dead so far. ... Twenty-three died at the site and three others in hospital," fireman Carlos Cordero told Reuters. Four children were among the dead and 16 survivors were under medical observation, he said. The cause was unclear, but bus crashes on Central America's poorly maintained roads happen often
