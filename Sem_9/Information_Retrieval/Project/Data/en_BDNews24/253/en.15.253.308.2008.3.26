 MADRID, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's Socialist Party started talks on Tuesday with regional nationalist parties to seek support to form the next government. Socialist Party Secretary Jose Blanco met with moderate Catalan nationalists CiU and the Basque Nationalist Party ahead of April 8 when Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is due to swear in for a second consecutive term. The Socialists fell short of an absolute majority in the election on March 9. Although the Spanish political system effectively guarantees they will be able to form the next government, they still need to negotiate deals with smaller parties to ensure support for legislation. "These meetings have been very positive," said Blanco afterwards. "We have agreed to keep talking in the next few days..." Both PNV's parliamentary spokesman Josu Erkoreka and CiU parliamentary's spokesman Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida warned afterwards they were lukewarm about backing the socialist Jose Bono as chairman of parliament. Bono, a popular figure in the socialist party, is seen as being unsympathetic to some of the demands of Spain's nationalist parties. Both the Basque Nationalist Party and CiU are seeking greater powers and funding for their regions. The Socialists have not ruled out a formal coalition agreement but have said they would prefer all ministers to come from their own party. Talks will continue on Wednesday, and the Socialists will also meet other parties such as the left-wing group IU and Catalan separatists ERC
