 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kerry Katona, former member of girl band Atomic Kitten, has been taken to hospital, although her illness is not as serious as initially feared, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The 27-year-old, who is pregnant with her fourth child, was admitted on Tuesday after her midwife was concerned she had pre-eclampsia, a condition affecting expectant mothers which can become life-threatening. "In fact it was water retention and low iron levels, which brought on similar symptoms," the spokeswoman said. "That is fantastic news. Mummy and baby are fine." Katona, who is undergoing treatment for bipolar disorder, is expected to be released from hospital later on Wednesday.
