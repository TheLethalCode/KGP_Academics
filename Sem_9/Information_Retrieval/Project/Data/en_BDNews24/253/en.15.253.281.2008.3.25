 Santiago, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck copper-rich northern Chile on Monday, the US Geological Survey said, but there were no immediate reports of damage. "For the moment we have no reports of damage or power disruptions," a source at Chile's National Disaster Agency (ONEMI) said shortly after the quake, which struck near the Bolivian border. The USGS said the quake, centered 88 miles (141 km) east of the Chilean city of Iquique, struck at a depth of 74.3 miles (120 km). Originally it said the quake occurred at a depth of 24.9 miles (40 km). Miners in the region said they felt the quake, but there were no initial reports of damage from major mines either in Chile or Peru to the north. Quake-prone Chile is a major copper producer.
