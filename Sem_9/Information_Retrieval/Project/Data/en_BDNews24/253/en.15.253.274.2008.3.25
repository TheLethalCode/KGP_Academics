 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board Tuesday recalled pacer Syed Rasel for the upcoming Pakistan tour as it announced a 15-man squad for next month's one-day international series. The Tigers are scheduled to leave for Pakistan on April 6 for a 15-day tour that includes five ODIs and a Twenty20 match, after Australia pulled out of their scheduled tour citing security reasons. The selectors pinned their hopes on all 14 players who were in the squad in the three-ODI home series against Ireland and recalled Rasel, who was dropped for the Ireland series. "We did not want to break the winning combination of the squad as there was much team spirit, confidence and trust among the players," chief selector Rafiqul Alam said at a press conference Tuesday at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Tigers completed a clean sweep against Ireland in their most recent three-ODI series after being whitewashed in both the previous ODI and Test series against South Africa at home. The three-member selection committee picked three specialist pacers and as many spinners for the squad. "I think off-spinner Mahmudullah's inclusion will bring the diversity in the attack," said the chief selector when asked whether fellow off-spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel was considered for the Pakistan tour. "We have been walking towards the 2011 World Cup with a long term plan. We have also said before that we wanted to keep this squad together," said Alam. Alam hoped that the boys would play better cricket against Pakistan as their confidence level was high after whitewashing Ireland. The national cricketers are now involved in the ongoing Premier Division Cricket League and will play three further matches in the league until national coach Jamie Siddons returns to Bangladesh on March 30. The chief selector said it depends on the coach whether the selected cricketers play in the premier league 11th round. Tour itinerary: April 8 - First ODI, Lahore April 11 - 2nd ODI, Faisalabad April 13 - 3rd ODI, Lahore April 16 - 4th ODI, Multan April 19 - 5th ODI, Karachi April 20 - Twenty20 international, Karachi Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Aftab Ahmed, Nazimuddin, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan, Dhiman Ghosh, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Mahmudullah Riad, Farhad Reza, Raqibul Hasan and Syed Rase
