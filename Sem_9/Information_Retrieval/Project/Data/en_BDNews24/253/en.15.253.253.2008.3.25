<TITLE> Panesar, Broad bowl England to brink of series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Monty Panesar and Stuart Broad sparked a characteristic batting collapse from New Zealand to all but clinch the third test, and series, after the fourth day's play on Tuesday. New Zealand, from a seemingly comfortable position at tea with Matthew Bell and Stephen Fleming well established, lost three wickets for 13 runs after the break and their side ended the day on 222 for five, needing another 331 to win the match. Ross Taylor (34) and Brendon McCullum (24) were the not out batsmen, though McCullum was dropped by Kevin Pietersen and had another chance bloop just over Panesar's head in the final over of the day from James Anderson. Panesar ended with three for 49. Broad had two for 40. To save the match on the fifth day New Zealand must last a minimum of 90 overs from the England attack, with the victory target of 553 undoubtedly well beyond reach. Should England complete victory on Wednesday, it would be the third time New Zealand have lost a three-test series after winning the first match. They also lost a series 2-1 in South Africa in 1994-95 and in Sri Lanka in 1997-98. Fleming and Bell resumed after tea on 146 for one and after Fleming took a single off the first ball, Bell fell without adding to his score two balls later when he lapped a ball from Panesar straight to Broad at deep backward square leg for 69. CAREER AVERAGE Fleming had brought up his 46th test half century and then passed 7,160 career test runs to ensure he would end his international career with a test average over 40 before tea. However, as has been typical of his storied career, he failed to convert another half century into a big score and was caught by Tim Ambrose off Panesar for 66 to leave New Zealand on 156 for three. He finished with a career average of 40.06. Fleming, who turned just nine of the 55 times he passed 50 into centuries, received a standing ovation from the crowd at McLean Park and was applauded off by the England team. Michael Vaughan's side had also formed a guard of honour when he walked to the wicket after lunch. Mathew Sinclair, who has been under pressure to retain his test place, may have damaged his selection chances for the tour of England when he was caught for six by Ambrose off a Broad bouncer four runs later -- the third wicket in 13 runs. Broad then had Grant Elliott caught by Ian Bell from a mistimed pull for four to leave New Zealand floundering at 172 for five. Jamie How had been dismissed before tea when he was trapped lbw by Panesar without adding to his lunch score of 11. England had declared their second innings at 467 for seven about 30 minutes into the day's play. Andrew Strauss top-scored with 177 and Ian Bell made 110. New Zealand won the first test by 189 runs and England the second by 126 runs
