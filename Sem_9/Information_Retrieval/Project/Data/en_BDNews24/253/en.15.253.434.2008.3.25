 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) - Biman Bangladesh recorded their sixth triumph in the Premier Division Cricket League when they handed a convincing 63-run defeat to Kalabagan KC in the seventh round encounters at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium Tuesday. The national flag carrier team joined the second-placed Abahani Limited with 13 points each from seven outing, just one point behind leaders Mohammedan SC. Biman posted a fighting total of 243 for eight in 50 overs riding on a fine 75-run knock from Mosharraf Hossain Rubel. Biman fell in trouble after deciding to bat first and were reduced to 13 for two in 8.4 overs before the middle order batsman took their side to near 250-mark. Apart from Rubel, Nafis Iqbal (24), Alok Kapali (40) and Sanwar Hossain (35) played key roles in giving Biman the sixth win despite Syed Rasel taking four wickets for 41 runs. In reply, Kalabagan also lost first two wickets at just three runs before opener Pakistani Shahbaz Butt (72) Hannan Sarkar (33) rescued Biman from the damage. But, they could not avert the defeat and Kalabagan folded at 180 all out with 4.1 overs to spare as Nabil Samad (2/22), Mahbubul Karim (2/22) and Niaz Ahmed (2/37) wiped the Kalabagan innings up.
