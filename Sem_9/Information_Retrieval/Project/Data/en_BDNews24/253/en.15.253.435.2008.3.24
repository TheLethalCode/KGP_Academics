<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real are confident they can halt their slide in form and ward off a renewed title challenge from Barcelona, despite slumping to their fifth league defeat in eight games on Sunday. The Spanish champions lost 3-2 to Valencia at the Bernabeu, with Angel Arizmendi getting an 89th minute winner against the run of play after Real had laid siege to the Valencia goal in the final stages. "We aren't running out of gas. We played well, but we just couldn't get a result," centre back Pepe told reporters. "We have to keep fighting because there is a long way to go yet." Sporting director Predrag Mijatovic agreed with the defender. "It was a shame because we played a great game and had lots of chances, but the ball just didn't want to go in... We still have a four-point advantage over Barcelona and we still depend on ourselves." "We have to play with more assurance and calmness and can't afford to make the sort of mistakes we made out there," said Pepe. "We will have to work hard to correct these errors." Barcelona, who had gone through a shaky period having taken just one point from their previous three matches, ensured they remained in the frame with a 4-1 win at home to Valladolid. Second in the standings, they now have 58 points to Real's 62 with nine matches left to play. ETO'O WARNING But striker Samuel Eto'o warned his team mates that they could not afford a repeat of recent slip-ups if they were to stay in the title race. "While there's life there's hope," said the Cameroon international. "But if we want to win the league and the Champions League we have to be more focused, more attentive right through from the goalkeeper to the strikers. "We have to improve our defending as a team." While the top two are struggling for consistency, Villarreal proved they are the form team of the moment by extending their winning streak to four games with a 2-1 victory at basement side Levante. Manuel Pellegrini's side, who have the best away record in the league, are now just two points behind Barcelona in third spot in the table
