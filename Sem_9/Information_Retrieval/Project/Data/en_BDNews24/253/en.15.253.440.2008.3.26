 KARACHI, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's leading fast bowler Mohammad Asif has been ruled out of next month's one-day series against Bangladesh. Coach Geoff Lawson told reporters that Asif was not ready to play in the five-match series starting on April 8 because he has not completed his rehabilitation following elbow surgery in Australia two months ago. "Everybody else is fit for Bangladesh and that is a big bonus for us. Asif hopefully is also not too far away from playing again," Lawson said. Asif has not played since October due to the elbow problem which also forced him to miss the 2007 World Cup. Asif has started bowling in the nets again and plans to play in the Indian Premier League. "It is a chance to play alongside my idol, Glenn McGrath of Australia, and try to learn from him," the 25-year-old Asif told Reuters. Asif has taken 51 wickets in 11 tests. "It is a great opportunity to learn from someone as experienced as McGrath as I will get a chance to play with him for at least a month," Asif said. McGrath retired last year after taking 563 test wicket
