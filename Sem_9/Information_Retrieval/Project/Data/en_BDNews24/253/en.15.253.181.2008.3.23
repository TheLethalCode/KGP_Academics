<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)Square Hospital doctors have again stated their limitations regarding treatment of Sheikh Hasina's ear condition, though they have yet to form a "comprehensive opinion" on all Hasina's ailments. Chief of the physicians' panel for Hasina, Prof Sanwar Hossain said at a press conference Sunday: "We informed authorities of our limitations in treating her ear earlier." "Her ears have been examined. The problem remains unchanged," Prof Sanwar said. Asked why they do not recommend sending the former prime minister abroad, he replied: "The recommendation normally comes at the end of our examinations." "Besides she has not come here only for her ear problem. We are looking into her other complaints also  an eye condition and allergies," the doctor said. "From what we have seen so far, it will take seven to 10 days to give a comprehensive opinion." Asked what the physicians had mentioned in their report to the court Sunday, Prof Sanwar said: "We reported on Sheikh Hasina's overall condition." "We have sent a report on the real situation. But we did not send it directly to the court. We sent the report to jail authorities." State and defence lawyers had earlier in the day trashed a report submitted to court by prison authorities on Sheikh Hasina's health condition. Hasina was not produced before the court Sunday, as had been scheduled, "because of her own reluctance though the condition of her health was fine", the prison authorities said in a report submitted to the court. The report said Hasina was being provided with the treatment her health condition demanded since the day she was arrested. Hasina's lawyers however rejected the report and termed it false and baseless. Hasina's lawyer Adv Syed Rezaur Rahman said the Awami League president was not produced before the court because of her deteriorating health condition. "No relative or lawyer has been allowed to meet Hasina for 13 days. In this situation, we are worried over her wellbeing," another lawyer said. State's counsel Syed Shamim Ahsan Habib also requested the court take action against the jail authorities as they had failed to produce Hasina before the court as scheduled. The court deferred to March 30 the proceedings of the graft case against Hasina involving the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants. Judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judges' Court-1 also ordered prison authorities to produce Hasina before the court on March 30. Meanwhile, an Awami League leader alleged Sunday that the physicians' panel formed by Square Hospital had not had access to Hasina for the last seven days. Awami League acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam claimed: "As far as my knowledge goes the Square Hospital doctors are not being allowed to go near her. "So we want to know from the government who is treating the leader?" he asked after a Jubo Mohila League day-long hunger strike programme for Hasina's release held at the Awami League central office Sunday. bdnews24.c
