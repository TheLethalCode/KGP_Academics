<TITLE> Trezeguet among Euro hopefuls aiming to shine </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Resigned to being omitted from Euro 2008 a week ago, David Trezeguet will have an unexpected chance to force his way into France coach Raymond Domenech's plans during Wednesday's friendly against England. The Juventus striker, who scored the extra-time winner in the Euro 2000 final victory over Italy, won a late call-up on Sunday having been ignored by Domenech since September's 1-0 qualifying defeat by Scotland. With Wednesday's batch of friendlies offering one of the last chances to shine before the June tournament, holders Greece play Portugal in a repeat of the 2004 final, Germany travel to co-hosts Switzerland and Spain take on Italy. While most eyes in Paris will be on David Beckham, who looks set to win his 100th England cap, the other David's contribution could be more significant with the Euro finals looming large. Trezeguet, who has scored 34 goals in 70 games for France, was given a reprieve after fellow World Cup winner Thierry Henry, Olympique Lyon's Karim Benzema and Mathieu Valbuena of Olympique Marseille were ruled out by injury. The Juventus player, who last week said he did not expect to feature in the Euro squad, is likely to start against England alongside Chelsea's Nicolas Anelka. "I've played many times with David and it worked well," Anelka told reporters. "He's an excellent striker. If we were to be paired, that would suit me." LESS FORTUNATE Alessandro Del Piero, Trezeguet's strike partner at Juve, has been less fortunate than his team mate. The 33-year-old, who has not featured for Italy since a disappointing display in September, was again omitted from a squad dominated by AC Milan and AS Roma players. Opposition coach Luis Aragones could hand debuts to Liverpool fullback Alvaro Arbeloa, Getafe midfielder Ruben de la Red and Real Mallorca defender Fernando Navarro in Spain's last match before he announces his squad for the finals. "This list isn't definitive," Aragones said last week. "Any player in form could (still) be called up." Germany's players will also have a last chance to impress coach Joachim Loew when they mark the 100th anniversary of their first international, also played in Basel against Switzerland in April 1908.
