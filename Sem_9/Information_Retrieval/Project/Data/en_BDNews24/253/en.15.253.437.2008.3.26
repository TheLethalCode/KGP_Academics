 Sayala Roksana Dina bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)--Mini Quadir is witness to a significant time in Bangladesh's history. Notably mentioned in Jahanara Imam's book 'Ekattor er din guli', as a young college student she helped stitch the first flag of an independent Bangladesh, flown on March 2, 1971, at Dhaka University. Reminiscing about 1971 in an interview with bdnews24.com Mini Quadir tells her story. bdnews24.com: How did you get involved in the Liberation War movement? Mini Quadir: I was in first year of Intermediate back then. I did not understand much about the struggle for independence. I used to take singing lessons with BAFA, and joined the musical group 'Kranti' where we protested through music. I heard my father discuss the situation with others at home and understood something was about to happen. bdnews24.com: How did you become a part of the historic event of making the first national flag? Mini Quadir: It was the March 1st. My cousin Monirul Haque was the president of Dhaka metropolitan Awami League. He came home and said: "Tomorrow there will be a meeting where we will fly the Bangladesh flag". He knew that I knew how to stitch and said: "You will do the stitching. The colour of the flag will be green with a red circle in the middle". We were wondering what shade of green the flag would be when Monir bhai ripped out a page from our telephone guide and said: "This green". My younger brother bought the material from Sadarghat; my mother did the cutting. We already had red material at home, so we made a circle and stitched it onto the green flag. That was an incredible feeling! I stiched the flag in the balcony in our house. I was surrounded by my mother, father, brother, sister and lots of others. The next day Monir bhai came and said " There will be a white map inside the red circle, the map of East Pakistan". Then we drew the map on a long white cloth that we had at home and attached it to the flag. Monir bhai looked and said: "No. The colour of map should be gold". Now where would we get gold material? Back in those days afsaan was used for makeup. So we got some from our next-door neighbour and colored the map with it. The national flag for an independent Bangladesh was now complete. This flag was flown at Dhaka University. Later, another flag was taken to Iqbal Hall (now known as Johurul Hall). bdnews24.com: What did you see during the initial stages of the war? Mini Quadir: On the 25th of March, I was singing with BAFA for a television broadcast, at the DIT Road recording studio. BAFA's Monsur bhai called me outside the building where I saw convoys of army trucks covered in tarpaulin. I suddenly had an amazing feeling. Monsur bhai said: "They are paratroopers". It was the first time I had heard that word. The army came inside once during our recording. I had no idea what was about to happen. Then came the black-out night; it took nine months of darkness for dawn to finally break. Mother woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me that war had begun. I heard cries of help from all around until dawn. When curfew was lifted for two hours after two days, we went to Gendaria. bdnews24.com: Were you in Dhaka after this? Mini Quadir: No, after three days on March 28th we left for our village in Comilla. We saw many dead bodies on our way there. Those images haunt me till this day. It was horrifying. Another time we went to Narshingdi by launch from Comilla. Our launch got stuck in the water on our way there. All the women were asked to move inside. We later found out that the launch was stuck between dead bodies floating in the water. That's how things were back then. You could see numerous dead bodies in Sadarghat almost everyday. Blind-folded with their hands and feet bound, these people were killed during the night and left there. Sometimes I wonder how it was possible for a civilised army to commit acts of such torture? Q: How did you get involved in the war? Mini Quadir: I went to the village, there I received plenty of news of the war. I was impatient to get involved. Then we got news of freedom fighters coming to our house. One of them was my cousin John (part of the guerrilla team responsible for blowing up the DIG building) and the other two were local youths. They fled from home to fight the war. They returned with vengeance in their eyes. They spread that spirit throughout the village. They told me to hide a heavy bag full of grenades. I saw grenades for the first time in my life. It strengthened my longing to be a part of the war. I hid the grenades. They stayed for two nights and later left for Narshingdi on my uncle's boat. Many other groups travelled to Narshingdi this way on my uncle's boat. From there they reached Dhaka via different routes, and back here from Dhaka and from here to the border. Three months later in June we returned to Dhaka to our house in Rokonpur. Q: You were involved in transporting arms and ammunition. How did you gather the courage? Mini Quadir: To tell you the truth I was involved in transporting weapons knowingly as well as unknowingly. A few of my acquainted freedom fighters would hide arms in the house. They would also say that if there was a woman in a car, the car would not be checked so heavily. Initially, although I wanted to, I couldn't gather the courage to go with them. But then an incident occurred in which I witnessed a woman I knew being tortured by the Pakistani army. The brutality of the event took away all my fear. I would go in the car with Omar bhai and Faruk bhai. After crossing a few check posts within Dhaka, I would get out of the car at my destination. But, there were occasions when the army stopped our cars and our hearts leapt in our mouths. If we were caught it would be all over. As a matter of fact, it wasn't the fear of death, it was the fear of torture. So without informing anyone at home, I would travel with them to and fro. My father would sometimes say "Ma be careful." Maybe he guessed something from the frequent visits of my freedom fighter friends . He never tried to stop me though, maybe cause he felt it wouldn't be any use. That how those times were, all we did we did because the times demanded it. bdnews24.com: During those days how close did you feel to the dream of liberation? Mini Quadir: When news of operations at different places in Dhaka were coming in, then it would be understood that freedom fighters had entered Dhaka. Our hopes gradually rose, maybe the dream of liberation isn't too far away! bdnews24.com: The demand to bring war criminals to justice is pretty strong this time. What is your take on this? Mini Quadir: You see, I don't understand politics. But like everyone else, I feel that war criminals should be bought to justice. I feel really bad. Many people, such as Jahanara mami (Jahanara Imam), went through so much, yet couldn't see war criminals being brought to justice on the soil of an independent Bangladesh. People might still say optimistically: "Don't worry, at least we will live to see them punished." But who will be alive to see it? bdnews24.com
