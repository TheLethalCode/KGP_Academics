<TITLE> Japan PM's support slides amid deep deadlock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Public support for Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda slid to just below 25 percent in a media poll published on Monday, the latest sign of voter doubts about his leadership in the face of a deepening political deadlock. Fukuda's falling popularity -- he boasted support rates of about 60 percent when he took office six months ago -- has sparked speculation that his ruling party may try to replace him before an election that could come this year. But analysts say ousting a premier is difficult. "Somebody has to take the initiative and draw out the knife," said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University. "It takes a bit of courage to do this." Public backing for 71-year-old Fukuda has taken a hit from his apparent failure to cope with a political deadlock born of a divided parliament. The stalemate has already left a vacancy at the top of the Bank of Japan and is now threatening tax measures needed to fund national and state budgets for the fiscal year from April 1, with no quick solution in sight. "It could turn into a very messy situation. Markets are not going to like it," said Robert Feldman, chief economist for Japan at Morgan Stanley Chase. The main opposition Democratic Party and smaller allies control parliament's upper house and can delay laws and veto appointments such as that of the BOJ governor. A survey by the Nikkei financial daily published the same day showed Fukuda's support among voters had slid nine points to 31 percent, in line with other recent polls. A rating of at least 30 percent is seen by many analysts as key to a government's survival, but previous premiers have hung on with less support. Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masaaki Shirakawa became acting governor last week after the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament rejected two government nominees for the job. BITTER BATTLE OVER Ruling and opposition parties are also locked in a bitter battle over a provisional gasoline tax whose revenues are dedicated to road construction that the government wants to extend when it expires on March 31 to avoid revenue gaps. The Democrats want to abolish the tax, which they consider a symbol of the long ruling Liberal Democratic Party's practice of wasteful spending on vested interests. The ruling bloc has called on the main opposition Democratic Party to hold talks on what it calls a compromise plan. But a senior opposition party executive on Monday dismissed the proposal as an attempt to deceive the public because it first calls for enactment of budget-related bills including the gas tax in time for the start of the new fiscal year on April 1. "This is the same as talks on not revising (the bill)," Democratic Party executive Kenji Yamaoka told reporters. Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura urged the opposition to negotiate and criticised their stern stance. "It is really doubtful whether they have a desire to resolve this," he told a news conference. Machimura, the top government spokesman, also brushed off a question about a snap election for parliament's lower house. No poll for the powerful lower chamber, where the ruling bloc has a huge majority, need be held until September 2009. But the Democrats want an early election in hopes of ousting the long-ruling LDP. "Would it be meaningful to have a snap election and create a vacuum?" Machimura asked. The Democrats, an often fractious group of former LDP members, ex-Socialists and hawkish younger lawmakers, have not benefited much from Fukuda's woes. Asked which party they supported, 30 percent of respondents to the Nikkei survey picked the Democrats while 40 percent opted for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. In addition, 65 percent of respondents to a survey by the Yomiuri daily said they did not highly rate Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa, a veteran lawmaker famed for his ability to sow political chaos.

Hong Kong rescuers stepped up searches on Monday for the seafarers of the Ukraine-registered tugboat Neftegaz-67. The vessel sank on Saturday night after colliding with another ship. The tugboat is now lying upside down on the seabed, 37 metres (122 feet) under water. Hong Kong officials said they couldn't ascertain if the sailors were alive or not, but said it was unlikely any survivors might last more than 12 hours if exposed to the present seawater temperature of around 17 degrees Celsius (62 degrees Fahrenheit). Meanwhile, divers sent down on repeated missions to scour the 80-metre long ship's exterior have not detected any signs of life. "They (divers) have been continuously knocking on the hull of the vessel to try and see if there's any response to indicate that there's anybody within the hull that's alive," said the director of Marine, Roger Tupper. "I have to be sorry to say that to date, in fact since we did the first dive on the hull yesterday morning, we haven't had any response," Tupper added. No other sailors have been found in surface searches around the wreck, Tupper added. Divers have made a number of attempts to get into the wreck, but adverse conditions were hampering efforts and divers had not yet found a way inside. "Conditions ... are extremely difficult, the current is very strong, the visibility is very, very short. It's completely dark. Even on a day like this it's absolutely black at 37 metres," Tupper said, adding the ship was sinking into mud on the seabed. A salvage boat had been deployed to drag the vessel to shallow waters, but officials said this plan was no longer feasible given the conditions. Instead, authorities have decided to call in Asia's largest salvage vessel, the "Hua Tianlong" from China, to assist with the extensive maritime search and rescue operation, Hong Kong's Cable TV said in a report, but it wasn't expected till later this week. The accident occurred on Saturday when the Ukrainian tug collided with a China-registered bulk carrier, the "Yao Hai" in Hong Kong's eastern waters off Lantau island. Of the tugboat's 25 crew, seven members including six Ukrainians and one Chinese have been rescued so far. The "Yao Hai", with 25 crew members aboard, suffered some minor damage but no injuries were report
