 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With the deciding third test against England all but lost, New Zealand pace bowler Tim Southee provided the crowd with a little excitement before the visitors wrapped up a 121-run victory on Wednesday. The 19-year-old debutant smashed 77 not out off just 40 balls, including nine sixes.

Southee, who took five wickets in England's first innings, evoked memories of compatriot Nathan Astle, who smashed 11 sixes in an innings of 222 when New Zealand unsuccessfully chased 550 for victory against England in Christchurch in 2002.
