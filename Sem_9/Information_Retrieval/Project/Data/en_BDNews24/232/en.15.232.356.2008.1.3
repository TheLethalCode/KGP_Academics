<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The owner of the recruiting agency, which allegedly cheated 100 returnees from Malaysia, Thursday claimed he had "divine proof" that he was no fraud. "I cried to Almighty Allah while performing Hajj and told Him that had I made any mistake please do not send me back unhurt, please end my life here on this sacred soil. "As I have come back to Bangladesh in good health, it proves that I have not cheated anyone," AHM Golam Kabir, owner of Kabir Enterprise, told reporters at a news conference at the Jatiya Press Club. On Monday, 25 returnees from Malaysia alleged at a press conference that Kabir Enterprise had sent them to Malaysia promising jobs on a company that turned out to be fake. The company's agent Dulal allegedly sold the 100 Bangladeshis to another Malaysian company which paid the workers up to Tk 4,000 a month and physically assaulted them when they would protest the exploitation. The workers told bdnews24.com that they used to pass days in Malaysia half-fed or without food. They came back home with the money their family members had sent out of Bangladesh. Kibria admitted that the company IH Technology did not pay the workers as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. "The company existed," he said. The owner in a written statement confessed that the workers "were appointed" in another company, Sejati Pati Sdn Bhd. "The workers who levelled the allegations against my company are out to destroy the labour market in Malaysia. Some unholy nexus is providing them with financial and other supports," Kibria said. The 'cheated' workers at Monday's press conference said the company had taken up to Tk 2 lakh from each of them. They said they had either sold their valuables or borrowed money to go to Malaysia for better jobs. "The company told us that we will be given up to 800 ringit per month, but they gave us only up to 400 ringit a month," Minhaz Ahmad, one of the workers, told bdbews24.com. "The agents used to take out up to 70 percent of our wage as costs of living and dining," he said. Other returnees present at the press conference made similar allegations against the company. bdne
