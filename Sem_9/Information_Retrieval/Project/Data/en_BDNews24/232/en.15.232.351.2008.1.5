 CAPE TOWN, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shivnarine Chanderpaul stood firm while West Indian wickets fell around him as South Africa closed in on victory in the second test on Saturday. West Indies were 161-6 in their second innings at lunch on the fourth day, a lead of 83 runs. The patient Chanderpaul batted for three hours for his unbeaten 33. He faced 101 balls and hit two fours. Chanderpaul and Jerome Taylor slowed South Africa's progress with their stand of 28 for the unbroken seventh wicket. Taylor, who was dropped on one, was 21 not out. Chris Gayle, who batted with a runner because of a hamstring injury, retired hurt on one when he was hit on the thumb by the fourth ball of the day, which was bowled by paceman Andre Nel. Nel struck a different kind of blow when his steepling delivery to Dwayne Bravo (12) took the outside edge and was caught by Graeme Smith at first slip. Three overs later, Rawl Lewis (1) played forward to a delivery from left-arm spinner Paul Harris, edging the ball onto his pad and into the hands of Hashim Amla at short leg. West Indies might have lost their seventh wicket eight balls after that when Taylor steered a sharply bouncing ball from fast bowler Makhaya Ntini to first slip, where Smith dropped the catch. Nel went to lunch with figures of 2-27 from 22 overs, and fast bowler Jacques Kallis conceded just 19 runs in his 13 overs. West Indies lead the three-match series 1-0
