<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Reporters Unity Sunday said it had cancelled a scheduled press conference by a grieving father over the death of his baby girl at the instruction of the organisation's president. Shafiqul Islam, a businessman from Chawkbazar in Old Dhaka, said he booked the hall room of the DRU for Jan 1 to go public with a statement but the DRU cancelled the booking without citing any reason. His 1-month-old daughter Afia died from what he alleged was "wrong treatment" at LabAid Hospital on Dec 27. A letter signed by DRU general secretary Ilyas Khan and sent to the members of the organisation Saturday said the president, Alamgir Hossain, ordered the cancellation on Dec 31 at the request of a senior journalist. The decision was conveyed to Shafiqul on the evening of Dec 31, the letter said, adding the incident seriously damaged the image of the DRU. Shafiqul had told bdnews24.com that another member of the organisation called in the police to him and his family from talking with journalists in front of the DRU office in Segun Bagicha. DRU executive committee at a meeting on Jan 3 served a notice on the DRU member, Madhusudan Mandal, also acting president of the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB), asking him to respond to the allegation in three days. Alamgir defended his action at the meeting of the executive committee meeting, saying he had cancelled the booking at the request of journalist AMB Musa. Musa denied having made such request. Alamgir also said the death of the baby was not mentioned in the application for the booking, Ilyas, the DRU general secretary, told bdnews24.com. Ilyas quoted Alamgir as saying at the meeting that Musa had told him that an attempt to reach a compromise with Shafiqul, the father, was going on and so, there was nothing to say in the press briefing. Reached, Musa told the bdnews24.com by telephone Sunday, "I did not ask for cancellation of the press conference." "I said LabAid authorities have come to know that a press conference is going to be held [over the death of the child]. I made a request whether the views of both sides could be presented following the journalistic ethics. I did not make any request [ to cancel the press briefing]." Speaking to bdnews24.com Thursday, Madhusudan denied the allegation against him and said, "I have no relation with the press conference." Madhusudan said he was working for a private TV station named "Ekattur", which was yet to go on the air. LabAid Group is financing the channel and Musa is the channel's chairman, he added. bdnews24.com could not reach Alamgir for comment as multiple calls to his cellphone went unanswered. bdnews
