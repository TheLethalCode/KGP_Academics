<TITLE> Spanish PM in surprise Lebanon visit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero paid a surprise visit on Saturday to Spanish peacekeeping troops serving in south Lebanon. Zapatero was accompanied by Defence Minister Jose Antonio Alonso on the visit to 1,100 Spanish troops who form part of the United Nations peacekeeping force UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. Last June a car bomb killed six members of UNIFIL's Spanish battalion -- three Spaniards and three Colombians -- on patrol near the south Lebanese town of Khiyam. Spain suspects the attack was the work of al Qaeda-inspired militants. "This mission sometimes requires big sacrifices from you ... and we remember on this occasion our colleagues martyred last year for the sake of this mission," Zapatero said at the Spanish battalion's base in Marjayoun. "Peace in this region is directly linked to peace in the world, stability and fighting global terrorism ... This is the most important mission that Spain is contributing to in the world with its many troops under the United Nations umbrella." UNIFIL has grown to 13,500 troops and naval personnel from 27 countries under a U.N. Security Council resolution that halted the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas. Zapatero earlier met Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, whose pro-Western government is locked in dispute with the Hezbollah-led opposition over a deal to elect a president even though both sides back army chief General Michel Suleiman to fill the post. Lebanon has been without a president since the term of the pro-Syrian Emile Lahoud ended on Nov. 23.
