 CONAKRY, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters burned tyres and built barricades in the streets of the Guinean capital Conakry on Friday after President Lansana Conte dismissed his information minister, in an apparent snub to a consensus prime minister. A presidential decree late on Thursday replaced government spokesman Justin Morel Junior a day after he read a statement on state television from Prime Minister Lansana Kouyate which called a New Year's address by the reclusive Conte a "hoax". Conte's address had criticised Kouyate's track record on fighting corruption and tackling inflation since he was appointed last year to defuse anti-government riots which left more than 100 protesters dead in the West African country. The prime minister's statement said the presidential address was drafted by "certain elements opposed to change", in the latest sign of a rift between the premier and entrenched ruling cliques.

A police source said Kouyate had been urgently summoned to the presidential palace on Wednesday after his statement was broadcast. Junior's dismissal appeared to be an affront to the authority of Kouyate, who has the right to name and dismiss members of his cabinet under the terms of the deal to end last year's political disturbances in the world's largest bauxite exporter.

"It would mark a precedent in his relations with Conte and his only option would be to resign." In a previous blow to Kouyate's authority, a Dec. 5 presidential decree reassigned control of government business to Presidency Secretary-General Sam Mamadi Soumah, a close ally of the veteran Conte who has ruled Guinea with an iron fist since seizing power in a military coup in 1984. Watnesses in Conakry saw black smoke rising over one district of the coastal city, while shops in the main Madina market pulled down their shutters. Youths prowled the streets brandishing stones and piece of wood. "We are not going to accept this decree," said one demonstrator. "The president does not have the right to dismiss a minister without consulting the prime ministe
