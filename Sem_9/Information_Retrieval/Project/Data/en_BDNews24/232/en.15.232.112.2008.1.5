 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh loses Tk 7,000 crore a year to corruption, Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Saturday. "Had this money been used properly the nation would have progressed further," he said in his address to elected representatives of the local government at a conference at the National Parade Square in Dhaka. "After taking the reins of the ACC, I have met and discussed with people of different positions. I came to know about the reasons and the extent of corruption. Corruption spreads mainly because of a lack of values. We have all united in our stance against corruption." He added: "Many blame our habits and poverty for corruption. And 70 percent of our population is poor. But not everyone is corrupt." "We can't blame corruption on poverty. There is a psychological side to being corrupt. We must unite in our attempts to fight corruption. Peoples' representatives are the biggest media through which we can raise awareness and start our anticorruption drive. For this to happen, all the representatives must contribute," he said. "Due to the corruption by a few people, the country now stands as the number one most corrupt nation. This is an embarrassment for us. Not everyone is corrupt. So why should we tolerate this insult? We have to fight corruption with everyone's efforts. The elected representatives and all of us must not tolerate corruption," he said. Along with elected representatives of the local government institutions, army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan, and Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed spoke at the conference. The conference was chaired by local government adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal. bdnews24
