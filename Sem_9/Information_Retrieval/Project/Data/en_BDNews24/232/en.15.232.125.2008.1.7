<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government has finalised the draft law on separation of the Election Commission secretariat, the law adviser said Monday. "The legal infrastructure for an independent Election Commission secretariat has been prepared," Mainul Hosein told reporters at his Baridhara home. "A few amendments are yet to be finished," he said, speaking after he enlisted as a voter along with family members. "The EC has been given freedom and it has been working independently," Mainul added. The EC secretariat is now under the Chief Adviser's Office. It will be separated from the Prime Minister's Office (currently the Chief Adviser's Office) after the draft law is introduced. "The EC is working to hold the polls by the end of this year. They may take place before the scheduled timeframe," mainul, aslo the information adviser, said. Voter registration with photograph is scheduled to end by October and the elections are due by Dec in line with the EC's election timeline. "The election is to be held with a proper voter roll for the first time. There is no chance that fake voters will be enrolled in the list." Mainul lauded both the EC and the caretaker government for the achievement. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal had earlier proposed simultaneously holding local govt and parliamentary elections. Commenting on the proposal, Mainul said: "It is possible to hold the two elections together. But it is also possible to hold them separately." The EC will decide; it being their job, he said. "But I personally think it will be good if the elections to city corporations are held separately," he added. bdnews24.com/br
