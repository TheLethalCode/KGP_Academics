<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Information adviser Mainul Hosein said on Monday a certain group was out to push the government into trouble using insignificant issues as weapons. He, however, would not name that group. The government is working taking risks to uphold the democracy, he said, as he spoke to a seminar on "Freedom of the Press and People's Right to Know". The state-run Press Institute of Bangladesh organised the seminar in the city. "The government is working to secure the democracy. The administration is dealing with the situation with patience and guts," he said. He said the prices of rice started falling since the imported rice had been supplied to the market. Information secretary Jamil Osman chaired the meeting. He claimed the government ensured freedom of the press since it wanted to hold a free and fair election. bdnews24
