 Tehran, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Iranian women's rights activists were released on bail on Wednesday after spending more than a month in Tehran's Evin prison accused of spreading propaganda against the state, a fellow campaigner said. "They came out and we are at a friend's house now," activist Sussan Tahmasebi told Reuters after the release of Jelveh Javaheri and Maryam Hosseinkhah who she said were detained on Dec. 1 and Nov. 18 respectively. The ISNA news agency also said they had been freed, citing their lawyer. Tahmasebi said bail was set at 50 million rials ($5,300) each in the form of a guaranteed bank cheque. A U.S.-based rights group last month called on Iran to drop "politically motivated" charges against the two activists facing trial for taking part in a protest and said they should be freed immediately. New York-based Human Rights Watch said they were active in a drive to collect one million signatures in favour of greater female rights. They were also among a group of women who took part in a banned demonstration in Tehran last March. Campaigners say Iran discriminates against women, a charge Tehran denies. Western diplomats in Iran and rights groups see the crackdown on women as part of broader moves against dissent. Javaheri was charged in December with "disturbing the public opinion," "propaganda", and "publishing lies via the publication of false news," Human Rights Watch said, adding that Hosseinkhah faced similar charges in November. Iran routinely dismisses accusations of rights violations and says it is acting on the basis of Islamic sharia law. Although Iranian women are legally entitled to hold most jobs, the Islamic Republic remains a male-dominated society. Campaigners, backed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, say it is difficult for women to get a divorce. They also criticise inheritance laws they say are unjust and the fact that a woman's court testimony is worth half that of a man's. Women cannot run for president or become judges but in recent years they have started to work in police and fire departments and there are also female members of parliament
