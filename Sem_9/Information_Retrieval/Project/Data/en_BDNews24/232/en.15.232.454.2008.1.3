 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)The National Board of Revenue has started working on the national budget for fiscal 2008-09, officials said Thursday. The NBR took up a new system to make the budget. Earlier, all district chambers and associations had sent their proposals through FBCCI, the apex body of industrialists and businessmen, to the NBR. The annual budget had been laid out in the light of those proposals. This year, business chambers in metropolitan cities and divisions will send proposals to the NBR direct. BGMEA, BKMEA and other organisations of importers and exporters have to send their proposals straight to the NBR as well. Only district chambers have to send their proposals through the FBCCIthe same as before. Proposals or recommendations have to reach Jamal Hossain, NBR official for budget coordination, by Jan 31, according to a decision taken at a meeting of NBR Thursday. NBR chairman Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com by phone: "In the past, the budget was prepared in a hurry. This time we have already started working on it." All budget activities will be complete by April, before a participatory, people-oriented and balanced budget is formally announced in June. The Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB), Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) and all professional organisations, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and other research organisations, and representatives of civil society could send recommendations by the deadline. After receiving proposals and recommendations, the NBR will hold a pre-budget sector-wise discussion with trade bodies and other stakeholders in mid-February. The discussion will continue through March. bdnews
