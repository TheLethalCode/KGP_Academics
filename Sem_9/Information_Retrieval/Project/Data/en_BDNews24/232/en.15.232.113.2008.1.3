<TITLE> Ghosts haunt Tigers ahead of 50th Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will try to be positive despite the humiliating defeat in the last game of the one-day series against New Zealand when the first of the two Tests starts in Dunedin Friday. The ghosts of Queensland may, however, prove difficult to shrug off for the Tigers after New Zealand raced to 95/0 in just 6 overs after the tourists made 93 all out in 37.5 overs in the final one-dayer. Bangladesh's Australian coach Jamie Siddons said his players were approaching the Test with a positive mindset, hoping to build on the experience. "We've got a lot of young boys that are going to have a lot of bad days before they have some good ones," said Siddons. "How will we react? We're capable of anything. We could respond really well, or we could capitulate -- that's how good we are," Siddons was quoted by the New Zealand Press Association as saying. The team management has kept spinner Abdur Razzak, all-rounder Farhad Reza, middle order batsmen Saqib Al Hasan and Rajin Saleh out of the playing eleven as it has decided to play three pacers. Openers Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique and pacer Sajidul Islam are all set to make Test debut while Shahriar Nafees, who used to open the innings, is likely to bat at number five. A total of 47 cricketers earlier represented Bangladesh in 49 Tests. Junaned is going to take a bow in Test cricket having played just three ODIs while Sajidul is yet to play any international match. Bangladesh, trounced by the Black Caps 3-0 in the ODI series, will look for a drastic batting improvement if they want to make their 50th Test something to look back at. The fact that the Tigers have not played Test cricket for the last five months is going to weigh up against them. "My new year's resolution revolves around seeing the team better its Test record and become more competitive in this form of the game," captain Mohammad Ashraful was quoted as saying by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "It's fair to admit that we haven't improved as expected in 49 appearances in the last eight years," said Ashraful, whose side have won just one Test against lowly Zimbabwe in 49 Tests. Newest test nation Bangladesh never offered any challenge to the Kiwis in Test and conceded innings defeat in all four Tests they have played against them. Bangladesh managed the highest 205 runs in a Test innings in New Zealand on their first-ever tour in 2001 and 262 against the same rivals came three years later at home. Following the one-sided series triumph, New Zealand have vowed to show Bangladesh no mercy in the Test series too. Captain Daniel Vettori urged his players not to take pity on Bangladesh and adopt the same ruthless attitude the Australians show against weaker opponents. "You can see what they (Australia) can do when they play well -- we have to take a leaf out of their book and go from there," Vettori told the New Zealand Press Association on Thursday. "Two wins against Bangladesh are pretty precious to us," he said. "We haven't played a lot of test cricket and when we have we haven't been going too well." The New Zealand selectors reacted to the loss in South Africa by wielding the axe on some senior players and giving several players the chance to impress against Bangladesh. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Habibul Bashar, Mohammad Ashraful, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Mushfiqur Rahman, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shahadat Hossain, Sajidul Islam and Enamul Haq Junior. b
