 CAIRO, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria and Lebanon's parliamentary majority leader support an Arab plan to end the constitutional crisis in Lebanon, which has not had a president since Nov. 23, diplomatic and political sources said on Sunday. Arab foreign ministers are expected to approve on Sunday a resolution close to the draft plan, which says a national unity government in Lebanon should be formed in such a way that no one party can impose or block any decision. The draft endorses the choice of army chief General Michel Suleiman as the next president of Lebanon and says that he should be the arbiter in any contested decision.

The Lebanese parliament is set to try for a 12th time to confirm Suleiman as president on Jan. 12 but until the Arab ministers came up with their plan it looked unlikely to succeed. Electing a president requires a two-thirds quorum that neither camp holds. The draft resolution says the election of Suleiman as president should take place immediately, along with immediate agreement to form a national unity government "such that the composition does not allow any decision to be imposed or blocked by any one party". "The President of the Republic should have the final say (in case of disagreement)," it added. After the election of the president and the formation of a government, work should start on drafting a new law governing parliamentary elections, the draft sa
