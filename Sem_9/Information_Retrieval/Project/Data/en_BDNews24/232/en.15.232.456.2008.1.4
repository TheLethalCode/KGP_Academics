 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  The 33 police stations under Dhaka Metropolitan Police recorded nearly twice the cases related to vandalism, women and children repression, mugging, theft and other crimes in 2007 than in the previous year. However, DMP Commissioner Naim Ahmed, told bdnews24.com: "An increase in the filing of cases does not mean deterioration of law and order." "The increase we have seen in cases filed is because people's confidence in the police has grown," the commissioner said. "Earlier, there was a tendency among police officers not to accept cases, but now that has changed," he added. "At the same time, the service delivery system introduced in the city [ police stations ] to help the common people has also encouraged them to file cases," Naim said. Following the 'changeover' on 1/11, the methods and nature of crime appear to have changed, with professional criminals using new techniques in conducting their activities over the year gone by, according to law enforcers and other experts in the field. Although political killings decreased in 2007 from those in 2006, the total number of killings throughout the year remained the same, according to available data. When asked why the number of murders had not come down, though incidence of political killings had dropped, the police chief said: "If killings take place as a sequel to previous rivalries, it is not possible for the police to control them." "In 2007, the number of such killings was up. However, as police remained more alert, the number of casualties in such clashes dropped significantly." DMP statistics show a total of 15,831 cases related to vandalism, killing, women and children repression, theft and other crimes recorded with 33 police stations of the metropolis in 2006. In 2007, the number of cases almost doubled, standing at 24,713. In 2007, incidents of killing in the city were almost the same as the year 2006. In 2006, 346 murder cases were filed with the police in the capital. According to DMP statistics, 340 such cases were filed in the capital in 2007, including seven murders reported in the last six days of the year. Last year, the rate of women' repression increased alarmingly in the capital. In 2006, police in the city recorded a total of 851 cases whereas for 2007 the number of such cases stood at 1,594 up to December 25. Last year, the number of armed robberies in the metropolitan area also went up significantly. In 2006, a total of 58 cases were filed in connection with such incidents. Up to December 25, 2007, police in the capital recorded 98 robbery cases. The number of vandalism-related cases also increased last year. In 2006 160 cases of vandalism were vfiled with police stations in the capital. The number to December 25, 2007, was 447. Incidents of theft also increased in the city last year. Meanwhile, Yaba was a new and dangerous addition to the city crime scene. The Yaba trade dominated crime news in the country. Though the deadly drug entered the country a few years ago, the biggest haul of Yaba was made in 2007. RAB arrested Aminul Hudanephew of businessman Aziz Mohammad Bhaiand an accomplice on October 25 for alleged links to the Yaba trade. On November 4, RAB members arrested the managing director of Hotel Purbani International, Mahbubur Rahman Joynal, and girlfriend Jannatul Ferdous Niki. The elite force had earlier raided Joynal's Dhanmondi house, recovering local and foreign currency worth Tk 28.5 crore, gold and diamond jewellery, alcohol and firearms. bdnews24.comans
