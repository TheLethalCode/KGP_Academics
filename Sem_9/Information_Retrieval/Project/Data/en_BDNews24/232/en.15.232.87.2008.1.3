 MOSCOW, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it would consider provocative any attempt by Britain to reopen regional offices of the British Council, its cultural arm, in comments that showed no sign a diplomatic spat is easing. Russia on Dec. 12 ordered the British government's cultural arm to halt work from Jan. 1 at all its regional offices, saying Britain had broken a host of international and domestic rules. The move is considered to be part of a broader diplomatic row, sparked by the murder of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of the Kremlin who was poisoned by radiation in London in November 2006. Britain this week reiterated that the British Council operates with full legal status and said it hoped offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg will reopen after the New Year break, which usually lasts for about two weeks. "We assume that the British side will act by the Russian laws and will stop the illegal activities of the Council," said Mikhail Kamynin, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman. "Any other action would be of provocative character and would aim at worsening the situation in bilateral relations," Kamynin said in a statement, the first official comments on the issue in 2008. Relations between Britain and Russia are at their worst since the Cold War, soured by the Litvinenko murder, mutual espionage allegations and the political asylum given by Britain to prominent Russian enemies of President Vladimir Putin. Russia said Britain had broken rules while registering 15 regional offices of the British Council, a claim London denies. The Council had earlier closed regional offices everywhere in Russia except Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. The last two have been closed for a break since the New Year. The British Council has said it hoped to reopen the offices after the New Year and was in discussion with Russian authorities to resolve the issue over the next two weeks. Kamynin said the Council's office in Moscow would continue to operate but made no mention of any discussion involving regional offices. He also said Moscow was unhappy about the involvemnet of third parties. In December, the European Union called on Russia to withdraw its demand the British Council shut its offices. "We are surprised by Britain's attempt not only to defy the obvious, but to involve in the discussion other countries, especially the European Union, which are doomed to be on the side of the loser," he said. Britain in July expelled four diplomats in response to Russia's refusal to extradite another former state security agent, Andrei Lugovoy, to stand trial for Litvinenko's murder. Russia followed that by expelling four British diplomats. Lugovoy denies any part in the murder.
