<TEXT>
 Warsaw, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland is ready to send 400 additional soldiers to Afghanistan in April or May and is considering taking command of troops in an eastern province, the defence minister said on Wednesday. Bogdan Klich said Poland had started talks with NATO to regroup Polish forces and would hold talks in Washington in January about taking control in Paktika. Some 1,200 Polish troops are in Afghanistan and Klich had already approved expanding the deployment. "Achieving strategic or political goals when troops are so spread out is impossible," Klich told TVN24 private broadcaster. Poland is the biggest ex-communist member of NATO and future plans for its troops could be decided in mid-January, when Klich visits Washington. However, Klich and his counterpart Robert Gates could also concentrate on the US plans to launch parts of global anti-missile defence system on Polish soil
