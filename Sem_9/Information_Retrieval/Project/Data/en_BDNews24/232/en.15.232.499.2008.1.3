 GENEVA, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiators returned to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on Thursday to tackle the remaining obstacles to a deal in agriculture, considered crucial to clinching an overall agreement in the Doha free trade round. The climate for the talks has changed dramatically since the round was launched in 2001 to repeal the politically sensitive rich-country farming subsidies and tariffs that poor farmers said made it impossible for them to compete. Record food prices have eased pressures on governments to support farmers with subsidies, and worries about food-price inflation and even security of food supplies have prompted some to cut import tariffs, shifting the focus of the talks. And growing protectionist pressure in rich countries is making it harder for the WTO's 151 member states to reach an overall deal. Trade negotiators said the nine days of talks called by New Zealand's WTO ambassador Crawford Falconer, who chairs the farm negotiations, would focus on technical issues such as how to designate and treat sensitive products that countries want to shield from tariff cuts. Diplomats said they would leave the big headline numbers, such as the size of cuts to farm subsidies and tariffs, for senior politicians to settle at the climax of the round. "That's minister stuff. We set it up. We get it as close as we can and get it to the point where the ministers can come in," said one rich country negotiator. SPECIAL PRODUCTS Agriculture is key to the success of the whole Doha process because of the importance of farming to developing countries who are supposed to be the special beneficiaries of the round. Developing countries want rich nations to cut farm tariffs and subsidies in exchange for opening up their own markets to industrial goods and services. One of the main issues still to be resolved in the Geneva talks is the treatment of "special products" in agriculture. WTO members have agreed that developing countries would be able to exempt some farm products from generally agreed tariff cuts, but there is still no agreement on how they will be treated and how many can be designated. A group of 45 developing countries, known as the G-33, said two weeks ago that any deal must allow developing countries to completely exempt some special products from tariff cuts. But developing food exporters like Brazil, Argentina and Thailand are joining rich countries in resisting this. Falconer hopes the talks this week and next will narrow the gaps enough for him to draft a revision later this month of the negotiating document he first produced last July. Trade negotiators said the talks, among three dozen key delegations, would cover the full range of agriculture negotiations, starting off this week on domestic support, or matters related to subsidies. Next week they would move on to market access, or tariffs, and then finish with export competition, including areas such as food aid and export credits, and the sensitive topic of cotton. Falconer will brief all the WTO's members on the talks on Friday next week, negotiators said. Just before Christmas, Falconer circulated documents reflecting the past four months of talks. Among other things they set a schedule for rich countries to implement cuts in subsidies and propose exemptions from cuts for new WTO membe
