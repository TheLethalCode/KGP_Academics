 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Summit Power has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval of the rights shares, the company said Saturday. The company said it now had no director on its board who have defaulted on loan payment. The capital market regulator initially declined to approve the application since Fazlul Haque, an independent director of the company, was defaulted on payment of loan taken against one of his family businesses. The director then resigned and the board of directors accepted the resignation, according to a company statement. The decision to issue four rights shares against every five shares was taken at extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of the company on Sep 29, 2007. Summit Power is currently working to set up four power plants with a total capacity of 110 MW. The company has said that it has made an arrangement with its majority shareholder Summit Industrial & Mercantile Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. to provide subordinate financial assistance for work of the four power plants continue unhindered. The company has assured the investors that issuance of right shares will take place at the earliest opportunity through an EGM once it gets the regulatory body's nod. bdnews2
