<TITLE> Asian stocks recoil on US recession fears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Thursday after weak US manufacturing data and record oil prices renewed fears of a recession in the world's biggest economy and sent investors towards the safety of gold. US crude oil futures and spot gold eased in Asia after touching all-time highs in the previous session, but analysts expect a further run-up in both. Indonesia's OPEC governor Maizar Rahman told Reuters that the price of oil may climb towards levels around $100-$110 and said the oil cartel could increase output at its next meeting. Higher energy costs comes just as data released on Wednesday showed a key U.S. manufacturing index shrank in December for the first time in nearly a year, darkening the outlook for Asia's top export market. European stocks were seen mixed, with financial bookmakers expecting a higher open in Britain's FTSE 100, but a drop in Germany's DAX and the French CAC 40. "People are showing concern about the overall global growth outlook. Oil is an underlying cost that a lot of companies face," said White Funds Management portfolio manager Angus Gluskie. "It also represents an increase in inflation that central banks around the world will have to deal with." Some analysts are even voicing the fears of U.S. stagflation as minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting shows it grappling with a credit crunch that may require more interest rate cuts. The Fed has cut rates by 100 basis points since September, with its latest action on Dec. 11 when it eased by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan fell 1 percent by 0605 GMT after hitting earlier its lowest since Dec. 24. Tokyo markets remained closed for the new year holidays, and will re-open on Friday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index lost 1 percent, while market falls in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong were well above 1 percent. Asian companies that depend on a healthy U.S. economy, such as South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor, slumped after the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index showed U.S. factory production dropped to 47.7 last month, its weakest since April 2003. Airline and utility stocks such as Korea Electric Power Corp that rely on oil were also hit. Chinese airline shares fell especially sharply, with China Eastern slumping 7.5 percent on uncertainty about its plan to sell a US$920 million stake in itself to Singapore Airlines and Temasek Holdings Talk of a rival bid from Air China sent shares in the world's top carrier by market value down 8.7 percent. The winners of the day were oil-related shares such as Australia's Woodside Petroleum and gold producers such as Zijin Mining Centro Properties Group surged 7.7 percent on a media report that Blackstone Group and Citadel Investment may be in talks to take a stake in the Australian firm, which owns shopping malls in the United States. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that Citadel was eyeing part of Centro. SEEING GOLD US light crude for February delivery fell to $99.46 a barrel, but was still near the $100 hit on Wednesday amid expectations of thinning US stockpiles, the falling US dollar and geopolitical risks in countries such as Nigeria. Oil surged nearly 60 percent in 2007, but some investors like long-time commodities bull Jim Rogers predict more gains. "I sound like a broken record, but it ain't over yet. It's got a long way to go," he told Reuters on Thursday. "It's come a ways, but we may be in the fourth inning of a nine-inning ball game, to speak in US baseball terms." Spot gold dipped to $856.30/857.20, below an all-time high of $861 an ounce on Wednesday, but analysts say the metal could also gain more as the uncertainty about the global economy and surging oil prices leaves it the safe haven of choice. The price of gold rose more than 30 percent last year, its biggest annual gain since 1979. The dollar gained ground against the euro and the Japanese yen after easing overnight, although the weak US economic outlook, record oil prices and expectations for more Fed rate cuts kept it on a weak footing. The US currency was quoted at 109.5 yen after hitting its lowest level in more than a month at 109.21 yen on Wednesday, but trading was thinner due to the Japanese holida
