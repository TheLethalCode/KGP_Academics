 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index rose early on Friday, ahead of closely watched US employment data, with rising commodity prices boosting miners and oil stocks. BP rose 1.3 percent and Royal Dutch Shell was up 0.6 percent as US crude prices crossed the psychologically important $100 a barrel mark on Thursday. Oil was steady on Friday at about $99 a barrel. Gold held near record highs as a weak dollar and the expectation of further US interest rate cuts boosted demand.
