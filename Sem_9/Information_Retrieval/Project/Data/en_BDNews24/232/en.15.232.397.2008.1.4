<TITLE> POLL-BoE to wait until February for next UK rate cut </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of England will wait another month before cutting interest rates again, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, although economists now say rates will fall three times this year to 4.75 percent. A survey of 63 economists conducted this week found the majority expect the Monetary Policy Committee will follow its December 25 basis point rate cut with another to 5.25 percent when it updates its quarterly forecasts next month. Only 12 say the MPC will trim them on Thursday, Jan. 10 at its next meeting. The strong consensus around February comes despite the MPC's unanimous decision to cut last month, which caught analysts off guard, as well as unexpected news from the minutes to the meeting that policymakers had even discussed a half point cut. "We would not rule out a cut in rates this time," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. "However it seems more likely that the committee will hold its fire, as the fear of inflation pressures encourages it to adopt a more cautious line on rates." News on Friday that Britain's dominant services sector partly recovered in December from a sharp slip -- and with accelerating price pressures -- may also give policymakers cause to pausing. Inflation was 2.1 percent in November, just above the MPC's target. While economists attached only a median 35 percent probability to a January move, they are now looking for more cuts than previously, expecting UK rates to fall to 4.75 percent by the fourth quarter. One month ago, 5.0 percent was the expected floor for the forecast horizon. One reason for waiting is to avoid spooking the markets, some analysts said. Sterling is already trading well below $2 and is near record lows against the euro . "A swift follow-up easing might be interpreted as a signal of deeper problems in the UK economy, perhaps the wrong prescription when restoring confidence is one factor in fostering a proper functioning of money markets," said Daragh Maher at Calyon in London. STILL SOME DOUBT But there is good reason for financial markets, still embroiled in a credit squeeze that started in August, to be nervous over the January decision. Many economists are haunted by the experience a year ago when all but one analyst polled by Reuters predicted the BoE would wait until February to raise rates only for the bank to go ahead with it in January. But much has changed since then, with talk of overheating and rampant house price inflation turning to worries about a hard landing for the UK economy and oil prices at $100 a barrel. House prices have fallen sharply over the past few months, official mortgage approvals have hit a three-year low and some trouble is brewing on the high street. Shares in British retailer DSG International Plc , whose store chains include Currys and PC world, tumbled by nearly a quarter of their value on Thursday after it gave a profit warning owing to slow computer sales over Christmas. Over the past few months large investment banks have written off billions of dollars stemming from the unravelling of the U.S. housing market and the rampant securitisation of home loans doled out to people who couldn't afford them. For months, a general sense has pervaded the City of London that policymakers have been somewhat late to respond. "Rapidly slowing growth in the housing and core retail sectors and negative signals from producer surveys indicate that the BoE has fallen behind the curve," said Lena Komileva, G7 market economist at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon. "Although an aggressive policy response at this stage could help prevent a 'hard landing' scenario for the real economy it is unlikely to reignite growth.
