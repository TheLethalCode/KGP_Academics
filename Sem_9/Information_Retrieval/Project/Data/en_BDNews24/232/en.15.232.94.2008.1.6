<TITLE> Japan opposition aims for poll after budget passes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition party is likely to wait for budget passage in March to push for a snap election rather than aim for an earlier poll by censuring the prime minister this month, a party leader said on Sunday. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who took office in September, faces a tough time getting key legislation through parliament, where the opposition Democratic Party and its smaller allies control the upper house and can delay laws. Pundits predict that the deadlock will force a lower house election this year. In the first major clash of 2008, the ruling bloc is set to use its two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house to force through a bill to resume Japan's naval mission in support of U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan after its expected rejection by the upper chamber this week. "Our resolve is firm," ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general Bunmei Ibuki told NHK television when asked if the ruling camp would take the rare step of overriding an upper house rejection. Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa insists that Japan's refuelling of U.S. and other ships in the Indian Ocean, halted last year when enabling legislation expired, violates the country's pacifist constitution. But close security ally Washington says the activities are vital to the war against terrorism, and Fukuda has vowed to enact a new law before parliament's current session ends on Jan 15. The Democrats had threatened to counter with the first-ever parliamentary censure to be passed against a prime minister in hopes of forcing an election. But with many voters more concerned about pocketbook issues such as pensions. and Fukuda likely to ignore the non-binding motion anyway, such a step could fizzle. CENSURE "NOT AUTOMATIC" Democratic Party senior executive Naoto Kan said the submission of a censure motion would not be automatic if the ruling bloc railroaded the bill through. "I think that a mandate from the people should be sought around the time that the budget is enacted, and we want to make efforts in that direction," he said. The national budget, usually passed in late March, can take effect without upper house approval, but related bills to implement it require both chambers' approval. Support for Fukuda's cabinet has fallen sharply, hit by a defence procurement scandal and government mishandling of millions of public pension records. A survey by the Mainichi newspaper published on Sunday showed that 46 percent of voters who responded wanted the Democrats to win the next election while 33 percent preferred the LDP. Still, the Democratic Party, an often-fractious amalgam of former LDP members, ex-socialists and hawkish young conservatives, is thought to be ill-prepared for an election now. Ibuki said the long-ruling LDP would also prefer to wait. "But we have to be prepared if the other side does things like stall bills for their own party interests," added the LDP's No. 2 executive, who appeared on the show wearing a traditional "jinbaori" kimono worn by samurai to do battle. The next general election need not take place until late 2009.
