 TEHRAN, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some of the heaviest snowfalls in years caused severe transport disruptions in Iran on Sunday, forcing the cancellation of most flights and the closure of many roads, Iranian media said. All international and domestic flights to and from Tehran were cancelled and some cities in northern Iran saw their first snow in 20 years. State radio said many roads to and from Tehran were also closed. "All international flights ... to and from Imam Khomeini International Airport have been cancelled," aviation authority spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh told Reuters, referring to Tehran's international airport. A later statement, reported by the state broadcaster, said there would be no flights to or from that airport until 9 a.m. (0530 GMT) on Monday. Flights at 15 other airports in the Middle Eastern country were also cancelled, state radio said. The authorities closed all schools in Tehran and children were told to stay at home also in other cities, with snow falling in northern, eastern and central regions The official IRNA news agency said schools and universities in Tehran and some other cities would stay closed on Monday. The agency, quoting an official source, also said all government offices would be shut on Monday and Tuesday. Thousands of motorists and passengers were stuck in the snow and police helped them find shelter in mosques and elsewhere, the media said. At one point, 15,000 people were stranded on a highway between the cities of Qazvin and Zanjan west of Tehran. Tehran's normally clogged roads were quieter than usual, with those braving the weather driving cautiously to avoid accidents. Tehran is located at the foothills of the Alborz mountain range, home to several ski resorts. Snow often falls on the capital in winter but usually involves light falls over most of the city that becomes heavier in higher, northern suburbs.
