 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman Friday asked the government to move toward elections and hold the voting well before the end of 2008, if possible. "The government has taken two years for the elections. Supporting their roadmap, I say to them to move toward polls," Zillur said. "If possible, hold elections before the schedule announced in the roadmap." he added, as he attended the 60th anniversary of the Bangladesh Chhatra League at the party's Dhanmondi office. The AL Thursday demanded that the government hold polls in June/July, saying that the government has failed to tackle various crises, including soaring prices of daily commodities. About the treatment of the detained party chief Sheikh Hasina, Zillur said: "We want better treatment for her. We will accept the suggestions of the medical board." "If the board suggests she be sent abroad for better treatment, we will support that. If the board says it's better she undergoes treatment in the country, we have no problem with that either." Party's policymaking presidium member Tofail Ahmed also expressed concern over soaring prices of daily commodities. "Such a crisis would never have occurred if the government would have been competent in its management," he said while speaking at the function. He said the government was talking to various organisations but not to the politicians. Sitting with the politicians would be the only viable option to implement the polls roadmap, he added. "If something alternative is unveiled (by the government), the people won't accept that," Tofail said. BCL president Mahmud Hasan Ripon, speaking on the 60th anniversary of his organisation, demanded freedom for Hasina. Before the meeting, the BCL leaders placed wreaths at the portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi. bdnews24.com/su
