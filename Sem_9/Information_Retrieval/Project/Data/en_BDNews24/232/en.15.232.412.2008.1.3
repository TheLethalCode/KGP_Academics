 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com) - The World Food Programme said Thursday it was keen to help Bangladesh procure 500,000 tonnes of rice in the quickest possible time, as the nation is reeling under soaring prices of the staple amid fears of a food crisis. By February, the UN food agency will dispatch about 30,000 tonnes of rice for cyclone victims, WFP officials said. The assurance came in a meeting between foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, WFP officials and other donor agencies. The government is also looking to import another 100,000 tonnes of rice from Thailand. The latest efforts are being seen as the government's delayed wake-up to the crisis, as the administration tries to ensure adequate rice supply after prices have already soared to record highs. Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Thursday separately called upon all to view the record rice prices as a national "catastrophe" in order that all may come together to combat the crisis. Acting country director of UNDP, Monoj Basnyat, said after the meeting with Iftekhar that they had discussed ways in which the UN could stand by Bangladesh to procure the rice as soon as possible. WFP representative Douglas Broderick said they had a "useful discussion" on the matter with the adviser, following a request by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Broderick was hopeful that his agency would be able to bring in 30,000 tonnes of rice in February for those on the southern coasts of Bangladesh devastated by the Nov 15 cyclone. FAO acting representative Lalita Bhattacharya also attended the meeting. Briefing reporters on the meeting, Iftekhar said: "The WFP will make available 30,000 tonnes by February. I have been told by the representatives that the UN can make speedier additional procurement if funds are made available to them." The UN representatives said these funds could come from the donors through appeals or from the Bangladesh government, according to a statement by the ministry. Asked about the import of rice from India, Iftekhar said the chief adviser would consider the matter with the interim cabinet. Thai ambassador Chalermpol Thanchitt, who had a separate meeting with Iftekhar Thursday, told reporters that Thailand was in a position to export 100,000 tonnes of rice, including 50,000 tonnes non-Basmati rice. The tender has already been floated, the ambassador said, adding that Thai exporters would be interested in the bidding. The foreign adviser told reporters he understood that it would take two weeks for the shipment of rice from Thailand to Bangladesh after completion of all preliminaries. The latest developments came as people have suffered escalating rice prices over the past few days, which many experts blamed on the interim government's mismanagement. "CATASTROPHE" General Moeen Thursday called upon all to view the crisis as a national "catastrophe" in order to come up with plans to combat it. "If we view it is a catastrophe and work together, we can overcome the crisis," Moeen said as he received donations for the relief fund at the Officers' Mess at Bangladesh Army Headquarters. "We are very much concerned about (the soaring prices of rice)," he said. "I have personally talked to the chief adviser about it." Moeen blamed steep rises on the global market for the soaring rice price in the domestic market and mentioned India's decision to increase the price of rice to $500 from $425 per tonne. He also said higher transportation costs, recent floods and the cyclone Sidr contributed to the crisis. The army chief said the government was working to face the crisis through intitiatives such as open market sales, vulnerable group feeding and food for work programmes. FEARS OF HOARDING M Aiyub Mia, acting secretary to the food and disaster management ministry, said Thursday that he feared hoarding was responsible for soaring prices of rice in the local market. Speaking to bdnews24.com by phone, the secretary said: "It should be reviewed why the price of rice is increasing despite adequate stocks." He said in the first six months of the current fiscal year import of rice was higher compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year. "Supply is adequate," he said. "Alternative food supply programmes such as food for work, test relief and vulnerable group feeding are ongoing. The WFP and the Red Crescent Society are also working on this." "Enough rice has been allocated for the programmes, and now it's being distributed." According to the food ministry, some 14 lakh tonnes of rice and 12 lakh tonnes of wheat were imported in the 2006-07 fiscal year. On the other hand, during July-December of the current fiscal year some 10 lakh tonnes of rice and 8 lakh tonnes of wheat have already been imported through both private and official channels. Another official speaking on condition of anonymity said the production of rice was 2.74 crore tonnes last year. But this year's production declined by about 3 lakh tonnes because of two severe spells of flooding and the Nov 15 cyclone. The country is facing a deficit of 17 lakh tonnes of rice this year against the total demand for rice, the official said. The government has already procured 7 lakh tonnes of rice to manage the deficit while 5 lakh tonnes have been sought from donors. Another 5 lakh would be imported from India, he said. Meanwhile, the acting food secretary stressed: "The government has an enough stock of rice while the private sector has also a good stock. There's no reason for the prices to soar." "Some 38,000 tonnes of rice have been allocated to 12 cyclone-hit districts under the VGF programme. For test relief another 75,000 tonnes of rice have been allocated while another 85,000 tonnes under food for work programmes have been dispatched," he said. bdnews24.com/k
