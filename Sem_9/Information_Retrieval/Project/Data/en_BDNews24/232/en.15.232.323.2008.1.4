 SYDNEY, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia lost two quick wickets after taking a narrow lead over India in the second test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. Opener Phil Jaques and captain Ricky Ponting both departed in quick succession after Australia had erased their 69-run deficit from the first innings. When lunch was taken on the fourth day, Australia were 90 for two in their second innings, leading by 21 with Matthew Hayden unbeaten on 39 and Mike Hussey yet to score. Jaques made 42 after batting for almost two hours in an 85-run partnership with Hayden. The left-hander struck five boundaries to get within sight of a half-century when he threw his wicket away by holing out to Yuvraj Singh in the deep off Indian spinner Anil Kumble. Ponting departed for just one run after being caught by Vangipurappu Laxman at silly point off the bowling of Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has dismissed the Australian skipper eight times in eight tests. Harbhajan scored a half-century in India's first innings of 532 but is facing a charge of racial abuse after an incident on Friday with Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds
