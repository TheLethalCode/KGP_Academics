<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's post-election violence could threaten the impressive gains that east Africa's largest economy has achieved, and harm regional economies that depend on it as a business hub, the World Bank said on Thursday. The World Bank expressed its concern in a statement which it said reflected its own views and those of leading western governments including the United States and Britain, plus the European Commission. "They are concerned that the unrest that continues in some parts of the country threatens impressive recent gains in economic growth and poverty reduction," the statement said. A quarter of the gross domestic product of Uganda and Rwanda and a third of Burundi's pass through Kenya, including essential commodities, the bank said. "Hence, the regional impact of the situation in Kenya could be significant," the statement said. All three of the nations are Kenya's partners in the East African Community. "There may still be time to salvage the situation, but urgent action is needed," the bank said. The immediate impact may already be negative, the World Bank said, pointing to the closure of tea and coffee markets and losses on the stock exchange. "Over the medium term, tourism could be impacted negatively," the statement said, referring to the country's $800 million a year business and top foreign exchange earner.
