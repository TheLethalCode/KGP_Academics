 VATICAN CITY, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict on Saturday called for a end to the violence in Kenya after a disputed Dec. 27 election and appealed to politicians to resolve the conflict through dialogue and debate. Violence and tribal clashes after the election have killed at least 300 people and uprooted 250,000 others from their homes in a country that had been seen as one of Africa's most stable democracies. The Pope had followed the "great tragedy" in Kenya with "deep sorrow and concern", Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone said in a letter sent on the Pope's behalf to the president of the Kenya Episcopal Conference. "He pleads for an immediate end to acts of violence and fratricidal conflict," said the letter. "The Pope also appeals to political leaders, who are responsible for the common good, and invites them to embark resolutely on the path of peace and justice, since the country needs peace that is based on justice and brotherhood." The Pope was praying the violence would soon come to an end and expressed his solidarity with Kenyans and the country's bishops, the letter added.
