<TITLE> Government `politically motivated' in HIPs delay </TITLE>

 LONDON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government's decision to delay the introduction of its controversial home seller pack scheme was motivated by politics rather than economics, a committee of MPs said on Thursday. The Communities and Local Government (CLG) select committee said the decision to delay the introduction of home information packs (HIPs) and then to phase them in over four months was "owing more to a failure of nerve in the face of vocal opposition from the press and others than to the general conditions prevailing in the housing market itself". The government said it had been forced to delay the full introduction of the packs because not enough people had been trained as energy assessors. HIPs were meant to be introduced last June, but were delayed by two months and, even then, only became mandatory for houses with four bedrooms or more. They were extended to three-bedroomed homes in September and to all properties from Dec. 14. Dr Phyllis Starkey, chairwoman of the committee and Labour MP for Milton Keynes South West, said: "The long and tortuous process of introducing home information packs signals a failure of delivery on CLG's part. "It is clear the reasons for this lie in poor preparation and then a retreat by the department's ministerial team." The government argues that HIPs are needed to cut delays in the home-buying process. But they have met with opposition because of their cost, and critics also say they make it more complicated to sell property. The controversy saw the government back-track on the need for the packs to include a full survey of the property, which would have been the most expensive part. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) says HIPs have led to the disappearance of a large proportion of an estimated 20 percent of speculative sellers that help keep the property market moving and warned the full roll-out will now hit first-time buyers hard. Steven Gould, its director of regulation, said on Thursday: "RICS has always supported CLG's objective to improve the home buying and selling process for consumers but as the committee highlights, delivery has left a lot to be desired. "By only listening to those who agreed with them, CLG has failed to provide the best solution for consumers and the industry." However, the government says the scheme is helping consumers save money on their energy bills and cutting search costs too. HIPs are currently taking an average of seven to 10 days to produce and costing sellers around 300-350 p
