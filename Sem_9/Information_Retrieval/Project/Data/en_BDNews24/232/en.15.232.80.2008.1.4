<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines has yet to make up its mind on buying four aircraft from Boeing Co. The struggling flag airline's board is weighing up a proposal it received from the Chigaco-based aircraft manufacturing giant some one month back for sale of commercial aircraft. "The Biman board of directors has not yet made a decision on buying four aircraft from the Boeing Company. However, the proposal from Boeing to sell planes is still on," Biman managing director MA Momen said to bdnews24.com Friday. Momen said the state-controlled airline, hamstrung by an aircraft crunch, needs to add new aircrafts to its ageing fleet on an emergency basis for survival. A high Biman official on condition of anonymity said a Boeing team visited Bangladesh on Nov 28 and proposed to sell 12 planes but Biman showed interest to buy four from the world's second-largest commercial plane maker. The Boeing has offered to sell 12 new and old planes including wide-body jets Boeing 787 and the 777. The US plane maker has told Biman that it can supply the planes by 2011 if a deal is reached. Biman sources the board of directors an emergency meeting on Nov 28 to discuss the Boeing proposal ended inconclusively. A final decision on purchase of new aircraft would be made after getting the opinion of Biman's committee on aircraft purchase, they said. Biman floated an international tender for lease-purchase of four wide-bodied aircraft five months back without response. Biman is now trying to reach an agreement directly with the aircraft manufacturer. Biman plans to buy new aircraft with bank loan and sell out old planes in phases, the sources added. A source said five DC-10-30s, four Airbus 310-300s and as many F-28s in its current fleet are 15 to 25 years old and these planes often get grounded even with small technical faults. bdne
