 WELLINGTON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand Cricket (NZC) officials say they are powerless to stop fast bowler Shane Bond joining the rebel Twenty20 Indian Cricket League (ICL) if reports about his signing are true. NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said he was still waiting for confirmation that Bond had joined the ICL following newspaper reports that he had agreed to a lucrative deal. "I can't say for certain he has signed but I understand that is what his agent is saying," Vaughan told The Dominion newspaper on Thursday. "We'd love to see him playing for New Zealand and that is why we have turned over so many stones, but at the moment we are on the back foot." Bond, who is currently injured, has not confirmed the reports. He is widely regarded as New Zealand's best fast bowler since Richard Hadlee and his departure would be a huge blow to the national team. The 32-year-old has taken 79 wickets in 17 tests at an average of 22.39 during an injury-plagued career but is unlikely to play for his country again after NZC instructed selectors to consider other players ahead of those who have joined the rebel league. Vaughan is still hoping to persuade Bond not to sign. "There's always hope but it's fair to say it's a long shot. It's unfortunate, but if it comes down to it we'll have to move on," he told the New Zealand Press Association. "Our side is obviously stronger with him in it but we've won games without him.
