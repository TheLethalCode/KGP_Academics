 CAIRO, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's main share indexes rose on Thursday, fuelled by a combination of foreign institutional investors buying on positive New Year sentiment and good fundamentals, brokers said. "There's a lot of optimism in the market. ... It's the beginning of the year, and most fund managers have a whole year ahead of them. ... They're relaxed and very bold. Any mistake you make in January, you have a whole year to fix it," said Hashem Ghoneim, CEO of El Nour Securities. Brokers noted the rise seemed to follow a pattern set the past few years, where the exchange saw a surge of activity after New Year holidays as foreign investors returned to the market. Overall, the benchmark Case 30 index gained 0.4 percent to 10,727.83 points, while the well watched Hermes index added 0.3 percent to 94,445.36 points, both at their all-time highest closing levels. The broader CIBC-100 index climbed 0.8 percent to 419.41 points. "We're beginning to see the foreigners being net buyers again, and I think the market is responding positively to that," Yasser Hassanein of Dynamic Securities said. Hassanein added that this was usually followed by a cool-down in February, and said there would probably be some profit-taking in the market in the near future. "Some shares have gotten ahead of themselves in terms of prices. At some point I imagine there's going to be some profit taking on some of the shares that have raced too fast," he said. Shares in Ezz Steel continued to rise on Thursday after the company announced it had won a license to build a new steel plant in Egypt. Its shares closed 3.5 percent up at 71.28 Egyptian pounds ($12.96). Investment bank EFG-Hermes, which HC Securities forecast would see a 67 percent rise in fourth quarter net earnings, was the day's most traded share by value. Its shares closed 1.4 percent higher at 67.01 pounds. Market heavyweight Orascom Construction Industries also rose, closing 2.2 percent up at 590 pounds. Traders said investors were also awaiting an announcement sometime in January on whether Commercial International Bank (CIB) would merge with Cairo-based Arab African International Bank. CIB shares closed 0.2 percent higher at 92.30 pounds. ($1 = 5.50 Egyptian pounds).
