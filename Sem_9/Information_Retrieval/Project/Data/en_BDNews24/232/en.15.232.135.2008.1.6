 BAGHDAD, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed nine people when he blew himself up near a ceremony marking Iraq's national Army Day holiday in central Baghdad on Sunday, the latest in an upsurge of suicide attacks. The attack was the worst in a series of bombings in the capital. Police said three people were killed in the northern district of Qahira when a car bomb blew up outside a restaurant. One person was killed in three blasts in central Nahda. While overall levels of violence in Iraq are down, US military figures show that suicide bomb attacks have increased slightly since reaching a low in October. Witnesses said the suicide bomber, wearing an explosives vest, tried to gain access to the offices of the Iraqi Unity Gathering, a non-governmental group hosting an Army Day event for army officers, most of whom attended in civilian clothes. Tribal leaders from both of Iraq's religious sects and clerics also attended the ceremony, held in a house in a residential neighbourhood in central Karrada district. bdnews24.com/lq/1940hrs Reuters television footage showed a group of soldiers dancing in a tight circle in the street, waving their AK-47 assault rifles in the air and chanting "Where is terrorism today?" shortly before the bomber struck. One police official said nine people were killed including two soldiers, three policemen and four civilians, and 17 people wounded, including seven soldiers and policemen. A second police source put the death toll at eight. The bomber attacked as guests were leaving the NGO's offices and milling about in the front yard. Iraqi security force members who had been standing guard appeared to have taken the brunt of the blast. A Reuters cameraman who was less than 10 metres away when the bomb exploded saw soldiers dragging away several lifeless uniformed bodies and AK-47s lying scattered nearby. "I was interviewing a cleric when a huge explosion rocked the whole street. I was luckily protected by a wall from the force of the blast but I kept filming the havoc it caused," said Reuters cameraman Salem al-Uraibi. "I saw at least four bodies and a lot of people wounded." A Reuters photographer was slightly wounded in the blast. BODIES DUMPED The head of the Iraqi Unity Gathering, Yassin al-Hashemi, said its aim was to promote reconciliation between Iraq's religious sects and ethnic groups. The group includes former army officers who took part in the Shi'ite uprising in southern Iraq against former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein after the 1991 Gulf War. "The terrorists and al Qaeda want to stop our march and they are targeting all the good people of this country. But we are going forward to achieve our goals and to support the government in its reconciliation projects," Hashemi said. A suicide bomber killed 34 people and wounded 38 at a funeral in eastern Baghdad on New Year's Day in the worst attack in the capital in six months. The US military blames such attacks on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, which it accuses of trying to reignite sectarian violence between majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni Muslims. A series of counter-insurgency offensives by US and Iraqi troops since June 2007 have largely pushed al Qaeda out of Baghdad, forcing them to move northwards to seek new havens in Nineveh and Salahuddin provinces. US commanders say al Qaeda sees mainly Sunni, US-backed neighbourhood patrols, which were created last year under the auspices of so-called tribal Awakening Councils, as a threat and is increasingly targeting them. Police said the leader of the Awakening Council in Shaab district in northern Baghdad was shot dead outside his home on Sunday. Police also reported the discovery of 12 bodies dumped around Baghdad on Saturday, four times the number they have been reporting in recent months. Such killings were normally associated w
