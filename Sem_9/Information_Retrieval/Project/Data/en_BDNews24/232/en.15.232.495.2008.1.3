 MADRID, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Late goals from Ernesto Chevanton and Frederic Kanoute gave holders Sevilla a place in the last 16 of the King's Cup on Wednesday with a 4-3 win over third division Denia. The Andalucians, who were held 1-1 in the first leg, looked to be departing the Cup after they surrendered a two-goal lead to trail 3-2 against their modest opponents with eight minutes left on the clock. But an 88th minute strike from Chevanton and a stoppage time penalty from Kanoute earned last season's UEFA Cup winners a place in the next round. League leaders Real Madrid also left it late to seal their place in the next round, a superbly taken strike by midfielder Guti earning the Spanish champions a 2-1 win at home to third division Alicante. Real, who scrambled a 1-1 draw in last month's first leg, took the lead when Dutch winger Arjen Robben cracked home on the half-volley to score his first goal for the club. An ambitious Alicante refused to wilt, however, and equalised 20 minutes into the second half when striker Borja steered a near-post header low past keeper Jerzy Dudek. With seconds of stoppage time left on the clock, the game looked certain to be heading for extra time but Guti took advantage as the Alicante defence dropped their guard and dinked a perfectly measured shot over the keeper and into the net. BARCELONA DRAW Arch-rivals Barcelona went through despite being held to a 2-2 draw by third division Alcoyano at the Nou Camp. Barca, who held a comfortable 3-0 advantage after the first leg, put the result of the tie beyond doubt when reserve forward Santiago Ezquerro struck twice in the first 11 minutes. But a penalty from Perona and a last-minute goal from Arnau earned their modest opponents a rare draw at the Barca stadium. Last year's losing finalists Getafe cruised into the last 16 after a 4-1 win at home to Burgos earned them an emphatic 5-1 victory on aggregate over their third division opponents. Real Mallorca scored four goals in 30 minutes to wipe out a two-goal first-leg deficit and turn the tables on fellow Primera Liga side Osasuna with a 4-0 win at Son Moix. An extra-time strike from Raul Tamudo gave 2006 winners Espanyol a 3-2 aggregate win over Deportivo Coruna, while Valladolid edged a 4-3 aggregate victory over Real Murcia in the remaining all-first division clash. Atletico Madrid, Villarreal, Valencia, Recreativo Huelva, Racing Santander, Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao all managed to see off opposition from the lower divisions
