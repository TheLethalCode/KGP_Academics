 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Thursday demanded general elections by June-July as it said the caretaker government had failed to meet people's expectations. The party also urged the government to release its detained president Sheikh Hasina from jail. "The caretaker government has failed to meet the expectations of the people. Therefore, the government should hold the national polls by the middle of the year deviating from the election roadmap," AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta told reporters after a meeting of the party's highest policymaking forum. AL's acting president Zillur Rahman presided over the meeting at his Gulshan home. Presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzaq, Tofail Ahmed and Matia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam attended the meeting. "We demand immediate polls," said Tofail Ahmed in a post-meeting briefing. The meeting took a decision to urge the government to free Hasina. bdnews2
