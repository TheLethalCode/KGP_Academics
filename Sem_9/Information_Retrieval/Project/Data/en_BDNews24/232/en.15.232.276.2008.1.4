 Des Moines, Iowa, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sen. Hillary Clinton acknowledged a disappointing defeat in Iowa on Thursday to rival Democratic Sen. Barack Obama but voiced confidence she would rebound in her bid for the presidency in other state contests across the United States. "I am so ready for the rest of this campaign, and I am so ready to lead," said Clinton, sounding upbeat and confident before a crowded room of supporters in Des Moines. "We're going to take this enthusiasm and go right to New Hampshire tonight," she said. New Hampshire holds its nominating primary next Tuesday, where Clinton leads polls among Democrats in the next state to choose party candidates to compete in the November general election. The loss to Obama was a big blow to Clinton, the former first lady who is seeking to become the nation's first female president. Once considered such a strong, well-funded front-runner that some dubbed her the inevitable nominee, Clinton saw her lead in Iowa shrivel in recent weeks, and she now faces immense pressure to turn around her campaign in New Hampshire over the next five days. "I am so proud to have run with such exceptional candidates," Clinton said, congratulating Obama, the senator from Ilinois, and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who was in a tight battle with Clinton for second place. "Together we have presented the case for change and have made it absolutely clear that America needs a new beginning," she said. She promised to take her candidacy nationwide through the upcoming nominating contests. "We have always planned to run a national campaign," she said. "I am ready for that contest. "We have a long way to go, but I am confident and optimistic," said Clinton, flanked by her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and daughter Chelsea.
