<TEXT>
 AMSTERDAM, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Amsterdam's infamous Yab Yum brothel, which calls itself the world's most exclusive men's club, must shut its doors, an Amsterdam court ruled on Friday. Yab Yum took the matter to court last month after the city decided to withdraw its licence based on a law that allows it to close companies that could be involved in criminal activities. Yab Yum said in a statement before the ruling that allegations that it was in the hands of the Hells Angels biker gang were "absolutely wrong". But an Amsterdam city council spokeswoman said after the court's decision: "We are glad because this shows we did the right thing by not giving out the permit and closing the brothel." In December, the city of Amsterdam announced plans to clean up its "red light" district to fight human trafficking, money laundering and drug abuse. The city wants to fight forced prostitution by clamping down on pimps and demanding that brothel owners, escort agencies and those who protect prostitutes apply for permits. It has withdrawn permits from dozens of sex businesses it accuses of links with organised crime. Yab Yum must close its doors next Monday, the Amsterdam city spokeswoman said. Yab Yum is appealing the city's decision not to grant a new permit, and a ruling is expected next month, she said
