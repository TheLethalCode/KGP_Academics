 TBILISI, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's opposition on Friday accused the government of using "dirt and terror" to rig Saturday's presidential election in the former Soviet state. The opposition, which accuses incumbent president and close U.S. ally Mikhail Saakashvili of corruption and economic mismanagement, says thousands of its supporters will take to the streets if the vote looks fraudulent. "We don't have liberal election legislation. We didn't have enough time to prepare for elections. They have been using dirt and terror against us," Saakashvili's main opponent Levan Gachechildze said. "These all mean elections today are practically falsified." The West is watching the elections in Georgia closely, aware of its strategic location and eagerness to join NATO and the European Union. The region is an important transit route wedged between Russia, Turkey and Iran which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe. Since taking power in a peaceful 2003 revolution, Saakashvili has steered Georgia towards the West and has positioned the country as the United States' chief ally in the South Caucasus. But the president scarred his democratic credentials when he ordered police to crush anti-government protests in November after five days of protests. The first opposition demonstration attracted around 100,000 people. The 40-year-old Saakashvili has always dismissed allegations of rigging elections. His aides say the opposition is making false accusations of fraud as an excuse for losing the vote. Hundreds of western monitors are observing the vote in the country of 4.5 million people. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) preliminary interim election report noted there had been a handful of problems with incomplete voter lists and that a few people had complained of intimidation. "We need of course the election day to see how it really functions," Dieter Boden, head of the OSCE's election monitoring mission in Georgia, told Reuters. Opinion polls differ over who will win, although most place Saakashvili ahead of his opponents
