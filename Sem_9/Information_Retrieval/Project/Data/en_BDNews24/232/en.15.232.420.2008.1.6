<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders Khulna Sunday bounced back against Barisal on the third day of the final round four-dayer in the National Cricket League while title contenders Rajshahi were in tatters against Dhaka. The hosts set Barisal 302 runs for a win, riding on two fifties from Nahidul Haq and Farid Ahmed at Birshreshthho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Barisal were 20 for no loss at stumps with Hannan Sarkar unbeaten on 3 and Nasiruddin Faruque on 16. Rajshahi were in deep trouble against Dhaka, slipping to 59 for seven in the second innings at the close of Day 3. They restricted Dhaka to 313 all out, taking a 52-run first innings lead, and increased overall lead to 111 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Khulna and Rajshahi are separated by just one point, 96 and 95 points respectively, from nine outings and the title would be decided on the final day Monday. Sylhet set Chittagong to chase 237 on the final day at Narayaganj Osmani Stadium. Khulna vs Barisal Having resumed the day on 73 for two, Khulna added another 252 runs to finish their second innings 325 all out, in a sharp contrast to their disappointing first innings total of 193. Overnight batsmen Mostafizur Rahman (34) and Sahagir Ahmed (8) fell in the opening session, but the middle and the late orders guided Khulna to a comfortable total. Middle-order batsmen Jamal Babu (48), Nahidul (52) and Ziaur Rahman (32) and tail-ender Farid Ahmed (62) frustrated the Barisal bowlers. Talha Jubair took 3/77 followed by Abul Bashar 2/23 and Arafat Salahuddin 2/63. Khulna will look for the killer blow to finish the league on a high when overnight Barisal batsmen resume Monday. Rajshahi vs Dhaka After resuming the day on 132 for four, Dhaka lost overnight batsman Mehrab Hossain Junior (52) and slipped to 163 for seven thanks to a mini collapse. However, Nazmul Hossain Milon (93) teamed up with Mosharraf Hossain (41) to defy the opposition bowlers. They put on 79 runs for the eighth wicket before the hard-hitting Nazmul was the last Dhaka man out, having hit four fours and as many sixes in his 154-ball knock. Rajshahi batsmen continued their poor batting in the second innings and the team was reeling at 46 for seven. First innings centurions Nayeem Islam and Mohammad Shahazada ended the day without further damage. Pacers Mohammad Sharif and Mahbubul Alam and spinner Mohammad Rafique took one wicket apiece to rattle the Rajshahi top order before Mosharraf (4/9) wrecked the middle order. Rajshahi, who have already clinched the one-day title, will pray for a miracle when Nayeem (5) and Shahazada (6) resume the final day. Sylhet vs Chittagong Chittagong resumed the day on 288 for seven and finished 319 all out, conceding a 35-run lead to Sylhet, who scored 354 all out in the first innings. Chitttagong bowled Sylhet out for 201 in the second innings with pacer Kamrul Islam (4/37) and Tareq Aziz (4/54) being the chief wreckers. Tail-ender Nabil Samad top-scored with 37, followed by opener Imtiaz Hossain with 30 and middle-order Ezaz Ahmed 29. Chittagong will chase 237 runs on the final day with 10 wickets in hand. b
