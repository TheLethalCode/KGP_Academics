<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com) - The prices of rice in the capital did not increase Friday and traders sold the staple at Thursday's rate. A market survey by bdnews24.com found that the prices remained static and a rice trader in Karwan Bazar said he expected the price to fall in a day or two. Traders at Karwan Bazar, New Market, Polashi and Mohammadpur Krishi markets were selling rice at the previous rate. The good quality miniket rice was selling at Tk 44-46 per kg while normal Miniket was selling at Tk 40. Najirshail was selling at Tk 42-44 while Dinajpur Najirshail at Tk 43-44. BR-28 and Lota-28 were selling at Tk 39-40 while Pari at Tk 35-36 and Paijam at Tk 35. The lowest-priced IRRI Guti was priced at Tk 33. In the previous week, Miniket was Tk 36-38 a kg, Najirshail Tk 38-40, Paijam Tk 28-30, and Pari and Guti Tk25-26. Consumers and rice traders have blamed the government for its failure in tackling the crisis. Job-holder Monwar Hossain, who came to buy rice in the Karwan Bazar market, said that "irresponsible comments" from some officials pushed the prices of the rice up. Golam Mowla, general secretary of Moulvibazar Rice Traders Association, blamed the crisis on the government's lack of vision. "All this is happening because of the government's lack of vision. There is no dearth of rice on the global market. There would not have been such crisis if adequate imports could have been be ensured earlier. "Now the government is looking for alternative markets like Thailand. It could have been done well before. It was not right to depend only on India." Alamgir Hossain, who came to shop at Polashi market, also accused the government of failure in keeping the prices stable. "Those of us who live in Dhaka are feeding our family with great difficulty. The people in villages have no option, nobody thinks of them. Many of my relatives in Barisal are having one meal a day," he said. Trader Abdul Haque at Karwan Bazar said: "I think the prices would come down. We are selling the rice that we had bought at higher rates. The number of buyers in the market has fallen." "I have heard that the prices have fallen slightly in wholesale markets. It will be clear tomorrow when we will buy rice from Babu Bazar wholesale market," he said. He feared they might have to count loss if the prices suddenly fall since they bought rice at higher prices. bdnews2
