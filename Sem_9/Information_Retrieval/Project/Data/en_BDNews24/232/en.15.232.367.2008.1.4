<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  A crisis is being created in a planned way in the power sector and high-priced electricity is going beyond the buying capacity of common people, speakers at a seminar said Friday. Rushed steps to raise production in a bid to overcome the crisis are increasing corruption in the sector and the production cost of electricity, instead. Speakers made the remarks at the seminar tilted "Endangered Power Sector and Our National Interest" organised by the National Committee for Protection of Oil-Gas-Mineral Resources and Power and Port at the National Press Club. Civil-rights activist Prof Serajul Islam Chowdhury said smuggling of national resources must be resisted and asserted that a relation between power and natural resources existed. Prof Muzaffer Ahmed said the Power Development Board did not prepare a balance sheet and there was no statistics on investment in the sector. The power sector is riddled with corruption. Electricity is being supplied to the VIP areas through load management but power is not being supplied to production-oriented industries on a priority basis, he added. Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury posed the question, "What has the government done in last one year? Only the politicians are being chastened. "It is being said that nothing positive happened in the last 36 years. Who were in power for 21 years? Let them be accountable for their work first." Rashed Khan Menon identified foreign aid as the main cause of crisis in the power sector. Dependence on foreign aid must end and political commitment is needed to achieve this, he observed. Former state minister for power Anwarul Kabir Talukder said there was no technical audit in the power sector. He demanded trial of those involved with embezzlement of Tk 10,000-15,000 crore in the sector. BNP standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman said political commitment was necessary for pull the sector out of the mess. Prof Anu Muhammad said a power crisis is being created in a planned way. Power production is being given to the private sector following the advice of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank instead of increasing production in the public sector. It is creating corruption inside and outside the country. The power plants are not being maintained or repaired properly. Prof M Shamsul Alam, director of the Institute of Energy Technology at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, presented the keynote paper. The paper said, "A crisis in the power sector is being created in a planned way. High-priced electricity is going beyond the capacity of the people." Former adviser to the caretaker government Amanul Islam Chowdury, JSD leader Hasanul Haq Inu, Jatiya party leader GM Quader, former MP Faruq Khan, CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim, BNP leader Rizvi Ahmed, Prof Abu Ahmed, Prof MM Akash, Prof Anu Muhammad, Dr Atiur Rahman, Justice Golam Rabbani, former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Khondker Ibrahim Khaled, DUTA leader Prof AAMS Arefin Siddiqui and Moshrefa Mishu spoke. bdnenw
