 PRISTINA, Serbia, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo's new parliament was to hold its first session on Friday with parties still discussing a coalition government to lead the province to independence from Serbia after last November's election. Kosovo Albanian leaders say the assembly will declare the territory's secession within the first months of 2008, counting on the major Western powers to overrule opposition from Serbia and Russia and recognise the new state. Negotiations on a coalition between the Democratic Party (PDK) of prime minister-designate Hashim Thaci and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) continued ahead of the parliament session scheduled for 2.00 p.m. (1300 GMT). Western diplomats back a Thaci-led coalition of the parties -- the two biggest -- as the best choice to steer Kosovo through what promises to be a turbulent transition to statehood. They have agreed to form a coalition, but analysts say the Democratic League is divided on who to name to its ministries. "We don't expect to form the government today," senior party official Rame Manaj told Reuters. "But a PDK-LDK coalition offers the only real possibility to form a government." The two parties, which hold 62 seats in the 120-seat assembly, differ little on the question of independence. Thaci would be Kosovo's fifth prime minister since 1999. His party emerged from the 1998-99 Kosovo guerrilla army, which eclipsed a decade of passive resistance by the LDK under late independence icon Ibrahim Rugova. NATO bombed for 78 days in 1999 to drive out Serb forces and halt their killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians during a two-year Serb counter-insurgency war, the culmination of a decade of repression under late strongman Slobodan Milosevic. Central to Serb history and identity, Kosovo has been run by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO peacekeepers since, but the West fears prolonging its limbo would trigger unrest in the fragile Balkans. Almost two years of Serb-Albanian negotiations ended last month in deadlock and Serb ally Russia has blocked UN adoption of a Western-backed plan granting Kosovo independence under European Union supervision. The United States and the major EU powers now say they will move ahead with the plan, drafted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, without a new UN Security Council resolution. Serbia has told the 120,000 Serbs in the territory to reject any unilateral secession, cementing a de facto ethnic partition and raising fears of a breakaway by the Serb north. Most of the EU's 27 member states are expected to recognise Kosovo as the last state to emerge from the former Yugoslavia, and the bloc is preparing to take control of policing and justice from the UN mission. Diplomats say the Kosovo Albanians have agreed to hold off any declaration until after a presidential election in Serbia on Jan 20 and Feb 3, to avoid driving voters into the arms of ultranationalis
