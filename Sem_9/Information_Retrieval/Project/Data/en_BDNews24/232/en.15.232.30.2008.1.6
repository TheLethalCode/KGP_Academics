<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan, the United States and the European Union will jointly propose the creation of a new body to act as an international command centre in efforts to counter global warming, a leading Japanese daily said on Sunday. The proposal would be formally unveiled at a Group of Eight summit on the Japanese island of Hokkaido in July, the Yomiuri newspaper said without quoting specific sources. The new organisation would make suggestions on energy conservation measures for countries such as the G8 leading industrialised nations and members of the International Energy Agency, as well as China and India, the newspaper said. The aim was to transfer developed countries' knowledge of energy conservation to other large energy consumers and to study their effectiveness, Yomiuri said. The body would create indicators for conservation related to the amount of fuel or energy used by cars, home appliances and the industrial sector, and use the data as the basis for its policy suggestions, Yomiuri said. The idea of joint funding by Japan, the United States and the European Union was being discussed, as well as the possibility of setting up the new body within the International Energy Agency in Paris, Yomiuri said. The new organisation would be discussed at a preparatory meeting of G8 energy ministers on Jan. 22-23, and at another ministerial gathering in Japan in June, the report said.
