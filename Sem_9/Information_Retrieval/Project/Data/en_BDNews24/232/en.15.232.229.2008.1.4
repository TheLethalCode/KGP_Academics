 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar recovered slightly from the previous day's one-month low versus a basket of major currencies on Friday as investors squared positions ahead of a report expected to show the US created 70,000 non-farm jobs in December. The as-expected release of the more narrowly-focused ADP employment report on Thursday showing a gain of 40,000 jobs last month was seen as slightly reducing the likelihood of a big downside surprise in the official data due at 1330 GMT. Having sold the dollar in all but one trading session of the past two weeks, investors took the opportunity to square their books ahead of what is arguably the most market-moving data release from the world's biggest economy. "There's only a bit of order flow going through ahead of the payrolls," said Naeem Wahid, currency strategist at Bank of Scotland Treasury Services. "People are looking to see if there will be a mediocre or disastrous number and (the dollar) won't go much from current levels until it comes out." By 1156 GMT the dollar index was up 0.13 percent at 75.986, recovering from Thursday's one-month low of 75.708. The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.4705. Euro zone inflation stayed well above the European Central Bank's target in December as expected, the first estimate from the EU statistics office showed. In contrast to bets for rate cuts in the United States, the ECB appears more concerned about rising inflation than easing growth, suggesting that rates will likely be left on hold at 4 percent for some time to come. The dollar was up 0.15 percent at 109.44, after falling as low as 108.22 yen the previous session, a five-week trough. UNDER PRESSURE Longer-term though, the dollar is likely to remain under pressure as weak U.S. indicators has cemented bets that the Federal Reserve has little choice but to ease monetary policy further to shelter the economy. The Fed is now expected to cut rates by at least 25 basis points at a policy meeting this month, with US interest rate futures pricing in a roughly one-in-three chance of a 50 basis point rate cut from the current 4.25 percent at the two-day meeting ending on Jan. 30. Analysts said that the non-farm payrolls data could well give fresh impetus for dollar selling. "Judged by the dollar weakness seen in the first trading sessions of the year the market is probably already positioned for a softer report than consensus, and it may require a reading below 40,000 for taking the dollar significantly lower," said Dresdner Kleinwort in a note to clients. Forecasts for the number of jobs added in December ranged from 25,000 to 130,000. As well as payrolls, Friday also features the release of the ISM's service sector index at 1500 GMT, which is expected to fall to 53.5 in December from 54.1, but to stay comfortably above the 50 watermark between growth and contracti
