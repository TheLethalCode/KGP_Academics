<TITLE> Indonesia Suharto`s health improving: doctors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The health of former Indonesian president Suharto, rushed to hospital in critical condition last week, continues to improve though he remains weak, doctors at the hospital said on Monday. Suharto, 86, was admitted to Jakarta's Pertamina hospital on Friday suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart, lung and kidney problems. He deteriorated rapidly on Saturday, and was given haemodialysis to remove excess liquid from his body. "Suharto's condition this morning has shown a lot of improvement although in general he is still weak. His consciousness is good and blood pressure is stable," Mardjo Soebiandono, the head of the medical team treating the former five-star general, told a news conference. "The fluid level in his arms and legs has returned to normal, his consciousness has returned, he can recognise people and has started to take soft meals." However, Soebiandono said doctors was still restricting visitors and treating Suharto "as if he was still in critical condition". Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for three decades until he was ousted in 1998, has suffered from various ailments in recent years, including intestinal bleeding and strokes. Soebiandono declined to comment on how long the former president would stay in hospital. "Starting tomorrow we will try to reduce the use of supporting medical equipment. Now we have started to cut the dose of medication." He also said the medical team was considering the possibility of installing a new pacemaker and would decide after completing the necessary examinations. A steady stream of important visitors including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, former ministers, and Muslim clerics visited him over the weekend -- a sign of his lingering influence among Indonesia's elite. Yudhoyono said the government would give Suharto the finest medical attention available. Suharto rarely appears in public and has lived in seclusion in Jakarta's leafy Menteng neighbourhood since he stepped down in the face of a tumultuous pro-democracy movement and economic crisis. He and his family are still involved in a couple of high-profile court cases. But the sudden deterioration in his health prompted some senior officials to call for legal proceedings against him to be dropped, the state-run Antara news agency reported on Sunday
