 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)--Qatar will allow more skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled Bangladeshis to work in the Gulf state, an adviser said Sunday. "The number of people will be more than 15,000," said expatriates' welfare and overseas employment adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. To facilitate the migration of workers for jobs, Bangladesh signed a protocol with the Qatari government. Iftekhar and visiting labour minister of Qatar Sultan bin Hasan al Dhabit al Dosari signed the protocol at a meeting at state guesthouse Padma. "The protocol indicates that there will be a technical committee which will meet regularly to discuss all labour issues," the Qatari minister told reporters in a joint press briefing after the bilateral meeting. "The minister has told me that the people of Qatar are extremely happy with Bangladeshis and the country will take more professionals, semi-professionals and non-professionals in coming days," Iftekhar said. He also said he had discussed the issue of Bangladesh-Qatar cooperation in the energy sector, as Qatar has a huge reserve of natural gas. There are some 70,000 Bangladeshi workers in Qatar. Bangladeshis complain that they get paid less than the workers from other countries such as India and Pakistan. "The Qatari government has been informed about 33 complaints from the workers and the government has already solved 17 of them," Iftekhar said. Qatar, one of the economic centres in the Middle East, has a population of 10 lakh, with eight lakh being foreigners. As many as 15,000 Bangladeshi workers migrated to Qatar in 2007 for jobs. bdn
