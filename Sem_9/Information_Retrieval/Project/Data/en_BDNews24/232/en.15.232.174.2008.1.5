 Mintu Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent. Chittagong, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Dry fish business in Chittagong runs the risk of collapse this year since Cyclone Sidr hit the industry hard in the beginning of the season, businessmen said. They fear the production may fall by 40 percent as fishermen could not catch enough fish in the initial days of the season. In the days before and after the cyclone, the processing of the fish has also been disrupted hugely, causing worries among the dry fish traders based in the country's largest dry fish market in Asadganj. Their worries have also mounted as more than half of the production season has passed by but the production did not see a boom. They also said that it might drive exports to fall by more than half against annual exports of 500 to 700 tonnes. The item mainly goes to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, some other Middle Eastern countries, the Unites Sates and the United Kingdom where a huge number of expatriate Bangladeshis live. The exporters say items such as Chhuri, Chanda, Loitta, Kachka and Chingri top the list of the export basket. According to the businessmen, the peak season for dry fish business is four monthsfrom November to February. The industry produces about 25,000 tonnes of dry fish in the four months. For the current season, the production fell to about 5,000 tonnes in the period from November to the first week of January in the wake of the Nov 15 cyclone, they said. Mojibat Ullah Moju, vice chairman of the Asadganj Dry Fish Reservoirs Society, said this season's production was almost half of the previous targeted production. He said they could produce another 10,000 tonnes for the rest of the season, meaning the total output will fall far short of the previous season's mark. Dry fish producers in Dublar Char and nearby char in Bagerhat would not be able to produce enough to help reach the target, he said. Asadganj Reservoirs Society's chairman Shafiul Alam said the industry was hard hit since many fishing boats were damaged by the cyclone. He said that 33 producers and about 200 retail dry fish traders in Asadganj were passing their days in hardship since they got little help from the government. Asadganj dry fish businessmen society's general secretary Farid Ahmed said high duty on exports of dry fish is hindering the business. bdnews24.
