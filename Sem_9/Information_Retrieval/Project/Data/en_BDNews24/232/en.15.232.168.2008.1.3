 ISLAMABAD, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's political crisis appeared to stabilise on Thursday with parties looking ahead to elections in which the party of assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto is set to make gains. There were no reports of protests against an Election Commission decision on Wednesday to postpone the general election to Feb. 18, despite the objections of the two main opposition parties which had wanted it held on schedule on Jan. 8. Pakistani shares rallied 4.65 percent by 0832 GMT, after falling nearly 10 percent in the wake of Bhutto's assassination in a gun and bomb attack a week ago as she left an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi. "Incidents of violence have gone down, in that sense one can say the situation is better," said former government minister and political analyst Shafqat Mahmood. "But the central issues which are dividing the nation remain and the most divisive figure is Mr Musharraf himself," he said, referring to President Pervez Musharraf, the former military chief who took power in a 1999 coup. The murder of the charismatic Bhutto, an old Musharraf rival, and the violence that followed has fuelled doubts about stability and the transition to democratic rule in nuclear-armed Pakistan, a crucial ally in U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. Musharraf gave in to an opposition demand for outside help with the investigation into the assassination, announcing in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday evening that British police would take part. He said he was sure al Qaeda-linked militants were behind the attack on Bhutto, who had spoken strongly of the need to tackle militancy and had been threatened by militant leaders. But many Pakistanis believe other Bhutto enemies, perhaps in sections of the security agencies, were involved, fuelling anger against Musharraf whose popularity had already slumped. "I was a supporter of President Musharraf, but now what he has done to the PPP is very bad. I will vote for the PPP," said David Bernard, a manager at Unilever in Karachi, referring to Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP). SYMPATHY, ANGER Bhutto's widower and the de facto leader of her party, Asif Ali Zardari, appealed to supporters on Wednesday to remain calm and Mahmood said the opposition had never intended to mount a street protest campaign against the postponement of the polls. The vote had been seen as a three-way race between the PPP, the other main opposition party, led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, and the party that backs Musharraf and ruled until a caretaker government was set up in November. The PPP is expected to ride a wave of sympathy into the election but analysts are unsure how much that might be diluted over the next six weeks. It was also unclear if the party would pick up more votes in its strongholds, which would not necessarily translate into more seats, or make inroads into vote banks of other parties. "The sympathy wave is likely to persist for the PPP throughout these six weeks," said analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi. "It's very difficult to say how much benefit PPP will get but it definitely will make gains and that will be a loss for Musharraf's allies." Nawaz Sharif, who has allied himself closely to the PPP since Bhutto's death, is also likely to make gains at the expense of the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League (Q). "If Nawaz Sharif is able to maintain his working relationship with PPP and use Bhutto's assassination to attack President Musharraf, his party's chances in the forthcoming elections are much stronger than they have ever been," London-based Citigroup economist Mushtaq Khan said in a report. The embattled Musharraf, whose re-election as president in October is still disputed by the opposition, will need support in the next parliament and looks likely to have to renew efforts to reach an understanding with Bhutto's party, analysts say. But it won't be easy. "The anger about Benazir Bhutto's death will not go away for a very long time," Mahmood sa
