<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Police Sunday obstructed a reunion by the Jatiya Gantantrik Party at the National Press Club. Police said the action came as the organisers did not take permission from the authorities to hold the gathering. The main participants previously belonged to the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League. But later they deserted the wing and joined other fronts. So the organisers named Sunday's reunion as the "Reunion of the Chhatra League". Some guests from outside the Jatiya Ganatantrik Party also attended the programme. Akhteruzzaman, Shah Moazzem Hossain and Rajia Fayez of the BNP, M Qamaruzzaman of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, Nazim Uddin Al Azad of the Bangladesh Democratic League and Sheikh Shawkat Hossain Nilu of the National People's Party were present in the programme. The officials intervened as some of the leaders had already addressed to the audience. Shafiul Alam Prodhan of the Jatiya Ganatantrik Party quickly wrapped up the discussion and left the press club's VIP lounge with others after the police intervention. Prodhan, however, disputed the officials' claims that they had no permission. "We had appealed to the authorities seeking permission for the reunion. But they did not let us know that we are not allowed to hold the reunion. Halting such a reunion is really too sad," Prodhan said. "We have ended our programme because we are respectful to law," he said. Shah Moazzem termed the incident unfortunate. "The Awami League's student wing recently observed its founding anniversary, but they faced no problem. I can't understand why police halted this function," he said. bdnews2
