 Washington, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Could the US presidential race be bad for the world economy? That is a distinct possibility, according to some experts who believe a new mood of American isolationism could emerge from voter discontent over economic issues and the campaign rhetoric it has spawned. From Democrat John Edwards' condemnation of "corporate greed" to the little-guy appeal of Republican Mike Huckabee, experts say the campaigns for the November election are picking up on the uncertainties that ordinary Americans increasingly face in the impersonal world of economic globalization. "Globalization has had a significant impact on public optimism about the economy and public confidence in the future. It's given people the sense that their safety net's been shredded," said Norman Ornstein, political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The result has been a long list of voter anxieties, including manufacturing job losses, stagnant wages, unsatisfactory health care benefits, illegal immigration, and dangerous Chinese imports. "We're paying the price today for the overselling of globalization: the fact that those who pushed globalization in both parties were unwilling to face up to the downside risks and take actions to mitigate them," said Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. "It also in part is a consequence of the failure of the Bush administration to put in place adequate regulatory standards in a host of areas," he said. Souring public sentiment could mean a reduced US role in the global marketplace if voters start to demand a change in economic course, analysts say. Eurasia Group, a New York consulting firm, named US resistance to globalization on Monday as the greatest political risk for global markets in 2008 -- topping Iran, Iraq and terrorism. The firm, which evaluates political risk for its clients, warned that presidential campaign rhetoric could contribute to a dramatic increase in US protectionist sentiment if accompanied by a major recession. "What we're seeing is that there is a broader (campaign) benefit from a populist, and frankly, a neo-isolationist streak," said Eurasia President Ian Bremmer. "We're going to get the strongest sort of populism from people like John Edwards. But we're also seeing it with the Huckabee campaign and the Ron Paul campaign," he added, referring to the long-shot Republican candidate. Experts say voter discontent alone probably would not force a major turn toward protectionism but could make it more difficult for US politicians to agree to new trade deals. Voters have already seen a lot of campaign talk about the perils of trade from Democrats including Hillary Clinton, who has pledged to review all existing trade pacts if elected. But Stiglitz said Democrats were likely to ease popular discontent by rebuilding the social safety net through health reform and other initiatives. "The danger I see is on the right," he said, explaining that a continuation of the conservative economic policies favored by President George W Bush risked raising discontent further. "If you go further down the Bush route, you will get a backlash because it's not true that everybody's better off," Stiglitz said. Ornstein agreed that a dramatic economic deterioration could raise the odds of a protectionist backlash. "You might see a trade war developing. You could see other countries including China getting mad enough to take measures against us," he said
