<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique both scored half-centuries in an unbroken 148-run partnership to launch a Bangladesh fightback in the first test with New Zealand at Dunedin on Saturday. Iqbal followed up his 53 from the first innings with an unbeaten 72 to cap a highly successful test debut and Siddique was 69 not out when stumps were drawn on the second day at University Oval. The tourists were still 72 runs behind after trailing New Zealand by 220 on the first innings. The home team were dismissed for 357 earlier in the day after Jacob Oram and Matthew Bell both completed hundreds. Bell, playing his first test in more than six years, celebrated his recall by scoring 107 after resuming on 74. His innings ended when he was trapped lbw by Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful after lunch. "I'm absolutely rapt I could do it out there," Bell told a news conference. "It's a fantastic feeling to score another hundred for New Zealand....but it was a really disappointing way to end the innings and not kick on. "I'm chosen in the team to bat for long periods of time and score big runs and while hundreds are nice when you get one you really want to make a pig of yourself." Oram, who took three wickets in Bangladesh's first innings, top-scored with 117, chalking up his fourth test century before he played on against Mashrafe Mortaza, who mopped up the tail to finish with 4-74
