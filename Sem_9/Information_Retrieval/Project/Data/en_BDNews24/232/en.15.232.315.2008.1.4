 Des Moines, Iowa, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic Sen. Barack Obama promised on Thursday to bring change to America if he wins his historic bid to be the first black US president. "They said this day would never come," the Illinois senator, surrounded by cheering supporters, declared after winning the Iowa Democratic caucus and defeating Sen. Hillary Clinton, the long-time national front-runner. "They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together," Obama said. "But on this January night at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do."
