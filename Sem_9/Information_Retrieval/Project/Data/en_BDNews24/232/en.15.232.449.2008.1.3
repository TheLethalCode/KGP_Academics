 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh ambassador to France Ruhul Amin has been put on the life support system as his condition is critical, an official said Thursday. Nazmul Quaunine, director general of the external publicity wing at the foreign affairs ministry, told bdnews24.com: "He (Amin) is on the life support system. We have the updates until 5pm (Bangladesh time)." Doctors have sought permission from the family to take him off the life support system, but no decision could be made as none of the family was around at the time. Amin suffered a brain haemorrhage Wednesday midnight (Bangladesh time) and was rushed to a clinic in Paris where doctors suggested transfer to another hospital for better treatment. Amin was appointed to France as ambassador in June 2007. Prior to his job in Paris, Amin, a career diplomat, was posted in Bahrain as Bangladesh envoy. bdnews24.c
