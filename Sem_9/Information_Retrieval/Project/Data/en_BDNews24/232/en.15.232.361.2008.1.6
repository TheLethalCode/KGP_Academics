 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)-The National Board of Revenue Sunday filed two cases against Globe Industrial Group chairman Atiqullah Khan Masud, his wife and their two sons on charges of dodging income tax. The NBR filed the cases with the senior special judge's court, prompting judge Md Azizul Haque to issue a warrant to produce Atiqullah Khan before court. The same court also issued arrest warrants against Masud's wife Shamima A Khan and sons Mishal Atiqullah Khan and Jishal Atiqullah Khan and chartered accountants Abdul Khaleque and Atauddin Khan, who allegedly assisted them in evading the tax. The court fixed Jan 9 for the next hearing on both cases. NBR's deputy tax commissioner Ayesha Siddiqa Shelley filed the first case. According to case details, the accused evaded Tk 2.08 crore in income tax by suppressing information about Tk 5.37 crore for tax years 1999 to 2006. Deputy tax commissioner Syed Zakir Hossain filed the second case that alleged that Atiqullah Khan, his wife and two sons had concealed Tk 6.23 crore in purchase of plots from Basundhara Group. bdnew
