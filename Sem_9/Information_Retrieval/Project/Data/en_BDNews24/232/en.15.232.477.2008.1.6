<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman said Sunday that Sheikh Hasina would not go abroad if the military-backed interim government put any condition for her. "Hasina won't go abroad if there are conditions by the government," Zillur told reporters outside a Dhaka court on the premises of the Sangsad Bhaban. He said there was a possibility that the government would attach conditions to the treatment of the detained party chief abroad if her physical condition deteriorates. Sunday was the day for hearing the charges of extortion against Hasina in the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge M Azizul Haque. Hasina could not attend the court Sunday for the second time because of her illness. The court set Jan 8 for next hearing of the case, which involves an alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from a businessman when she was in office in 1996-2001. Hasina and the Awami League denied the charges, saying they were aimed at preventing her from taking part in next elections. Zillur regretted that the authorities did not allow them to see the party chief. "It's very sad that she is ill. We have appealed for seeing her but the government didn't give us permission," he said. bdnew
