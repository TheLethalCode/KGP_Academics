 Riyadh, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists has urged Saudi Arabia to release a blogger who has been detained in the conservative Muslim kingdom for almost a month for his writings. Interior Ministry Spokesman Mansour al-Turki confirmed that Fouad al-Farhan was being detained but declined to say under what charges. The blogger was not being held over any security-related issues, he added. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Farhan was arrested for writing articles about political prisoners in Saudi Arabia on his Web site (www.alfarhan.org). "Arbitrarily detaining a writer and holding him for weeks without saying why violates the most basic norms for free expression and serves as a chilling reminder to those seeking to express their opinions," CPJ said in the letter. "It also runs counter to official Saudi statements in support of reform and a more open press." Farhan said Saudi authorities think he was running "an online campaign promoting the political prisoners issue", according to an email sent to friends, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. Saudi Arabia is often the target of complaints by rights groups. It recently faced international criticism over an Islamic court ruling that sentenced a gang-rape victim to flogging. The Saudi king later pardoned the 19-year old woman
