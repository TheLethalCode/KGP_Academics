 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock index futures indicated a strong open on Wall Street on Friday ahead of non-farm payrolls data which might offer clues on the outlook for interest rates and growth in the world's largest economy. Markets will also eye news that Barack Obama took the first step to winning the Democratic presidential nomination as Iowa kicked off state-by-state nomination battles for candidates seeking to run for U.S. president in the November 2008 election. By 1120 GMT, S&P futures and Dow futures were both up 0.2 percent and Nasdaq futures ticked up 0.1 percent. European equities traded higher.

US stocks ended little changed on Thursday as anxiety that Friday's payrolls data may suggest the economy is headed into recession dampened earlier optimism over buoyant factory orders. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1 percent to 13,056.7. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was unchanged at 1,447.2. The Nasdaq closed down for a fifth straight session, dragged lower by semiconducto
