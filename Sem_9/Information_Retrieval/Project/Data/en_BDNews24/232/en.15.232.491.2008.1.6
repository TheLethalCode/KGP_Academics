 COLOMBO, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Tamil Tigers' military intelligence chief was among 34 rebels killed in heavy fighting in northern Sri Lanka on Saturday, the military and a pro-Tiger Web site said, amid signs the 25-year civil war was escalating. Colonel Charles was killed in clashes in the northwestern district of Mannar, where fierce fighting has been focused for months, the military said on Sunday.

The government opted to cancel the ceasefire after a series of deadly bombings blamed on the Tigers, who are fighting for an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka. It argued that the insurgents, widely outlawed as a terrorist group, had used the pact to regroup and rearm, had violated the terms thousands of times and refused to talk peace sincerely. The international community has expressed alarm at the government's decision, urging the state to reach a political settlement to the protracted conflict.
