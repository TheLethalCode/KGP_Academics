 LILONGWE, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malawi will announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with China this month but will retain economic links with Taiwan, a Malawian foreign ministry official said on Friday. "A delegation ... was in mainland China last week to discuss bilateral relations with Malawi and the announcement will be made anytime this month," the official told Reuters. China, which is importing minerals and oil from around the world to feed its booming economy, is the world's third-largest investor in Africa.

China, which has seen self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, wants to isolate the island internationally and pressure it into unification by making diplomatic allies switch ties to Beijing. Taiwan's allies, which the island leadership sees as key to its legitimacy against China, have dwindled to 24, mostly small countries in poor regions, compared to China's 1
