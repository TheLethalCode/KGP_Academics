<TITLE> Launch of European and Japanese space labs delayed </TITLE>

 Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fixing what may be a design problem on the space shuttles will keep European and Japanese laboratory modules destined for the International Space Station grounded for weeks, NASA said on Thursday. The U.S. space agency rescheduled its first flight of the year for no earlier than January 24 but said a more realistic date for launching Europe's Columbus laboratory aboard the shuttle Atlantis will be around February 2, John Shannon, the deputy shuttle program manager told reporters on a conference call. "Everything has to go exactly right for us to make the 24th," Shannon said. The first part of Japan's Kibo complex would then fly on shuttle Endeavour about five weeks later. It originally was set for launch on February 14, a date that is no longer possible. Launch attempts of Atlantis were postponed on December 6 and December 9 due to erratic sensor readings in the spacecraft's hydrogen fuel tank. NASA had hoped to try again on January 10 but decided late last month that it would need more time to fix the problem. The sensors, which operate like dipsticks to gauge fuel levels, are part of an emergency system to cut off the shuttle's three hydrogen-burning main engines if the tank runs dry because of a leak or other problem during the climb to orbit. Running the engines without fuel could cause their pumps to break and possibly trigger a catastrophic explosion. NASA engineers decided the fuel sensor glitch resided in a plug-like connector that relays electrical signals from the sensors in the tank through wiring leading to the shuttle's engine compartment. They removed the suspect part and took it to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama for analysis. A modified connector plate, with soldered rather than plug-in components, will be installed this weekend even though inspections of the defective unit are not complete. If any surprises turn up, additional repairs may be needed. "If the problem is where we think it is, this will solve that," Shannon said. NASA also is considering filling the shuttle's tank with fuel to test the repaired sensor circuits prior to launch, which would delay Atlantis' flight to around February 7. NASA says there is still plenty of time for 12 missions to the space station as well as a 13th flight to service the Hubble Space Telescope before the shuttles are retired in 2010.
