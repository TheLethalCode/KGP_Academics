<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Sat Jan 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britney Spears left a hospital on Saturday where she was admitted following a confrontation at her home, which ended in a fit of hysterics by the troubled pop star, several media outlets reported. A number of celebrity Web sites said Spears was visited Saturday by Dr. Phil McGraw, who counsels people on his popular television program, "The Dr. Phil Show." A spokeswoman for the hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, declined comment citing patient confidentiality, and a representative for McGraw could not be reached. Spears, 26, was hospitalized on Friday when trouble erupted between her and representatives of her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, who went to Spears' home to pick up their two young sons from a weekend visitation.

Federline's attorneys went to a Los Angeles family court on Friday and obtained a ruling that suspended Spears' visitation rights to her two sons, Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1, until January 14. On Saturday, celebrity Web site TMZ.com reported that Spears was demanding to leave the hospital, and that she might appear on "The Dr. Phil Show" on Monday. Web sites for celebrity TV shows "Entertainment Tonight" and "The Insider" reported that McGraw walked Spears to her car. The New York Post's PageSix.com cited a "family insider" as saying Spears had "a complete nervous breakdown." None of the reports could be confirmed. Spears lost primary custody of her sons to Federline after her life spun out of control following their divorce in November 2006. Since then, she has spent time in rehab, been charged with hit-and-run driving and exhibited unusual behavior. Spears is currently undergoing court-ordered random drug and alcohol tests and parenting lessons. She became a teen pop phenomenon in the 1990s. In October, she made her musical comeback with the single, "Gimme More," and an album, "Blackout," that briefly hit No. 2 on the US pop album char
