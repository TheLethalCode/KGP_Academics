 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League's student front Bangladesh Chhatra League has vowed to free AL chief Sheikh Hasina through a movement. The declaration came as the organisation was celebrating Friday its 60th founding anniversary. "The government is harassing Sheikh Hasina by implicating her in false cases one after another. We will free her through movement," BCL president Mahmud Hasan Ripon told activists. He kicked off the celebrations at 9am by cutting a 60-pound cake at Curzon Hall of Dhaka University. "It is very sad that we have to celebrate our founding anniversary without our leader," the BCL chief said. Ripon also demanded that the detained Dhaka University teachers, students and central BCL leaders be freed. "The normal activities of the university cannot continue with the teachers detained in prison. They have to be immediately released." On student politics, Ripon said student organisations must work for student welfare. They will stand by students when they are in trouble and take strong steps during national crisis. BCL's DU unit president Sohel Rana Tipu and general secretary Sajjad Sakib Badsha were present. Later, the BCL leaders paid respect to independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman by placing wreath at Bangabandhu Memorial in Dhanmondi road no. 32. Later, they went to meet Hasina in special jail on Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises and handed in a wreath to jail authorities for her. The AL's student wing has also arranged a discussion meeting for 3pm at the AL's office in Dhanmondi road no. 3. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman and presidium member Tofail Ahmed are scheduled to attend it. bdne
