 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The father of a child that died from alleged wrong treatment at LabAid Hospital in late December has said he was not allowed to go public with a statement to the media. The father said he could not tell the media of the incident as the police intervened at the request of the chief of the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) cancelled a scheduled news briefing. Shafiqul Islam, a businessman from Chawkbazar in Old Dhaka, said his 1 -month old girl Afia died from "wrong treatment" at LabAid Hospital on Dec 27 after she was admitted there on Dec 24. He said he booked the hall room of DRU office for Jan 1 to hold a news conference but the DRU authorities cancelled the booking citing no reason. Shafiqul said he then tried to speak to reporters in front of the DRU office in Segun Bagicha, but was whisked away by the police. He said Afia was admitted into the cabin No. 464 of LabAid on the evening of Dec 24 under the supervision of Dr Col (retd) Nurun Nahar Fatema. A small operation was performed on the heart of Afia on Dec 25 and she was then taken to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). On Dec 27 when he went into the NICU he found out that Afia's respiration was kept functional by a hand-run pump. After half an hour he was told that the incubator was not working and was advised to take the child to another hospital for proper ventilation. Shafiqul said Afia was shifted to Salahuddin Hospital from LabAid in Dhanmondi around noon on Dec 27. Doctors declared Afia dead on arrival at Salahuddin Hospital. LabAid Group managing director Dr MMA Shamim told bdnews24.com that the child did not die from wrong treatment, nor did she die at his hospital. The child had three holes in the heart at birth and two attempts had been made to plug the holes but the hospital authorities were in no way responsible for the death, Dr Shamim asserted. He added a special ventilation machine is required for such patient and Afia's relatives were informed about it. On Thursday, Afia's father said: "What's the difference between LabAid and another hospital when we don't get proper treatment from there even with so much money we spend?" Shafiqul has alleged that LabAid took so long to make the bills for treatment costs during checkout when he needed to rush to another hospital with his child. "I told the LabAid management that my wife would pay the bills. I wanted to rush out with my child to another hospital. But the LabAid officials didn't let me go," he alleged. Shafiqul claimed that the duty doctor at the NICU did not inform him about the problems of ventilation in time. "I got to know that a fire was sparked in the basement of the hospital on Dec 27 and patients were shifted from the third floor of LabAid to LabAid Cardiac Hospital nearby. But my child was left alone there on the fourth floor (where NICU is located). Not so, said Mesbah Aajad, media coordinator for LabAid. "There was no fire in the hospital on Dec 27. "And we had shifted only the adult patients to LabAid Cardiac Hospitalbut no children, as LabAid Cardiac Hospital has no arrangement for neonatal care," he said. Mesbah would not explain why the adult patients were shifted. ROLE OF DRU Shafiqul, the father, said, "I booked the DRU hall for an 11:30am press conference on Jan 1. Letters were also sent to newspaper offices with the same schedule." He said when he went to the DRU office at about 11am on Jan 1, the "DRU people" told him that his booking had been cancelled, without assigning any reason. When he tried to speak to reporters outside the DRU office, police obstructed him. Officer in charge of Shahbagh Police Station Shahidul Islam told bdews24.com by phone that Madhushudan Mandol, acting president of the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB), called them at about 11:30am on Jan 1 to say that some people were trying to enter the DRU and CRAB offices. They sought police intervention and a mobile team was sent there, the Shahbagh police chief said. Madhushudan denied having made the call. He also said he was working for private television station, called "71", which was yet to go on the air. LabAid Group is financing the TV channel, he said. DRU president Alamgir Hossain said: "We were told that a press conference would be held over a family feud. If we had been told about the issue of the baby we would have allowed them to hold the press conference on humanitarian grounds. "Shafiqul Islam was informed about the cancellation of the permission for the press conference a day before it was scheduled for," Alamgir said. bdnews24.com/
