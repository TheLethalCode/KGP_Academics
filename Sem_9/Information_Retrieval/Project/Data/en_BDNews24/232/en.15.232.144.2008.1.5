 Dhaka, Jan 05 (bdnews24.com)  Human rights watchdog Amnesty International's secretary general Irene Khan arrived in Dhaka Saturday morning on a six-day visit. Soon after she arrived in Dhaka, she attended a seminar on human rights at the LGED auditorium in Agargaon. During her visit, Khan will meet with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed, law adviser Mainul Hosein and foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in Dhaka. She is also scheduled to exchange views with civil society and rights organisations and attend a roundtable discussion at Drik Gallery in Dhanmondi on Jan 9. Just prior to Irene's arrival in Bangladesh, Amnesty International had called on the Government of Bangladesh for the unconditional release of cartoonist Arifur Rahman. Arif was arrested and detained in Sept 2007 for "hurting religious sentiment" in a cartoon published in Alpin, a satire magazine of Bangla daily newspaper Prothom Alo. A statement, naming Arif "a prisoner of conscience" and calling for his release, was posted on Amnesty International's website Friday. bdnews24
