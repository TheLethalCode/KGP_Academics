<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 04 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami Friday said a ban on religion-based political outfits would serve as an obstacle to good governance. He said the demand for banning politics based on religion would not be able to stop Islam's progress. "It would rather create obstacles to establishing good governance," Nizami said at the meeting of the party's highest policymaking body, Majlish-e-Shura, in Al Falah auditorium in Magbazar in the city. The chief of the Islamist party expressed concern at the soaring prices of essential commodities. He asked the government to take urgent steps to import rice and launch development activities including agriculture rehabilitation and food for work programmes in the cyclone-ravaged areas. Some Shura members said they would discuss political situation of the country and preparation for the next election in the meeting. bdne
