<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares firmed by midday on Friday ahead of crucial US jobs data while mining and oil stocks benefited from high commodity prices. The mining sector was positive across the board, with Vedanta Resources leading the charge, up 3.3 percent, and Rio Tinto pushing up 3 percent. Shares in Xstrata gained 2.6 percent. Australian coal miner Resource Pacific rejected a takeover bid from Xstrata as "neither fair nor reasonable". BP rose 1.6 percent and Royal Dutch Shell was up 1.1 percent as US crude oil prices hovered just below the psychologically important $100 a barrel mark reached on Thursday. By 1206 GMT, the FTSE 100 index was up 40.3 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6,519.3, led by gains in these two heavyweight sectors, and adding to Thursday's nearly 1 percent jump. The FTSE gained 3.8 percent last year but logged its worst performance since 2002. Record merger and acquisition activity was offset by a global liquidity crisis that has created much economic uncertainty and risk aversion in markets. "It's no surprise that investors are migrating up the capitalisation scale," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of private client research at Charles Stanley. "They're being supported by some extent by the fact that the FTSE 100 is weighted towards raw materials and scarce precious minerals and also oil." "There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic backdrop this year." Mobile phone company Vodafone was the single biggest positive influence on the index, rising 2 percent. Carphone Warehouse jumped 8 percent and headed gainers as traders reported talk of bid interest from Vodafone and strong Christmas sales at the mobile phone retailer. Banks were mixed ahead of US jobs data due at 1330 GMT that will offer evidence of the world's largest economy's ability to generate jobs despite a global liquidity crisis, record high oil prices and a deteriorating housing market. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 70,000 jobs were created in December, down from a November increase of 94,000 jobs. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1.3 percent, Barclays was up 0.4 percent and HSBC gained 0.7 percent. Lloyds TSB fell 0.6 perce
