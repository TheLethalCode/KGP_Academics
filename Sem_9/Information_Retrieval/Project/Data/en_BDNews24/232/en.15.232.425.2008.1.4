 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman banned from driving for seven days after travelling at speeds of less than 10mph on the motorway told Reuters on Friday: "that road's my nemesis." Stephanie Cole, 58, of Fishponds, Bristol, straddled the hard shoulder and inside lane as she dawdled along a stretch of the M32 near her home last August. In the back window of the car was a sign which said: "I don't do fast, please overtake". Cole admitted driving without reasonable consideration at North Avon Magistrates' Court on Friday and was told she would have to take another test at the end of the ban. "I didn't intend getting onto the motorway, but all of a sudden I found myself on it and I could not get off," she told Reuters after the hearing. "I just panicked. I hate that particular stretch of road and I avoid it normally. It is my nemesis." Cole had been travelling from her home to a stationer's when she was arrested in her Perodua Kenari mini people-carrier. "I thought "thank God" when I saw the blue flashing lights," she said. "I thought they could help and I asked them if they could drive me home." Cole, who has multiple sclerosis, said she depends on her car for getting around. "I will try and retake the test," she said. "I will have to do my best when driving, and hope it is better than it was.
