 KINSHASA, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congo's Tutsi rebels will attend a peace conference aimed at ending fighting in the east, a top rebel commander said on Saturday, and the government pledged to suspend military action against rebels during the talks. The peace and security summit in the blood-steeped North and South Kivu provinces of Democratic Republic of Congo is due to begin on Sunday and aims to bring together government officials, local leaders, and representatives of rival warring factions. "We are invited and will send our delegation," Bwambale Kakolele, the top military commander of a Tutsi-dominated rebel movement led by renegade General Laurent Nkunda, told Reuters. Despite the end of Congo's 1998-2003 war, conflict in the east of the vast, mineral-rich former Belgian colony has continued, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians from their homes in the Kivus and causing renewed humanitarian suffering. The government called the peace conference in North Kivu's provincial capital Goma after the disastrous failure of an offensive against the rebels last month that further worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis. Kakolele said Nkunda would initially send a mixture of lower-level military and civilian delegates. "We must first see if the will is there... There is also the question of security. (Nkunda and I) will perhaps participate later," he said. In an apparent show of good faith, Defence Minister Chikez Diemu halted military operations against Nkunda's rebels. "In the aim of allowing for the holding of the conference in good conditions, I announced the suspension of all operations, especially in North Kivu," he told Reuters. A spokesman for the 'Pareco' Mai Mai militia, which was created to combat Nkunda's rebellion, said the group would send several civilian political delegates to the conference. However, Ignace Murwanashyaka, president of the Rwandan Hutu Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), told Reuters they had not been invited to the conference. "According to information we received this is to be an inter-Congolese dialogue. We weren't asked to participate," he said. The FDLR includes former Rwandan troops and Interahamwe militia who fled to Congo after carrying out Rwanda's 1994 genocide of some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Congo's war ended in 2003 but eastern violence goes on. Some 4 million people have died since the 1998-2003 war began. Nkunda led around 4,000 fighters into the bush in 2004 saying he was protecting fellow Tutsis against FDLR attack. Open fighting resumed between Nkunda and the Congolese army in late August after Nkunda abandoned a Rwandan-brokered accord and pulled thousands of his fighters out of mixed army brigades. More than 400,000 North Kivu residents have been forced to flee clashes between government troops, Nkunda loyalists, local Mai Mai militia, and Rwandan Hutu rebels over the past year. One conference organiser, Vital Kamerhe, president of Congo's lower house of parliament, told UN-sponsored Radio Okapi he believed between 850 and 1,000 delegates would attend the talks -- well beyond the initial 200 expected.
