 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Sunday approved installation of seven rental power plants to add 270MW electricity to the national power grid within four months of the contract signing, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said. The cabinet committee on public purchase approved the installation of the plants at a meeting chaired by Azizul Islam, also chairman of the committee. "Some 270MW electricity will be added to the national power grid within 120 days of the work order," Azizul told reporters after the meeting at the finance ministry. The plants will be installed in Bhola, Bogra, Bheramara, Fenchuganj, Khulna, Shahzibazar and Kumarganj in Sylhet, he said. Energy ministry officials said the proposal evaluation committee of the ministry recommended Energy Prima, Alstom Power Company, Kaltimex, GBB Power and Aggriko for installation of the plants. "The power purchase rate is yet to be fixed. We can't say anything before receiving the minutes of the meeting," Abdul Jalil, director general of the Power Cell, told bdnews24.com.
