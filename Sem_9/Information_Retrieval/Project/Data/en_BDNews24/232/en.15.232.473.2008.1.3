<TITLE> Odinga in fight of his life over 'stolen' poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former political prisoner and opposition leader Raila Odinga shows no sign of relinquishing the fight to reverse narrow defeat in a presidential election that has pushed Kenya to the brink of chaos. Under huge pressure to end an impasse sparking the country's worst clashes in years, Odinga has been urged to hold talks with his rival, President Mwai Kibaki, and stop supporters from his Luo tribe attacking Kibaki's Kikuyu kinsmen. But with the death toll mounting, Odinga is still pressing on with probably the toughest battle of his turbulent political life to reclaim what he considers to be his "stolen" victory. "People have seen their nascent democracy shackled, strangled and finally killed," he said, flanked by his Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) colleagues. "Stopping this is not in the hands of the ODM, this violence can be stopped immediately when Kibaki steps down. "I am the elected president of the republic of Kenya." Last week's vote was widely seen as the 62-year-old's best chance of winning the presidency and fulfilling the dream that eluded his late father, a hero of the independence struggle. Many say Odinga, who helped propel Kibaki to the top job five years ago, may be too old and faces too much competition from party colleagues to run a powerful campaign in 2012. With everything to gain, he has been buoyed by a chorus of international concern over the vote. Looking tired and visibly angry at a flurry of press briefings, he has initially refused dialogue with his former ally -- unless there is international arbitration. And he has arguably thrown fuel on the fire by insisting on a protest rally, despite a police ban. "He's a tough character," said a Western diplomat. "He knows his community doesn't want him to stand down." "RABBLE-ROUSER" Critics say Odinga's defiance confirms his reputation for being a rabble-rouser, who admitted backing a 1982 coup attempt in a recent biography. But many fear his call for peaceful mass action is a lightning rod for more bloodshed. "The only solution is finding a gracious way for President Kibaki to say 'I won the election, but in the interest of this country I'm handing over to Raila Odinga'," said Salim Lone, an Odinga spokesman. "The violence would stop overnight and healing would begin." Odinga, the self-styled "people's president" who delighted supporters by driving to campaign rallies in a red Hummer, is enjoying the sympathy of a cross-section of Kenyans angered at rigging claims and disenchanted with Kibaki's leadership. But goodwill towards a man, who rattled the Kikuyu establishment whose members see themselves as Kenya's rightful rulers, may wane as killings mount. In a column for the Daily Nation newspaper, commentator Macharia Gaitho said Odinga had a chance to display "statemanship, not brinkmanship." "Nobody right now is better placed than Mr Odinga and his key ODM lieutenants...to do what the government is unable to do -- save this country from total destruction, and President Kibaki's people from the threat of genocide." "If their intervention can restore a peace the government is unable to, that will be the real demonstration of who has the people's mandate." Government officials call him a trouble-maker and criminal, who has whipped up tribal tensions shamelessly. Even if Odinga ultimately loses his fight for the presidency, he will continue to loom large in Kenyan politics. His party unseated most of Kibaki's cabinet and took a huge majority in concurrent parliamentary polls. With a history of crossing the floor of the house, Odinga will be quick to forge ties with other opposition figures and may seek revenge on Kibaki by trying to push a confidence vote at the earliest opportunity. Hardened by several stints in jail including six years of solitary confinement under former strongman leader Daniel arap Moi, Odinga is unlikely right now to even contemplate a role that does not have him on centre sta
