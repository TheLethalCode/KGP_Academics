<TITLE> EU must choose between Serbia and Kosovo: Serb PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BELGRADE, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union must choose between signing an accord with Serbia or deploying a mission to Kosovo as a prelude to an independence declaration by the breakaway province, Serbia's prime minister said on Thursday. In a written statement, Vojislav Kostunica said that when EU foreign ministers met on Jan. 28, the bloc would have to choose "whether it wants a whole... Serbia as a partner, or it wants to create a 'quasi state' on Serb territory". "The EU must choose... whether it will sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia or, under United States pressure, send a mission to implement (a plan for) supervised independence of Kosovo, snatching part of Serbia's territory." Kosovo is expected to declare independence early this year. Thursday's statement echoes a Kostunica-sponsored parliament resolution that Serbia would shun offers of EU membership if the bloc recognises Kosovo as an independent state. Kostunica indicated that instead of signing the agreement -- a first step towards EU membership -- Serbia might take a step back. If the EU took the "illegal decision" to send a mission to Kosovo, it would effectively be making "null and void" the initialling of the accord in December, he said. Government sources and EU politicians say such rhetoric has more to do with electioneering ahead of a presidential vote later in January than a real change of course. Serbia spent the 1990s in international isolation for its role in wars in Croatia and Bosnia. It lost control of Kosovo in 1999 after 11 weeks of bombing by NATO forced strongman Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his troops, ending a ruthless counter-insurgency campaign that killed some 10,000 civilians and drove 800,000 from their homes. The territory has since been run by the United Nations. Belgrade offers wide autonomy short of full self-determination, but Kosovo's 2 million Albanians are preparing to declare independence with the backing of the United States and most EU members. The EU is planning to take over policing and justice supervision from the U.N. and steer the province through a period of supervised independence. While Kostunica is seen as unyielding, the West hopes that moderate President Boris Tadic, his coalition partner in the government, will be more pragmatic. Re-election in the presidential vote could lead Tadic to be more assertive towards Kostunica's hardline leanings. A vote for ultranationalist contender Tomislav Nikolic would be a gesture of defiance to the West. Polls indicate the race will be close. It was made more confusing by a Thursday statement by Kostunica's party that they would not be supporting Tadic in the first round on Jan. 20, but instead back another candidate from a smaller party.
