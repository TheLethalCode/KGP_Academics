 Nashua, New Hampshire, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, after losing the youth vote to Barack Obama in Iowa, turned her attention to young voters in New Hampshire on Sunday. Young voters turned out in large numbers in Iowa, helping push Obama to victory in the nation's first presidential nominating contest there last Thursday, while a large swath of Clinton's support came from older voters, research showed. Clinton, a New York senator once seen as the Democratic front-runner but who came in third in Iowa after Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, is under enormous pressure to regain political momentum ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. Obama has pulled into a virtual dead heat with Clinton in New Hampshire, according to a Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Sunday. New Hampshire holds the second of the state-by-state contests to nominate Republican and Democratic candidates to compete in the November election to succeed President George W. Bush. Taking newfound aim at young voters, Clinton told supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, she wanted to help give "every generation, especially young Americans, a chance to live their own dream and hopes." By contrast, in Iowa, Clinton scarcely mentioned young voters directly in her campaign stump speeches. In Nashua, accompanied by her 27-year-old daughter, Chelsea, she said: "When I think about the world that awaits her and all of the young people who are here, I want to be sure that our country keeps faith with their dreams, that we can deliver the kind of possibilities that will give each of you the chance to live out your own hopes." "Too many young people feel like America's not going to live up to its promise to them," she added. EVOLVING CAMPAIGN Asked about all the new attention to young people, Clinton, who is seeking to become the first woman US president, said: "I think if a campaign doesn't evolve, it probably is dead, and I don't intend for it to be anything other than a winning campaign. "We're just going to keep moving and reaching out and trying to attract as many voters of all ages as we possibly can," she said. Iowa youth turned out in droves for Obama, whose campaign heavily sought their support. Observers say his speeches, which emphasize change and hope for the future, are particularly inspirational for young Americans. Obama is trying to become the first black U.S. president. "Obama's cool, and that's why people like him," said Michaela Balderston, 18, a Clinton volunteer in New Hampshire from Alexandria, Virginia. "She has 35 years of experience. That really appeals to me. It's experience over cool." Research showed more than a third of Obama's support in Iowa came from voters under age 30, and that nearly two-thirds of young Iowa voters backed the Illinois senator. Clinton meanwhile saw more than a third of her support in Iowa come from voters over age 65. More than 65,000 Iowa caucus-goers were under age 30, three times as many as those in 2004, local media reported. "We worked very hard to get young people out in Iowa and didn't do as well as we should have," said Clinton spokesman Jay Carson. "So we're redoubling our efforts here in New Hampshire in hopes of turning out more young people.
