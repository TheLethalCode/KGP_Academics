<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com) The import of five lakh tonnes of rice from India has run into snags, officials with the Bangladesh mission in New Delhi said Saturday. Prices have not been fixed over the past one month, and the method of import has yet to be finalised, the officials said. The economic minister at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, Wasiuddin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com: "Rice purchase through three separate Indian government organisations is being discussed." "We are expecting a delegation from the Ministry of Food to come to India on Jan 9 or 10 to discuss the matter." "If the Indian agencies had agreed, the Bangladesh trade delegation could have come earlier." After Cyclone Sidr struck, Indian foreign affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee during a visit to Dhaka on Dec 1 announced that Bangladesh would be able to import five lakh tonnes of rice from India. At the primary stage of discussion, the Indian government verbally agreed that the five lakh tonnes of rice would be bought in the private market, said a top official with the food ministry in Dhaka. Only weeks later, India stated in a letter that the rice would have to be imported at the government level, the official said, adding that "India backtracked from its earlier position". Bangladesh was told to contact three Indian trading housesState Trading Corporation of India, Metal and Mineral Trading Corporation and National Agricultural Cooperation Federationand finalise the conditions for rice import. Although they were supposed to give final price quotations for the rice import on Jan 3, they are yet to do so, the official said. The Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi was maintaining contact with these three firms, Wasiuddin told bdnews24.com, adding that they would have to sit with the firms separately. The houses themselves would not supply the rice directly and would buy rice from suppliers, but for this they would need approval from their respective ministries, Wasiuddin said. "I wanted to bring in a delegation from our food ministry so that it could fix the rice prices and conditions of the agreement, but the three Indian organisations did not agree yet." "Later, we sat separately with the representatives of the three organisations. I hope the food ministry officials will come to Delhi for discussions as per the date given by the Indian organisations," he said. Whether road, rail or ship will be used as the mode of transportation for import has still not been decided, he added. bdnews24.co
