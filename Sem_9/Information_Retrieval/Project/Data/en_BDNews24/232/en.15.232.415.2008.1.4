<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Barcelona forward Ronaldinho will miss his side's league match at Real Mallorca because of tendinitis in his left knee, the club said on their Web site (www.fcbarcelona.com). Ronaldinho, who came under fire after a poor performance in the recent 1-0 defeat against Real Madrid, also missed out on his side's King's Cup match against Alcoyano in midweek. Striker Thierry Henry, who has not played since Nov. 24, is available after recovering from headaches that prevented him from training earlier in the week. Real Zaragoza's leading striker Diego Milito will miss Sunday's match against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu after being sent off in the final minute of his side's King's Cup victory over third division Pontevedra. Milito has scored nine league goals this season, although Zaragoza his team are currently on a seven-match winless streak. Real Madrid winger Arjen Robben is hoping that scoring his first goal for the club since making his 36 million euro move from Chelsea will help him claim a regular place in the starting line-up after missing much of the first part of the season because of injury. "I feel in good shape after recovering from my last injury and I'm ready to play more," the Dutchman told sports daily AS after scoring in the Cup win over Alicante. "I need to play more and more and that's the only way I will become the sort of player I was before." Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido said Wednesday's scare in the King's Cup against third division Denia gave his team the perfect wake-up call before Sunday's city derby against Real Betis. "The lesson in humility that Denia gave us showed us that we will have to play from the first minute to the last on Sunday," said Del Nido. Sevilla surrendered a 2-0 lead to trail 3-2 against Denia and needed an 88th-minute strike from Ernesto Chevanton and a stoppage time penalty from Frederic Kanoute to reach the last 16. Betis have not beaten Sevilla in the league at the Sanchez Pizjuan for 11 years. Villarreal's striker Nihat Kahveci will miss his side's league clash against fellow high fliers Espanyol because of a muscle tear in his right leg. Argentine midfielder Ever Banega is expected to complete an 18-million euro move from Boca Juniors to Valencia at the weekend. "I'm surprised by how quickly everything happened," the 19-year-old told Argentine daily Ole. "It was a great deal for the club and an important move for me and my family. I had to accept it.
