 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Saturday reassured that the interim government would hold the voting in line with the roadmap. He promised "acceptable and neutral" polls, and said there was no possibility of deviating from its original plan. The army, he said, would provide the administration with all assistance for voting to get through. His statement came as he spoke to the closing session of a conference of the local government representatives at the National Parade Square in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Moeen asked all to be part of a campaign for electing efficient and honest people to office so that the country does not need to go back to the tumultuous days before Jan 11. He said the elected representatives in the local government have a vital role to play to achieve that target. Moeen later took questions from the participants of the conference. Moeen said the time has come to evaluate how much the nation has achieved in line with the expectations of people since 1971. "If there would not have been widespread corruption and destructive politics, we could have fulfilled the people's desire," he said. The army chief said the nation has lost 2 percent of the GDP because of the pervasive corruption while another 2 percent goes because of hartal for years. He said the nation has a chance to march through the highway of the development if 15 crore people could make their 30 crore hands useful. Despite three huge natural disasters in recent months, the nation stands still overlooking all the hurdles, he said. "We didn't crumble," he said, adding that the local government representatives could make a sea change in society. He regretted that only 40 to 45 percent of the money allocated by the government had been used for development while the rest ended up in the hands of corrupt people in the recent past. Moeen said his soldiers have been working tirelessly to make a flawless electoral roll to contribute to an acceptable election. He said recent disasters have pushed the prices of daily commodities up while hoarding by "dishonest businessmen" was another vital reason. "Now the prices are going down thanks to various measures," he said. He asked the local government representatives to encourage the farmers to grow more crops in the next season. "If necessary, farmers will get financial aid from the government," he said. Local government adviser M Anwarul Iqbal presided over the working session. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan and Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed also spoke at the concluding session of the conference. bdnews24
