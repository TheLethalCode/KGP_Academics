 Conakry, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guinea's ruling party appealed to citizens to boycott a general strike called for Jan. 10, saying it would plunge the West African country back into chaos a year after demonstrations in which more than 130 protesters died. Sekou Konate, secretary-general of the Unity and Progress Party, called on the powerful unions on Sunday to come to the negotiating table and said they had no right to call a strike after President Lansana Conte sacked a member of a consensus government on Thursday. Unions accuse the reclusive Conte of violating the power-sharing deal that ended last year's violent protests, which brought the world's largest bauxite exporter to a halt for months. Under the deal, Prime Minister Lansana Kouyate has sole authority to name the members of his cabinet. "Unions should not call a strike just because of a presidential decree," Konate told a news conference. "A strike will only bring troubles to the country and we should avoid that." At least one person was killed on Friday when youths burned tyres, erected barricades and pelted vehicles with stones in poor parts of the capital Conakry to protest at the sacking of Communication Minister Justin Morel Junior. The opposition in Guinea is weak and divided, and unions have taken a lead in forcing democratic change upon Conte, an army general who has ruled the former French colony with an iron fist since taking power in 1984. Last year's strike caused major disruption to exports of bauxite, the ore used to make aluminium, and hurt an economy already prone to high inflation and sporadic food and fuel shortages. Conakry residents made the most of a lull in protests at the weekend to stock up on food and other essentials before the strike. The government has appealed to religious leaders, who headed last year's successful negotiations, to mediate in the dispute. The death from illness in Paris on Saturday of General Arafan Camara, the ex-deputy head of Guinea's armed forces and former defence minister, deprived the septuagenarian Conte of one of his closest military allies
