 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England have axed wicketkeeper Matt Prior for next month's tour of New Zealand after he dropped a number of catches in the series against Sri Lanka. Warwickshire's Tim Ambrose has been selected in his place and the uncapped 25-year-old will compete with Phil Mustard for a place in the team. Middlesex opening batsman Andrew Strauss, a key figure in England's 2005 Ashes triumph but omitted from the Sri Lanka tour, was recalled to the 16-man test squad announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) at Lord's on Friday. "Ambrose fully deserves an opportunity at this level following impressive performances for the England performance squad in India before Christmas and for Warwickshire last season," said chairman of selectors David Graveney in a statement. "We felt in this instance that, as well as Matt Prior has batted, there are areas of his wicketkeeping that he needs to work at and that's the reason why we've made that decision," he added at a later news conference. Graveney said Strauss would come back stronger from the enforced break. "He's worked very hard on his game, we need his experience for what is going to be a tough series," he said. "His experience will be of benefit to the squad as a whole and his inclusion will also provide us with alternative options if required at the top of the batting order," said Graveney. Kent off-spinner James Tredwell was called up for the one-day squad for the first time while Essex all-rounder Ravi Bopara is dropped from the test squad but included in the limited overs side. Sussex's Prior became the first England wicketkeeper to make a century on his test debut when he appeared against the West Indies at Lord's last May. However, his recent form behind the stumps has been suspect with a string of handling errors during the test series against Sri Lanka, which England lost 1-0. "I'm sure Matt will be back," said Graveney. "He's proven that he can play at that level but we have to improve our ratio of taking chances. "The wicketkeeping situation since Alec (Stewart) has finished has been under the microscope, more so than any other position." England have searched unsuccesfully for a player who can keep wicket adequately and score runs consistently since Stewart retired in 2003 as his country's second highest run scorer after Graham Gooch
