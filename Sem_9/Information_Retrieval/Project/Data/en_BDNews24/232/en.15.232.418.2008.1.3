<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell to their lowest in a month on Thursday, as British retailers DSG and Next issued downbeat outlooks, raising worries about the resilience of consumer spending. Banks were the largest negative weight on the broader market, with UBS, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander down as much as 2.7 percent. Shares in Next were among the largest percentage decliners in Europe, while oil companies were the main gainers as the price of a barrel of crude oil hovered near the $100 mark on expectations for a drop in US inventories. At 1120 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,475.96 points, its lowest since Nov. 28. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about six to one. The index fell 1.3 percent on Wednesday, the first session of the year, after closing 2007 with a 1.6 percent gain, its worst performance since 2002. "Obviously it's not a very welcome or promising start to the year, clearly it's disappointing. But ... it's too early to pronounce judgement on whether this is the lead indicator of how things will evolve throughout the year," said Brewin Dolphin chief strategist Mike Lenhoff. "I feel the boundaries of those trading ranges are defined by loss of earnings momentum, which will limit the upside, but equally limiting the downside are cuts in interest rates." Retail stocks were among the session's worst performers. The DJ Stoxx retail index fell nearly 3 percent. DSG tumbled more than 19 percent after the mid-cap electrical goods retailer said its annual profits would miss analysts' expectations after poor Christmas trading. Next, which warned that its 2008 outlook was "extremely cautious" as consumers face increasing demands on their finances, was down by nearly 6.5 percent. Other retailers fell, with Marks & Spencer down 3.5 percent, Spain's Inditex down nearly 4 percent and Carrefour down 1.1 percent. MORE DECLINES The FTSEurofirst was down for the second day in a row, after a key measure of U.S. manufacturing fell to its lowest in five years, even with the dollar near record lows against a basket of major currencies and a raft of rate cuts. Adding to the drag on global equities were the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy-setting committee meeting, at which members expressed concern the credit crunch could restrain economic growth. The Institute for Supply Management's index of U.S. factory activity fell to 47.7 from 50.8 in November, well below expectations and the weakest since April 2003. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. "The ISM numbers showed that the slowdown in the manufacturing sector is a reality," said Jean-Marc Lucas, economist at BNP Paribas in Paris. "On the one side, you have economic data pointing lower, and on the other side record oil prices that raise concerns over inflation, a difficult situation for the Fed. The data fuel the stagflation theme, but we think that recession risks are much greater than inflation risks," he said. Stagflation, when prices rise even as growth stagnates, was last seen in the late 1970s. It could pose a dilemma for the Federal Reserve as policies aimed at boosting economic growth may fuel inflation, while policies used to fight inflation could weigh on an economy already fighting the fallout from the housing slump. Oil prices hovered just below the $100 a barrel level hit a day ago on expectations for a drop in U.S. stockpiles, the weakening US dollar and geopolitical risks. BP rose 2.2 percent, Total gained 2.5 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 1.2 percent. Around European, Germany's DAX index lost 0.7 percent, Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 0.4 percent. On the macro front, investors are awaiting US monthly jobs figures, due on Friday at 1330 GMT. US weekly inventory numbers will be released at 1530 G
