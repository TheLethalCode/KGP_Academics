 Athens, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strong earthquake shook parts of Greece on Sunday but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. The quake woke up residents in the capital Athens and prompted people in several other cities to call emergency services. "It shook me out of bed," said Reuters correspondent Karolos Grohmann. "The house was shaking badly," a woman from the northern Athens suburb of Maroussi told a radio station. The magnitude and the epicentre of the quake, which occurred shortly after 7 a.m. (0500 GMT), were not immediately known. Greek media said they had received calls from people who felt the quake in several Greek cities, mainly in the south.
