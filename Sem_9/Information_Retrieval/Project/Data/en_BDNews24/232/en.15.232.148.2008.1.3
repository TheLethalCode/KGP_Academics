 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  More than 1,000 garment workers took to the streets for a second day Thursday in the city's Sheorapara and clashed with police to protest the sudden closure of a factory without notice, witnesses said. Police clubbed and dispersed the workers in front of the Police Staff College in Mirpur after the demonstrators vandalised some 10 vehicles on the road. Witnesses said workers of about 50 other garment factories in Sheorapara and neighbouring areas skipped work to express their solidarity with workers of SQ Sweaters Ltd. bdnews24.com senior correspondent Liton Haider reported from the scene that the workers of SQ Sweaters and other factories blockaded the main road from Mirpur-10 to Mirpur-14 and staged demonstrations. The workers who were staying at Sheorapara halted their agitation for one hour at 2:00 pm. Agitating workers assembled at Rokeya Sarani at 7:30am, blockading the road, bdnews24.com photographer Mustafiz Mamun reported from the scene. A huge traffic snarl-up clogged the roads in the area during Thursday's busy morning hours A meeting between the workers' representatives and the owners started at 12:50pm at the BGMEA Bhaban. BGMEA leaders, the police and the army officers were also present at the meeting. Army personnel earlier had taken 10 protestors in to Mirpur Police Station to "get them to sit with the owners" to resolve the crisis, but to no avail as the owners did not turn up there. Finally, the meeting began at the BGMEA Bhaban. bdnews24.com correspondent Mahbub Alam Roni stationed in Mirpur-10 intersection said workers of SQ Sweaters went to Turja Apparels, a garment factory, to call them to join the protest. But Turza Apparels workers attacked them leaving Shamim and Hasan injured. Shamim said misunderstanding among the workers led to the attack on them. "We went there to call them, not to attack." Roni said the workers assembled at Mirpur-10 intersection. Workers of Jugi garments, Ashulia garments, Fashion Maker and Shaon garments vented their anger while speaking to bdnews24.com. They made a number of demands including pay rise, pay for overtime work and allowing them to enjoy weekly holiday. The protest began Wednesday morning as the workers blocked Rokeya Sarani throughout the day, blocking the busy thoroughfare because of the closure of SQ Sweaters Ltd. BGMEA officials and the police Wednesday failed to manage the protesters as the death of a fellow worker on Monday fuelled their anger. After a nine-hour shutdown of Rokeya Sarani that runs through Sheorapara the protesters withdrew their blockade Wednesday evening but announced the protest would continue the following day. The protesters resumed their agitation early Thursday amid tight vigilance by security officials. Monir Hossain, a SQ worker, told bdnews24.com: "Our main demand is compensation for the family of the dead worker who fell sick at the factory." The death of worker Salma Aktar on Monday left her fellow workers fuming. Salma died because of factory authorities' alleged neglect, the protesters claimed. She fell sick Sunday night and wanted to go home but the factory management did not allow her, said co-workers, forcing her to work through that night. She died after returning home Monday morning. The following day, Salma's colleagues blamed factory officials for her death, though it was not clear what had caused it. bdnews24.com/m
