 MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fresh from big wins in Iowa, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mike Huckabee said they had momentum as they swept into New Hampshire on Friday to campaign for the next prize in the U.S. presidential race. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Friday gave Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain leads in New Hampshire, but the polling was done before Iowa's contest on Thursday in which Clinton finished third, and did not include a predicted bounce for Obama as a result of his Iowa victory. All the major candidates fanned out across New Hampshire for political events, ahead of back-to-back debates in Manchester on Saturday night and the state's primary contest on Tuesday. Iowa's caucuses kicked off a state-by state process to pick the Democratic and Republican candidates to run in the November presidential election to replace President George W. Bush. The prize for the Iowa winners is valuable momentum and at least a temporary claim to the front-runner's slot. Clinton, 60, a New York senator who would be the first woman U.S. president and who has for months occupied a commanding front-runner's position in national opinion polls, was solidly beaten in Iowa by Obama, an Illinois senator who would be the first black president. "I think it's a harbinger of what's going to happen around the country," Obama told reporters early on Friday on his flight from Iowa to New Hampshire. He said his message of hope and a desire for change hit home with Iowans, encouraging many to vote for the first time. Obama drew rave reviews for a victory speech in Des Moines with soaring rhetoric about how he wants to unify the United States after years of political division between Democrats and Republicans.
