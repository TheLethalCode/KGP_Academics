 KABUL, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed six police and an Indian engineer on Thursday in southeastern Afghanistan, a top provincial official said. The bomber attacked a convoy carrying a group of Indian road engineers in a district of Nimroz province, Governor Ghulam Dastagir Azad told Reuters. "In this attack six Afghan police and an Indian engineer have been killed," he said. Eleven Afghan police and two Indian engineers were wounded in the incident, he said, adding the attack was the work of "terrorists", a term often used by Afghan officials to describe Taliban insurgents. Ousted from power in 2001, the Taliban have turned to suicide attacks against the Afghan government, aid workers and foreign troops led by NATO and the U.S. military. Hundreds of people, including many civilians, have been killed in such raids.
