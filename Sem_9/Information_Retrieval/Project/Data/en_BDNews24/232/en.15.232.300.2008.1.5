<TITLE> Merkel's CDU focuses on youth crime for elections </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WIESBADEN, Germany, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives unveiled new plans to combat youth crime on Saturday, including controversial measures that would make it easier to expel foreign offenders. Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) hope the proposals, which come in response to an incident in which a Turkish and a Greek youth savagely beat a German pensioner in Munich, will win over voters ahead of state elections later this month. But some of the proposals, which have been pushed by Hesse state premier Roland Koch in his bid to win a third term, have been condemned by immigrant groups and rival parties because they focus on foreigners. The strategy paper unveiled on Saturday at a party meeting in the western city of Wiesbaden urges a change in the law to allow for the expulsion of foreigners who receive one-year jail sentences, down from three years currently. It also includes proposals for boot camps and longer prison terms for offenders between the ages of 18 and 21. The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who govern in an uneasy "grand coalition" with Merkel in Berlin but are battling to oust her CDU from state governments in Hesse, Lower Saxony and Hamburg, say stricter laws are unnecessary. But their leader Kurt Beck signalled in German magazine Der Spiegel at the weekend that he was ready to talk with Merkel's party about youth crime. "That shows that the Social Democrats have finally recognised the importance of this issue," Merkel said in response to Beck's overture. "We can't afford to sweep this under the rug." The CDU has seized on the Munich pensioner beating, which was caught on surveillance cameras and broadcast widely on German television, as well as figures showing that 43 percent of violent crimes in Germany are committed by people under 21 years of age and nearly half of those by foreign youths. But data from the Federal Crime Office also shows that crimes by non-Germans have declined for nine straight years and that youth crime as a percentage of total crimes has been stable at around 12 percent since 1993. Koch has also been condemned for combining his proposals on youth crime with an appeal to traditional German values that opponents say risks fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment. The influential Hesse premier has threatened immigrants with "consequences" if they don't adapt to the German way of life and accused them of breaking German taboos by slaughtering animals in their kitchens and improperly disposing of their waste. Voters go to the polls in the CDU-run states of Hesse and Lower Saxony on Jan. 27 and in the city state of Hamburg, ruled by the CDU and the Free Democrats (FDP), on Feb. 24. The CDU strategy paper outlined plans for overhauling Germany's income tax rules from 2011 and said more details would be published in early 2009, the year when the next federal election will take place. The party also aimed to further reduce mandatory jobless benefit contributions and increase child benefit at the beginning of next year, according to the paper.
