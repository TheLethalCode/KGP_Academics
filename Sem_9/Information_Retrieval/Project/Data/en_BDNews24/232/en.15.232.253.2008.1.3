 NAIROBI, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mwai Kibaki called on Thursday for an end to post-election violence that has killed at least 300 people in Kenya and said he was ready for talks with the opposition once the nation had calmed down. "I am ready to have dialogue with the concerned parties once the nation is calm and the political temperatures are lowered enough for constructive and productive engagement," Kibaki told reporters on the lawn of his State House residence in Nairobi.
