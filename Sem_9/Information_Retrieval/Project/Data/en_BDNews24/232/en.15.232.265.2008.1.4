 PRISTINA, Serbia, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament sat on Friday for the first time since last November's election with the main parties still trying to form a coalition to lead the province to independence from Serbia. Kosovo Albanian leaders say the assembly will declare the U.N.-run territory's secession within the first months of 2008, counting on the major Western powers to overrule opposition from Serbia and Russia and recognise the new state. But it is still without a government, seven weeks after the Democratic Party of ex-guerrilla Hashim Thaci beat the once-dominant Democratic League of Kosovo into second place in Kosovo's third parliamentary election since the 1998-99 war. Rivals since the conflict, the two have agreed in principle to form a "grand coalition" with Thaci as prime minister, but they have yet to divide cabinet posts or name their ministers. Western diplomats back an alliance of the two as the best choice to steer Kosovo -- 90 percent populated by Albanians -- through what promises to be a turbulent transition to statehood. Thaci said he expected to form a government by next Wednesday. "Kosovo is on the right track," he told reporters. "It has international support and very soon we will move to fulfil our aspirations for statehood." The two parties together hold 62 seats in the 120-seat assembly, and differ little on the question of independence. ETHNIC PARTITION Thaci's party emerged from the 1998-99 Kosovo guerrilla army, which eclipsed a decade of passive resistance by the Democratic League under late independence leader Ibrahim Rugova. NATO bombed in 1999 to drive out Serb forces and halt their killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians during a two-year Serb war against the guerrillas, the culmination of a decade of repression under late strongman Slobodan Milosevic. Central to Serb history and identity, Kosovo has been run by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO since, but the West fears prolonging its limbo would trigger unrest in the Balkans. Almost two years of Serb-Albanian talks ended last month in failure and Serb ally Russia has blocked U.N. adoption of a plan granting Kosovo independence under European Union supervision. The United States and the major EU powers now say they will move ahead with the blueprint by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, without a new U.N. Security Council resolution. Serbia has told the 120,000 Serbs in the territory to reject any unilateral secession, cementing a de facto ethnic partition and raising fears of a breakaway by the Serb north. Most of the EU's 27 member states are expected to recognise Kosovo as the last state to emerge from the former Yugoslavia, and the bloc plans to take control of policing and justice. Diplomats say the Kosovo Albanians have agreed to hold off any declaration until after a presidential election in Serbia on Jan 20 and Feb 3, to avoid boosting the ultranationalist vote
