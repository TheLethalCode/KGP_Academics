<TITLE> Cruise close to deal, Globes unclear: sources </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Los Angeles, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A film company run by actor Tom Cruise was close to an agreement with the striking Writers Guild of America, while the Golden Globes awards show broadcast was in limbo, people close to the matter said on Sunday. The deal between United Artists -- run by Cruise and partner Paula Wagner, and owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- would be a first for a movie company during the 2-month strike, but would be similar to a pact reached between the guild and Worldwide Pants Inc., the television production company owned by David Letterman. The source said on condition of anonymity that the United Artists deal could be announced as soon as Monday. United Artists and WGA had no immediate comment. Writers went on strike in November, predominantly over the key issue of pay for work distributed on the Web. Letterman, Jay Leno and other late-night TV talk show hosts returned to the air last week, but only Letterman and CBS talk show host Craig Ferguson had writing teams intact because of interim deals reached with the WGA. In yet another twist, NBC on Sunday said Leno and Jimmy Kimmel, who hosts a late night show on Walt Disney Co's ABC, will appear on each other's show this week in what observers are saying is an effort to solve the problem of booking guests, reluctant to appear due to the strike. CLIFF-HANGER Meanwhile, the big cliff-hanger in town is the fate of the Golden Globes. Sources said the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which puts on the Golden Globes, was trying on Sunday to persuade General Electric Co's NBC to back off televising the awards gala next Sunday. The widely watched film and television honors gala is one of Hollywood's biggest ceremonies before the Oscars in February, but the Screen Actors Guild has said nearly all its members would refuse to cross striking writers' picket lines. The Hollywood Foreign Press on Friday said it hoped to announce a resolution on Monday that would permit the awards show to take place with the creative community present. A spokesman for the group was not available on Sunday, while NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said, "We have no announcement at this juncture." A person familiar with NBC said "a lot of scenarios were at play," which could include possibly postponing the event. Since talks between the studios and the guild broke down in December, the WGA has begun talking with various independent companies in the hope of reaching interim agreements. A second person familiar with the United Artist talks cautioned the deal faced significant opposition from other Hollywood studios. The agreement would benefit United Artists' distributor and majority shareholder MGM by supplying it with films once they were produced. The Los Angeles Times, however, said MGM had tried to discourage Cruise and Wagner from reaching such a deal
