<TITLE> Zuma trial unlikely before Aug: lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The corruption trial of Jacob Zuma, leader of South Africa's ruling ANC, was unlikely to take place any earlier than the already scheduled August starting date, his lawyer Michael Hulley said on Thursday. The National Prosecuting Authority said this week it was prepared to proceed with the case early if Zuma wished. "I don't think that there is any likelihood that it will be sooner than (August)," Hulley told 702 radio in an interview. Zuma, who won the African National Congress leadership in a election contest last month against the incumbent, President Thabo Mbeki, has been charged with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering. The trial is set to start on Aug. 4 and could overlap with national elections in 2009, adding to political uncertainty in Africa's biggest economy. Zuma's supporters say the charges are meant to smear his name, coming barely two weeks after his victory to take the helm of the ANC, and to scupper his chances of succeeding Mbeki as state president
