<TITLE> Japan PM sorry for blunders, but cabinet to stay </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda apologised on Friday for government blunders including mishandled public pension records, but brushed off speculation that he would reshuffle his cabinet this month to boost his sagging popularity. Fukuda also stressed the need to swiftly restart a naval mission in support of U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan, setting the stage for a clash with rival parties in parliament, but said he wanted to talk with the opposition to implement policies. Japanese media have reported that Fukuda, who took office in September after predecessor Shinzo Abe quit and kept most of Abe's ministers, was considering changing his cabinet lineup in mid-January. But Fukuda said the reports were wrong. "Taking various things into consideration, I'd like the current cabinet ministers to continue their work," he said, although he acknowledged many in his party favoured a reshuffle. Fukuda's support has fallen below 35 percent in recent voter polls from an initial high of 60 percent, battered by a string of headaches including a Defence Ministry procurement scandal and the botched public pension records. Fukuda, 71, apologised for the pension mess and offered a separate apology to patients who contracted hepatitis C through tainted blood products from around 1970 to the early 1990s. "Not only the bureaucracy but the politicians who supervise them also have a big responsibility, and as a politician I would like to apologise frankly," Fukuda said about the pensions. Fukuda, who took office in September when his predecessor suddenly quit, faces a tough struggle to enact legislation in parliament, where opposition parties control the upper house and can delay the enactment of laws. NAVAL CLASH The first clash of the new year could come next week, when the upper house is expected to vote down a government bill to allow Japan's navy to resume refuelling of U.S. and other ships patrolling the Indian Ocean for suspected terrorists. Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa says the mission violates Japan's pacifist constitution, but Washington argues that the naval operations, halted last year when enabling legislation expired, are vital to the global war on terrorism. Fukuda has vowed to enact the law before parliament's current session ends on Jan. 15. "By resuming the refuelling mission as soon as possible, I want to show that Japan is sweating together with other countries for the sake of the world," he said. The ruling bloc can use its two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house to override an upper house rejection, but the rarely used tactic risks sparking a public backlash. Japanese politics was thrown into turmoil last year when Ozawa discussed a coalition with Fukuda, then tendered his resignation when his party executives rejected the idea. Ozawa changed his mind and decided to stay in his top party post, vowing to topple the government in an election many think could come in the first half of the year. Asked if he still favoured a "grand coalition" between his Liberal Democratic Party and the Democrats, Fukuda played it coy. "First, I want to consider what system is desirable for implementing policies. For that, naturally we must have many opportunities for talks with the No. 1 opposition Democratic Party," he said.
