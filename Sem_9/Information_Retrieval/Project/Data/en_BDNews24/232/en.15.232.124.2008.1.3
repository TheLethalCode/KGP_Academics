<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Thursday called upon all to view the soaring prices of rice as a "catastrophe" and come up with plans to get over it. "If we think it is a catastrophe and work together, we can overcome the crisis," Moeen said as he received donation for the relief fund at the Officers' Mess at the Army Headquarters. "We are very much concerned about (the soaring prices of rice)," he said. "I have personally talked to the chief adviser about that." His comment came as the interim government was struggling to ensure adequate supply of rice, a staple for Bangladeshis, as the prices continued to soar over the past few days. Moeen blamed steep rises on the global market for the soaring rice price in the domestic market. He also said higher transportation costs, recent floods and the cyclone Sidr contributed to the crisis. Moeen also talked about India's decision to increase the prices of rice to $500 from $425 per tonne. He said the government was working to arrest the crisis through alternative arrangement such as open market sale, vulnerable group feeding and food for work programmes. Meanwhile, Thailand has promised to look into a government appeal to supply 1 lakh tonnes of rice in a week. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury made the appeal during a meeting with the Thai ambassador in his foreign ministry office Thursday. b
