 BEIJING, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China, host of six-party talks aimed at reining in North Korea's nuclear programme, on Thursday described North Korea's failure to meet a deadline to account for its nuclear activities as a natural delay. North Korea failed to meet a year-end deadline to make a full declaration of its nuclear programmes under a disarmament-for-aid deal involving the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, Russia and China. "The pace is faster in some areas and slower in some areas. This is natural," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news conference, urging all sides to fulfil their respective pledges. "We believe the comprehensive implementation of actions will open broader prospects for the six-party talks." The reclusive and impoverished North Korea has made progress towards disabling its Yongbyon nuclear complex. The disabling was not completed by Dec. 31, but that was mostly due to technical reasons. If North Korea meets its obligations, it will receive a huge injection of aid, mostly in the form of heavy fuel oil needed to run its ageing factories. Washington has also pledged to take it off its terrorism blacklist, which could allow North Korea to tap into international finance. Chief U.S. negotiator Christopher Hill is expected to tour Northeast Asia next week to push the deal forward which, in its next steps, will require North Korea to fully dismantle its nuclear complex
