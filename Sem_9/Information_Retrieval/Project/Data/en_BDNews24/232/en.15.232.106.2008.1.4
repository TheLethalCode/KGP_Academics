 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares briefly pared losses on Friday after a gauge of US service sector activity beat expectations for December, soothing some concern over the economic outlook after weak US jobs figures. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 53.9 in December from 54.1 in November but beat forecasts for a reading of 53.5. Banks were the top drag on the broader European market, followed by automakers which tumbled after Thursday's weak U.S. vehicle sales data for December. UBS fell 2.7 percent, Banco Santander dropped 2.1 percent and Barclays fell 3.2 percent. By 1505 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.3 percent at 1,465.65 points, versus 1,464.84 before the data and down from a session high of 1,492.57. The U.S. government earlier reported the slowest pace of job growth in over four years, sparking renewed concern about the resilience of an economy that has struggled in the past year with a housing slump, the global liquidity squeeze and record high oil prices. London's FTSE 100 index was down 1.2 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX was off 0.9 percent and Paris' CAC 40 was down 1.3 percent
