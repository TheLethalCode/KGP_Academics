 MINSK, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belarus has banned United Civil Party leader Anatoly Lebedko from travelling abroad, the veteran opposition figure told Reuters on Friday, calling it a political move after he met US President George Bush last year.

The case has not reached court. The United States and the EU barred Lukashenko from entry after his landslide victory in 2006, which was followed by unprecedented protest rallies. He later jailed opposition candidate Alexander Kozulin for his role in the protests. Late last year, the EU cautiously praised Minsk for releasing two jailed activists before the end of their terms and welcomed the restraint used by police during opposition rallies.
