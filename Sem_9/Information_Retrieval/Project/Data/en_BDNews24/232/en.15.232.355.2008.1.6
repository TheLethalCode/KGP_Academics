<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday quashed a writ petition that sought an order declaring the Fakhruddin administration an interim government instead of caretaker government. The High Court bench of justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Shahidul Islam heard the writ petition by barrister Masud Reza Sobhan. Sobhan said the government formed after the promulgation of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007 was no caretaker government. "As caretaker government is formed for a specific period of 90 days this government should be termed an interim government. So there will be no obligation of keeping the number of advisers to 10," Sobhan argued in court. In reply, the court said it is mentioned nowhere in the constitution that the highest tenure of the caretaker government is 90 days. "Rather it is said that an election must be held within 90 days of power transfer. If those responsible for arranging an election fail to do so they have to take the responsibility and suffer for it," the court said. As per the 'doctrine of necessity' the country cannot go without a government, the court said, adding, "Somebody has to run it." Citing article 58 of the constitution, Sobhan said it is not proper to call "this government" a caretaker government. In reply, the High Court bench said "this government" is a caretaker government as there is no specific tenure for the caretaker government. "Besides, there cannot be any constitutional vacuum in the country." After the hearing, the court rejected the writ appeal. bdnews24
