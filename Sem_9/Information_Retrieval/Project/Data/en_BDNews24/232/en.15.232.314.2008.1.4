<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Bikalpadhara Bangladesh Friday demanded the government start importing more rice and launch open-market sale (OMS) in unions to curb the steep prices. The party also demanded steps for better production in the next boro harvest to avoid any food crisis. MA Mannan, secretary general of the party, made the demand at a press briefing after a meeting of the party's executive committee in its Segun Bagicha office. "The crisis could have been overcome if the government took immediate steps for production of crops after cyclone Sidr hit. Still the rice price can be brought down. To be able to do that rice has to be imported from Myanmar and Thailand in a week." Replying to a question the former minister said, "It will not help if any adviser resigns taking responsibility for the rice crisis. The government will have to take lesson from the crisis and move ahead." He lauded the caretaker government for its efforts to check corruption and contain terrorism. "Corruption and terrorism have come down substantially in one year. The government deserves praise for that. However, they have failed to check the price of essentials." Party presidium member MA Halim, Dr Nurul Amin Bepari, Gias Udddin Chowdhury, Zainal Abedin, Saidur Rahman, Monzur Rashed and Saima Jalil were present at the press briefing. The meeting with Mannan in the chair reviewed the present situation in the country and discussed the next elections. bdnews2
