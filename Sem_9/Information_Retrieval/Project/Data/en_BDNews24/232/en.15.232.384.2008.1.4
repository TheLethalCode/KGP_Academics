 PARIS, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained ground in early trade on Friday, reversing a two-day drop as a rise in mining shares overshadowed weakness in auto stocks following tepid US car sales data. Investors remained cautious ahead of US monthly jobs data expected to confirm a slowdown in US economic growth and give clues on the outlook for interest rates. By 0925 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,490.43 points. Europe's benchmark index has lost 1.1 percent so far in 2008, after closing 2007 with a thin gain of 1.5 percent, its worst performance since 2002. Miners rose as commodity prices rallied, with Rio Tinto up 3.2 percent and Anglo American up 1.7 percent. Copper rose more than 1 percent in early London Metal Exchange business, lifted by falling stocks in China and expectations of buying to come, according to analysts. Prices were also bolstered by data released on Friday showing inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 6 percent in the week ended Thursday. The DJ Stoxx European basic resources index, up 2.2 percent on Friday, soared 28 percent in 2007, the best performer among European sectors, lifted by buoyant commodity prices and mergers and acquisitions activity. The auto sector moved into the opposite direction on Friday, with the DJ Stoxx European autos index down 2.2 percent. Major automakers reported lower U.S. sales for December led by a 9 percent slide at Ford Motor Co as the industry closed its weakest year in over a decade and faced the prospect of deeper declines in 2008. Full-year 2007 sales dropped almost 3 percent, the lowest since 1998, while sales for December were off almost 3 percent. Daimler dropped 2.6 percent, Renault shed 3 percent, BMW lost 1.7 percent and tyre maker Michelin fell 2.8 percent. Higher gasoline prices combined with a slump in the US housing market have fuelled worries that the US economy could slip into recession in 2008 and cause consumers to delay big-ticket purchases such as new vehicles. On the macro front, investors braced for US non-farm payrolls data, due at 1330 GMT, expected to show a modest gain of 70,000 jobs in December, after a gain of 94,000 in November. "Considering the market's reaction to the US manufacturing data on Wednesday where the Dow posted its worst start to the year since 1983, any figure that comes in worse than expected could delight the bears and send indices lower. We are expecting a figure of around 70,000 which is consistent with the jobless claims that have been coming out," Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, wrote in a note. Germany's DAX index was down 0.1 percent, hit by falling car makers, while the UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 added 0.3 percent. Shares of energy firms rose, benefiting from steady oil prices after they hurdled the $100 mark for the first time earlier this week. US crude oil futures were slightly down, at $99 a barrel. Total gained 1.4 percent, BP rose 1.2 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 0.6 percent. "Oil retreated from $100, but only mildly and you get the feeling that it will not take much to send the price hurtling to new highs if something bad happens or stockpiles continue to remain low," Campbell wrote. "Despite all the hype about $100, the fact remains that we are not going to see cheap oil prices for a long time and the consumer's spending power is already being affecte
