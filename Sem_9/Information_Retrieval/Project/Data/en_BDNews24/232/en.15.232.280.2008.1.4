 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)Police said Friday a suspected criminal died in a shooting incident involving RAB and the dead man's alleged accomplices in the city's Mohammadpur area. The officials said the dead man's name was Hannan, popularly known as Hanna. He was 28. Police and RAB officials claimed that 'Hanna' was an infamous criminal in the area, facing at least 20 charges including three for murder. RAB-2 officials arrested him on Dec 21, and he was on the custody of the security officials until his death Friday. Mohammadpur sub-inspector Alamgir Hossain said the firefight erupted after the RAB officials took Hannan late Thursday for a drive to recover illegal arms and arrest some of his accomplices. As soon as the team arrived near Mohammadpur Music College, Hannan's people allegedly opened fire at the officials in an effort to help him escape, Alamgir said. The suspect was shot as he tried to flee, taking advantage of the melee. Hannan's accomplices fled the scene leaving him behind, the SI said. The RAB team seized two revolvers, four bullets and a CNG-run three-wheeler from the scene, the official said. Later, a team of Mohammadpur police recovered the seriously wounded Hannan and rushed him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Doctors declared him dead on arrival. Hannan was the son of late Abu Taleb of Agargaon, his home village being Haturia in Gafargaon upazila, Mymensingh. Hannan's sister Momtaz said at DMCH that he was a father of two, a son and a daughter. bdnew
