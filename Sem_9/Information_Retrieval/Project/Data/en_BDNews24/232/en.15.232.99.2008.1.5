<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's physicians will file an appeal with the Chief Adviser's Office urging the authorities to send her abroad for better treatment. Hasina's ophthalmologist Modasser Ali told bdnews24.com: "We will go to the Chief Adviser's Office tomorrow (Sunday) morning. "If the chief adviser is unable to spare us some time, we will ask any responsible person in his office to accept our appeal." Ali said he saw Hasina four days back. "Her blood pressure is fluctuating and she is suffering from kidney problems. She has also gynecological and eye problems." The hearing aid planted in her ear is not working either, Ali said. The August 21, 2004 grenade attacks on an Awami League rally on Bangabandhu Avenue left Hasina with hearing impairment. Prof Ali said ENT specialist Prof Pran Gopal Dutta, gynecologist Prof Shahla Khatun and medicine expert Prof ABM Abdullah will accompany him to the Chief Adviser's Office. bdnews
