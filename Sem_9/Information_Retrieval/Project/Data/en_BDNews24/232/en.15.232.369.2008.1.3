 LONDON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil held near its lifetime high of $100 a barrel on Thursday, fuelled by expectations of another fall in US fuel stocks and a struggling dollar. Its rise to triple digits may help push top consumer the United States -- battered by a housing crisis and credit crunch -- into recession. European Union economies could also suffer if the spike is prolonged, said the European Commission. But after rising 57 percent in 2007, oil and other commodities may push higher still, analysts said. Gold and platinum also drew strength from dollar weakness to hit fresh record highs on Thursday.

On Wednesday, the dollar traded around 1.4750 to the euro, little stronger than its low of 1.4966 to the euro in November, according to Reuters data. Despite oil rocketing to $100, the White House said it will not open up the nation's emergency crude reserves to ease prices. Nor will the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), adviser to 27 consumer nations. "We are not going to carry out (an emergency) oil stock release," William Ramsay, the IEA's deputy head told Reuters. "We don't respond to prices, and we don't see any disruption in the physical oil market." Officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the group could do little to halt the ral
