 LONDON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Snow and bitter winds will sweep across much of Britain on Thursday in a winter blast that could cause havoc on the roads, the Met Office said. It issued severe weather warnings for nearly all the country, with plunging temperatures and up to 10 cm of snow in Scotland and northeast England. London and the southeast may see some light flurries, turning to sleet and rain, while some areas will get no snow. Temperatures will range between 0 and 3 degrees Celsius (32 to 37 Fahrenheit), but a harsh easterly wind will make it feel even colder. The Highways Agency urged drivers to check the forecast and road conditions before they set out and delay their journey if the weather is too severe. It advised motorists to carry warm clothes and an emergency pack in the car, including food and water, boots, de-icer, a torch and a spade.

Temperatures should be up to double figures by the weeke
