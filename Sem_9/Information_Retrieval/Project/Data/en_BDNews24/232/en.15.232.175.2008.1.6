 LONDON, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Islamic extremism has turned some areas of Britain into hostile `no-go areas' for non-Muslims, a Church of England bishop said on Sunday. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Bishop of Rochester, the Right Reverend Dr Michael Nazir-Ali said non-Muslims find it hard to live or work in these separate communities. Muslim leaders and politicians dismissed the bishop's comments as scaremongering and said there was no evidence to support his views.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has spoken of the need to integrate communities better and isolate extremists from the moderate majority of Muslims. A spokesman for his Downing Street office had no comment on the bishop's remarks. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said Nazir-Ali was "talking nonsense" and had no evidence to support his views. "This is irresponsible scaremongering," an MCB spokesman said. "Where are these so-called areas that he's talking about?" Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the idea of no-go areas was "a gross caricature of reality", while Conservative Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague told Sky News the bishop had "probably put it too strongl
