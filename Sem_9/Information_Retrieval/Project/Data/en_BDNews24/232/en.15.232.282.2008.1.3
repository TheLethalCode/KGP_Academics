 ISMAILIA, Egypt, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Egyptian bedouin man was found shot dead outside his home near an Israeli-controlled border junction between Egypt, Israel and the Gaza Strip on Thursday, residents of the area and security sources said. "We have a person killed in the border area. ... Investigations are ongoing into the reasons for the killing," one of the security sources said. The sources said Humaidan Suweilam, 40, was found shot by multiple bullets in the yard of his house near the Kerem Shalom border terminal. Security sources declined to comment on the source of the gunfire. One resident of the area, Imad Suleiman, reported heavy gunfire coming from the border area in the morning. Another resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several homes had been struck. Egyptian security sources could not immediately confirm that.
