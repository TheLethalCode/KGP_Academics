 JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Sunday that Israeli troops would escalate attacks on Gaza militants in response to continued cross-border rocket fire, raising tensions before US President George W. Bush's visit. Hours before Olmert spoke to his cabinet in Jerusalem, an Israeli ground force pushed into the central Gaza Strip and shot dead a Palestinian whom medical officials identified as an 18-year-old civilian. Two militants were also wounded. An Israeli army spokeswoman confirmed that a force has been operating in the area since dawn, but had no information about any casualties. Israel has stepped up attacks against militants in Gaza in a bid to curb cross-border rocket fire from the territory. One of the rockets landed last week in the northern part of the major Israeli city of Ashkelon. The army said it was the furthest a rocket from Gaza had travelled into Israel. Olmert told his cabinet the rocket that landed in Ashkelon marked an "escalation" in Palestinian attacks. In response, he said Defence Minister Ehud Barak had ordered security forces "to escalate Israel's actions" against militants in the coastal territory. Bush will visit Israel and the occupied West Bank later this week, seeking to spur renewed peace talks between Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Olmert said Israeli military operations had already yielded "very significant results" against militant targets in Gaza, which Hamas Islamists seized by force in June after routing Abbas's secular Fatah forces. Despite protests from Abbas's government, Olmert said Israel will continue to operate against militants in the occupied West Bank, where Fatah holds sway. "We will continue to react and to initiate actions by our forces in order to hit terror elements and to reach those who are responsible in every corner of Gaza and also in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank)," Olmert add
