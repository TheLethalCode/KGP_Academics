<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks slumped to a two-week low on Monday, extending a weak start to 2008, while the dollar hovered near multi-week lows after weak US jobs data heightened fears of recession in the region's top export market. Bond prices rallied on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month to try to revive growth, while oil prices -- which hit a record above $100 barrel just last week -- fell as investors feared demand would suffer from a US-led slowdown in global economic growth. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan lost 2.2 percent by 0309 GMT. Earlier, the index hit its lowest since Dec. 21. The index has dropped more than 3 percent this year, weighed down by concerns about the world's top economy. "The sluggish jobs data is reinforcing concerns that the subprime mortgage crisis is pushing the US economy towards a recession," said Kim Young-gak, an analyst at Hyundai Securities. "Now it looks like the US Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point this month." Tokyo shares dropped 1 percent after slumping 4 percent on Friday, their first trading day of the year. Taiwan stocks slumped 3 percent, while other markets such as Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore were down more than 2 percent each. Exporters were hit hard, particularly chip makers following downgrades of the sector by a couple of US brokerages last week. Microchip equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 3 percent, while chip maker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, of South Korea, was down 3.3 percent. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's biggest contract chip maker, dropped 6.3 percent The US non-farm payrolls figures showed US job growth skidded to a near-halt in December and unemployment rose to a two-year high. The dollar weakened on Friday, undermining the earnings prospects for Asia's exporters. The currency steadied in Asia on Monday, having hit a six-week low of 107.90 on Friday and it stayed near a five-week low against the euro. Commodity-related shares, such as BHP Billiton, which had benefitted last year from soaring prices in metals and oil, also fell on concerns about a slowdown in global demand growth. U.S. crude futures retreated 59 cents to $97.32 a barrel, while London Brent crude eased to $96.24 "Concerns about the US economy are clearly putting some pressure on oil prices. Some market players are also using this opportunity to take profits," said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst from the National Bank of Australia. SAFE HAVEN With fears of a US recession growing, investors continued a trend this year of switching to so-called safe-haven assets, such as government bonds. Japanese government March bond futures hit a one-month high on Monday. US short-term interest rate futures jumped on Friday, pricing in as much as a 70 percent chance that the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points when it meets to review policy on Jan 29-30. The Fed has lowered its benchmark lending rate by 100 basis points since September to 4.25 percent. Spot gold edged down to $857.10/$857.90 as energy prices fell, but stayed within reach of a record high of $869.05 traded last week, as a weak dollar makes the precious metal cheaper in other currencies
