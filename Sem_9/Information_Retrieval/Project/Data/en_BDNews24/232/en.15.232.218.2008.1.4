<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Rajshahi Friday had the upper hand against Dhaka on the first day of the final round four-dayer in the National Cricket League while table-topper Khulna and Chittagong tottered against Barisal and Sylhet. A defiant 115-run partnership for the unbroken eighth wicket between Nayeem Islam and Mohammad Shahazada took Rajshahi, who are just one point shy of Khulna, to 264 for seven at stumps in the first innings against holders Dhaka at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. National discard pacer Talha Jubair snared five wickets as Khulna folded at 193 in the first innings against Barisal at Birshreshtho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. A scintillating 130-run from Imtiaz Hossain propelled Sylhet to a comfortable 348 for eight at stumps against Chittagong at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Rajshahi vs Dhaka After deciding to bat first, Rajshahi fell into trouble to reel at 44 for four with Dhaka's pacer duo Mohammad Sharif and Mahbubul Alam Robin (2/55) rattling Barisal's top order. Skipper Khaled Mashud, batting at number five, and Anisur Rahman (20) provided some resistance before Rajshahi slipped to 79 for six in the face of a fierce spell of Sharif, who finally returned four for 53. Mashud was the seventh batsman out for a patient 52 off 142 balls, leaving the side at 149 for seven. Afterwards, Nayeem and Shahazada stopped further damage to keep the Dhaka bowlers at bay with an unbeaten 115-run eighth wicket partnership. Nayeem struck 82 off 188 balls with the help of 11 boundaries while Shahazada scored a 102-ball 57 studded with seven boundaries. Khulna vs Barisal Depleted Khulna continued their miserable batting display to be folded within 200 against Barisal, who deprived the hosts of getting any bonus point from batting in the title-deciding round. Talha wiped out the Khulna innings with five for 44. Skipper Nahidul Haq contributed 58 followed by Ziaur Rahman and Farid Ahmed on identical 38, but it was not enough for the home side to finish the day on high. Barisal, in reply, lost three wickets to make 62 with Nasiruddin Faruque (35) and Tariqul Islam (0) remaining unbeaten. Sylhet vs Chittagong Asked to bat first, openers Imtiaz and Golam Rahman (36) gave Sylhet a solid 99-run start before the latter was trapped by Mohammad Younus, who also removed Imtiaz, but by then it was too late to stop Sylhet. Middle orders Alok Kapali (30), Golam Mabud (36), Ejaj Ahmed (37) took their side beyond the 300-mark after Imtiaz struck 130 runs off 144 balls hitting 17 boundaries. Sadiqur Rahman along with Nabil Samad remained uneaten on 28 and 0 at the close of Day 1. Younus was the most successful Chittagong bowler with four for 81.
