 LONDON, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Sunday brushed off opinion polls showing the opposition conservatives ahead and said he was focused on the long term. Brown said 2008 would be critical for the economy and was a year of big decisions on energy, infrastructure, transport and housing. "You've got ups and downs, you've got things that go right or wrong, events come and go," he said on the BBC's Andrew Marr show. "The question is are you making the right long-term decisions for the country." Brown, a former finance minister, enjoyed a brief honeymoon after taking over from Labour Party colleague Tony Blair in June but his poll ratings fell in late 2007.

Analysts say the economy was key to Brown's poll ratings. "The question is just how bad that downturn will be and what the consequences will be for the housing market and employment," said Warwick University politics professor Wyn Grant. Brown said past decisions by the government had ensured a solid economic framework and he promised to make the right choices, even if they were unpopular. "These are choices about secure energy, about building new houses for people, choices about building our infrastructure, about getting our education and health systems right, about making our economy secure when faced with global financial turbulence," Brown said. He is expected this week to authorise a new generation of nuclear power stations, despite opposition from environmentalists and some Labour lawmakers and supporte
