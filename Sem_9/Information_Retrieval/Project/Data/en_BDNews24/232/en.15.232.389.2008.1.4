<TITLE> GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar, stocks hit by weak U.S. jobs report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar and stocks fell and government bond prices rose sharply on Friday on news U.S. jobs growth hit a four-year low last month, intensifying expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further. The U.S. non-farm payrolls data, a crucial measure of the health of the world's biggest economy, showed just 18,000 jobs were created in December. That was well below the 70,000 consensus forecast and the weakest since the August 2003 reading which showed a net loss of 42,000 jobs. The data also showed the national unemployment rate kicked up to five percent, its highest in more than two years. The news hit European equities and set Wall Street heading for early losses while the prospects of lower interest rates weakened the dollar and boosted U.S. Treasury bonds. The weak payrolls number intensified expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow through on the three rate cuts it has already made since September after defaults on U.S. mortgage debt provoked a global credit crisis that threatens to undermine consumer spending. Major central banks, however, will have to balance risks to economic growth against surging food and energy prices that are pushing up inflation rates and risk driving up wages and prices for services and manufactured goods. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.44 percent, reversing earlier gains. The euro rose to $1.4815 as investors sold dollars. The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield dropped 7 basis points to 3.8237 percent as demand for bonds rose. Three key U.S. indicators this week have come in below the weakest of scores of economists' forecasts gathered by Reuters -- a key manufacturing gauge on Thursday and both payrolls growth and the jobless rate. Investors were already convinced the Fed, seeing mounting risks to economic growth, will cut its benchmark rate further from 4.25 percent, removing or eroding the dollar's yield advantage over currencies such as the euro, yen and Swiss franc. COMMODITIES FUEL INFLATION WORRIES Euro zone data on Friday showed inflation running at 3.1 percent in December, well above the European Central Bank's 2 percent ceiling, and the ECB is widely expected to keep its benchmark on hold at 4 percent for now. The surge in global inflationary pressures has sent investment funds in search of hedging instruments. While gold, which jumped more than 30 percent in 2007, eased from Thursday's record highs of $869.05, platinum hit a record high of $1,553 an ounce earlier on Friday. Oil eased below $99 a barrel as traders took profits from a record rally that propelled crude prices to over $100 a barrel. MSCI's main world stocks index was down nearly 0.4 percent at 398.36 at 1355 GMT while its emerging markets gauge shed some earlier gains to 1235.09, up about 0.6 percent on the day. Most Asian stock markets were buoyed earlier on Friday by resource firms' gains as commodities such as oil and gold held near record highs, but Tokyo's main share index was dragged down after a week-long holiday by worries including a firming yen currency, which makes Japanese exports more expensive
