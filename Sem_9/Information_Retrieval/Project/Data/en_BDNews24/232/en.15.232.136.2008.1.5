 Baghdad, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Two US soldiers were killed and three others wounded along with a civilian interpreter on Dec. 26 when an Iraqi soldier opened fire on them during a joint patrol, the US military said on Saturday. "The incident occurred as U.S. and Iraqi army soldiers were conducting operations to establish a combat outpost," U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel James Hutton said, adding that two Iraqi soldiers had been taken into custody. The spokesman's comments confirmed earlier reports of the incident by two Iraqi Army generals.
