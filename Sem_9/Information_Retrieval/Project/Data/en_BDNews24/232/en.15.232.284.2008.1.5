<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India spinner Harbhajan Singh has been granted an extra day to prepare his defence to a charge of racially abusing Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds during the second test in Sydney. The International Cricket Council (ICC) said the hearing had been postponed until after the close of play on Sunday following a request from the Indian team management. "At the request of the India team manager and under the circumstances I have exercised my discretionary powers to postpone the code of conduct hearing until the conclusion of this test match," ICC match referee Mike Proctor said in a statement. "I am satisfied that with a further 24 hours India will have time to sufficiently prepare for this hearing." If found guilty, Harbhajan faces a ban of between two and four test matches or between four and eight one-day internationals. Harbhajan was charged by the match umpires Mark Benson and Steve Bucknor after play ended on Friday following a complaint from Australia captain Ricky Ponting. Harbhajan and Symonds exchanged words shortly after the Indian had reached his half century. Play was delayed for several minutes while the umpires spoke to Harbhajan on the pitch. Harbhajan has denied racially abused Symonds and the Board of Control for Cricket in India has reportedly called on its lawyers to defend him. "I did not say anything racist. I do not know what is going on," Harbhajan told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. "I haven't done anything, we were just talking. It wasn't even sledging, it was just normal talk out on the cricket field. I was concentrating on my batting." Symonds, the only black player in the Australian team, was subjected to racial abuse during his team's tour of India in October when spectators began taunting him with monkey chants
