<TITLE> PSC members were responsible for question leaks: chairman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Public Service Commission chairman Saadat Hossain Sunday said some PSC members had been involved in BCS question leaks in the last 14 years, depriving "brilliant candidates" of government jobs. In an interview with bdnews24.com, the PSC chairman said the situation was "very different" now. "Questions are no longer leaked. A number of changes were made to the process of preparing questions, holding exams and checking answer sheets. "Some commission members were involved in the leaks of questions for exams related to government jobs including BCS. The questions were leaked out because of their complicity, but the commission as a whole was not responsible," he said. Hossain was more specific and said some of those who came to the commission after 1993 had been involved in the question leaks. For the last one and a half decade, it was commonplace that allegations were raised shortly after any examination for government jobs was held. Soon after the Fakhruddin administration took over, demands were made to overhaul the PSC. Hossain was appointed to the PSC as chairman on May 9 after former chairman Zinnatunnesa Tahmida Begum retired. Besides, eight new members were appointed. About current commission members, Hossain said: "Eight people who earned fame in respective fields were appointed members of the commission. They are very different from the previous members in terms of quality. We did not have any relation with each other earlier." "The commission has so far arranged up to 20 exams but no questions were leaked. Nor will it happen in future." Hossain said the members eased the process of applying for jobs under the PSC. Appointments on political grounds made the PSC controversial, Hossain said. "University teachers had come here as members. They were divided into groups like White, Blue and Pink. Many teachers belonging to the ruling party had come here as members. They were somehow answerable to university vice chancellors," he said. "They had been on good terms with teachers, ruling party leaders and even with students. Staying neutral for a PSC member was difficult at the time." Describing PSC's steps to stop question leaks, Hossain said applications were now verified in four stages. bdnews24.c
