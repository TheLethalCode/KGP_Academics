 Chittagong, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com) A Chittagong court Sunday started trial of an embezzlement case involving private television station 'Bijoy' and set Jan 9 for indictment hearing. The trial started after judge SM Solaiman of Chittagong Divisional Special Judge's Court received a gazette notification against fugitive accused Mokhter Alam, chief engineer of Chittagong City Corporation. The two other accused CCC mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and suspended chief executive officer Imtiaz Hossain Chowdhury were present in the court. The court also upheld the order that asked government officials AKM Rafiqul Islam, deputy controller of Bangladesh Government Press, Dhaka office, and Akhter Hossain, deputy controller of Bangladesh Forms and Publication Office, Dhaka to be present in the court on Jan 9 to explain why the publication of gazette notification was delayed. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Abu Mohammad Aref Siddique filed the case with Kotwali police against the three for allegedly siphoning off Tk 80 lakh from the city corporation's funds to run the private TV station. bdnews24.
