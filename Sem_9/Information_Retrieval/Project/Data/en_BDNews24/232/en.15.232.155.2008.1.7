 Caracas, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Sunday said he would keep Rafael Ramirez as the OPEC nation's energy and petroleum minister amid a major cabinet shuffle following a December electoral defeat. The leftist leader rotated 13 cabinet posts after losing a referendum that would have let him run indefinitely for re-election but on Sunday he said he was leaving Ramirez -- a close Chavez confidant -- in his post. "Rafael Ramirez is ratified as minister of energy and petroleum," Chavez said. Ramirez, who has held the job since 2002, oversaw last year's takeover of four multi-billion-dollar oil projects previously run by foreign companies. He has also served as president of state oil company PDVSA since 2004, helping turn the company into the principal financier of Chavez's self-described socialist revolution. Chavez did not mention any change to his post at PDVSA
