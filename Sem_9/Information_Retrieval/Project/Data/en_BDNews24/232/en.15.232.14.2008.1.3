 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission seeks jurisdiction to hold elections to all local government bodies on its own and regulate the rules about the polls, an election commissioner said Thursday. A proposal in this regard will soon be sent by the Election Commission to the local government ministry, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters in his office. "We are going to seek the jurisdiction to hold elections to all local government bodies on our own initiative," Sakhawat said. The proposal includes the recommendation that the EC be granted the powers to draw up the rules and regulations for such elections, he added. "However, some regulations will be solely applicable to the parliamentary elections." Sakhawat said the commission was also going to recommend the mandatory provision of eight pieces of information for all local election contestants. The Supreme Court in a recent verdict made it mandatory for parliamentary elections candidates to disclose the eight pieces of informationincluding income, expenditure and educational qualification. The commissioner also said the EC had recommended disqualifications of "convicted war criminals" to the elections. Asked what penalties have been recommended for local election candidates who violate the code of conduct and give false information, Sakhawat said: "The provision of punishment has been kept in the proposal." He added the penalties would be similar to those for national election candidates who are found guilty of misconduct, including monetary fines and cancellation of candidacy. bdnew
