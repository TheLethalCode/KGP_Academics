 TBILISI, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's opposition were taking to the streets on Sunday to protest over a presidential election they said was rigged to hand victory to Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili. As police with water cannon were deployed in the capital in preparation for the protests, the United States, a key Georgian ally, urged the opposition to show restraint. Saakashvili called the election early to try to rebuild democratic credentials that were left in tatters after he ordered riot police to fire tear gas and rubber bullets at opposition supporters protesting against his rule in November. He swept to power in his ex-Soviet state in a 2003 "Rose Revolution" but his critics say his reforms -- lauded by the West -- have ignored the poor and they accuse him of being an autocrat who pays only lip service to democratic freedoms. Georgia lies at the heart of the South Caucasus, which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe and where Russia and the United States are battling for influence. Washington's top emissary to the region, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza, said the opposition should respect a report from Western election observers, which is expected at around 3 p.m. (1100 GMT). "If the experts determine that the election was not rigged then there is absolutely no justification, and it would be absolutely undemocratic, to claim otherwise," Bryza told Reuters in a telephone interview from Washington. "How unfortunate that would be for Georgian democracy." Official results, with votes from 7 percent of polling stations counted, showed Saakashvili won 57.6 percent of the vote and his main rival 22.6 percent. An exit poll showed Saakashvili with more than half the overall vote. "According to the exit polls and all the data, we have won, although as a democratic party we should wait for the central election commission's final results," Saakashvili said. His supporters spilled on to the streets overnight, honking car horns and waving the national flag. "LYING" Saakashvili's opponents, who have accused the 40-year-old U.S.-educated lawyer of autocratic rule, economic mismanagement and corruption, said the election had been rigged. "Saakashvili is lying," Levan Gachechiladze, leader of a nine-party opposition coalition, told reporters. "The exit polls have been falsified." Sunday's planned protest echoed the opposition rallies in November. They attracted about 100,000 protesters at their peak and lasted for five days until police broke them up with teargas and rubber bullets. A Reuters witness saw water cannon and several buses full of policemen being driven into the city. Saturday's election was both the first big test of voters' faith in the "Rose Revolution," and the first genuinely competitive election since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Georgia's previous elections were heavily one-sided or rigged. Gachechiladze's campaign officials said they had recorded cases of people being allowed to vote more than once, and voters and opposition observers being intimidated. Saakashvili's camp said there had been isolated violations but denied there was widespread fraud, saying the opposition was crying foul to divert attention from its defeat. Saakashvili has pushed through liberal economic reforms and steered Georgia toward NATO membership, policies with which his opponents broadly agree. His reforms have attracted foreign investment and generated economic growth of 9-12 percent a year. US President George W Bush once hailed Georgia as a "beacon of democrac
