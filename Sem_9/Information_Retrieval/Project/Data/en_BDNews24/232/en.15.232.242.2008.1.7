<TEXT>
 Manchester, New Hampshire, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Republican presidential rivals Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney picked up on Sunday where they left off the night before -- bickering bitterly in a bid for votes in a tight New Hampshire primary race. With Romney fighting for his political life in Tuesday's primary, the former Massachusetts governor went on the attack against Huckabee and Arizona Sen. John McCain on their tax records during a debate. New Hampshire's primary is the next battleground in the state-by-state process of choosing Republican and Democratic candidates for November's election to replace President George W Bush. Romney and Huckabee, sitting shoulder to shoulder on a Fox News set with three other Republican candidates, clashed after Romney accused Huckabee of raising the tax burden on Arkansas residents when he was governor. "Mike, you agreed that net-net, you raised taxes by half a billion dollars. Is that right?" Romney asked Huckabee. When Huckabee avoided the question, saying he turned a budget deficit into a surplus, improved education in his state and built roads, Romney asked him the same question two more times and accused him of "political speak." "Mike you make up facts faster than you talk, and that says something," Romney said. Huckabee said he was forced to raise taxes by a court order to improve education. "Maybe you don't have to obey the courts in Massachusetts," Huckabee shot back. He raised the issue of Romney's series of television ads criticizing his record in Arkansas. PERSONAL ATTACK "You spent tens of millions of dollars sayings all negative things about me. If someone raises a question, you say it's a personal attack," Huckabee said to Romney. The exchange occurred one night after Huckabee, McCain and other Republican contenders ganged up on Romney in a debate in New Hampshire. Huckabee beat Romney in the first contest in Iowa last week, and Romney trails McCain in many polls in New Hampshire in a contest that could amount to a last chance to revive his candidacy. The debate on Sunday did not have an audience in the studio and was a much more low-key affair than the bare-knuckle brawl the Republicans held on Saturday night, when former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson joined in the attacks on Romney. McCain reined in the personal attacks on Romney from the previous night's debate, and said he was trying to move forward with his campaign. Romney, who once led polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire, also criticized McCain for voting against Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. "I believe the Bush tax cuts helped our economy grow and are one of the reasons that we're not in a recession today," Romney said. McCain said he supported tax cuts but he was trying to hold down budget deficits. He said he had battled against excessive federal spending and to hold down the spending on special local projects that members of Congress send home to their districts. "I think it was the reason why I wasn't elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. I have a record of saving billions for the American taxpayers," he said
