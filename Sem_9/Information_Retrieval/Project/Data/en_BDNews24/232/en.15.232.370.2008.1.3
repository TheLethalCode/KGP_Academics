 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Demonstrating garment workers in the city's Sheorapara have agreed to withdraw their two-day protests following an agreement with factory owners Thursday. "Misunderstanding on a worker's death has led to this problem," Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told a joint news briefing. The agreement was reached at a meeting running for more than five hours. "Workers understood that their colleague Salma (Akter) died in her house, not in the factory due to her illness," Chowdhury said. "The factory owner will immediately compensate her family with Tk 1 lakh," he told journalists. On the other demands, the BGMEA president said a committee comprising factory management, workers, BGMEA and the intelligence and detective agencies of the government will look into the issues and submit a report by three months. The demands include cancellation of overnight shift and the reinstatement to jobs of 28 workers who the workers say were fired illegally. "We were disappointed to know that Salma had not been granted leave despite her being serious ill. Now we understand some employees, not the management, were responsible for that," a worker of the SQ Sweaters said at the briefing. "But we want our suspended colleagues reinstated," he added. Salma fell sick Sunday night and wanted to go home but the factory management did not allow her, said co-workers, forcing her to work through that night. She died after returning home Monday morning. The protest begun Wednesday morning as workers blocked Rokeya Sarani throughout the day, clogging the busy thoroughfare because of the closure of SQ Sweaters Ltd. BGMEA officials and police Wednesday failed to manage the protesters as the death of Salma fuelled their anger. After a nine-hour shutdown of Rokeya Sarani, that runs through Sheorapara, the protesters withdrew their blockade Wednesday evening but restarted their agitation early Thursday amid tight vigilance by security officials. BGMEA officials sat with the factory management and workers in presence of the intelligence agencies Thursday noon to resolve the crisis. Witnesses said workers of about 50 other garment factories in Sheorapara and neighbouring areas skipped work to express their solidarity with workers of SQ Sweaters. bd
