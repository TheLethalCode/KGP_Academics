 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar, government bonds and European stocks all firmed a touch on Friday as investors braced for US non-farm payrolls data, a crucial measure of the health of the world's biggest economy. The dollar edged up from the previous day's one-month lows versus a basket of major currencies after an independent US jobs report on Thursday supported forecasts for the official numbers, due at 1330 GMT, to show a modest increase. But investors are still convinced the US Federal Reserve, seeing mounting risks to economic growth, will cut its benchmark rate further from 4.25 percent, and euro zone government bonds extended gains from the previous session. Having sold the dollar in all but one trading session of the past two weeks, investors took the opportunity to square their books ahead of payrolls, and by 0816 GMT, the dollar index was up 0.25 percent at 76.059, recovering from Thursday's one-month low of 75.708. "The dollar's come back a little bit but we are in the confines of range trading realistically until we get to (the jobs data)," said Jeremy Stretch, strategist at Rabobank. The payrolls report is forecast to show the US economy added 70,000 jobs in December, and a weaker number would intensify expectations of further Fed rate cuts to counter a housing market decline and a credit market crunch that threaten to undermine consumer spending. However, major central banks have to balance these risks to economic growth against a surge in commodity prices, including food as well as energy, that are pushing up inflation rates. European markets will also be keeping a close watch on euro zone inflation data for December at 10OO GMT, forecast to come in at 3.1 percent, well above the European Central Bank's 2 percent ceiling. The euro lost around a third of a percent to $1.4704 ahead of the inflation data, while euro zone government bond futures marked a session high of 114.57 after weaker German data led some investors to speculate the euro zone figure could be softer than forecast. RECORD HIGHS FOR COMMODITIES European stocks reversed a two-session drop as a rise in mining shares, rallying along with commodity prices, eclipsed weakness in auto stocks following tepid US car sales data. By 0925 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,490.43 points. Europe's benchmark index has lost 1.1 percent so far in 2008, after closing 2007 with a thin gain of 1.5 percent, its worst performance since 2002. Most Asian stock markets were also buoyed by resource firms' gains as commodities such as oil and gold held near record highs, but Tokyo's main share index was dragged down by worries including a firming yen currency as it played catch-up after a week-long holiday. Gold, which jumped more than 30 percent in 2007, held near Thursday's record highs of $869.05 in Asia and platinum hit a record high of $1,553 an ounce on Friday as investment funds sought a hedge against concerns that fast-rising oil and food prices will fire up global inflation. Oil held steady, hovering at about $99 a barrel, after falling the day before as traders took profits from a record rally that propelled crude prices to over $100 a barr
