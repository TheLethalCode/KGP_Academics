<TITLE> DU students stage sit-in to protest 'injustice' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  About 40 students Saturday staged a sit-in in front of the office of the Dhaka University vice chancellor to demand immediate release of detained teachers and students. The students peacefully stayed there for about 20 minutes under the banner of "general students". Their protest was against what they said was injustice. Some students charged that the teachers and several students were put on trial but the army personnel, who allegedly triggered the violent campus protest in August, remained untouched. The protesters said they would announce tougher programmes with the help of students and teachers and other DU employees unless the detainees are released by Jan 8 when the university reopens after the winter vacation. bdnew
