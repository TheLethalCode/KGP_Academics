 Tbilisi, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Soviet Georgia on Saturday voted in a presidential election expected to hand its pro-US leader Mikhail Saakashvili a narrow win but opponents said they may take to the streets in protest. US-educated Saakashvili swept to power in a peaceful 2003 revolution but he shocked his Western allies in November by crushing anti-government protests and they now want Georgia to prove its commitment to democracy. "This election is a watershed election that will make a determination as to their commitment," said U.S. Congressman Alcee L. Hastings, head of the main Western observation mission. Georgia lies at the heart of the South Caucasus - a strategic transit route which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe where Russia and the United States are battling for influence. Since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, Georgia's elections have been heavily one-sided or called fraudulent and Saturday's poll is considered the first genuinely competitive vote. Polls indicate Saakashvili, 40, is likely to win the seven-candidate race but it is unclear if he will gain the 50 percent needed to avoid a second round run-off. Flanked by his Dutch wife and two young sons a beaming Saakashvili voted mid-morning in central Tbilisi. "Georgia is a great success story for this region," he said afterwards. "Now it's up to the people of Georgia to decide whether this success will continue as it was going." Saakashvili's main rival is Levan Gachechiladze, a 43-year-old wine producer, who heads a nine-party opposition coalition which accuses Saakashvili of economic mismanagement, corruption and ruling in an autocratic manner. PROTESTS Across Georgia - birthplace of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin - people braved a heavy snowfall to travel to polling stations. "It's excellent we have real competition," Rusudan Tsutsnashvili, a 54-year-old English language teacher said as she queued in Tbilisi to vote. Inside officials dabbed indelible ink on voters' thumbs and monitors took notes. Saakashvili ordered the snap election in November after telling police to fire teargas and rubber bullets at anti-government protesters, closing the main opposition broadcaster and imposing a state of emergency. The early election was designed to repair his democratic image but the opposition accused him of rigging the vote and said they may organise mass protests. "A lot of bad things are happening at polling stations," Tina Khidasheli, a leader of the opposition coalition, said. "Some polling stations were open later than 8 a.m and in several polling stations the ballot boxes were opened and votes inspected." Saturday's snowfall is unusually heavy in Georgia, a mountainous country the size of Ireland with a population of around 4.5 million with many people living in rundown villages. Saakashsvili's supporters dismiss the vote-rigging accusations as lies by an opposition which knows it cannot win. In the last few years Saakashvili has pushed through liberal economic reforms and steered Georgia toward NATO membership, policies which his opponents broadly agree with. His reforms have attracted foreign investment, economic growth of between 9 and 12 percent a year, and U.S. President George W. Bush once hailed Georgia a "beacon of democracy". But inflation has eaten into incomes, utility bills have soared and unemployment is high
