<TITLE> France's Royal eyes leadership of Socialist party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defeated French presidential candidate Segolene Royal said on Thursday she might try to become the Socialists' next leader this year, raising the possibility of a new presidential bid in 2012. Since Royal lost to conservative Nicolas Sarkozy in May's election, the Socialists have been deeply divided over their future direction, their leadership and lessons to draw from the double defeat in presidential and legislative polls. Royal, a regional leader who has kept a relatively low profile since the ballot, said she wanted to renew the left. "If I am able to unite the Socialists on this political offer ... I will go right to the end of this move," Royal, 54, said when asked by France 2 television whether she intended to take over the party's top job. The current Socialist leader, Francois Hollande, who is also Royal's former partner, is due to step down later this year. The couple, who have four children, surprised many French people when they announced their separation shortly after the party's election defeat in June, only a few months after Royal said she had pondered a romantic wedding with him. In a book published last month, Royal said she had lacked the support of a united party and a loving partner in her failed presidential bid. Royal was a controversial candidate within her own party, upsetting colleagues with tough law-and-order plans, patriotic- toned rhetoric and plans to move the party closer to the centre. Some critics also said Royal was playing up her femininity in flowery speeches and portraying herself as the victim of male chauvinism, rather than convincing voters with concrete ideas. "I'm at the service of the left, and of France as well, because I have a responsibility as a former presidential candidate," Royal told France 2. "I raised a lot of hope. I received a lot of love. And I also gave a lot of that to the French people." Analysts say the party leadership would give Royal a springboard from which to launch a possible new presidential bid in the next election in 2012. Royal said on Thursday she would get fully involved in the party's campaign ahead of a municipal election in March. However, many Socialists say that one of the most prominent candidates in that poll, Socialist Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe, is set to be Royal's key competitor for both the party leadership and the Socialist presidential candidacy in 2012.
