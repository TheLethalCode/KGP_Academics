 BRUSSELS, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged Kenya's rival political parties to seek a coalition government, an EU spokeswoman said after the two spoke by phone on Thursday. "They agreed the focus should be on pressing the parties to engage in dialogue and make every effort to agree on seeking to establish a coalition government," she said after Solana and Rice discussed unrest triggered by the disputed re-election of President Mwai Kibaki. Solana also raised with Rice the possibility of a joint EU-US mission to Kenya and the two agreed to remain in close contact on the situation. Over 300 Kenyans have been killed in a week of tribal and political violence. "It is possible that might be one way (to help)," said the spokeswoman of the mission, which if agreed could involve a joint envoy or team of envoys. Kibaki was sworn in on Sunday after official results showed he had narrowly beaten opposition leader Raila Odinga. However, each side has accused the other of vote-rigging and EU observers said the elections fell short of international standards. Earlier EU statements this week noted that, despite concerns over irregularities, the vote appeared to be a very close race and called on Kibaki and Odinga to work together for an "inclusive" political solution.
