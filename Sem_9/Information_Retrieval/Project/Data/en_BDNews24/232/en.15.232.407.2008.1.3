 TBILISI, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian multi-millionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili said on Thursday he would run in a Jan 5. presidential election days after saying he was pulling out, a U-turn that poses a fresh challenge to the incumbent president. A bitter opponent of current frontrunner President Mikhail Saakashvili, the media magnate does not have enough support to win the election. But his candidacy will influence the outcome by either attracting enough votes from Saakashvili to force a second round or by dividing and weakening the opposition vote. In a face-off between the first round's two top performers, the fragmented opposition could unite around the single opposition candidate and reduce Saakashvili's chances of victory. Patarkatsishvili was a driving force behind mass opposition protests late last year, after which prosecutors accused him of plotting a coup attempt. He said on Dec. 27 he was pulling out of the race, citing a threat to his life. Patarkatsishvili's press office said in a statement he had decided to stand after all following a conversation with the head of the Georgian Orthodox church. "We did not discuss issues concerned with the elections," Patarkatsishvili wrote in the statement on his telephone conversation with Patriarch Iliya II. "But this conversation has given me the power to declare that I will not withdraw my candidacy and will continue to fight on to be elected president, to develop Georgia into a true democratic country with an independent parliament and courts." Saakashvili, a US ally, called the snap election as part of a package of concessions to ease a stand-off with the opposition, which accuses him of ruling in an autocratic style and failing to ease poverty and unemployment. The move came after he ordered police to crush anti-government protests in November. He then closed down the main opposition television station, Imedi, which is mainly owned by Patarkatsishvili. Patarkatsishvili, who made millions in Russia during the chaotic privatisations of the 1990s, is mainly based in London and has not been in Georgia since prosecutors said he was wanted for questioning over the coup plot charges. Patarkatsishvili has pledged to spend $1 billion of his own money to help improve the standard of living in Georgia and turn it into a "shining country". Most opinion polls give Saakashvili the biggest share of the vote, but they show his support hovering around the 50 percent plus one vote threshold needed to win in the first round. Patarkatsishvili has around 10 percent support. Opinion polls have in the past not been a reliable guide to Georgian electio
