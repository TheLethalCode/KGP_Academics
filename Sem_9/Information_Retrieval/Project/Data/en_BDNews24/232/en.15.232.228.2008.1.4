 HONG KONG, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks recovered on Friday from early losses as resource firms gained amid record prices for commodities such oil and gold, but Tokyo's main share index slumped as it played catch-up following a week-long holiday. European shares, including Britain's FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 were set to gain on Friday, reversing a two-day drop, according to financial bookmakers. The gains in Asia ended a rough start to the year for the region as fears of a US economic slowdown, $100-a-barrel oil and a weakening dollar hit export-reliant economies, with gold prices surging as investors sought a safe haven. Japan's Nikkei reflected these concerns during its half session on Friday, falling 4 percent to its lowest close in 17 months. Those losses in last year's worst-performing major index were far beyond those seen on Wall Street or the rest of Asia this week. "There's so much uncertainty now about the U.S. economy, the dollar/yen rate, and crude oil prices that it's pretty hard to see how anybody could buy," said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities. Key U.S. employment data for December due later on Friday will likely set the tone for early next week, as investors seek to gauge the extent of a slowdown in the world's largest economy. The jobless rate is seen hitting its highest in more than a year as the economy added 70,000 jobs to non-farm payrolls, down from the 94,000 added in November. "There's a worry that the U.S. payrolls data will come in very weak," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities in Seoul. "High oil prices are a big burden because that could significantly limit the room for more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve to prevent a recession," he added. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan rose 0.9 percent by 0622 GMT, recovering from an earlier fall of as much as 0.4 percent, with investors also picking up shares seen as oversold this week. The index is down 1 percent so far in 2008. Hong Kong stocks surged 2.3 percent by late trade, led by resource plays such as oil and gas producers PetroChina and CNOOC. Australian shares recovered from morning losses to end higher, led by miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd, while Korea Zinc jumped in Seoul India's main stock index hit a record high buoyed by Reliance Power's planned $3 billion initial public offering and Tata Motor's position as a front-runner to buy Ford Motor Co's Jaguar and Land Rover brands. Among other gainers, LG Electronics Inc surged 6.7 percent amid optimism about its fourth-quarter earnings due later this month. SAFETY FIRST Investors showed little reaction to the Iowa caucus results that mark the start of the U.S. presidential campaign, with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee winning among Republicans, and Senator Barack Obama heading the Democrats. Instead, the focus is expected to remain on the US economy and on oil prices, which on Thursday hit a life high of $100.09, the second day running in which US crude futures hit the triple digit mark. US light crude for February delivery held steady at $99.25 in Asia. A weakening dollar also threatens to erode overseas earnings at exporters, with the US currency hitting its weakest against the Japanese yen in five weeks on Thursday, before recovering a touch on Friday in Asia. Investors also moved towards assets perceived as safer in uncertain times, with gold at around $863.75/$864.40 an ounce, close to Thursday's record high of $869.05, supported by high energy prices and a weak dollar. Platinum hit a record high of $1,553 an ounce, but drifter lower later in the session. Some bond markets also gained, with benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond futures jumping to a one-month hi
