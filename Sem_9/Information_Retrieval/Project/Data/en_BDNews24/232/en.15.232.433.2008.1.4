<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus's president said on Friday he was pressing for a fresh start to stalled talks on reunifying the island, an issue complicating Turkey's bid to join the EU. Attempts to end the partition of Cyprus have been deadlocked since 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. reunification blueprint shortly before joining the European Union. "We have been pressing for the earliest possible start of substantial negotiations ... to our Turkish Cypriot compatriots and to the United Nations secretary-general," said President Tassos Papadopoulos, who is seeking re-election for a second five-year term in elections scheduled for Feb. 17. But, he said at a lunch with foreign correspondents, he did not know when the United Nations was likely to try again to resolve the deadlock. Regarded as a hardliner by critics, Papadopoulos led his Greek Cypriot community into rejecting the 2004 U.N. blueprint which Turkish Cypriots accepted. The division of Cyprus into an internationally recognised Greek Cypriot south and a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in its north remains a hurdle to Turkey's bid to join the EU. The EU has frozen membership negotiations with Turkey in eight policy areas due to Ankara's refusal to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot traffic. Papadopoulos, who participates in peace talks as Greek Cypriot leader, said his side had prepared detailed proposals to assist in the reunification process, which would be presented if and when talks under the auspices of the U.N. recommence. "There are several basic points we consider necessary for a workable and viable solution and in the past months we have worked very actively to formulate our proposals on each," he said, without giving further details. About 18 to 20 percent of Cyprus's population of around one million are Turkish Cypriots. Turkey seized the northern third of Cyprus in a 1974 invasion triggered by a brief Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia engineered by the military then ruling Greece
