 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)Local rights watchdog Odhikar has demanded that the government lift the state of emergency to secure human rights in the country. In a new report released Saturday, the watchdog said that alleged torture in the custody of security agencies was one of the main concerns in the past year. Odhikar launched the report at the National Press Club, where speakers also demanded a fear-free environment to reinstate people's basic rights curtailed at present because of the state of emergency. A total of 184 people died at the hands of various security agencies over the last year, according to Odhikar. Of those, 130 people were killed during so-called "cross fire/gun fights/encounters," the report said. The Rapid Action Battalion topped the list with 94 deaths, while 64 people died at the hands of police, according to the watchdog. Seven others died at the hands of joint forces, the army was responsible for another seven and the navy for three deaths, Odhikar said. The nongovernmental organisation also reported that 'joint forces' and the government had intimidated the press. In 2007, at least 35 journalists were injured carrying out their professional duties, while 13 journalists were arrested, reported Odhikar. The report highlighted the harassment of journalists by joint forces/security officials during the August 2007 curfew. bdn
