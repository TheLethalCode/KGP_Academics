<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  British oil-and-gas firm Cairn Energy said Friday that it completed the drilling of the Magnama-1 offshore exploration well in Block 16, which is now being plugged and abandoned. Earlier, energy officials said the drilling failed to discover commercially viable gas but there was no word from the company. The firm started drilling the well in October in the Magnama structure in the Bay of Bengal, some 60 kilometres south of Chittagong port, as part of a $117 million project. In a statement, the company said Magnama-1 was drilled at a crestal location to a total depth of 4,003 metres BRT to evaluate the potential for gas in abnormally high pressured sands beneath those productive at Sangu and elsewhere in the basin. The well encountered a series of well developed sands in the deepest section drilled but these were not gas charged and the well is now in the process of being plugged and abandoned, the statement said. Magnama-1 also encountered a number of thin gas bearing sands, which may be subject to further evaluation at a later date, it said. The Block 16 joint venture will next drill the Hatia-1 exploration well, which is located 12 km northwest of Sangu. The firm operates the country's only offshore gas field at Sangu in the Bay of Bengal, producing up to 80 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd). The country's proven and recoverable gas reserves of 13.54 tcf are expected to be exhausted by 2011, officials said. It is currently expected that drilling on Hatia-1 will commence shortly, the statement said. On Oct 26, 2007, Cairn announced a partial disposal of its Bangladesh interests to Santos International Holdings and currently holds a 37.5 percent operated interest in Block 16 exploration acreage. Santos holds a 37.5 percent interest in Block 16 exploration acreage. Cairn has been in Bangladesh for more than 10 years and, along with its joint venture partner, US firm Halliburton Co, has invested nearly $790 million, officials said. b
