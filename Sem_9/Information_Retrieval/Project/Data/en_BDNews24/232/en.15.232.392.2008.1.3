 GAZA, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops killed at least five Palestinians, including three civilians, during a raid into the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip on Thursday, Palestinian witnesses and hospital officials said. The Israeli army said it was hunting for militants responsible for firing rockets into southern Israel. One of the rockets landed north of the Israeli city of Ashkelon, 17 km (11 miles) from Israel's border with Gaza. The army said it was the furthest a rocket from Gaza had travelled.

A tank fired at a building after gunmen were spotted taking shelter in it, the spokeswoman said. The army said its forces killed two gunmen in separate incidents. Hamas said one of its gunmen was killed, but there was no immediate confirmation of another death. At least 22 Palestinians were wounded in the clashes, hospital officials said.
