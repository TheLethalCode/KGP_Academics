 KARACHI, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani test players Imran Farhat and Taufiq Umar have filed a petition against the Pakistan Cricket Board for banning them from playing domestic cricket matches. The board banned Farhat and Umar last month after they returned from India after playing in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), which is not recognised by the International Cricket Council or its member boards. "We have filed the petition in the Lahore High Court and our plea would be heard on Monday," the players' lawyer Imran Aziz told Reuters on Friday. He said both players had asked the court to declare the board's action, which also excludes them from national team selection, as unconstitutional. The board had amended a clause in their domestic cricket regulations to impose its suspension on Farhat, Umar and others, including former test captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, who played in the ICL. "This is the only way available to us to fight this unjust action by the board," said Farhat. "Cricket is our livelihood and they are depriving us of our right of trade." Farhat has appeared in 27 tests and 33 one-dayers and Umar in 25 tests and 19 one-day internationals
