<TITLE> New Zealand to show Bangladesh no mercy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand have vowed to show no mercy when they take on Bangladesh in the first of two tests starting in Dunedin on Friday. The New Zealanders are overwhelming favourites to win the series opener after crushing Bangladesh 3-0 in one-day internationals last month. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori has urged his players not to take pity on Bangladesh, who have won just one of 49 tests against all countries, and adopt the same ruthless attitude the Australians show against weaker opponents. "You can see what they (Australia) can do when they play well -- we have to take a leaf out of their book and go from there," Vettori told the New Zealand Press Association on Thursday. Vettori said his players had an added incentive to perform after their disappointing performances in the recent test series in South Africa. "Two wins against Bangladesh are pretty precious to us," he said. "We haven't played a lot of test cricket and when we have we haven't been going too well." The New Zealand selectors reacted to the loss in South Africa by wielding the axe, giving several players the chance to impress against Bangladesh. Opener Matthew Bell was recalled after a six-year absence along with fit-again Craig Cumming. Batsmen Scott Styris, Jamie How and Ross Taylor were all left out. The bowling lineup has been weakened by the unavailability of Shane Bond, James Franklin and Mark Gillespie, but the selectors have shown faith in Vettori, Chris Martin, Kyle Mills and either Michael Mason or Iain O'Brien. "Batting has been a concern in recent seasons so we have selected players who we believe can occupy the crease for long periods," selector Glenn Turner said in a statement. "In our assessment the bowling attack performed reasonably well in South Africa so we have retained that group." Bangladesh's Australian coach Jamie Siddons said his players were approaching the game with a positive mindset, hoping to build on the experience. "We've got a lot of young boys that are going to have a lot of bad days before they have some good ones," he said. "How will we react? We're capable of anything. We could respond really well, or we could capitulate -- that's how good we are.
