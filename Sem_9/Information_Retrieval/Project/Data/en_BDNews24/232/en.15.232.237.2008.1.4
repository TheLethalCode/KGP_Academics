 LONDON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British service sector activity in December unexpectedly picked up from a 4-1/2 year low, but price pressures are building rapidly while expectations for future business dived to a six-year low, a survey showed on Friday. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/NTC said its purchasing managers' index for services companies, ranging from hotels to banks, rose to 52.4 from 51.9. Economists had forecast the index to weaken further to 51.6, which would have been the lowest reading since April 2003. The activity index has been on a downward trend since hitting a nine-year high a year ago as past interest rate rises and, more recently, the global credit crunch have taken their toll. And business is increasingly pessimistic about what lies ahead. The business expectations index slumped to 67.5 from 69.5, the weakest reading since November 2001. Worries about the future of the service sector -- which makes up two thirds of Britain's economy -- are likely to add weight to expectations that official interest rates will need to fall further in the wake of the lending squeeze. "There was little festive cheer in the UK service sector at the end of 2007 as the subprime (debt) crisis continued to hurt general business confidence, placing downward pressure on sales and revenues," said Paul Smith, an economist at NTC. "Although the slowdown in activity growth was stemmed, market conditions clearly remained tough and confidence in the sector is now at its lowest since the immediate months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States." The global crisis triggered by defaults on U.S. mortgage debt led to the first run on a British bank -- Northern Rock -- in more than a century last year and the Bank of England voted unanimously to cut borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent last month to shore up the economy. PRICE PRESSURES CONSOLIDATE But signs of further price pressures at both ends of the pipeline are likely to complicate the tough balancing act facing the BoE as it seeks to pilot the economy through a rough patch just as inflation digs in. The survey's input prices index rose to 63.9 from 63.6, its fourth consecutive rise and equalling the series high set in August 2006. Pricing power is also picking up, with the output prices index accelerating for a fifth straight month to 54.5 from 54.2, its strongest since March last year. Such strength is likely to encourage policymakers to take a cautious approach to easing monetary conditions next year, with a back-to-back cut in January less likely, according to NTC. "Strong inflationary pressures do provide a hurdle to a second consecutive rate cut in January," Smith sa
