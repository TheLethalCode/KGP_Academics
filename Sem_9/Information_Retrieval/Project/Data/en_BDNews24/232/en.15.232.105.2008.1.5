 KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian police broke up a human rights rally on Saturday for the fourth time in three months, arresting at least one person and using a water cannon to disperse a group protesting against the use of internal security laws to silence dissent. Malaysia has drawn international criticism for its use of a colonial-era security law in a crackdown on public protests which have brought more than 20,000 people onto the streets since November. The spate of protests in this normally peaceful country comes at a delicate time for Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's government, which has seen its popularity fall ahead of snap polls expected in the coming months. A witness said an ethnic Indian man was arrested at Saturday night's protest after defying police orders to disperse. A police spokesman said there was no record of arrests so far. The Malaysian rights group Suaram criticised police for using water cannon and deploying riot police to break up the peaceful candlelight vigil. "It's totally unnecessary. They provoked the crowd by lining up the riot police with batons and shields and tried to push people away," Suaram executive director Yap Swee Seng told Reuters. He said at least two people were arrested. About 300 protesters, mostly lawyers, holding lighted white candles had earlier gathered near the city's main square, handing out leaflets calling for the abolition of internal security laws. Their march to the square was halted by police who had earlier sealed off the area. Most protesters soon left, but a group of about 30 Indian men challenged police to arrest them with cries of "We want action", another witness said. Police fired water cannon to break up the rally and chased protesters away, prompting shopkeepers to shutter their stores. Last month the government invoked the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for indefinite detention without trial, to detain five members of a Hindu rights body that had organised a rally of more than 10,000 ethnic Indians in November. The Indian protest, which complained of racial discrimination by the government, was one of the largest in a decade. It shocked authorities who accused the organisers of trying to incite racial tensions. Police had said the organisers of Saturday's rally did not have a permit. Malaysia bans public assemblies of more than five people without a police permit. In practice, police deny permits to anti-government protests but often issue them for protests aimed at foreign governments such as the United States.
