 Jakarta, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Islamic militant serving 19 years for his role in the bombing of a McDonald's restaurant has escaped from a prison on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, a prison official said on Monday. Wirahadi, 25, fled the Gunung Sari prison in Makassar, South Sulawesi province, with a fellow inmate during busy visiting hours on Sunday morning by climbing over a barbed wired wall, prison chief Bambang Yudotomo told Reuters. The Indonesian was sentenced to 19 years in prison for his role in a 2002 blast at a McDonald's fast food outlet in Makassar in which three people were killed. Fellow escaper Marcus Valyhuwae was serving a 15-year sentence for murder. "It was crowded that day, many visitors came to see the prisoners," said Yudotomo, "We didn't have enough guards. There were only 13 people on duty, whereas there are 511 inmates. This incident is (a result of) our carelessness". Yudotomo said prison security had been tightened and the country's anti-terror squad and local police were scouring ports and terminals to find the men. Last year another Islamic militant, jailed for 20 years for the 2004 bombing of a Sulawesi karaoke bar that killed four people, fled the same prison. Most such attacks in Indonesia have been blamed on Islamic radicals from the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) regional militant network.
