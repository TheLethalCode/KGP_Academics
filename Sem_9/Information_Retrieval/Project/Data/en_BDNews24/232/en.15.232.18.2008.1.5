<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com) Nayeem Islam and Mohammad Shahazada Saturday struck hundred each to take Rajshahi a step closer to the four-dayer title in the National Cricket League. Rajshahi declared their first innings at 365 for nine and restricted Dhaka to 132 for four at stumps on the second day of the final round four-dayer at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Leaders Khulna were apparently in backfoot compared to title contender Rajshahi though they took an overall 49-lead against Barisal at Birshreshtho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. Khulna, who are just one point ahead of Rajshahi, made 73 for two at stumps in the second innings after bowling Barisal out for 217 in their first innings. Two fifties from Ehsanul Haq and Dhiman Gosh helped Chittagong score 288 for seven at stumps in reply to Sylhet's first innings total of 354 all out at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Rajshahi vs Dhaka Rajshahi added 101 runs on the second day and declared their innings soon after their overnight batsmen Nayeem and Shahazada reached century. Nayeem converted his overnight 82 to 104 before he was caught by Sharif off Musharraf Hossain. He hammered 14 fours in his 236-ball knock. His overnight pair Shahazada also reached the magical figure of 109 before being bowled by Mohammad Sharif, who returned five for 70. Shahazada hammered nine fours and one six in 237 balls. Nayeen and Shahazada also put on 178 runs for the eighth wicket after Rajshahi reduced to 149 for seven. Dhaka, in reply, fell in trouble losing opener Anwar Hossain (3) before Opee and Arafat Sunny repaired the damage to take their side to 50 for four before Opee (33) left the field. Dhaka soon slipped to 61 for four. Mehrab Hossain Junior (40) and Mahmudullah Riad (31) then denied further damage to guide their side to 132 for four at stumps. Khulna vs Barisal The tail-ender batsmen helped Barisal take a first innings with Mohammad Shaheen (23 not out), Raisul Islam (28), Arafat Salahuddin (28) and Monir Hossain (27) providing some scores. Barisal having resumed the day on 62 for three finished their first innings at 217, taking a slim 24-run lead against Khulna. Spinners Jamal Babu, Murad Khan and pacer Aslam Khan each grabbed three wickets to wreck Barisal's innings. Mostafizur Rahman (31) and Sahagir Hossain (8) will resume Khulna's second innings on 73 for two on Sunday after the hosts lost openers Nazmus Sadat (32) and Imrul Kayes on naught. Sylhet vs Chittagong Sylhet added only six runs to finish their first innings at 354 after resuming the day on 348 for eight against Chittagong. In reply, Chittagong struggled at 97 for four at one stage before Ehsanul Haq (54) and Faisal Hossain Dickens (32) rescued the hosts contributing 64 runs for the fifth wicket. Thereafter, Dhiman and Yasin (23) together added another 67 runs for the seventh wicket before being separated. Dhiman and Kamrul remained unbeaten on 72 and one respectively at the close of Day 2.
