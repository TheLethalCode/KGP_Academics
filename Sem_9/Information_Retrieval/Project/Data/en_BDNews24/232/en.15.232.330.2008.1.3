 WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has urged rival Kenyan political leaders to work out a political solution to their election dispute and end the violence that has shaken what was one of Africa's most stable states, the State Department said on Thursday. Rice telephoned Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki on Thursday morning and opposition leader Raila Odinga the previous night, urging them to "broker some political solution to the political crisis," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. "We're urging them to come together and to have a political dialogue that leads to a political solution, whatever that may be, that puts an end to the crisis and an end to the violence," he told reporters. The turmoil over Kibaki's disputed re-election has already cost at least 300 lives and threatened Kenya's reputation as one of Africa's most promising democracies, strongest economies and favorite tourist destinations. McCormack told reporters the U.S. stance was to urge reconciliation and support a made-in-Kenyan solution, without being "prescriptive" about any outcome in Nairobi "What that political solution is is going to be up to them," he said. Kibaki appealed for calm and offered to talk to political rivals on Thursday after another day of battles between police and protesters disputing his re-election.
