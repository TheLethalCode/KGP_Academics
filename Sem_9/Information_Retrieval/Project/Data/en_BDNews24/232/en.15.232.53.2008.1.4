 WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea has not provided a full account of its nuclear program despite Pyongyang's statement asserting it already made a declaration required under a disarmament deal, US officials said on Friday. "Unfortunately, we have not yet received a complete and correct declaration and we urge North Korea to deliver one soon so that we can all get the benefits offered in the six-party process," White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters. North Korea's official KCNA news agency on Friday quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: "We have already drawn up a nuclear report in November and have notified the United States of it." Asked about the North Korean assertion, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said none of the other five countries in the six-party talks -- China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- had seen the final declaration that the North had committed to deliver by Dec. 31, 2007. "They've not yet provided what they have said is their final declaration to the chair of the six-party talks, the Chinese, and we're still waiting for that," he told reporters, adding that Washington remained committed to the nuclear deal. The United States and its allies reacted mildly when North Korea missed the declaration deadline -- part of deal in which Pyongyang would shed its nuclear program in phases in exchange for 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid and a removal from a U.S. terrorism blacklist. But McCormack said Washington was "not lowering the bar" on North Korea's commitments and said U.S. nuclear envoy Christopher Hill would push for progress in a trip next week to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia
