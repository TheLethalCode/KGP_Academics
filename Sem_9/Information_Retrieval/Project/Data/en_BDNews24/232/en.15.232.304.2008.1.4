 Des Moines, Iowa, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sen. Hillary Clinton placed third in the Iowa Democratic caucus on Thursday, a big setback for the one-time national front-runner in the first nominating contest of the 2008 US presidential election, CNN reported. Sen. Barack Obama placed first in the vote and former Sen. John Edwards came in second. The third-place finish put pressure on Clinton, the former first lady who is seeking to become the country's first woman president, to regain her national front-runner status as she heads into the Jan 8. primary vote in New Hampshire.
