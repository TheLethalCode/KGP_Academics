The government has since detained lawyer Uthayakumar, and four other Hindraf members, for up to two years under the draconian Internal Security Act, saying their actions were a threat to national security.

"It is an attempt to blacken and ruin his reputation globally," he told Reuters. Around 7 percent of Malaysia's 26 million people are ethnic Indians, whose forefathers were brought to the Southeast Asian country as labourers by British colonial rulers.

The complaints come at an especially sensitive time with Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi expected to call a snap election within months.
