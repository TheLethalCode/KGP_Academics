<TITLE> Georgia votes in poll Saakashvili likely to win </TITLE>

 Tbilisi, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgians began voting in an election on Saturday that President Mikhail Saakashvili is likely to win but surveys differ on whether his victory will be big enough to avoid a second round. Saakashvili, who swept to power in a peaceful revolution in 2003, needs to prove his commitment to democracy after shocking Western allies by violently crushing anti-government street protests in November. The West will watch the vote for fairness. "Georgia has made a commitment and expressed a desire to become a part of the Euro-Atlantic family," U.S. Congressman Alcee L. Hastings, head of the main Western election observation mission, said on the eve of the vote. "This election is a watershed election that will make a determination as to their commitment." Georgia lies at the centre of the South Caucasus -- a transit route wedged between Russia, Turkey and Iran which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe. After a landslide election win four years ago Saakashvili introduced economic reforms, aimed for NATO membership and positioned Georgia as the main U.S. ally in a region where Russia is competing for influence. But after days of demonstrations in November, Saakashvili ordered police to fire teargas and rubber bullets at protesters, closed the main opposition broadcaster and imposed a week-long state of emergency. He then ordered a snap Jan. 5 election, a move designed to repair his battered authority and democratic reputation. Most opinion polls place Saakashvili ahead of his nearest rival Levan Gachechiladze, head of the opposition coalition, but disagree over whether he will win more than 50 percent of the vote and avoid a second-round runoff. PROTESTS The opposition has already questioned the vote's fairness and threatened protests after the ballot. "If we detect serious violations, we will apply to the courts and call people for mass demonstrations," said David Zurabishvili, an opposition leader. The opposition accuses Saakashvili, a 40-year-old U.S.-educated lawyer, of economic mismanagement and corruption. Western economists have praised Saakashvili's reforms, which attracted sizeable foreign investment and economic growth of between 9 and 12 percent a year, and U.S. President George W. Bush hailed Georgia as a "beacon of democracy". But many Georgians say they have been left behind by the economic boom, inflation has eaten into incomes, utility bills have soared and unemployment is high. Saakashvili held a final election rally on Friday night that drew 15,000 cheering supporters to a Tbilisi sports arena. "Our task is to fight poverty," he bellowed as his supporters cheered and waved Georgian flags. "And as your candidate, if elected, I will fulfil this task." Others were not enthusiastic about his leadership. "I'll vote for opposition candidate Levan Gachechiladze, he has very good people in his team. They are very well educated," said 36-year-old Paliko Toriashvili as he hurried through the damp snow. "They will unite Georgia." Polling stations opened across Georgia, roughly the size of Ireland and with a population of about 4.5 million, at 0400 GMT and will close 12 hours later.
