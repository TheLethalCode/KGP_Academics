 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim Saturday called on the media to take initiatives to motivate farmers in using modern farming technology. Speaking at a seminar on the role of the media in disseminating farming methods, Karim said: "Ours is an agro-based country." "To be sufficient in agriculture we should provide the farmers with different equipment for using fertiliser and insecticide in the land so that good harvest can be ensured." "It is essential to reinforce the agricultural economy to make the country self-reliant," the adviser said. The media can play an active role in promoting modern technology in agricultural production, he added. Organised by the Department of Agricultural Extension, IFDCan international centre for soil fertility and agricultural developmentand USAID, the seminar focused on the advantages of granular fertiliser for small farmers. DAE officials said the granular urea fertiliser could be used for over some 8 lakh hectares of farmland in 80 upazilas in 24 districts across the country during the current IRRI-Boro season. The harvest could be doubled by using granular fertiliser, earning farmers greater profits. bdnews24.com/
