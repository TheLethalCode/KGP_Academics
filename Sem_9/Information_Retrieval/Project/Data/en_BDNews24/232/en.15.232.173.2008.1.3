<TITLE> Govt asks Thailand for 1 lakh tonne rice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Thursday asked Thailand to supply one lakh metric tonnes of rice as the interim government was staring at a crisis of the staple food. "We understand Thailand has some rice surplus and we have the need. I've requested the Thai ambassador to use his good office for the procurement of the desired quantity of rice from Thailand," Iftekhar told reporters at his office after he met Thai envoy in Dhaka Chalermpol Thanchitt. "We have to work together to face it." Thailand has promised to look into a government appeal, Iftekhar said. The Thai ambassador said his country could arrange the rice in two weeks but Bangladesh would have to buy that from them. The prices of all varieties of rice have shot up during the last couple of days, with some experts blaming it on the government's management failure. The government while briefing foreign envoys and donors last month said Bangladesh needed about 2 million tonnes of rice by March. Otherwise, it feared a food crisis. bdnew
