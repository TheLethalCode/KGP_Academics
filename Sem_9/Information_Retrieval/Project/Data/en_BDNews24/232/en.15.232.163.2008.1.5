<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)-- Amnesty International Friday urged the government to release cartoonist Mohammad Arifur Rahman from jail without further delay. Arifur, who had worked for Bangla-language daily Prothom Alo, was arrested on Sept 18 on charges of hurting religious sentiments of Muslims by drawing a cartoon in the newspaper. "Amnesty International considers Mohammed Arifur Rahman to be a prisoner of conscience, having been detained and charged solely for the legitimate and peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression," the human-rights watchdog said in a Web posting. "The AI is calling (Bangladesh authorities) for his immediate and unconditional release," it further said. The AI statement coincided with the visit of its secretary general Irene Khan to Bangladesh. A delegation led by Irene Khan will be on a six-day visit to Bangladesh from Saturday to discuss human-rights issues with the government and civil society. Arifur drew the cartoon in the now-banned satire magazine of Prothom Alo. Hundreds of people tied to Islamist outfits took to the streets protesting the publication of the cartoon and demanded closure of the top-selling newspaper. Arifur was put in detention initially for one month, which was later extended by three months. bdn
