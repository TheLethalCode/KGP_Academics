 PARIS, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks dropped on Thursday morning, adding to the previous session's sharp losses as shares of retailers sank following a profit warning by DSG International and a cautious outlook from Next. But the fall was cushioned by rallying energy shares after oil prices reached the $100 mark for the first time on expectations of a drop in US stockpiles. At 0953 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.6 percent at 1,477.68 points, a level not seen since Nov. 28. The index fell 1.3 percent on Wednesday, the first session of the year, after closing 2007 with a meagre 1.6 percent gain, its worst performance since 2002. The DJ Stoxx retail index was down 2 percent. DSG tumbled more than 19 percent after the electrical goods retailer said its annual profits would miss analysts' expectations after poor Christmas trading. Shares in Next, which warned that its 2008 outlook was "extremely cautious" as consumers face increasing demands on their finances, were down 4.4 percent. Other retailers were on the downside, with Marks & Spencer down 3 percent and Carrefour down 1.2 percent. Investors were also fretting about the outlook for the U.S. economy following weak manufacturing data released on Wednesday. The Institute for Supply Management's index of U.S. factory activity fell to 47.7 from 50.8 in November, well below expectations and the weakest since April 2003. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. "The ISM numbers showed that the slowdown in the manufacturing sector is a reality," said Jean-Marc Lucas, economist at BNP Paribas, in Paris. "On the one side, you have economic data pointing lower, and on the other side record oil prices that raise concerns over inflation, a difficult situation for the Fed. The data fuel the stagflation theme, but we think that recession risks are much greater than inflation risks," he said. Stagflation, when prices rise and growth stagnates, was last seen in the late 1970s. It could pose a dilemma for the Federal Reserve as policies aimed at boosting economic growth may fuel inflation, while policies used to fight inflation could weigh on an economy already grappling with fallout from the housing slump. Oil prices hovered just below the $100 a barrel they touched a day ago after expectations of falling US stockpiles, the weakening US dollar and geopolitical risks sparked a rally. Total was up 1.4 percent and Royal Dutch Shell up 1 percent. US weekly inventory numbers will be released on Thursday at 1530 GMT. According to a Reuters poll, US crude oil inventories were expected to have fallen by another 2.2 million barrels last week, a seventh successive weekly draw. Oil prices climbed 57 percent in 2007. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index flat and France's CAC 40 down 0.3 percent. On the macro front, investors were bracing for US monthly jobs figures, due on Friday at 1330 GMT. The data could shed light on the health of the US economy and the outlook for interest rat
