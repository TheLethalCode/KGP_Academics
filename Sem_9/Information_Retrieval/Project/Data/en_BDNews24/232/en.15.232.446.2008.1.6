<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Indonesian president Suharto, rushed to hospital in critical condition on Friday, is showing some signs of improvement but requires constant monitoring, hospital and medical officials said on Sunday. Suharto, 86, was admitted to Jakarta's Pertamina hospital suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure. His health deteriorated rapidly on Saturday, and he was given haemodialysis to remove excess liquid from his body. "Suharto's condition is now showing some progress. In general, (he is) still weak," Djoko Sanjoto, acting director of Pertamina Hospital, told a news conference. "The heart and lungs have shown some improvements, excess liquid in the whole body has started to decrease, especially in the lungs." It was unclear how long Suharto would have to stay in hospital. "We are not yet able to predict how long he will be hospitalised, because we are still doing observations hour by hour," Djoko Rahardjo, co-ordinator of the presidential medical team, told the news conference. "Because of his age, we are cautious about administering heavy medication that cannot be tolerated by his body." Suharto, a former general who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for three decades until he was ousted in 1998, was accompanied by family members at the hospital. A succession of government leaders, including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, as well as former ministers and Muslim clerics, have visited him there. Yudhoyono said the government would give Suharto the finest medical attention available. "Like what we do to all the former leaders of this country, we always give the best medical treatment," the state-run Antara news agency quoted the President as saying. "We have to pray so that the actions taken by the medical team will work and we pray for the best for former president Suharto for the sake of all." Suharto has suffered from various ailments in recent years, including intestinal bleeding and strokes, and has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions. Suharto came to power after a botched 1965 coup attempt blamed on communists. In the aftermath of an event still shrouded in mystery, around 500,000 leftists were slaughtered across the country, crimes that remained unpunished. The former strongman president rarely appears in public and has lived in seclusion in Jakarta's leafy Menteng neighbourhood ever since he stepped down in 1998 in the face of a tumultuous pro-demcoracy movement and econokic crisis. He and his family are still involved in a couple of high-profile court cases. Last year, the Supreme Court ordered Time magazine to pay Suharto more than $100 million in damages in a libel suit. Time, which is challenging the ruling, published a May 1999 cover story that said Suharto and his family had amassed a fortune of around $15 billion. They have denied that. Suharto was put on trial in the years after he was pushed from power on charges of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars in state money, but the government dropped the case due to his poor health. However, state prosecutors are now seeking a total of $440 million of state funds and about $1 billion in damages for alleged misuse of money held by one of Suharto's charitable foundatio
