 TBILISI, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili was heading for a landslide presidential election victory, early results showed on Sunday, but the opposition said the vote was rigged and vowed street protests. Official results so far from 105 polling stations -- out of a total of 3,512 -- gave Saakashvili just over 61 percent of the vote and his main rival 21 percent. An exit poll showed the pro-US Saakashvili with more than half the overall vote. The West is monitoring the fairness of the election. Saakashvili, who swept to power in a peaceful so-called "Rose Revolution" in 2003, shocked Western allies by violently crushing anti-government street protests in November. "According to the exit polls and all the data we have won, although as a democratic party we should wait for the central election commission's final results," Saakashvili told cheering supporters who waved the national flag. Across the capital Tbilisi, supporters honked car horns and celebrated in its snowy streets. But opposition leaders said the election was a fraud and called for a rally in central Tbilisi on Sunday. A Reuters witness saw water cannon and several buses full of men in uniform being driven into the city. Georgia, birthplace of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, lies at the heart of the South Caucasus -- which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe and where Russia and the United States are battling for influence. Saakashvili's opponents, who have accused the 40-year-old U.S.-educated lawyer of autocratic rule, economic mismanagement and corruption, said the election had been rigged. "LYING" "Saakashvili is lying," Levan Gachechiladze, leader of a nine-party opposition coalition, told reporters. "The exit polls have been falsified." He said the opposition had won Saturday's election and urged people to attend the rally in Tbilisi on Sunday. The opposition rallies in November attracted about 100,000 protesters at their peak and lasted for five days until police quelled them with teargas and rubber bullets. Saturday's election was both the first big test of voters' faith in the "Rose Revolution" that swept Saakashvili to power on a tide of euphoria and the first genuinely competitive election since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Georgia's previous elections were heavily one-sided or called fraudulent. Final official results from Saturday's election are not expected until Sunday evening. The main Western election monitors will give their assessment of the vote on Sunday. "This election was not ideal of course, but they were definitely much, much better than any previous election has been," said Temur Iakobashvili, a Georgian political analyst who took part in the exit poll. Gachechiladze's campaign officials said they had recorded cases of people being allowed to vote more than once, and voters and opposition observers being intimidated. Saakashvili's camp said there had been isolated violations but denied there was widespread fraud, saying the opposition was crying foul to divert attention from its defeat. Saakashvili has pushed through liberal economic reforms and steered Georgia toward NATO membership, policies with which his opponents broadly agree. His reforms have attracted foreign investment and generated economic growth of 9-12 percent a year. US President George W. Bush once hailed Georgia as a "beacon of democrac
