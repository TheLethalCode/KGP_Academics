<TITLE> US envoy meets Kenya opposition for crisis talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Washington's top diplomat for Africa met Kenya's opposition leader Raila Odinga on Saturday to seek an end to ethnic violence that has killed more than 300 people and shattered the country's peaceful image. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer, who arrived in Nairobi overnight, was due to meet President Mwai Kibaki later in the day. "We had a long, extremely useful meeting with her," said Odinga's spokesman Salim Lone. During the two-hour talk, Lone said Odinga reiterated the opposition's demands that a transitional government be formed to prepare for a new presidential vote within three to six months. "We're willing to meet Mr. Kibaki as long as there is international mediation," Lone added. "Without it, this crisis will only fester and get worse." Frazer's mission was the latest attempt at mediation by world powers horrified by the turmoil in what was seen as one of the continent's most stable democracies, and an ally of the West in its efforts to counter al Qaeda. Violence kicked off in earnest after Kibaki took a narrow victory in a contentious vote count that had Odinga ahead all the way, prompting opposition charges ballots had been stuffed in the president's strongholds to rig the result. On Sunday, Kibaki was sworn in at his residence an hour after the results were announced as opposition anger exploded into bloody protests that only subsided on Friday. The government, which also says Odinga supporters committed vote fraud, said on Friday it would accept a re-run of the Dec. 27 polls, if a court ordered it. The opposition is sceptical. It says the judiciary is packed with Kibaki loyalists and legal appeals may take years. The United Nations says post-election riots have uprooted 250,000 people -- far more than previously feared. U.N. officials were scrambling on Saturday to get food to people facing starvation after fleeing violence in the west of the country that included the burning to death of 30 people barricaded in a church. BUSINESS HUB The World Bank has said the unrest could hurt Kenya's impressive economic gains and harm neighbouring countries that rely on it as the region's business and transport hub. Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi are suffering fuel shortages. The U.N. World Food Programme says its main problem in feeding the displaced has been getting trucks to western Kenya. The turmoil has caused sharp fluctuations in the Kenyan shilling and the stock exchange lost 2.3 percent on Friday. International observers say last week's election fell short of key democratic standards. The Standard newspaper wondered if the country's electoral commission (ECK) was capable of organising a new poll, after its chairman said he did not know if Kibaki had won. "The burning question has, of course, been the credibility of another poll, given the laughing stock that ECK is. It is a divided, compromised and discordant house propped up by a mix of ethnic and old ties," its Saturday editorial said. Next to the editorial was a cartoon depicting Kibaki and Odinga in a car labelled "Kenya", trying to drive it in opposite directions under the heading "Going Nowhere Fast!". Many Kenyans blame their respective political parties for inflaming passions by accusing each other of genocide. Outside observers continued to call for reconciliation. South African Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu, who has met both sides to explore common ground, said on Friday Kibaki was open to the idea of forming a coalition government. Ghana's President John Kufuor, chairman of the African Union, has shelved plans to visit the country for talks because the authorities in Nairobi did not give him clearance. Tempers appeared to be cooling in the capital's slums, scene of some of the worst fighting, but protesters remained defiant. "Before we had long hair and skirts, but we are the dot.com generation," said Philip Ohago, an unemployed 29-year-old. "We know maths and we know who we voted for."
