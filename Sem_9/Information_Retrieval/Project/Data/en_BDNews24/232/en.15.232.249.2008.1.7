<TITLE> US top court takes up major death penalty case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday in a death penalty case being watched around the world, to decide whether the lethal injections used to execute criminals cause unacceptable pain. The hearing on whether the three-chemical cocktail used to end the lives of death row inmates violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment marks the first time the court has considered a specific means of execution since it upheld the use of firing squads in 1879. Although the session will focus on that narrow issue, it has prompted a nationwide debate on capital punishment itself in one of the few democracies that still permit it. Executions across the United States have come to a temporary halt since the court agreed in late September to decide the case, falling last year to a 13-year low of 42. Last month, New Jersey became the first state to abolish the death penalty since the Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976, reducing the number of states with capital punishment on their books to 36. Attorneys for two Kentucky death row inmates argued in their appeal to the Supreme Court that the current lethal injection method can cause excruciating and needless pain. They said the evolution of execution methods in the United States, from hanging in the 19th century to electrocution and then lethal gas, reflected a continuing quest to find a more humane way of killing, but that each new method turned out to be less humane than intended. But Kentucky and the Bush administration argued that the current procedures are intended to cause death in a painless, quick manner. The court's ruling, expected by the end of June, could decide if the current lethal drug combination is constitutional or whether states have to come up with alternatives that pose less risk of pain and suffering. Support for the death penalty remains strong in the United States at around 60-65 percent of the public, but has fallen significantly in recent years as DNA tests have helped exonerate 15 people convicted to die, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-capital punishment group
