 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Bhutan have agreed to explore land links and energy ties under the SAARC framework. The two countries agreed to "explore the possibility of land connectivity" to enhance trade and people-to-people contact, according to a joint press statement released by foreign ministry on the prime minister's visit. The two countries have also reached a consensus on "exploring the possibility of cooperation" in the energy sector under South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation charter. The agreement came on Monday at the end of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's four-day visit to the Himalayan nation. The two sides signed a trade deal on Saturday. As a move to increase bilateral trade, Bhutan waived all duties on imports from Bangladesh. Hasina announced Dhaka's reduction of the existing 15 percent tariff to zero on 18 import items from Bhutan to increase the volume of trade, said the statement. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan total less than $1 million, and include warm garments, computer accessories, dry foods, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the latter's commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oats. "Both sides emphasised the relevance of enhancing people to people contact to further strengthen the existing close ties of friendship and cooperation," said the joint statement. They agreed to promote each other's tourism in their respective countries. "They also agreed to explore the possibility of land connectivity between Bhutan and Bangladesh under the aegis of SAARC transport connectivity to promote intra-regional trade and travel." The 14th SAARC summit in April 2007 in Delhi had special focus on regional connectivity. According to the regional connectivity plan, SAARC proposed a number of routes to integrate the South Asian countries. The major corridors proposed were: Lahore-Delhi-Kolkata-Petrapole-Benapole-Dhaka-Akhaura-Agartala (2,453 km), Kathmandu-Nepalganj-Delhi-Lahore-Karachi (2,643 km), Kathmandu-Birgunj-Kolkata-Haldia (1,323 km), and Thimpu-Phuentsholing-Jaigon-Kolkata-Haldia (1,039 km). Referring to the growing energy demand in Bangladesh and Bhutan's high potential for production of hydro electricity, the two sides also agreed to explore possibility of cooperation in the field of energy under the SAARC regional cooperation in energy sector. Mountainous Bhutan has the potential to produce about 30,000 MW of electricity, according to SAARC estimate. The Indian companies have so far been able to exploit 10,000 MW of electricity most of which goes to India. Bangladesh and Bhutan will have to construct a 50-km long distribution lines to import its power subject to approval of India's central government. New Delhi officially dictates foreign policy of Bhutana "consciously isolated" country. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina went to Bhutan on Nov 6 on an invitation from Bhutanese premier Lyonchen Jigmi Thinley, and returned home Monday afternoon. During her stay in the Himalayan country, Hasina was also received by the King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and his father Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, commerce minister Faruk Khan and industries minister Dilip Barua accompanied the prime minister.
