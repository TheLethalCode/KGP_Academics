<TITLE> Two Koreas in brief naval clash, no casualties: Yonhap </TITLE>

 SEOUL, Nov 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The two Koreas had a brief naval skirmish in Yellow Sea waters on Tuesday, but there were no casualties in the incident that came just ahead of a visit to Asia by US President Barack Obama, Yonhap news agency reported.
