 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)A delegation of 21 Danish companies is visiting the country in a bid to explore investment opportunities in the shipbuilding and fishing industries. "Our reports show that it's 15 percent cheaper to build a ship in Bangladesh compared Vietnam, Malaysia or India," Einar Hebogrd Jensen, the Danish envoy in Dhaka said at a 'match-making event' between the delegation and Bangladeshi businessmen. But, Jensen pointed out, that there's a need for improvement of the industry as 90 percent of the components to build a ship has to be imported. "So, a backward linkage industry is very much needed; that way jobs can be created and value can be added." The Danish delegation arrived Sunday on a 7-day tour. The members will visit shipbuilding yards in Bangladesh, said the Danish ambassador. "But they will also look into other areas like the fishing industry as the delegation includes representatives from companies that manufacture nets and other fishing gears," he added. On Denmark's B2B Programme in Bangladesh, which aims to promote private sector activities, Jensen said that it had already established 70 joint venture initiatives in the country, mainly in the IT sector. "Now we are also into the shipbuilding and fishing sector and from next year we hope to touch the food industry as opportunities are very good." Speaking on behalf of the shipbuilding industry, merchant mariner ATM Kamal said that Bangladesh has skilled labour, which is a low cost advantage. The Bangladeshi shipbuilding industry should focus on building smaller vessel rather than larger ones, according to Kamal, the managing director of Highspeed Group, a shipping company. "Support from the government over the last 3 years fostered the growth of the industry," added Kamal, also representing the Bangladesh Shipbuilders Association. He urged the commerce minister to lower the bank interest rate to single digit and provide tax holiday facilities to the sector. "If possible, provide direct subsidies for each vessel exported." Kamal said that backward linkage through joint venture enterprises would definitely enhance the sector's performance. Commerce minister Faruque Khan was chief guest at the inaugural session of the 'match-making event' held at a city hotel. He asked the Danish delegation to weigh the opportunities of building dredgers in the country. "We need them urgently in our country for river dredging to protect against floods." On the question of cutting interest rates, he said that it has to be done gradually. The government's aim was to bring the interest rate to a single-digit before the end of its current tenure, he said. He also asked the representatives of local industry to consider the environmental issues and ensure appropriate worker facilities.
