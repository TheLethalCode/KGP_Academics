 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--The attorney general has appealed to the top judges not to administer oath to any power usurpers in a bid to safeguard democracy and the constitution. In his concluding arguments in the Bangabandhu murder appeals at the Supreme Court on Monday, Mahbubey Alam said no judge should be made chief martial law administrator in future. "The judges rather die, why should they become chief martial law administrator? The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began hearing arguments for the 26th day at around 9:45am. It ended at around 1:45pm. "Power was usurped unconstitutionally after Aug 15 by trampling constitution. A number of judges failed to play strong role that time," Alam told the top court. "One of them was seen to administer oath of office to Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed. That judge should be reproached. Mushtaq was sworn in as president by justice Mohammad Sayem Abu Sadat after the assassination of president and founding father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Gen Ziaur Rahman made justice Sayem chief martial law administrator and president on Nov 7, 1975. Later Zia became CMLA on his own and was sworn in by then chief justice Syed A B M Mahmud Hossain. Gen H M Ershad usurped state power ousting then president, justice Abdus Sattar, in a bloodless coup on Mar 23, 1982. Justice A K M Muneem administered Ershad's oath to office. Another Supreme Court judge, A F M Ahsanuddin Chowdhury succeeded Ershad to presidency. Though Bangladesh's judges helped the military rulers to the helm state power, Pakistan's Supreme Court chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary shook the power base of the country's military ruler Parvez Musharraf. He was removed from office in November 2007 when president Musharraf declared a state of emergency, and reinstated on Mar 16, 2009, as Musharraf's successor, Asif Ali Zardari, moved to avert a political crisis. Alam questioned: "Where did he (Chaudhary) take Pakistan's image?" He observed that there was no chance of commuting the death penalty of the convicts considering the brutality of killing. He said the top judges in the pending ruling should give a directive to bring the remaining convicts back home. Alam urged the court to give its explanation censuring the judge who had administered oath to Mushtaq. "The High Court in the case regarding the fifth amendment to the constitution ruled illegitimate the wresting of state power in an unlawful manner." He urged the court to refer the related issues in the ruling along with the murder trial. Alam said many a High Court bench felt embarrassed to hear the death reference and appeals after the penalty of the convicts in the trial court. He presented his arguments on the reason of embarrassment of the judges. Alam said: "The killers shot Bangabandhu's eldest son Sheikh Kamal at the reception room. Bangabandhu was shot while he was in the stairs. Begum Mujib was shot in the bedroom. Sheikh Naser was killed after he was taken to the bathroom, crying for water. Sheikh Naser was the younger brother of Sheikh Mujib. He continued: "Sheikh Russel (youngest son of Bangabandhu) wanted to go to his mother and an army officer ordered to take him to his mother and was shot dead taking him upstairs. "The army officer gave the order to take Russel to his mother but Begum (Fazilatunnesa) Mujib was killed only moments before. "What a cruel idea of a practical joke about taking Russel to his mother!" Citing the example of the concentration camp in Germany during the World War Two, the attorney general said: "Bandages were kept on the mothers' breasts in those camps so that their toddlers could not have milk. "Mothers killed their own babies by pushing injections at the order of the doctors as they could not endure their (children's) pains. "The cruelty of the killers of Aug 15 was surpassed all cruelties of the world. The eyes and brain of the 10-year old Russel came out at the firing of the killers. "Such example of brutality is rare in history. There is no scope to commute the penalty of the killers." Alam said the killers had destroyed the image of Bangladesh by the sheer brutality of the killing. He said the defence in their arguments had pointed out that army mutiny took place on Aug 15, but no mutiny was held that day. "Conspiracy was plotted to kill Bangabandhu. Killers Bazlul Huda, Noor Chowdhury, Aziz Pasha and other officers stealthily entered Bangabandhu's house. They did not let other army soldiers, who had gone with them, know their purpose. "It was proved from the evidence that the army officers hoodwinked the army soldiers to get their job done." Continued Alam: "If there was mutiny why Bangabandhu's nephew Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, his wife Arzu Moni, Bangabandhu's brother-in-law Abdur Rob Serniabat and his grandson Sukanta Abdullah Babu were killed? "A woman of that house urged the killers not to kill Sukanta Abdullah Babu. But the killers killed all family members in a hail of bullets. Alam told reporters after the hearing he had told the court that Syed Faruk Rahman and Abdur Rashid Khan were the self-confessed killers. "The video footage of the statement of the killers confessing to their involvement with the killing on then UK-based Granada TV came to Bangladesh. "Apart from that, The Time, Sunday Times and other magazines reported the involvement of the convicts. These reports were presented in High Court division. "But the High Court did not take them into cognisance due to technical reasons. "I have urged the Appellate Division to take cognisance of these issues. Their observation is needed for future trial." The attorney general said: "The convicts are now claiming themselves innocent. But Faruk Rahman and Abdur Rashid confessed to their involvement in the writ petition filed with the High Court. "They have delivered different statements at different times to save their lives. The convicts had plotted conspiracy to kill Bangabandhu. It is clear in the High Court ruling. "They deserve the highest punishment for that." The attorney general said: "Many of the killers still remain fugitive. Lt Col AKM Mohidduin (lancer) during his stay in America confessed before a court there that he had killed Bangabandhu. "Other fugitive convicts also remain abroad confessing to their involvement." "I have urged the court to give its observation on sending the fugitive convicts back home. It will ease the process of returning them to the country. "Many states have sheltered the killers. Libya is still sheltering them. The convicts have convinced many Muslim countries into believing that they had saved Islam by killing Bangabandhu. At the end of the hearing Alam cited a line of world poet Rabindranath Tagore. "The nation has sighed wearily for the trial of the killing for long. They expect true justice from the court. "The army members (involved in the putsch) were given jobs at foreign missions after the killing. How were they given jobs?" At the start of the hearing, he hammered at the link between the convicts. "Convicts Faruk Rahman and Abdur Rashid are brother-in-laws (Their wives are sisters). "Aziz Pasha was brother-in-law of Bazlul Huda. Maj Dalim and Maj Noor Chowdhury were bosom friends. They came to Bangladesh together. "Khandaker Abdur Rashid was nephew of Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed. Of the 15 convicts, six were dismissed from the army. "All of them made the scheme to kill Bangabandhu," he said. State counsels Toufique Newaz, Azmaul Hossain QC and A F M Mesbahuddin will present their arguments on Tuesday. Before Alam, the chief state counsel in the case, Anisul Haque, delivered his arguments. The prosecution started its arguments on Nov 2. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaq Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
