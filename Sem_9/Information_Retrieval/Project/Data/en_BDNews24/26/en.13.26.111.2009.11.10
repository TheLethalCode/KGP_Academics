 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has given CID police one day to interrogate Dhaka City Corporation commissioner Ariful Islam Arif at the jail gate in the case regarding the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. The bench of justices A F M Abdur Rahman and Mohammed Imdadul Haque Azad issued the order on Tuesday. The Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Monday granted police a five-day remand to question Airf. Barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah, who argued for the DCC commissioner at the hearing, said his client was sick and tortured in remand. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. b
