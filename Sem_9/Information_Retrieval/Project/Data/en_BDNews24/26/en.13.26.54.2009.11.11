 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet, in its weekly meeting Wednesday, is expected to finally approve a new pay scale for civil servants. The meeting began at around 11:15am at the prime minister's office. Finance minister AMA Muhith hinted on Tuesday that civil servants were likely to get their November salary, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, in line with the new pay scale. "I hope the cabinet will approve the new pay scale. If passed, the November salary will be given under the new scale," he told reporters at the Secretariat. The Seventh Pay Commission was formed in September 2008. It submitted recommendations to the finance minister in late April, proposing new pay scales for civil servants ranging from Tk 4,500 to Tk 45,000 per month. The secretary-level committee later revised the proposals and suggested the lowest salary at Tk 4,150 and the highest at Tk 39,000. bd
