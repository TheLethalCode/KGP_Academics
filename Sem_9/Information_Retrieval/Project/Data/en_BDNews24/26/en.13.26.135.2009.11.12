 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka and New Delhi will finalise deals on mutual transit facilities during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India from December 19, foreign minister Dipu Moni has said. The foreign minister, however, could not say whether the two governments would be able to reach a crucial agreement on Teesta water sharing during the three-day visit. "The prime minister leaves for Delhi on December 19," Dipu Moni told bdnews24.com at the foreign ministry Thursday. "She will operationalise deals with India to get transit facilities to Bhutan and Nepal," she said. The foreign minister said Dhaka and Delhi would also "operationalise" the agreement on allowing India to use Ashuganj as a transit point under an existing Water Protocol between the two countries. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes defined the word "operationalise" to bdnews24.com Thursday at his office. "Operationalisation means removing the policy barriers and reaffirming commitments," said Quayes. He said both Bangladesh and India needed some necessary preparations to make existing transit agreements effective. "For instance, we cannot make Ashuganj a port of call overnight. The roads must be widened for that purpose," said Quayes. During Dipu Moni's visit to India on September 7, Delhi agreed giving Bangladesh transit facilities to reach Bhutan and Nepal through Indian territory. In return, Bangladesh agreed to allow Delhi to use Ashuganj for carrying heavy machinery for setting up a power plant in India's North East. However, the foreign minister did not make it clear whether the government would allow India to use Ashuganj as a multi-modal transit point under the Water Protocol. Foreign ministry officials have told bdnews24.com that if India gets transit under Section 11 of the Protocol, signed in 1972, Delhi will not be able to carry goods by Bangladesh roads. But Indian trucks will be able to carry goods from Ashuganj, unloaded from Indian ships, if Delhi gets transit under Section 23 of the same Protocol. Dipu Moni and her Indian counterpart SM Krishna in September also agreed to form a technical team with a view to signing a deal on water sharing of the common Teesta river on which Bangladesh has its largest irrigation project. "I think we need time to sign the deal on sharing Teesta water," Dipu Moni told bdnews24.com Thursday. India has a barrage in Gazaldoba on the Teesta upstream from Bangladesh for its irrigation projects. The Indian water withdrawal during lean periods makes the Teesta almost dry, water development board officials say. Bangladesh's Teesta barrage (first phase) in the rice-producing Rangpur region covers irrigation projects on 750,000 hectares of land, according to the board officials. Water shortage in the Teesta very often disrupts irrigation in the vast tracts of land of the greater Rangpur district and puts Bangladesh's agriculture in trouble. As many as 54 rivers enter Bangladesh from India and the only water sharing deal was signed in 1996 to share water of the common river Ganges.
