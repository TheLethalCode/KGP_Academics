 LONDON, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry Birmingham City players and management accused Liverpool's David Ngog of cheating after the striker earned a controversial penalty for a 2-2 draw at Anfield on Monday. Birmingham were leading 2-1 with 20 minutes remaining when Ngog went to ground after a challenge by Birmingham's Lee Carsley. Television replays showed no contact had been made. "You are supposed to be teaching your kids an example and this is just an embarrassing case of cheating," Carsley was quoted as saying by British media. "I was absolutely nowhere near him. It's a joke. I know I didn't touch him and I said to the referee to book me or send me off. That would have made me feel better." The point left Birmingham in 15th place, just above the relegation zone, and manager Alex McLeish was also frustrated by referee Peter Walton's decision. "Ngog dived.

TABLOID BACKLASH The incident dominated Tuesday's back pages, with the best-selling tabloid Sun newspaper running the headline "Cheat." "King Con" declared the Mirror while the Mail opted for "Diving Pool." The match added to pressure on Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez, with his injury-depleted team in seventh place and 11 behind leaders Chelsea.

"Riera had the same problem (hamstring) as before," Benitez told the club's website (www.liverpoolfc.tv). "Yossi has the same problem as Riera. "Some players are playing too many games in a row. They are working very hard and so you always have this risk. I think both will have tears. "Agger also had a problem with his back. It's not serious but he felt it a little bit." Of greater concern is the fitness of Torres, and while Liverpool's next game against Manchester City is not until November 21 because of the international break, Benitez said the Spanish international may not even not even be ready then. "Torres had no confidence and said he couldn't play, so we started the treatment yesterday," Benitez said. "He has to work with the physios and try to improve and be ready. We are not talking about an operation at this moment. "I don't know if he will be ready for Man C
