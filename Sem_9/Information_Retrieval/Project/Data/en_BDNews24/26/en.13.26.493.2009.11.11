 HANOVER, Germany (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke, who committed suicide by jumping in front of an express train, was suffering from depression, his wife and his doctor said on Wednesday. The 32-year-old Enke was hit by the train travelling at 160 kph as it passed through a crossing near Hanover on its route between Hamburg and Bremen. His wife Teresa said the couple had tried to overcome years of depression through therapy "When he was acutely depressive it was a very difficult time because he lacked motivation and any hope of improvement," she told reporters at a news conference. Enke, who apologised in a suicide letter for hiding the condition of his mental state leading up to his suicide from his family and doctors, tried hard to keep his depression secret. His wife, dressed in black and struggling to hold back tears, said: "It is crazy because now it is coming out anyway. We thought we could do everything and we could do it with love but you can't always do it." The German soccer federation called off training for Saturday's friendly against Chile, putting the match in doubt. German Chancellor Angela Merkel contacted Enke's family. "The Chancellor communicated her shock and compassion to the widow of Robert Enke in a very personal letter," government spokesman Christoph Steegmans told reporters. Enke won eight international caps and was in the running to play at the World Cup in South Africa next year. His doctor said he had been treating Enke since 2003, during a turbulent time when the goalkeeper had several unsuccessful transfers to clubs in Spain and Turkey. "I had been treating him since 2003. He suffered from depression and fear of failure," Valentin Markser told reporters. Markser said the player refused to be treated on the day of his suicide, saying he was feeling well.

He lived in the shadow of Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann for almost a decade and it was only after the latter's international retirement last year that Enke emerged as a leading contender for the position, despite earning his first call-up in 1999. He won his first cap in 2007. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the Hanover stadium and offices on Wednesday, leaving flowers and lighting candles in Enke's memory. "We loved him. He was our idol," one fan told Reuters Television. "We will never have someone like him. Not only for us but for the history of football this is a great tragedy." Enke is survived by his wife Teresa and an eight-month-old girl the couple adopted in May. The German soccer league (DFL) said a minute's silence would be held on the next matchday, with all players wearing black armb
