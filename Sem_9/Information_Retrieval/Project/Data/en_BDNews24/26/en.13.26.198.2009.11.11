<TITLE> Denmark stresses Bangladesh's COP15 role </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11(bdnews24.com)  Danish ambassador Einar Hebogaard Jensen has said Bangladesh's role at the crucial Copenhagen climate conference is more important than ever. Jensen, at a press conference Wednesday, said host Denmark considered Bangladesh a partner in the process leading up to the 15th UN Climate Change Conference (COP15). COP15 aims to secure binding pledges on emissions cuts to replace the Kyoto Protocol that expires in 2012. The Danish envoy said Bangladesh would certainly receive more adaptation funds following successful conclusion of a Copenhagen deal. "Bangladesh has previously played a crucial role in speaking up for the least developed countries in climate negotiations," Jensen told reporters at the Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium. "In Copenhagen, Bangladesh's voice is more important than ever," he said, mentioning that prime minister Sheikh Hasina was contributing to the upcoming climate change talks through the Copenhagen Commitment Circle. The Copenhagen Commitment Circle is a body, headed by the Danish prime minister, with a goal of maintaining momentum to reach an agreement in Copenhagen. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is talking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries. She is raising the problems of the poor and small countries," said Jensen. "It cannot be that only the developed  will be talking in the conference," he said. In reply to a question, Jensen said Bangladesh would get funds as grants for adaptation. But he could not say whether the Copenhagen deal would give Dhaka the necessary funds as grants or loans. Foreign minister Dipu Moni at a Climate Vulnerable Forum in Male said Tuesday that the adaptation funds must be given as "grants, not loans". Jensen pointed out that Bangladesh had already received funds as grants under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, set up under the country's Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan adopted in 2008, and revised in 2009. Negotiations are on whether the most vulnerable countries (MVCs) facing climate change should get necessary funds as grants since most being poor countries are not responsible for global warming though they are most at risk. The British prime minister Gordon Brown, on behalf of the European Union, has proposed creating a fund of 1 billion per year for climate change adaptation and mitigation from 2020. The issue is yet to be settled.
