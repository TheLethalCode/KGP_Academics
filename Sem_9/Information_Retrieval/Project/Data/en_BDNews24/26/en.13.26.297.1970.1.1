 Syed Nahas Pasha, London London, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)--The Bangladesh government must ensure justice for the victims of the Feb 2009 BDR mutiny by ensuring that all suspects receive a fair trial, Amnesty International has said in a report released in London on Wednesday. It urged the government to ensure that those suspected of committing crimes are brought to justice under internationally recognised fair trial standards which include the right to family visits and access to lawyers. The report "Looking for Justice: Mutineers on trial in Bangladesh" carries testimony from family members of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) accused of participating in the mutiny. These reports suggest that scores, possibly hundreds of BDR personnel had suffered torture, for possible involvement in the mutiny. Nearly all were denied the opportunity to seek the assistance of a lawyer for weeks or months. Amnesty International's Bangladesh researcher Abbas Faiz told bdnews24.com that this was an opportunity for the government of Bangladesh to show its commitment to the international human rights treaties that it has ratified by ensuring that those suspected of committing crimes are brought to justice under internationally recognised fair trial standards. The government is obligated under these treaties and its domestic law to provide justice for the victims of the massacre. It also has an obligation to ensure that the human rights of those accused of the mutiny and killings are protected, Faiz added. The report said "Amnesty International condemns the unlawful killings, hostage taking and other human rights abuses committed during the mutiny and calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice". "The government of Bangladesh has an opportunity to reinforce trust in the rule of law by ensuring the civilian courts, which will be trying the accused, deliver justice." Abbas Faiz said, "The mutiny was brutal and led to the killing of civilians, and army officers who died in horrific circumstances. It's vital that the government of Bangladesh brings the perpetrators of these crimes to justice in a manner that is compatible with international law." Following the mutiny, thousands of BDR personnel were confined to barracks and denied all contact with the outside world. Reports soon emerged as family members began to meet the detainees, alleging that scores, possibly hundreds of BDR personnel had suffered human rights violations, including torture, for possible involvement in the mutiny. "Looking for justice" documents the methods of torture used including depriving suspects of sleep over a number of days, subjecting suspects to beatings and the use of pliers to crush testicles, inserting needles under suspect's nails and administering electric shocks. "The reports of torture that Amnesty International has received are consistent with the previously documented torture and ill treatment of detainees in Bangladesh. It's not good enough for the authorities to deny that torture isn't taking place. There needs to be greater accountability on this issue." said Faiz. Reports said at least 20 BDR personnel died in custody between March 9 and May 6 2009 alone. BDR sources claimed that four of them committed suicide, seven died of heart attacks and another nine died from diseases. By October 10 2009, the total number of BDR Personnel who have died in custody has risen to 48. Faiz told bdnews24.com Amnesty International welcomes the Supreme Court's clarification that army court martial has no jurisdiction to try BDR personnel accused of mass killings and other criminal offences during the February 2009 mutiny. The government must also reconsider its decision to use Speedy Trial Tribunal because the time limit these courts impose for the completion of the trial may lead to a miscarriage of justice, he observed. He said amnesty may publish another report on BDR Special Court later. Amnesty International urged the government to ensure that those suspected of committing crimes are brought to justice under internationally recognised fair trial standards which include the right to family visits and access to lawy
