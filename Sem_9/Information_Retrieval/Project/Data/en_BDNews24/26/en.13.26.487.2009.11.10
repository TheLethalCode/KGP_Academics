 Bhairab, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  All shops and businesses in Kishoreganj's Bhairab and Kuliarchar Upazilas were shut down on Tuesday in observance of a half-day general strike. A citizen's group enforced the strike protesting the burning of an effigy of president Md Zillur Rahman at Kishoreganj district headquarter last week and in support of the government's move to create the proposed new district of Bhairab. All educational institutions, offices and banks in the two Upazilas kept their doors shut in observance of the hartal. The citizen's group also held a protest rally after the hartal in Bhairab town's Durjoy crossing. Md Sirajuddin, convener of the citizen's group, and Bhairab Upazila Awami League acting president, blasted the burning of the president's effigy and demanded punishment of those responsible. He told bdnews24.com they would declare their next action programmes at a rally scheduled to be held later in the day. Bhairab police chief Shahjahan Kabir said no untoward incident took place during the strike. Picketers created barricades on roads during the strike by burning tyres, disrupting road communication between Bhairab and Dhaka, Sylhet and Kishoreganj. The shutdown also disrupted rail communication. All trains bound for Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet and Mymensigh remained halted at Bhairab. Protest processions were taken out from various spots of Bhairab town in support of the shutdown. Protesters in Kuliarchar Upazila uprooted some 300 yards of rail tracks on Kishoreganj-Bhairab line at Usmanpur near Kuliarchar railway station. Kuliarchar police chief Jamal Uddin admitted the agitating mob had damaged the railway track but claimed the situation was peaceful during the strike. Kuliarchar Awami League president Abul Hossain said the hartal was observed spontaneously. Earlier on Nov 2, another citizen's group observed a daylong general strike in Kishoreganj protesting the government's move to create the proposed new district of Bhairab. The demonstrators had set fire to the president's effigy in the town's Gatail area during the strike. A series of agitation programmes are being observed at different Upazilas of the district for a month now against the government's decision to form Bhairab district encompassing five Upazilas  Nikli, Bajitpur, Kuliarchar, Katiadi and Bhairab. bd
