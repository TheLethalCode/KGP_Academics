<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)The nation's founding father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed to destroy Bengali nation, culture, values and all institutions, the four state counsels in the Bangabandhu murder appeals have said. The Supreme Court heard arguments from state counsels Azmalul Hossain QC, Toufique Newaz, A F M Mesbahuddin and Abdul Matin Khasru at the 27th day's hearing. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began the hearing session at around 9:45am. The hearing ended at around 1:30pm. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque will present his arguments for half an hour on Wednesday. Azmalul Hossain in his arguments said the nation was hijacked on Aug 15, 1975. "The country plunged into chaos since the trial of the killing was not held. People saw misuse of power after the assassination. "The third High Court bench gave an accurate ruling resolving the difference of opinion of the two-member High Court bench." Hossain said there was a proper reason for the delay in filing the case. "The trial court and the High Court had handed down verdict observing all points. The law enforcers did not maintain their duties at that time. The then government should have maintained law and order. "The law-enforcing agencies and the people who were in charge of the state including heads of the armed forces, the chief justice, the attorney general and the home secretary did not do their job. "Nobody moved to hold the trial. All of them failed. "The members of the armed forces were sworn in to safeguard the republic, the president and the constitution. They breached their oath although they took oath to save all the three even at the cost of their own lives. "The High Court division issues suo moto rule on various issues. But no suo moto rule was issued regarding the trial of the killing not being held. "The judges are neutral as per the constitution. The court failed to prove so after Aug 15, 1975. The judiciary totally failed at that time." Hossain presented his arguments to mention this issue in the ruling. "After the killing of Bangabandhu there was grave misuse of power. The door to the trial was shut by clamping indemnity ordinance on Sept 26, 1975. "The retired and dismissed army officers were reinstated to jobs and paid salaries and allowances but they were not indemnified by law. This is against the rule of law and unconstitutional. "Nobody questioned the unconstitutional and illegal activities of the then government." On army mutiny, Hossain said: "Army mutiny is an offence of breaching discipline. The penalty for breach of discipline is death sentence by court martial in accordance with Army Act. "The trial for army mutiny can be held under Army Act while the trial for killing will be held in the sessions court under common law." Advocate Toufique Newaz in his arguments said the character of the government, the constitution and the state structure had been changed through the murder of president Mujib. He said there is no scope for a re-trial. "The unconstitutional activities are meant for belittling the constitution. It happened following the killing of Bangabandhu." Newaz urged the court to include these constitutional issues in the ruling. Another special state counsel, Abdul Matin Khosru, in his presentation said the constitution was not halted though indemnity ordinance was issued in 1975. "There is no legal validity that Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed would become president instead of vice president Syed Nazrul Islam and speaker Abdul Malek Ukil. "The culture of indemnity means disrespect to the rule of law, human rights and the constitution. "The government rehabilitated the killers of Bangabandhu. They were given jobs and made opposition leaders in the parliament." Khosru, a former law minister, said: "The state failed to ensure the rule of law. Many judges felt embarrassed to hear the case. But not all embarrassments were real. "There will be no rule of law and democracy if the judiciary does not work properly and the responsibility of the state is not maintained." Another state counsel A F M Mesbahuddin became emotional while presenting his arguments. He said he got out of the house of Sheikh Moni at around 2:30am on Aug 15. "Sheikh Moni was my leader. I have stood here for the trial of the killing with Sheikh Moni's son Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh." Taposh is also one of the lawyers of the state panel. Mesbahuddin said: "Bangabandhu was killed to destroy Bangalees, their culture, values and all institutions. "The nation wants the trial of the killing today. Like the nation, the lawyers also want the trial of the killing. The nation wants to purge the stain. He said: "Some of the defence lawyers were on our side once. Now they are fighting legal battle for the killers." Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for death convicts Syed Frauk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), protested the claim and drew the court's attention. "We are being termed lawyers for the killers before the trial!" He said the law minister had said the rule would be given before Dec 16. "When will you give the ruling? How have we become the counsels for the killers before the trial," Khan Saifur asked. The court said: "Such statement does not deserve admiration. Our eyes are closed..." Khan Saifur said: "I wish your ruling will reflect your views." Earlier, attorney general Mahbubey Alam and chief state counsel in the case Anisul Haque delivered their arguments. The prosecution started its arguments on Nov 2. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaq Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
