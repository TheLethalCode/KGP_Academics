 MOSCOW, Nov 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Dmitry Medvedev called on Russia on Thursday to refocus its economy away from Soviet-era energy and heavy industry toward information technology, telecommunications and space. "We haven't managed to get rid of the primitive structure of our economy," Medvedev said at the start of his second annual address to parliament. "...The competitiveness of our production is shamefully low." Noting that Russia's economy had been much harder hit by the global crisis than other key nation, Medvedev said the country's giant state corporations had "no prospects" and needed overhauling to improve management and competitiveness. Independent auditors should examine them and they should either be closed down or turned into companies with shareholders, he added. "Instead of a primitive economy based on raw materials, we shall create a smart economy, producing unique knowledge, new goods and technologies, goods and technologies useful for people," Medvedev said. "Instead of an archaic society, in which leaders think and decide for everybody, we shall become a society of intelligent, free and responsible people," he added. Vladimir Putin, Russia's most powerful and popular politician, watched Medvedev make his speech from the front row in an elaborately decorated hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. The audience greeted Putin's arrival with a standing ovation. Medvedev is hoping to put a personal stamp on a presidency which has so far stayed in the shadow of Putin, with whom he worked for 18 years and who chose him as his successor. The president emphasized that his ideas drew on an article he published in September calling for change, as well as e-mails and discussions with Russians from all walks of life. Whether the speech will make any real difference to Russia remains to be seen. LOFTY IDEAS Analysts say Medvedev, who is nearing the halfway mark of his four-year term, has so far outlined lofty ideas but failed to make significant improvements to the country's limited democracy, controlled media and woeful human rights record. Most diplomats, officials and ordinary Russians believe Putin, now prime minister and leader of the ruling party, remains firmly in charge and makes all the key decisions, leaving Medvedev largely as a figurehead. Almost all the key Kremlin administration and cabinet appointments are held by Putin loyalists. Policy-making in many areas such as foreign affairs and the economy is indistinguishable from the Putin years. Russian officials say the economic crisis, which hit Russia far harder than other large developing countries, strengthened the hand of nationalist hardliners in the government by undermining the case for Western style capitalism and showing the value of government intervention and state control. Medvedev has frequently spoken of the need to create a 21st century knowledge economy in Russia based on technology and innovation but the past year has seen the government spending billions of dollars propping up failing old-style firms such as AvtoVAZ, the maker of the widely mocked Lada cars. The country's economy remains very weak, with some signs of tentative recovery showing but no prospect of a rapid return to the oil-fueled growth rates of 7-8 percent seen in the Putin presidential years. The Kremlin is heavily preoccupied with social stability and preventing mass unrest amid the crisis, further limiting the scope for bold economic refo
