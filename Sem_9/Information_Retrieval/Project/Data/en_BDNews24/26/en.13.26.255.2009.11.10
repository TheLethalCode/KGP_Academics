 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)--Civil servants are going to get their salary in new pay scale this month ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the finance minister hinted on Tuesday. The new pay structure will be presented in the cabinet on Wednesday for the go-ahead. "I hope the cabinet will approve the new pay scale. If passed, the salary of November will be given under the new scale," A M A Muhith told reporters at the Secretariat. The Eid-ul-Azha will be held at the end of the current month. If the Eid falls at the end of a month, the salary for that month is paid earlier. The Pay Commission was formed in Sep 2008 with former secretary Mostafizur Rahman as its chief. The commission submitted their report to the finance minister in late April, and proposed pay scales for the civil servants ranging from Tk 4,500 to Tk 45,000 per month. The secretary-level committee later revised the proposals and suggested the lowest salary at Tk 4,150 and the highest at Tk 39,000. bdnew
