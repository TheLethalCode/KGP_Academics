<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh airline pilots will highlight their air safety concerns in a regional conference of Asia Pacific aviation officials, to be held in Dhaka from Thursday. A top air official said it was a matter of alarm that International Civil Aviation Authority had recently listed the aviation authority in Bangladesh as a 'Significant Safety Concern'. The three-day regional conference at Sonargaon Hotel will be attended by 51 representatives of the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations (IFALPA) and aviation experts. "The conference will touch on different issues, in particular air safety and technical difficulties facing the sector throughout the region," Captain SM Helal, president of Bangladesh Airline Pilots Association (BAPA), told a press conference Wednesday. He said BAPA would raise the technical barriers at Zia International Airport and difficulties with the air traffic control system of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB). Helal said the Bangladesh air authority already lagged far behind while the rest of the world was trying to develop air safety further. He said the ICAA's recent listing of CAAB as a 'Significant Safety Concern', a major downgrade, was a major issue for Bangladesh to overcome. "In this conference, where CAAB and Bangladesh Biman will also take part, we'll place our concerns on why air safety needs to be strengthened," he added. "The top officials of IFALPA and other aviation experts will be present at the talks, it will be a good forum to discuss the issues, while the Bangladesh air authority may also get the chance to lobby them for support." bd
