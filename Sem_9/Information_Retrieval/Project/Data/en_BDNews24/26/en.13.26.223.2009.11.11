<TITLE> Govt ordered to appoint dropped 27th BCS candidates </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has directed the government to give appointments within three months to 169 civil service candidates, who passed the 27th BCS exams in 2005 but were later disqualified. The bench of justices Miftahuddin Chowdhury and Abu Bakar Siddiqui gave the order on Wednesday on three separate petitions by the 169 candidates. The High Court also ruled that the appointments of the successful candidates of a second round of the 27th Bangladesh Civil Service exams would be upheld. The results of the first 27th BCS exams were published in January 2007. The Public Service Commission cancelled the results, however, on allegations of irregularities and held a fresh round of viva voce exams. Over 1,000 candidates, including the 169 petitioners, were disqualified the second time round. They have been demanding redress since. Senior advocate Abdur Rob Chowdhury represented the petitioners, while additional attorney general Murad Reza, deputy attorney general Md Akram Hossain Chowdhury and assistant attorney general Samarendra Nath Biswas represented the state. Akram Hossain Chowdhury told bdnews24.com after the ruling: "The High Court has declared illegal the cancellation of first viva of the 27th BCS exams." "It has ordered the government to appoint the 169 candidates who challenged the legality of the cancellation," he said. Asked whether the state would appeal against the ruling, he said: "It depends on the government's instructions." The High Court in an earlier ruling, on June 4 this year, had said that the results of the first viva voce exams "had no legal validity". The PSC cancelled the results of the 2005 BCS exams on Jan 21 2007 after the final results came out, on allegations of favouritism and anomalies. The viva voce for those who had passed the written test was re-taken, based on which 1,154 candidates who had passed the first time round were failed the second time. The failed candidates, calling themselves "deprived" and protesting the "unfair treatment", have since been lobbying the authorities to appoint them. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, despite the June 4 High Court order, directed the PSC to take measures to ease the long-standing dispute. A parliamentary subcommittee, on June 14, recommended the PSC provide jobs for the deprived candidates after considering "the legal and ethical aspects of the situation". bdne
