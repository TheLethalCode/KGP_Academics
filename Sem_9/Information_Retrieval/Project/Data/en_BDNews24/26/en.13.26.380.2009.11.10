 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  A long-awaited stimulus package for the apparel industry proposes up to 5 percent cash incentive for new markets. The new markets would be those other than the USA, EU and Canada; the support would be given over the next five years. Five and four percent cash incentives were proposed for the first and second years of exports respectively. The government formed a nine-member working committee on Oct 15 to find ways to help ready made garments and backward linkage industries amid the global recession. "We have prepared a number of recommendations for assisting the garment and textile sectors to boost exports," head of the committee, and former finance minister, M Syeduzzaman told reporters after the committee's first meeting Tuesday. "They must be provided with cash assistance for their products to enter new markets," said Syeduzzaman. The committee also recommends that the government pay Tk 5 lakh renewal fee for gas connections for the next year. It suggested increasing an existing export development fund to Tk 1 crore. It also recommended opportunities for loan re-scheduling without any down payment, until June 2010, for those industries having faced loss in exports, said Syeduzzaman. The committee also backed reduction in bank charges. But, Syeduzzaman said, "Bangladesh Bank and bankers will make the final decision on that." The committee also includes the heads of the major trade bodies. BKMEA president Fazlul Haque was particularly happy with the support for opening up exports to new destinations. Fazlul said, "We are passing through a difficult time. We will be benefited by the expansion of government support this time. However, the hand of support needs to be expanded still more." BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi said, "We are happy with the recommendations, though not all were made in line with our proposals." Bank charges must be reduced immediately, he said. "And export targets will be very difficult to meet if gas and power crises are not solved within the next six months." President of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association Abdul Hai Sharkar said a fund was also suggested, to be jointly contributed by the garments owners and the government, to meet emergencies. BGMEA figures show exports of readymade garment dropped by 9.71% in the first three months of 2009 from the same period last year. September 2009 exports were down 26.93% from the same month last year. The government's total export target for 2009 is $1,760 crore, which is 13% above last year. It is expected that 79.46% of this will come from the garment sector. The government announced an incentive package earlier this year of Tk 3424 crore for export-oriented industries on the recommendations of the recession taskforce, but the garment industry was not included. The government was forced to review the matter on lobbying by leaders of the country's top exporting sector. bdnew
