 Chapainawabganj, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  India's Border Security Force shot dead two cattle traders, thought to be Bangladeshis, at Chapainawabganj's Chouka border on Wednesday, a BDR officer said. Chapainawabganj's 9th Rifles Battalion commander Lt Col Zayed Hossain said Indian border guards fired six rounds at the traders as they were entering Indian territory in the early morning. The two men died on the spot while another two received bullet wounds, Hossain said. BSF recovered the bodies. Identification of the deceased and the injured could not be immediately verified, but they were almost certainly Bangladeshi, Hossain said. Bangladesh Rifles and Border Security Force officials held a flag meeting shortly before midday to decide on return of the bodies, he said. bdn
