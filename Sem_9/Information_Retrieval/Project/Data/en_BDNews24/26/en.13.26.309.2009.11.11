 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet has finally approved a much-anticipated new pay scale for public servants, senior government figures said on Wednesday. Finance minister AMA Muhith will give a press briefing later in the day to announce the new scale, the prime minister's deputy press secretary Mahbubul Haque Shakil said after a four-hour cabinet meeting, ending at 3.20pm. Muhith had hinted the day before that civil servants were likely to get their November salary, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, in line with the new pay scale. "I hope the cabinet will approve the new pay scale. If passed, the November salary will be given under the new scale," he told reporters Two ministers, present at Wednesday's cabinet meeting, told bdnews24.com it had indeed been approved. The Seventh Pay Commission was formed in September 2008. It submitted recommendations to the finance minister in late April, proposing new pay scales for civil servants ranging from Tk 4,500 to Tk 45,000 per month. The secretary-level committee later revised the proposals and suggested the lowest salary at Tk 4,150 and the highest at Tk 39,000. bd
