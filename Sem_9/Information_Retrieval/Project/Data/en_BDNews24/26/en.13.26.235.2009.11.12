 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman disbursed Tk 2 crore among 603 farmers in three upazilas of Sherpur on Thursday. Bangladesh Bank aims to disburse Tk 11,500 crore among farmers in the current fiscal year. The governor handed out the loans from midday to evening to farmers of Pakuria Union in the Sadar Upazila, at Longorpara Union in Shribardy Upazila and Tetultola Union in Jhenaigati Upazila. "Real farmers never received much-needed loans earlier. Loans aimed at farmers went to the wring hands," said Rahman. "So, we have started disbursing loans ourselves in a new initiative so that real farmers can get loans." "Bank officials are publicly handing out the loans after identifying the real farmers through door to door visits," he said. He said GDP growth would cross 6%"despite IMF's forecast"because of the farmers' contribution to the economy. Krishi Bank chairman Ibrahim Khaled and managing director Moktar Hossain, among others, were present at the meeting. bdnews
