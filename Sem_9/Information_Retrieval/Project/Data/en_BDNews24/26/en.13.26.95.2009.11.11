 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserve crossed $10 billion on Wednesday, breaking all previous records. It stood at $10.03 billion, with the addition of an Asian Development Bank loan, the Bangladesh Bank governor told bdnews24.com. The reserve was $9.30 billion on Tuesday, before the addition of ADB's $744 million loan to deal with the global recession and implement public policy reforms. The loan agreement was signed between the government and ADB on Oct 26. Governor Atiur Rahman said high remittance inflow from overseas workers continues to boost the forex reserve. The current reserve was enough to meet import costs for the next seven months, he said. According to economists, a healthy forex reserve should meet at least three months' import expenditure. Bangladesh economists have been warning that inflated reserves may reflect a fall in import of capital machinery and industrial raw materials. But, the governor said, capital machinery imports have been on the rise since September. Rahman said the main reason for the country's strong forex balance was a fall in food imports. "In fact, rice import has dropped to zero," he said. He said fuel prices had also come down on the international market due to the global recession, which also led to lower import costs overall. Meanwhile, Bangladeshi workers abroad remitted over $3.6 billion in the first four months (July-Oct) of the fiscal year, 21.23 percent up on the same period last year. An all-time record for monthly remittance, of $937.9 million, was set in August this year. Bangladesh received $9.7 billion in remittance in 2008-09, and $7.9 billion in 2007-08. Rahman told bdnews24.com, "The sustained rise in remittance flow is a very good sign for our economy." But, the governor has also stressed investment in productive sectors. "If not, inflation might rise," he said last week, as October's remittance figures were revealed. bdnew
