<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)The National Board of Revenue is introducing online income tax payment, just one week after the Bangladesh Bank allowed online transaction. The online system is likely to be introduced from January, NBR chairman Nasiurddin Ahmed said at a news briefing at his office on Thursday. "There will be a system to deduct a particular amount of money from his/her bank account after the taxpayer applies online. They do not need to go to the National Board of Revenue." "We have to proceed through this way to implement the pledge of digital Bangladesh." "We are moving to introduce the online system to resolve the difficulties related to tax at source," he said. Bangladesh Bank on Nov 2 introduced Internet money transfers, allowing online payment of utility bills and other financial transactions with local currency cards. Ahmed said they also moved to provide single registration number containing information on income tax, VAT and customs. Now companies have to collect registration, VAT, TIN certificates from many government offices to get registration for new venture, but the new system will allow them to get everything from one office. It will save at least one month to launch a new company, said Aminur Rahman, investment policy officer of International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's lending arm that is assisting in the project implementation. It takes 45 days under the present system to get registration. On the recovery of income tax stuck in legal tangle, the NBR chief said: "There are 18,000 cases related to income tax due to which some Tk 8,000 crore remain unrealised." In his reply to a query from the reporter of Prothom Alo newspaper about the status of the income tax dodge case against Bashundhara Group, Ahmed said the BR cannot resolve the case. "It will have to be solved through legal procedures." Prothom Alo reported on Wednesday that NBR was attempting to save Bashundhara Group in the tax evasion case. The deadline for submission of income tax return comes to an end on Thursday. NBR member (Customs and VAT) Fariduddin Ahmed said they had received 6.45 lakh income tax returns until Nov 8. The last year's figure was 7.39 lakh. bdnew
