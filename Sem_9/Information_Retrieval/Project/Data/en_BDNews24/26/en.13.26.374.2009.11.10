 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court resumed hearing arguments of the prosecution in the Bangabandhu murder appeals on Tuesday. After the court concluded hearing arguments from state counsel Azmalul Hossain QC, another state counsel, Toufique Newaz, started his presentation at around 11:30am. The five member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began the hearing session for the 27th day at around 9:45am. At the previous hearing, attorney general Mahbubey Alam appealed to the top judges not to administer oath to any power usurpers in a bid to safeguard democracy and the constitution. In his concluding arguments on Monday, Alam also said no judge should be made chief martial law administrator in future. Before Alam, the chief state counsel in the case, Anisul Haque, delivered his arguments. The prosecution started its arguments on Nov 2. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975.
