 Chittagong, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)The shipping ministry suspended four senior Chittagong port officials, including a director, on Wednesday. The ministry order for the temporary suspension came via a letter, said port authorities. Director (transport) Ehsanul Kabir, deputy manager (transport) Golam Sarwar, deputy-chief engineer (mechanical) Ferdous Ahmed and manager (workshop) Md. Shahjahan have been suspended, according to the letter. Another CPA director Muhibul Haque told bdnews24.com that the port authority received the suspension order from the ministry by fax on Wednesday. He said the order had not yet reached the Chittagong Port Authority chairman Commodore RU Ahmed, to take the next step, as he was in Dhaka. The letter will be forwarded to the named officials on Thursday if the chairman's direction is received, Muhibul said. No port officials could give a reason for the suspension. bdnews
