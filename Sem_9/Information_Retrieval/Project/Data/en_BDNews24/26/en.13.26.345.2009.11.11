 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)--Visiting US special envoy for global women's issues, Melanne Verveer, has praised Bangladesh for integrating women into its economy and education. In her address to women MPs on Wednesday, Verveer said women in Bangladesh had contributed immensely to insulate its economy from the global economic crisis. She observed that empowerment of women reduced poverty and corruption. "You are a Muslim-majority country. You have been engaging women in economy, education," Verveer, appointed by president Barack Obama, said at Sonargaon Hotel. "So many women are raising their voice for change," said ambassador who last came to Bangladesh 10 years ago. Women in many Islamic states have little access to education and economy resulting in their subjugation. She referred to a case of a Bangladeshi women who puled her family out of poverty through micro-credit facilities and said spending money on women resulted in the country's overall development. The ambassador said the Asian University for Women will be commissioned in Bangladesh. "We know lots of innovation are taking place here," Verveer said and suggested Bangladesh's women development efforts may be replicated in other parts of the world. She said women workers have turned the informal ready-made garment industry into a formal sector. The ambassador said, "Your growth remained stable at the time of global economic crisis. Women in particular contributed to it. "Empowerment of women reduces corruption too," said Verveer, attributing her comment to findings of a study on women. Verveer came to Bangladesh on Tuesday on a three-day visit. She will meet with government officials, politicians, and business and civil society leaders to discuss a range of bilateral and multilateral issues, with special focus on women's development. In her capacity as director of the US State Department's new office on Global Women's Issues, she coordinates foreign policy issues and activities relating to the political, economic and social advancement of women around the world.
