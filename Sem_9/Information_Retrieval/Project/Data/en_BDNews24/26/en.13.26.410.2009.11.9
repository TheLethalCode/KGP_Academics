 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)Launches were operating again from Monday evening after river transport workers called off a countrywide strike enforced from midnight Saturday. Time keeper at the capital's Sadarghat launch terminal, Alamgir Hossain, told bdnews24.com that MV Panama and MV Tipu-4 left their berths at 6:30pm. MV Saikat -2 started at 6.45pm, and Coco-5 left 15 minutes later. Faruk Hossain, manager of the MV Tipu, said there were very few passengers though the strike had been called off. "I don't think any more launches will leave terminal tonight if there are not enough passengers," he said. River transport workers withdrew the countrywide strike on passenger, goods and fishing vessels after tripartite talks between the shipping secretary, transport owners and leaders of workers Monday afternoon. Negotiations the previous day had failed. Shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader told reporters after Monday's talks that the leaders of workers had agreed to go back to work. He also said a 16-member committee was formed, led by Lokman Hakim Talukder, head of the Directorate of Labour, to prepare recommendations after reviewing the workers' demands, including pay issues. The committee has been asked to report in two months, Hawlader said. Chowdhury Atiqul Alam, general secretary of the Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, who was present in the meeting, said the federation would ask the workers to go back to work immediately. The federation, a coalition of workers unions, enforced the strike from Saturday midnight to press home their 22-point charter of demands, which include a reasonable pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and curbing harassment and robbery on river routes. The strike paralysed river communication on Sunday and most of Monday, stranding thousands of passengers and disrupting transportation of goods. bdnews24
