 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)--The cabinet has tasked the prime minister's security adviser retired major general Tareq Ahmed Siddique with coordinating the intelligence agencies. The political section of the home ministry on Wednesday issued a circular on the cabinet decision, said a senior official of the ministry. The official told bdnews24.com, "The cabinet's fourth meeting on law and order of Oct 29 formed the committee, headed by retired Maj Gen Siddique, to coordinate the agencies' operations. "The circular has been issued to inform the respective ministries about the decision," said the official, who preferred to remain unnamed. A copy of the circular was also sent to the secretary of the prime minister's office. The circular, containing only the name of the head, did not detail the committee's scope of work and authority. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar, however, told bdnews24.com, "This is nothing new. The prime minister gave a verbal directive last March to her security adviser to coordinate the activities of the agencies." "It is a sensitive issue, there should be no misunderstanding here." The prime minister in her speech concluding the third session of parliament on Nov 5 said the government had formed a committee to coordinate the spy agencies to improve security. "We are reactivating the intelligence agencies. Previously, different intelligence agencies used to perform their duties in different ways," the prime minister said. "I have been receiving information from them (the agencies) every 15 days. I will tell nothing more now." Opposition MP Oli Ahmed on the same day asked the government to confine the activities of military's spy outfit DGFI inside the cantonment only. "Then incidents such as the BDR mutiny (Feb 25-26) would not take place in future." "You have to take pre-emptive measures. Strengthen the intelligence agencies, if necessary," he added. Home minister Shara Khatun recently commented that the incidents of Aug 15 and Nov 3, 1975, grenade attack of Aug 21, 2004 and February's BDR carnage stemmed from intelligence failure. bdn
