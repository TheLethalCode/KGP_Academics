<TITLE> Call for DSE chief's head over market slide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)Retail investors staged demonstrations in front of Dhaka Stock Exchange office on Thursday, calling for the bourse chief to resign as sliding share prices saw the biggest single-day fall in more than four months. A group of investors, frustrated by days of price falls, took to the streets around midday blocking the adjacent roads to the Exchange. The demonstrators blamed the slump on DSE president Rakibur Rahman and demanded his resignation. Indices on the prime bourse opened with a positive note but ended the day a massive 39 points down, capping the week's bearish trend as retailers have taken a wait-and-see approach ahead of the debut of the country's largest initial public offering, Grameenphone on Nov 16. The wrath of investors was mainly fuelled by the fall in mutual funds. The demonstrators said the High Court last Sunday held back a ruling given the same day to allow mutual funds to issue rights and bonus shares. The ruling was halted for seven days. The halt was made on a petition by lawyers defending the Securities and Exchange Commission that had barred mutual funds issuing rights and bonus shares through an amendment. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court further stayed the High Court ruling for two weeks upon pleas from SEC lawyers. "This has caused a massive fall in prices of mutual funds, causing hundreds of small-scale investors to burn their fingers," said Nurul Alam, one of the demonstrators. Thursday's trading saw 159 issues out of the 227 traded scrips lose value. Law-enforcers eventually dispersed the protesters who had created a blockade in the city's commercial hub of Motijheel, causing traffic congestion. Extra forces of police and the Rapid Action Battalion were deployed in front of the DSE to avoid further chaos. Meanwhile, the Chittagong Stock Exchange also finished the day in the red. The key index, CSCX, fell 63 points while 105 among 159 traded scrips lost.
