 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Three young entrepreneurs from Bangladesh have been selected to join the Paragon Fellowship 2009. The Foundation for Youth Social Entrepreneurship (FYSE) on Tuesday announced 100 inspiring young entrepreneurs and social Changemakers from 10 countries of the Asia Pacific, including Indonesia, India, China, Pakistan and Nepal, selected for the annual Paragon Fellowship (previously Asia Pacific Future 100).

This year fellows represent 10 countries including India, Indonesia, China, Pakistan, Nepal and Singapore and an astonishing 65 percent of the fellows started social ventures or NGOs.
