 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court on Monday granted CID police a third remand term of three days to question former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in connection with the Aug 21, 2004 grenade blast case. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui denied Babar bail, granting police another three-day remand after investigation officer Abdul Kahhar Akand requested six more days. The court also denied bail to JMB leader Ariful Islam and former founding HuJI leader Sheikh Abdus Salam, also accused in the case. Akand requested 10 and eight day remands respectively for Islam and Salam in the same case. Babar has already been in custody for two remand terms totalling nine days, Salam for one term of six days. Babar, behind bars since March this year serving 17 years for an arms conviction, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Oct 26. The 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. bdnew
