 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The International Cricket Council on Thursday introduced anti-racism and anti-corruption codes in its revised Code of Conduct to maintain and promote "fair play and multiculturalism", reports PTI. The new codes were put in place after a "comprehensive consultation and review process with all stakeholders," the ICC said in a statement. "These codes help to copper-fasten the unique spirit of cricket by effectively laying out what behaviour is acceptable and what is not, not just by players but by everyone involved in the game," said ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat. "These codes are practical, workable and user-friendly while also acting as genuine deterrents to anyone who seeks to undermine the integrity of cricket.

The anti-corruption code, meanwhile, seeks to further empower the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). "It provides important support to the activities of the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) by requiring players to report approaches or invitations to act in a corrupt manner and to co-operate fully with investigations being carried out by the ACSU," the governing body said. "The code sets out a detailed charging and hearing process which preserves the players' right to a fair and impartial hearing before a specifically convened tribunal and a final appeal right to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland," it added. "Players who are found guilty of such offences can expect to serve long suspension periods and face hefty fi
