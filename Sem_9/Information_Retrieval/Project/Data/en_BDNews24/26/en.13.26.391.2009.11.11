 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone shares will hit the prime bourse on Monday Nov 16, as the largest issue in the country's history, the Dhaka Stock Exchange president said Wednesday. Rakibur Rahman told bdnews24.com the date was fixed at a DSE board meeting Wednesday. "Trading of Grameenphone shares will start from next Monday." Chittagong Stock Exchange is also likely to start trading of the scrip the same day, though officials could not confirm. The port city bourse authority handed GP the listing confirmation letter Wednesday at its Dhaka office. There had been widespread speculation the issue would start trading from Sunday Nov 15. "We are all set to start from Sunday but if GP wants, we will start on Monday," AKM Shahroze Alam, manager of CSE's corporate development wing, told bdnews24.com. The Securities and Exchange Commission, on Aug 20, cleared the country's largest mobile-phone operator to float 69,439,400 ordinary shares of Tk 10 each, in addition to a Tk 60 premium per share. The pre-IPO or private placement of Tk 486.07 crore was completed in December last year. The long-awaited initial public offering closed in October, with total subscriptions over three times the issue target. The Tk 4.86 billion offering, the largest of the market to date, opened on October 4, creating a stampede of investors forcing banks to open extra desks to accept all applications. It closed just four days later, on Oct 8, for locals; NRBs had until Oct 18. The record IPO attracted subscriptions worth Tk 17.25 billion from over one million prospective investors. The offer price values the company at only 3.3 times its 2008 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which created a buzz among investors. Norway's telecom giant Telenor owns 62 percent of Grameenphone, launched in 1997, while the local Grameen Telecom owns the rest.
