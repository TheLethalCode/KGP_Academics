 Feni, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  Elections to 300 municipalities will be held in May next year and to 4,500 Union Parishads in all six divisions at the end of September, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Wednesday. Huda also reconfirmed that elections to Dhaka City Corporations would be held in March. The CEC was speaking to reporters after a meeting with leaders of Bangladesh Union Parishad Forum at the Election Commission secretariat. He said the municipal elections would be held simultaneously on a single day next May and Union Parishad polls over six days in September. The CEC last month had suggested different timings for the two sets of polls. In Feni on Oct 22, Huda had said the municipal polls would be in March and elections to UPs in all six divisions at the end of July. He said Wednesday the EC would announce the final schedules for the elections at a favourable time. Parliament passed local government laws pertaining to municipal councils on Sep 14 and to Union Parishads on Oct 6. Among the total 309 municipalities of Bangladesh, voting in nine was held in August last year during the caretaker government's regime. Most of the remaining municipal councils have already run their term. The terms of over 4,500 Union Parishads have also expired. Union Parishad polls were last held in 2003. bd
