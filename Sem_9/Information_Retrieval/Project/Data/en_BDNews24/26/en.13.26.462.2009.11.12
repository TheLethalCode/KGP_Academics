 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)--The government has decided to drop another 293 cases, filed for 'political persecution', the state minister for law has said. The decision came from the ninth meeting of the scrutiny committee for recommendation, Quamrul Islam, also the committee's chairman, told reporters on Thursday. No cases of BNP-led four-party alliance leaders were placed in Thursday's meeting. The committee has so far recommended for cancellation of 1,183 cases filed by the Anticorruption Commission and under Bangladesh Penal Code, he said. Of the total 659 files placed in the meeting, 49 were filed by the ACC while the 610 under the CrPC, Islam said. "Recommendations were made to withdraw 21 cases filed by the ACC and 28 cases have been asked to place in the next meeting for review. "A total of 272 cases under the penal code were recommended for cancellation. Some 25 cases were rejected and 313 cases will be brought in the next meeting," the state minister added. The recommendations to withdraw cases were three cases against businessman Salman F Rahman, one against MP Kamal Ahmed Majumder, one each against former MPs Haji Mohammed Selim and Mizanul Haque, four cases against Khulna mayor Talukder Abdul Khalek, four cases against Manikganj municipality mayor Ramzan Ali Sheikh and one case against Tongi municipality mayor Azmat Ullah. The scrutiny committee in the last meeting recommended dropping one case against opposition chief Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman. Earlier one case against BNP MP Moudud Ahmed was also withdrawn. The Awami League-led government, soon after assuming office in January, announced that it would look into cases filed under past administrations against politicians and others for "political harassment only". The government invited applications seeking cancellation of such cases from February, forming district-level vetting committees and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The deadline for applications was extended three times up to July 12. The scrutiny committee has so far recommended 578 cases to be quashed, and 14 to be partially withdrawn, since its first sitting. Its first meeting, on June 10, recommended withdrawal of 62 cases, including 12 against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. On June 21, it approved another 46 cases to be cancelled. In its third meeting on July 1, the committee recommended quashing another 66 cases. On July 15 it recommended 69 cases be cancelled. On Aug 5, in its fifth meeting, the committee recommended cancellation of 121 cases, on Aug 26, it recommended withdrawal of 105 cases, on Sept 16, 123 cases and on Oct 13 in its eighth meeting it recommended cancellation of another 297 cases. bd
