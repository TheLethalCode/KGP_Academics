<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The newly approved seventh pay scale for public servants will be implemented in two phases, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Wednesday. The scale has been set from a minimum Tk 4,100 to a maximum Tk 40,000 per month, Muhith told reporters, following the cabinet's approval of the long-awaited pay grades. Upgraded salaries will be effective from July this year, while allowances will be implemented in the later phase from next July, he said. Muhith had already hinted Tuesday that civil servants were likely to get their November salary, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, in line with the new scale. In Wednesday's press briefing, he said the government would try to meet that pledge. The minister also said he did not believe the prices of essentials would rise due to salary hikes as in the past. The cabinet finally approved the much-anticipated seventh pay scale in a four-hour meeting Wednesday, and also formed a five-member committee headed by the minister, to resolve any discrimination that might rise. The upgrade will add an average of Tk 2,000 to each grade. The government will have to spend Tk 3,570 crore annually on the new salaries and Tk 2,652 crore for allowances. The Seventh Pay Commission was formed in September 2008. It submitted recommendations to the finance minister in late April, proposing new pay scales for civil servants ranging from Tk 4,500 to Tk 45,000 per month. The committee later revised the proposals and suggested the lowest salary at Tk 4,150 and the highest at Tk 39,000. The new scale The finance minister announced Wednesday a Grade -1 salary will now be Tk 40,000. Grade-2 will range from Tk 33,500 to Tk 39,500. Grade-3 will get between Tk 29,000 and Tk 35,600 and Grade-4 Tk 25,750 to Tk 33,750. Grade-5 will get Tk 22,250 to Tk 31,250, Grade -6 Tk 18,500 to Tk 29,700, Grade -7 Tk 15,000 to Tk 26,200. Grade-8 will get between Tk 12,000 and Tk 21,600; Grade-9 Tk 11,000 and Tk 20,370; and Grade-10 between Tk 8,000 and Tk 16,540. For Grade-11 salaries will be between Tk 6,400 and Tk 14,255, Grade-12 Tk 5,900 and Tk 13,125, Grade-13 Tk 5,500 and Tk 12,095. Grade-14 will draw Tk 5,200 to Tk 11,325, Grade-15 Tk 4,900 to Tk 10,450, Grade-16 Tk 4,700 to Tk 9,400. Grade-17 will be Tk 4,500 to Tk 9,095, Grade-18 Tk 4,400 to Tk 8,580, Grade-19 Tk 4,200 to Tk 8,140, while the minimum salary will be between Tk 4,100 and Tk 7,740. The minister said, "Discrimination is often seen when pay scales are upgraded and there are methods to resolve that." "A committee has been formed to face the situation, which I will head." Pensions up 40 pc Pensions across the board will increase 40 percent on average and 50 percent for those aged over 65, Muhith said. Gender discrimination over pension has also been resolved. Earlier, only wives of deceased public servants would get pensions, not the husbands. Medical allowance has been increased to Tk 2,000 from Tk 500, said the minister. The judiciary will get a separate pay scale, with district judges under the Judicial Service Commission receiving a maximum salary in line with Grade-3 of the new scale. They will also get a special clothing allowance. Muhith said, "They will be provided the special allowance considering their responsibility, which is 30 percent of their salaries every five years." Perks for the police and other forces will also be increased in line with the new pay, he added. Salaries and allowances for military will also be upgraded. "Pension for their families has also been increased," he said. Muhith also said teachers enlisted under MPO will be paid according to the new scale. "But there'll be a separate scale for all teachers in future. We think their salaries should be determined separately," he added. Citing difference of salaries for nurses with and without diploma, he said, "Their scale will be determined according to qualifications." Regarding a possible hike of essential prices in wake of the newly announced salaries, the minister said it would not happen. "We're not concerned as the media has already been carrying reports about the new pay scale and the prices are not increasing," he said. bdn
