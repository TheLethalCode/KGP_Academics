 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh has made considerable progress in the US government's just-released Millennium Challenge Corporation scorecards, gaining "impressively" in governance indicators among others. The country advanced in eight out of 17 indicators weighted by the MCC, a statement issued by the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington said on Wednesday. The MCC is a US government corporation designed to reduce global poverty through the promotion of sustained economic growth. The 2010 MCC scorecards reflect the performance of 86 developing countries that were seeking grant assistance for the current fiscal year. "Bangladesh gained impressively in the broader category of governance and economic freedom," said the statement. The report said Bangladesh had moved upward in political rights from 33 percent in 2009 to 60 percent in 2010, an impressive progress by 27 percent, said the statement. Matching the progress in civil liberties, Bangladesh made progress from 46 percent in 2009 to 53 percent in 2010, it said. In rule of law in 2009 Bangladesh received 57 percent in contrast to 60 percent in 2010. In "investing in people category", Bangladesh's immunization rates jumped from 70 percent in 2009 to 75 percent in 2010, the said statement. In national resource management sub-category under the same category of "investing in people", Bangladesh made good progress in sub-category trade policy as she attained 8 percent this year compare to last year's achievement of 4 percent. However, Bangladesh's achievement in the category of investing in people needs future boost for better outcome in the future.
