 Rajshahi, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--Fifty-two men, one of them Rajshahi correspondent of private TV station ATN Bangla, on Monday faced extortion and torture charges. All accused, including reporter Sujauddin Chhoton, were alleged to be members of banned militant outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh. Mariam Mun Manjuri at Senior Judicial Magistrate's Court-1, Rajshahi, received the charges against 52 pressed by complainant Abdul Jalal, who lives at Uttar Sajuria in Bagmara Upazila. The case alleges that the accused demanded Tk 50, 000 from Jalal after he had gone to sell fish at Shikdari Haat of Bagmara Upazila on Apr 26, 2004. They later intercepted him on his way home, robbed him of Tk 17,000 and beat him up with iron rods, hockey sticks, for the rest of the money. He was, at one stage, taken to banned Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh's leader Siddiqur Rahman 'Bangla Bhai's torture cell in Tamjan Koya's house at Hamirkutsa in Bagmara Upazila. The accused handed over Jalil to police after framing him in a 'false case' the following day after overnight torture. They even threatened him with death in case he filed any case against them. Jalal also pointed out in the case that he had delayed in pressing the charges as some of top militant kingpins had been arrested and executed. RAB arrested six of the top leaders of JMB in 2005, four of them were executed on Mar 29, 2007, for the killing of two judges in Jhalakathi and for the Aug 2005 bombings. Officer in charge at Bagmara Police Station said he has heard about the charges, and will take necessary steps after receiving the court order. bdn
