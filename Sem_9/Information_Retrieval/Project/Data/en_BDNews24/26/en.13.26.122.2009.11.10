 Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The number of BTCL customers could not reach even 1,000 though the high-speed broadband internet service was launched seven months ago. To increase the number of customers, the state-owned Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd (BTCL), has now introduced three new packages and reduced charges for its other packages. BTCL managing director engineer S M Khairuzzaman regretted that the present strength of BTCL subscribers is below 1,000 though the big cities have the connection capacity for 33,000 high-speed broadband lines. He told bdnews24.com, "Along with land phones, BTCL, with the objective of giving value added services, has introduced three new packages at reduced prices." A meeting of the board of BTRCthe telecom regulatory bodyapproved the new packages and reduced call charges being introduced by BTCL. He further claimed that compared with other services, the new BTCL packages would provide scope for downloading data up to two gigabytes with a speed of 128 kbps at Tk 300 only. "Last April, BTCL introduced its high-speed broadband internet service along with land phone dial-up connections. This internet service is given in five packages under the 'adsl plus2' technology," said the BTCL MD. BTCL started giving the broadband connections to Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla, Jessore, Rajshahi, Bogra, Khulna, Barisal and Mymensingh. An official concerned, preferring not to be named, said, "Because of lack of effective steps for marketing and also the absence of publicity, this service could not earn popularity among customers." He said, "Compared with other internet service providers, BTCL's improved high-speed broadband internet service remained unnoticed by customers." If publicity is properly done, BTCL will have a terrific market for its broadband internet service, he observed. "Though we are offering a qualitatively better broadband service at a competitive price, we are yet to attract customers," admitted BTCL managing director Khabiruzzaman. "That is why the new packages have been introduced with reduced charges." Under the new pre-paid packages, customers can download 2 gigabytes at a speed of 128 kbps at Tk 300, 8 gigabytes with 256 kbps at Tk 1,200 and 16 gigabytes with one megabyte speed at Tk 2,400. BTCL charges only Tk 500 as registration fee and Tk 600 taka as setup configuration cost. BTCL has two packages for day and night. For the daytime (from 8am to 8pm), the charge for 128 kbps is Tk 2,100, for 256 kbps the charge is Tk 4,500 and for 2,000 kbps the cost is Tk 6,000all for a three-month period. For night-time (8 pm to 8am), the charge is Tk 3,000 for three months for 512 kbps, Tk 4,500 for 1000 kbps and Tk 7,200 for 2,000 kbps. Registration fee is only Tk 300 for these two packages and Tk 500 is setup configuration charge. On the other hand, unlimited postpaid connection charges were also reduced, BTCL officials informed. Under re-fixed rates, the charge is Tk 800 for 128 kbps, Tk 1,200 for 256 kbps and Tk 2,000 for 512 kbpsall for three months. If any customer pays three months' charges at a time, a bonus for free internet use will be given for an additional one month. bd
