 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday stayed the admission exams to six Dhaka University departments for three months, on a petition filed by five Aleem candidates. Lawyer for the petitioners, Belayet Hossain, told bdnews24.com that the written and viva exams for admission to six departmentsBangla, English, Mass Communication and Journalism, International Relations, Women and Gender Studies and Linguistics under 'Kha' and 'Gha' units have been stayed for three months. The High Court bench of justices Tarique-ul-Hakim and Moinul Islam gave the university four weeks to explain why the admissions criteria of passing 100-mark exams each in Bangla and English at HSC or equivalent level should not be declared discriminatory. The High Court on Jan 20 declared that the criteria for admission to certain DU departments were unlawful, on a petition by madrasah students. The petition said Aleem exams, though comprising only 50 marks each for Bangla and Englsih papers, were given official recognition as being equivalent to HSC exams in 1986. But the DU authority on Sept 6 last year added a criterion saying that students who have not passed HSC or equivalent exams of 100 marks each in English and Bangla would not be eligible to take the admission tests for selected departments. bd
