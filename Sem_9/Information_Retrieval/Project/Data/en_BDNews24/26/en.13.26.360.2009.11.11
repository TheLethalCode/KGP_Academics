 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Wednesday granted Criminal Investigation Department police five days to grill accused HuJI member Abdul Majid in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. Majid was shown arrested in the case based on information of another accused Sheikh Abdus Salam, a former founding leader of Harkatul Jihad al-Islami (HuJI), now head of the Islamic Democratic Party. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui granted the five-day to CID police, who requested ten days. The police remand report said Majid was arrested from Uttara in possession of arms on Jan 6 this year, and has been behind bars since.
