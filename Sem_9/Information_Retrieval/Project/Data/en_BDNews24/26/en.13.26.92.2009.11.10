"It is not easy for us to diversify the market overnight and make up the loss so we shall have to wait for some time," he said. The finance minister was hopeful of economic growth of more than 7 percent in the fiscal year ending March, 2011. "Maybe in 2012 we will be able to reach the magic figure (of 9-10 percent growth)," he said. Policymakers including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have pressed the case for keeping easy fiscal and monetary policies in place to nurture growth. "This cannot continue for a long period of time," Mukherjee said, referring to the exit from easy fiscal policy.
