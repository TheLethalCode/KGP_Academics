 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper, Rashid Latif, has admitted he claimed a catch against Bangladesh batsman Alok Kapali in Multan in 2003 even though he knew he hadn't taken it cleanly, according to media reports. Pakistan went on to win the Test by a slender one-wicket margin but Latif, then the captain, was banned for five games by the match referee for that incident, reports Cricinfo.

"I dived, took the catch, rolled over and then just threw the ball to Inzamam." Latif, who stepped down as Pakistan captain following the series, is currently in Dhaka to attend a Level III coaching course conducted by the Asian Cricket Council and Cricket Australia in collaboration with the Bangladesh Cricket B
