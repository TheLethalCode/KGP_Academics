 STOCKHOLM, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Phelps said he was "not in the best shape" after finishing third in the short course 100 metres medley final at a World Cup meeting in the Swedish capital on Tuesday. American Phelps, who won a record eight Olympic gold medals last year, ended a disappointing day by clocking 52.14 seconds, 0.37 behind South African winner Gerhard Zandberg.

Phelps is entered for another two races on Wednesday in Stockholm, after which he will compete in Berlin at the weeke
