 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police is being digitally equipped from this month, for a more effective and modern crime fighting force, officials say. WiMAX wireless technology is being installed at each of the city's police stations for better communications to quash crime and terror in the capital. Additional deputy commissioner (public relations) of DMP Walid Hassan told bdnews24.com Tuesday the state-of-the-art wireless communication will empower the police to counter crime with a blitzkrieg. "New digital technology will let two officers communicate one-to-one ensuring secrecy before a surprise raid," he said. The police control room or headquarters will be able to monitor the position of a specific case too, with the new wireless device, he added. Besides, top officials at the headquarters would be able to conduct video conferencing and quiz any detained person at any of the police stations, he added. Assistant commissioner (public relations) Shyamol Mukharjee said, "With the help of close circuit cameras being set up at some 155 spots around the city will allow police to supervise traffic jam and know the status of the traffic flows at specific areas." Each police station will have eight more CCTV cameras that should them to monitor the situation under their jurisdiction, he said. Hassan said, "A database will also be developed at each police station where information about crime and criminals will be readily available. As a result, all the background of a detained can be found instantly as soon as one is held." An internal network sight-board would also be set up at police stations displaying photographs, identity, details of crime and information gathered after quizzing when an accused is held, he added. The new digital gadgets would help the police force a lot to come to grips rising crime, said Hossain, adding the facilities would start to be installed within this month. Meanwhile, an eight-day training programme on WiMAX was conducted recently where 34 police officers were trained. There would be similar training for other officials in the next phase, Hossain added. bd
