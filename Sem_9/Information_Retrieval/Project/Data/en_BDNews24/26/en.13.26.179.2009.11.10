 Dhaka, November 10 (bdnews24.com)  Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has called for introduction of school buses to curb traffic pressures in the capital. Nahid, in a meeting with school officials Tuesday, said the government would also give support to the initiative, while BRTC officials agreed to look into leasing vehicles to schools. "Parking cars in front of schools should be prohibited," Nahid said at the meeting to review new school timings. "The schools should use larger vehicles for students to replace cars." He suggested schools either lease large buses from BRTC or buy them. "The schools can take loans from the bank or their own funds for the purpose." State minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanok, education secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, chairman of BRTC Iqbal Hassan and members of BRTA and traffic police were among those present at the meeting. Iqbal Hassan said BRTC has enough buses to lease out to schools. "If the schools apply for them, the authority will take the necessary steps," he said. Schools authorities, meanwhile, informed the meeting that children and parents are facing some problems due to new timings announced last month by the government. Nahid said schools in Dhaka would be allowed some leeway in the coming winter with respect to the new time schedules. But they cannot clash with office timings. "The decision to give schools some flexibility was made considering the problems," said Nahid. In an effort to curb traffic gridlock in the city, the government announced new school, office and bank timings last month. Primary and kindergarten schools are running from 9:30am to 4:15pm. Secondary, higher secondary and English-medium schools start between 7am to 8:30am and end between 1:00pm to 2:30pm. bdne
