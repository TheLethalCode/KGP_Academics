<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)The Criminal Investigation Department on Wednesday questioned an army officer in connection with the sensational 10-truck arms haul case. Major general Enamur Rahman Chowdhury appeared at the CID office at Dampara at around 10am. A investigation team led by the senior assistant superintendent of police Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, also the investigation officer of the case, began quizzing him from 11am. It ran into afternoon. CID's SSP for Chittagong region Mohammad Muslim told bdnews24.com, "We are done with questioning Enamur Rahman for today. We might call him later, if needed. "We are questioning him about whether the report submitted by the government probe committee was biased or whether there was pressure from the then government's top level." Gen Enam was a member of five-strong probe committee, headed by former home secretary Omar Faruq, that former BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government formed to investigate the case. He had directed national spy outfit National Security Intelligence with the rank of brigadier general when police seized 10 truckloads of weapons and ammunition on the night of April 1, 2004 from the restricted jetty of CUFL. Former NSI chief retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, who also sat on the government probe committee, is now in prison. CID has already quizzed three other committee members-Omar Faruq, former DIG Farrukh Ahmed and former DIG (special branch) Shamsul Islam. bd
