 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has halted a High Court order that asked the police to interrogate Dhaka City Corporation commissioner Ariful Islam Arif at the jail gate in the case regarding the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. The stay order has cleared the barrier for CID police to remand Arif in custody for questioning. The Appellate Division chamber judge, justice Mohammed Mozammel Hossain, put a two-week freeze on the High Court order. The Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Monday granted a five-day remand but on Tuesday the High Court ordered CID police to interrogate Arif at the jail gate. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. b
