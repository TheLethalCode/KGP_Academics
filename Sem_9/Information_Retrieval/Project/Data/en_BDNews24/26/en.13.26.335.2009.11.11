 HANOVER, Germany, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While police continue to investigate the apparent suicide of German national keeper Robert Enke, the country's soccer federation called off training for Saturday's friendly against Chile, putting the match in doubt. On Tuesday evening, the 32-year-old Enke died when he was hit by an express train running between Hamburg and Bremen at a crossing near Hanover.

Hundreds of fans were gathered outside the Hanover stadium and club offices on Wednesday, leaving flowers and lighting candles in Enke's memory. "We loved him.
