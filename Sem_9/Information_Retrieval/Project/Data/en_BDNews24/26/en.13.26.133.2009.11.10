<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) - The cabinet on Monday directed the home ministry to update the BDR Act of 1972 for trial of February's Peelkhana mutiny. The cabinet was unable to decide on future military trial of border guards for acts of mutiny or killing like those at the BDR headquarters in Peelkhana, as the law minister was away. The regular meeting presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina at her office discussed the issue, deputy press secretary of the prime minister Mahbubul Huq Shakil told reporters after the meeting. He said, "Today's meeting was supposed to give a final decision for the trial under military law for future acts of mutiny like those at the BDR headquarters in Peelkhana, and issuance of a gazette notification on this matter by the home ministry under Section 5 (1) of the Army Act 1952." "The decision will be taken after detailed discussions in his presence once (law minister Shafique Ahmed) returns home," Shakil said. The home ministry, meanwhile, has been asked to update the existing BDR Act of 1972, for upcoming trial of the February mutiny, he said. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. The law minister said last month that the BDR mutiny trial would start at the beginning of November after the constitution of separate courts in the six divisions by the border force's chief. Future acts of killing in any regular force, such as the ones at the BDR headquarters in Peelkhana, will be held under military law, the law minister also said. The cabinet on Monday also saw finance minister AMA Muhith present a report on Bangladesh's participation in the meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers on Oct 14-16 in Tanzania and the annual meeting of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. A report on the meeting of commerce ministers of least developed countries (LDCs) was also discussed in the meeting. The cabinet adopted a proposal to congratulate the national cricket team, its coach and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials for the recent victory over Zimbabwe in the five match one-day internationals series. bdnews
