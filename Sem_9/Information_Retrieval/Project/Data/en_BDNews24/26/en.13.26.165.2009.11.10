 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said 10 percent ADP implementation during the first quarter was "quite satisfactory", according to the planning secretary. At the same time, she directed government officials to reinforce field-level monitoring for speedier execution. Planning secretary Habibullah Majumder briefed the press after an ECNEC meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday, focusing on ADP progress. "The prime minister said 10 percent implementation of the Annual Development Programme during July-September period of the current fiscal year is quite satisfactory," Majumder told reporters. "But she said it needs more momentum so that 100 percent of ADP projects are complete by the end of the current fiscal year." The planning ministry's Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division placed a report at the meeting on ADP progress. According to the report, 10 percent of projects were completed in the first quarter and 25 percent of total ADP allocation was released during the period. The current ADP allocation totals Tk 30,500 crore, up from last year's Tk 25,600 crore. It includes 886 projects of which 664 are investment projects, 163 technical assistant projects and 59 Japanese loan-free assistant projects. The report also said 19 out of 48 ministries with ADP projects marked more than 10 percent implementation rate and the remaining 29 registered below 10 percent. The ECNEC meeting also approved one fully state funded project for 'Madaripur-Agorchara Road Extension and Development Work' at a cost of Tk 31 crore. bd
