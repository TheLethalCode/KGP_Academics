 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission on Thursday pressed charges in court against Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of the opposition chief Khaleda Zia, in a money laundering case. The ACC filed the case on Mar 17 with the Kafrul Police Station, accusing Coco of laundering 28, 84, 000 Singapore dollars and 9, 32, 000 US dollars. The charges have been submitted to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Thursday afternoon. Earlier, ACC deputy director Abu Sayeed confirmed to bdnews24.com the approval of the filing of the charges. Sayeed is also the investigation officer of the case. The case details say the amount was deposited to a Singapore bank account of Coco by foreign companies that were to be awarded construction work in Bangladesh during the rule of Khaleda's 2001-2006 administration. In the event of a guilty finding, Coco will face a maximum seven years in jail. Some 23 persons have been made prosecution witnesses. Ismail Hossain Simon, son of former BNP shipping minister Akbar Hossain, is another accused in the case. The investigation officer appealed to the court to issue arrest warrant against Simon. The government on Thursday extended by another month the parole of Coco. Coco, also an accused in the GATCO corruption case alongside his mother, and facing other graft cases, fell ill during detention in prison during the past caretaker government's tenure. He was paroled on July 17 last year for eight weeks for medical treatment abroad and flew to Bangkok two days later. The government has since successively extended Coco's parole by a month each time. bdnews24
