 MUMBAI, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan has returned from a lengthy injury layoff to spearhead India's attack in this month's Test series against Sri Lanka. The experienced bowler underwent shoulder surgery in July after damaging his shoulder during the Indian Premier League earlier this year, although he did play in the Twenty20 World Cup in England in June. The 31-year-old Zaheer was named by India's selectors on Tuesday to lead a six-man bowling attack in the first two matches of a three-Test series starting in Ahmedabad on Nov 16. Despite missing several one-day series and the Champions Trophy in South Africa, Zaheer has proved his fitness and form in domestic competition. India, who last played a Test match during the tour of New Zealand in April, also recalled temperamental paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth to form a three-pronged pace attack with Zaheer and Ishant Sharma. Left-arm Pragyan Ojha was selected as a third spinner along with the experienced Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra. Sri Lanka arrived on Sunday to play three Tests, five one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games over two months. The visitors, ranked number two behind South Africa in the official Test rankings, have not won any of the 14 matches they have played in India since their first Test visit in 1982. The second Test will be played in Kanpur from Nov 24-28 and the final Test in Mumbai from Dec 2-6. Squad: Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Murali Vijay, Pragyan Ojha, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Subramaniam Badri
