 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) A landmark interactive e-documentary went online Monday exposing "the tragic impact of climate change" on a small village in Bangladesh and the devastation wreaked by Cyclone Aila on the community earlier this year. 'Gabura: From Daily Life to Disaster', released by Oxfam in partnership with the Guardian newspaper, enables the audience to experience stories from all walks of life in the small community of Gabura before and after the cyclone hit the area. Featuring extraordinary footage of the cyclone's trail of destruction, the e-documentary allows the audience to choose its own journey through the community and to be immersed in the lives of local residents. The work captures the shocking moment when Cyclone Aila swept over the region in May this year, killing hundreds and causing chaos and devastation for the community. It also shows the stark reality of climate change and the impact is has had on the lives of residents, says Oxfam. From widows whose husbands were killed by starving tigers, to farm girls blighted with skin afflictions from rising salt levels in the water, the people's voices are captured in a unique way. Director Sandhya Suri said: "This explorable documentary bears witness to the devastation wreaked by one catastrophic event and the everyday disasters created by climate change in a new and innovative format." "It also provides a rare, visceral experience of what it is like for a small impoverished community to suffer a disaster - from the hours before the cyclone hits, to the horrific impact itself and its devastating aftermath." Oxfam, one of Britain's largest charities, is launching the e-documentary ahead of crucial UN talks on climate change in Copenhagen in December. The charity is calling on the world's most powerful leaders to negotiate a deal that prevents dangerous global temperature rises and protects the world's poor, who all too often bear the brunt of climate change's deadly impact but are least responsible for causing it. It also comes as Oxfam is encouraging people to join the UK's biggest ever climate change march, called The Wave, in London and Glasgow on December 5 to demand that the UK government pushes for the right deal at Copenhagen. Barbara Stocking, Oxfam's chief executive, said: "With this remarkable online documentary, Oxfam has broken new ground to tell the world that climate change is real, it costs lives, and that we can help to combat its effects. "But while the medium is different our message remains the same, that now more than ever we need a deal at Copenhagen to aid those affected by climate change, and we need the public to help make it happen."
