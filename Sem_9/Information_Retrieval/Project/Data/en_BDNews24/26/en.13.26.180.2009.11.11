<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)Chief state counsel Anisul Haque has vehemently opposed the defence's plea for commuting death penalties in the Bangabandhu murder trial, arguing that in that event, the crime would be condoned. "There is no scope of commuting penalty of the convicts. If it is done, the crime would be condoned," he told the Supreme Court at the 28th day's hearing in the Bangabandhu murder appeals on Wednesday. Haque countered the contentions of the defence that the death penalties for the convicts should be reduced to life imprisonment since they have been languishing in jail for long. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began the hearing session at around 9:45am. It ended at around 1:30pm. "Innocent women, children and everybody's beloved Bangabandhu were killed on Aug 15. So there is no chance of reducing penalty of the convicts," Haque said. The court asked barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for death convicts Bazlul Huda and A K M Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer), to not present distorted facts when he had again spoke of army mutiny. It also observed that no charges for mutiny were framed in the case. Mamun also demanded a re-trial of the case. The prosecution wrapped up their arguments at the Wednesday's hearing. Mamun also finished his reply to the arguments. Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for convicts Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), and Abdur Rezzak Khan, lawyer for appellant Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, will deliver their arguments on Thursday. Anisul Haque said the trial of mutiny in the killing of president Ziaur Rahman has been held, not the trial of the killing. "The murder case regarding the event is still pending the trial of the trial court. Military ruler Gen Zia was killed in a coup staged by renegade army officers on May 30, 1981. He said: "We always want proper justice. We have made the killers face trial. This is the duty of the state. There is no room for pardon and compassion for the convicts. "The Aug 15 killing shook democracy. The nature of the government and the philosophy of the state have been changed. It also changed the course of history. "So no punishment less than death sentence can suffice here," Haque said.. The court asked him to reply to the defence point on reducing penalty of the convicts on the grounds that they had been behind bars for long. The chief state counsel cited the rules and laws of the Appellate Division to say: "The 10-year old Russel (youngest son of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) was killed that day. Three helpless women were victim to murder, of whom one was pregnant." Sheikh Mujib's wife Fazilatunnessa Mujib, daughters-in-law Sultana Kamal and Rosy Jamal, nephew Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni's preganant wife Arzu Moni were killed among others on Aug 15, 1975 Citing examples of the ruling higher courts of many countries he said: "There is no penalty without death sentence in cases where popular and innocent people are killed. "Our tears have dried up, but the hearts still bleed. "We wish nobody endures the pains and sufferings of awaiting trial and sees judges embarrassed." "The pain of waiting and offence of negligence have upset us. But we did not lose faith in the rule of law." Haque concluded his arguments pleading for a proper trial in the Appellate Division in line with article 104 of the constitution. Defence counsel Abdullah Al Mamun in his arguments said the third High Court bench should have analysed the whole ruling of the two-member High Court bench. He said: "As the president Bangabandhu was commander-in-chief of the army. "Bangabandhu told army chief Gen KM Shafiullah by phone that his house had been under attack and asked him to take action. "Since Shafiullah took no action it proved that he was involved with the event." The court asked Mamun not to deliver any distorted information. "No witnesses in their statements said about Shafiullah's involvement," it said. Mamun said: "Shafiullah did not obey the supreme command which proves that he was involved with army uprising that day." The court said: "It was not told in Gen Shafiullah's statement and the statements of the witnesses." Mamun said: "The prosecution said no mutiny was held." The court again asked him not to provide distorted information. Presenting statements of two witnesses, Mamun said: "Army mutiny took place that day. Shafiullah neglected his duty. The trial of the case should be held again. The court said: "We are not trying Gen Shafiullah. We are holding trial of the killing event. No charge was framed regarding army mutiny in the case." Mamun said: "The trial of retired army officers can be held under common law. But the trial of the army officers will be held under Army Act. "The convicts have been deprived of proper justice since two trials were not held regarding Aug 15 event. "The trial has become invalid as it was held under general law. "After expressing allegiance at radio station, Gen Shafiullah went to the cantonment before going to the Bangabhaban. He is also involved with the 'rebellion'. That's why the trial should be held again." The court asked him whether the trial should be held under the military law. Mamun said: "We want trial in accordance with law, we want a re-trial. "The prosecution's point that the conspiracy was plotted after killing was not right. The conspiracy was for toppling the government, not for killing." Presenting statements of four witnesses he said convicts Abdur Rashid, Syed Faruk Rahman and Shariful Haq Dalim in their speeches in Balurghat talked about ousting the government. Convicts cannot be handed down sentence until their crime is proved beyond doubt, he said. The court said: "You are delivering statements for the media, not for the court." Mamun claimed that relatives of the convicts could not come to the court after the bomb attack on Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, an MP and one of the state lawyers. They cannot be contacted either, he said. Presenting the provisions of the constitutions of Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama and Bangladesh, Mamun said: "The convicts have been suffering ordeals of death since the verdict of trial court. "As per the constitution a convict cannot be detained and tortured for a long time. Under this circumstance the penalty of the convicts can be reduced to life imprisonment," he said. The arguments in the Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing began on Oct 15 after completion of presentation of paper book. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaq Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
