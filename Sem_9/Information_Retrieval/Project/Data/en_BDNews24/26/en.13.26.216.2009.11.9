 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hossain has said that they will write to parliamentary affairs ministry to declare Bhola-3 constituency vacant. He told journalists of the decision after a meeting of the Election Commission headed by chief election commissioner A T M Shamsul Huda on Monday. The meeting discussed the court ruling. Awami League's Jashimuddin, a retired major, was elected from the constituency beating another retired major, Hafizuddin Ahmed, of BNP in the Dec 29 polls last year. Hossain said, "The parliamentary affairs ministry has received a copy of the High Court's verdict. We have got another copy. It was decided in the meeting to write a letter asking the ministry to publish a gazette declaring Bhola-3 constituency vacant." He said, "Bye-election will be held within 90 days of the gazette publication." The election commissioners sat in a meeting on Monday morning, to take directives regarding the HC ruling. The High Court on Feb 26 declared Jasim's nomination unlawful after Hafiz filed a writ petition on Dec 17 to declare Jasim's nomination illegal. Jasim moved the Supreme Court on July 13 to overturn the verdict but the top court on Oct 18 upheld the HC ruling, leaving the Bhola-3 vacant. The electoral law stipulates that none can contest the polls in three years from the date of retirement and in five years after compulsory retirement. Jashimuddin was forced to retire on Aug 31, 2004. The EC said Jasim's application was validated following the opinion of judge advocate general (JAG) Lt Col Mohammed Aziz Ahmed after the chief election commissioner sought opinion. The JAG told the EC that Jasim's retirement had not been a mandatory one. b
