<TITLE> German corpse 'may be Luxemburg' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, May 30 (bdnews24.com) An unidentified corpse found in the basement of a Berlin hospital could be that of revolutionary left-wing icon Rosa Luxemburg murdered 90 years ago. A German pathologist said the headless corpse "bore striking similarities to the real Rosa Luxemburg", the BBC reported on Saturday quoting German media. Luxemburg was killed by right-wing paramilitaries in 1919 at the age of 47 and thrown into an icy canal. A body thought to have been hers was later retrieved and buried. The grave, in Berlin's Freidrichsfelde cemetery, has since become a place of pilgrimage for communists, feminists and left-wing activists. Forensic pathologist Michael Tsokos, who discovered the body at Berlin's Charite Hospital, said that he doubted that the body in the grave was Luxemburg's. He pointed to several inconsistencies in the post mortem examination carried out on that body. These included the fact that the post mortem report made no mention of the hip defect or differing leg lengths which gave Luxemburg a limp throughout her life. Luxemburg is believed to have died from a shot to her head, but the corpse buried at Freidrichsfelde cemetery showed no signs of a bullet in the skull. In contrast, the body which Tsokos discovered showed signs of being waterlogged, according to Der Spiegel magazine. Tests also show it was a woman aged between 40 and 50, who had legs of different lengths. Tsokos told German news agency DDP there had been rumours for many years that Luxemburg's body was hidden in the hospital. He said he had been searching for DNA samples to test against the body since he found it. Murat Cakir, a spokesman for the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, told a local paper it was "conceivable that the authorities at the time made sure [the body] would disappear". "But it's also disturbing that her body could have been in a hospital cellar for the last 90 years," he said. "We hope that the identity of the body is clarified as soon as possible so that whoever it may be will finally be laid to rest." Cakir said that when and if the identity of the corpse was discovered, Luxemburg's legacy would not be affected. "The world over she is thought of as a revolutionary forward thinker  and she will always be this, regardless of where her body rests," he said.
