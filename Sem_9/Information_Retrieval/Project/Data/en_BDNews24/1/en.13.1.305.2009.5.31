 KARACHI, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan are confident that a tough conditioning camp and psychological counseling will make up for a lack of playing time and prepare the team for a serious assault on the Twenty20 World Cup in England. The Pakistan squad departed for next month's tournament on Saturday with coach Intikhab Alam advocating the strength of careful preparation going into the second edition of the 12-nation event.

The Pakistan coach said his team had some very experienced players who had the ability to adjust quickly to English conditions. "I don't think that would be a problem. What we must guard against is complacency, because no opponent can be taken lightly," he said. Alam added Pakistan's strength lay in its varied bowling attack and they had the pace bowlers to exploit pitches in England. Pakistan are in Group B along with hosts England and the Netherla
