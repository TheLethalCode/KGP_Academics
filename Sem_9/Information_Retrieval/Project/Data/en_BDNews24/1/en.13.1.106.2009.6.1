 SRINAGAR, Mon Jun 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry protesters clashed with troops in Kashmir on Monday, injuring dozens in ongoing anti-India protests over the rape and murder of two Muslim women, police and witnesses said. Offices and businesses were shut as a strike called by the separatists crippled activity on Monday, the third day of protests in Kashmir, where near daily street protests since last year are giving new life to a separatist movement. Residents said the two women, aged 17 and 22, were abducted, raped and killed by security forces on Friday in Shopian town, 60 km (37 miles) south of Srinagar. Authorities denied the killing and said the women drowned in a stream. A police statement on Saturday said a postmortem conducted revealed no marks of violence. "We assure that truth about Shopian incident in which two women were found dead, will be brought to the fore within 48 hours," Ali Mohammad Sagar, Kashmir's rural development minister, said in a statement. Sagar called for restraint and warned people not to take the law into their own hands after protesters ransacked government vehicles and damaged buses. The strike called by Kashmir's main separatist alliance, All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, also closed schools, colleges and many government offices in Kashmir. In Srinagar, the focus of a 20-year insurgency that has killed tens of thousands, most of the streets were deserted except for security patrols on the roads. The strike call was backed by Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, blamed by India for last year's Mumbai attacks. "Lashkar-e-Taiba and Kashmiri people have resolved to continue struggle against Indian forces and protect the chastity of Kashmiri women," the group's spokesman, Abdullah Gaznavi, said in a statement. Indian security forces fighting separatist militants in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, have been accused in the past of human rights violations, including rape and extrajudicial killings. Authorities deny any systematic violations and say all reports are investigated and the guilty punished. More than 47,000 people have been killed in the region since a revolt against New Delhi's broke out in 1989. Separatists put the toll at 100
