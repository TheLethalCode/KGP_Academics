<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has said that the Public Service Commission resorted to irregularities by excluding over 1,000 "successful candidates" of the 27th BCS batch. Members of the parliamentary standing committee on the establishment ministry on Sunday spoke in favour of appointing some 1,114 Bangladesh Civil Service candidates saying they fully qualified for public service. Of the 1,114 rejected candidates, 326 are the children of freedom fighters, 300 are women and 200 belong to minority communities, a special panel formed by the standing committee disclosed at a meeting. "We want to know on what basis, did the PSC reject wards of freedom fighters and other minority candidates even though they passed the examinations," Abdus Shahid, chief whip and committee member, told bdnews24.com after the meeting in parliament. "All of us  say the PSC have resorted to irregularities while making the final selection of candidates," said Shahid. "All of the deprived candidates should get jobs." Saad't Hussain, a retired bureaucrat, took over as PSC chairman after announcement of the state of emergency in 2007. His commission, during the immediate past caretaker government's tenure, took a decision to re-examine the results of the 27th BCS examination that ended when the previous BNP government was still in power. Of the total 16,418 candidates passing the written examinations, 9,769 examinees passed the first viva voce. Hussain's commission decided to re-hold the viva voce in which 10,412 candidates passed. Of the total candidates, 1,114 passed the first viva voce but were screened out in the second. The PSC said the unsuccessful candidates failed to get the minimum 40 marks in the second viva voce. The "deprived" candidates launched a months-long protest programme against the PSC decision and sought prime minister Sheikh Hasina's intervention in this regard when she came to power. Sheikh Hasina on May 5 sent a letter to the PSC to settle the disputes. The parliamentary standing committee on establishment ministry discussed the issue and formed a sub-committee to recommend ways for appointing them to jobs. The sub-committee submitted its reports to the standing committee on Sunday. The standing committee will make its recommendation at the next meeting, the date of which was yet to be fixed, Shahid said. The committee chairman Khandker Asaduzzaman made no comment about the 27th BCS issue. "We have recommended that all ministries should form a cell comprising different professionals to bring dynamism to the administration," he told reporters. He said the committee observed a "type of inertia" in the civil service.
