 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has dismissed the appeal of interdict by Kazi Faruq, sacked chairman of Proshika. Judge Sheikh Marina Sultana of First Assistant Judge's Court, Dhaka, on Sunday dismissed the appeal Faruq filed on May 25 for a ban on the seven-member new board of directors of the NGO. Faruq had claimed himself the chairman of the organisation and applied for interdiction on the activities of the new board. The court on that day had given the defendants 24 hours to explain why a temporary ban would not be clamped on the activities of the new board. The new seven members are MA Wadud, Mahbub-ul Karim, Masrurul Islam, Abdul Matin, Renuka Biswas, Golapi Begum and Shahjahan Hawladar. The first four of them appeared in the court on Wednesday to contest the appeal for a ban. Advocate Md Shahabuddin was on Faruq's side and advocate Abdul Barek Chowdhury and Garib-e-Newaz represented the defendants. The new board was formed last Sunday removing Faruq as the chairman. Many staffs of the organisation have alleged that he had used them to achieve his political ambitions. bdne
