 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation did not accept Sheikh Mohammad Aslam's resignation following the national flag issue after the prove committee found no motive behind the incident. Former national striker Aslam resigned from the post of deputy chairman of the ongoing Citycell National School Football Championship following unveiling of a portrait of the members of the Swadhin Bangla Football Team in a opening ceremony that involved the national flag being 'cut' into two halves to reveal the portrait. Following the incident, the BFF emergency committee on May 27 apologised for it as well as formed a three-member probe committee headed by its senior vice-president Abdus Salam Murshedi to find out whether there was any motive behind the unwanted incident. "Having talked with the committee members, we found no motive behind the incident and requested Mr Aslam to resume his post ahead of the semi-finals and the final," probe committee head Murshedi told bdnews24.com on Monday. "They actually wanted to show something to the youngsters, who did not see the Independence war where the footballers also fought to create opinion through playing football," said Murshedi, the acting BFF president. The former national striker, however, said that inclement weather on that day played a role in the incident. bd
