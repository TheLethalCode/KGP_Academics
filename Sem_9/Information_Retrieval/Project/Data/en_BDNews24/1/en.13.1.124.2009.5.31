<TITLE> Never a dull moment for drama queen Serena </TITLE>

 PARIS, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There never seems to be a dull moment when Serena Williams is around. Williams has made a cameo appearance in medical drama ER and lists acting as a hobby but she does not need to rely on a script to produce her own drama. Controversy has a way of following the American round on the tennis circuit and on Saturday wide-eyed fans at the French Open witnessed the latest episode to unfold around the 10-times grand slam champion. "I'm drama, and I don't want to be drama," Williams said after reaching the fourth round with a ill-tempered 4-6 6-3 6-4 win over Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. "I'm beginning to think it's me because I do have a lot of drama, and it's always something, whether it's my life with friends, with anybody. It's like I have the most dramatic life. It's so ridiculous." Williams labelled opponent Martinez Sanchez a "cheat" on Saturday for not admitting a shot at break point down in the fifth game of the first set had rebounded off her arm. It proved to be the pivotal moment of the first set as Martinez Sanchez went on to win it. Williams was not happy. "The rules of tennis are when the ball hits your body, then it's out of play. You lose a point automatically. So the ball hit her body, and therefore, she should have lost the point instead of cheating," said Williams. "It was clearly my point  I've never sunk low." At least on this occasion the American won the match. In 2003, a sobbing Williams accused Justine Henin of "lying and fabricating" following a controversial semi-final defeat at Roland Garros. Two years later, the American lost a hotly contested quarter-final with compatriot Jennifer Capriati at the U.S Open after being on the receiving end of several bad line calls. The incident led to umpire Mariana Alves, who made an incorrect overrule, being removed from officiating duties from the championships that year while U.S. Open officials apologised to Williams. "Every time you look around, it's like I mean, there was an incident with Justine, and then there was another incident with Jennifer Capriati. Always some drama," said the 2002 Paris champion. "Even in Australia this year I had a bad call, and I was just like, why? "I'm like one of those girls on a reality show that has all the drama, and everyone in the house hates them because no matter what they do, drama follows them. I don't want to be that girl." Life off the court is equally exciting for the American. "I do have drama off the court. It's always something, and honestly, maybe it's me," joked Williams. "It always makes for a fantastic story. I always call my friends like, 'You won't believe who's showing up here, or that only happens to me every time'. So they're always like, 'You know what? This only happens to you'. I'm like, I don't know w
