 PARIS, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova was glad to finally face a stiff test after too many easy matches when she beat Pole Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4 1-6 6-1 to reach the French Open quarter-finals on Monday. The former U.S. Open champion, who had lost only 11 games at these championships until this match, will take on world number two Serena Williams for a place in the last four. "(My) other matches were too easy and sometimes it's not too good. Today I was a little bit tested," the Russian told a news conference. "It's also good in this stage of tournament. But in the next matches, I cannot allow myself to do this. I really understand that. I just have to be more prepared." Kuznetsova clinched the first set when Radwanska clipped the Russian's delivery with her outstretched racket but could not return it. The second set was a different story as the 12th seeded Pole whizzed through it, hitting a beautiful lob that Kuznetsova could only watch sail over her and making the most of the Russian's temporary lapse in concentration. Kuznetsova, a steely glint in her eyes, reverted in the third to the lethal topspin forehands that featured prominently in her other matches and a shell-shocked Radwanska surrendered with a mishit service return after one hour 42 minutes. The Russian, who trails her next opponent Williams 5-1 in head-to-heads, said the 2002 champion would be the favourite to win even if clay was not her best surface. "Serena, maybe she didn't play that many tournaments on clay. Maybe she didn't do well, but you cannot discount her," said Kuznetsova. "She's big champion, she's great player. She won here, and definitely she knows how to play on clay. "I feel a little bit more comfortable on clay than her. I have to try to use it to my advantage. I think the serve going to be big in this match.
