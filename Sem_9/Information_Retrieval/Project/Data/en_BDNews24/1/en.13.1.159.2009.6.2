<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)CID will jointly interrogate three detained former NSI officials, the top accused in the 2004 '10-truck arms case', as they previously gave conflicting information during separate questioning. Former director general of National Security Intelligence Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former director Shahabuddin and former deputy director Liakat Hossain have all pointed fingers at each other while claiming themselves innocent, say investigators. Earlier in the day, a Chittagong court granted the TFI six days to grill Maj Liakat again in connection with the case. Liakat had just completed four days' remand in police custody. But CID Chittagong zone's Muhammad Muslim said Liakat was "cautious" in giving information during the four days' grilling that ended on Sunday. He said Liakat gave some important information, but did not disclose enough for the sake of investigation into the 10 truckloads of arms seized during unloading at the port city's CUFL jetty in 2004. Liakat was arrested at his Dhanmondi residence on Monday following the statement of a former NSI director, retired wing commander Shahabuddin, arrested previously. Another former NSI director general Brig Gen (retd) Abdur Rahim and a former NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan, both held in the case, have also given statements in court following interrogation by the TFI. Rahim gave an eight-page written statement in court on May 28 denying his involvement in the arms trafficking case. However, CID officials told bdnews24.com that Rahim gave a "tricky" statement, evading many key questions. The CID on Sunday also asked for another 10 days to quiz Shahabuddin afresh. bdnews24.com/m
