<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  BFF president Kazi Salahuddin on Saturday termed the Bangladesh Cricket Board's desire to hold some 2011 ICC World Cup matches at Bangabandhu National Stadium a dead issue, referring to the decision taken by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Youth and Sports Ministry. The BFF boss has also categorically illustrated that the football governing body was going to spend a busy international schedule at the BNS, the country's premium venue. On May 24, the BCB board of directors meeting decided to place a proposal to the authority concerned on holding one or two matches of the ICC World Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, which was only scheduled to stage the opening ceremony of the cricket extravaganza. Bangladesh have already bid for the SAFF (South Asian Football Federation) men's and women's championship in 2009 and 2010 respectively and the BFF president told a press briefing on Saturday that he would confirm the issues in the SAFF meeting during the FIFA congress, scheduled for June 1-3 in the Bahamas. "A meeting of the South Asian Football Federation is scheduled to take place in the Bahamas where a decision on the SAFF Championship is expected to be taken. We made bids for both the tournaments during the AFC congress and this time I am going to fight all the way because we are planning to make Bangladesh the centre of South Asian football," said Salahuddin. "Also, we are going to talk about the SAFF executive committee, which has been running for ten years. Bhutan objected about the one-man show for too long and we had seconded the decision during the last SAFF meeting in Kuala Lumpur," he said adding that the time for change has arrived. The BFF boss also said that the new statues of the SAFF executive committee would also be made in the meeting as it had been running by a one-man show for the last eight to 10 years. The BFF had earlier announced the Bangabandhu International Gold Cup football to be held in Bangladesh and Salahuddin hopes to finalise the participating teams. "I have already discussed the matter with some nations during the in the AFC Congress in Malaysia and this time I will likely seek assurances that will be taking part." bd
