 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is seeking information from the parliament secretariat on educational qualifications of BNP MP Salahuddin Qader Chowdury's. The EC has also decided to move against a petition filed by Jatiya Party MP ABM Ruhul Amin Hawladar, election commissioner Sohul Hussain told the reporters Monday. Chowdhury and Hawladar failed to submit their educational certificates to the EC within the deadline of May 31. Both of them have been accused of perjury regarding the information they submitted to the EC on their educational qualifications ahead of the December general elections. Sohul said on Monday, "We are asking secretary of parliament secretariat for information on Salahuddin Chowdury's educational qualifications." "The record of his academic profile should be in its archive because he was also a member of a previous parliament," he said. Chowdhury, MP for Chittagong-2, and Jatiya and Hawladar, MP for Barisal-6, were accused by rival candidates ahead of the parliamentary elections on December 29 2008 of submitting false information on their education. Chowdhury made no mention of his educational qualifications in his affidavit when he filed his nomination. Howlader said he had a BA (Hons) in public administration from Dhaka University but did not provide the documentation. During a hearing on Dec 10, they promised to submit their educational certificates "as soon as possible". The EC has since sent letters to the two MPs, twice extending the deadline to submit their documents, finally setting May 31 as the last date. EC deputy secretary AKM Salimullah told bdnews24.com the two had not handed them in by 5pm Sunday. CEC ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters back in April, "Under electoral laws, if anybody gives false information in their affidavit, he will be disqualified from candidacy." Huda said if information given in their affidavits is proved false, the EC will write to the Speaker to take action against the two MPs. bdnews
