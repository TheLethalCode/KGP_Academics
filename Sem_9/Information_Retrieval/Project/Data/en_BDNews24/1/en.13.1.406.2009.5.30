<TEXT>
 Barisal, May 30 (bdnews24.com)Education has become too disparate and commercialised in Bangladesh, said chairman of the parliamentary standing committee for education Rashed Khan Menon MP on Saturday. "A unified education system is mentioned in the constitution, a system that would be pro-people," said Menon at a discussion on education in Barisal. "But, we have been going in the opposite direction for 38 years since the liberation." "Nine education commissions have outlined nine education systems, and none of these came into effect," he added. The meeting was organised by district-based student body of Zila Chhatra Maitree at Barisal Brojomohon (BM) college. bdnews24
