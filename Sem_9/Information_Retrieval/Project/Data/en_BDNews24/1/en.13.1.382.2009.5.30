<TEXT>
 Lalmonirhat, May 30 (bdnews24.com)India's Border Security Force erected barbed wire fencing overnight along the two sides of the road of the Tin Bigha Corridor that provides the Dahogram-Angorpota enclave's link to the Bangladesh mainland, officials said on Saturday. Bangladesh Rifles Patgram company commander Subedar Hamidul Islam said the BSF erected the fence through Friday night on the road which Bangladeshis use for travel to and from the enclave surrounded by Indian territory. Saiful Islam, chairman of the Dahogram-Angurpota enclave, a union that belongs to Lalmonirhat district, said the residents were angry with the fence. BDR has protested the BSF fencing saying it breached a decades-old agreement between Bangladesh and India. Islam said he led a company commander level flag meeting with the BSF on the Tin Bigha Corridor on Saturday. On protests from BDR at the meeting, the Indian border guards said the fence was built on directions from "higher authorities". "The BSF has breached the 1974 pact by erecting the fence along the Corridor," said Hamidul. Signed in 1974, the Tin Bigha Corridor agreement came into effect from 1992, allowing Bangladesh the corridor of land through which Bangladeshis can freely move between the Dahogram-Angurpota enclave and the mainland during the day. bdnews24.com
