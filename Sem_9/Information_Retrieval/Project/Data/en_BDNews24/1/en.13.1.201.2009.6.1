 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) - The secretaries committee will propose executing recommendations of the pay commission for government employees from July, cabinet secretary Mohammad Abdul Aziz said on Sunday. "The pay commission recommended keeping the scale at a rate of 1:11.25 for lowest and highest government salaries, respectively. But this creates too much disparity," said Aziz, who heads the committee, after its first meeting. "We have decided to bring the rate down to 1:10," he said. The secretaries committee was formed last month to formulate final recommendations by reviewing and scrutinising the recommendations of the pay commission formed during the immediate past caretaker government. "If the new pay commission takes effect, Tk. 8000 crore extra allotment for army and Tk. 2000 crore for teachers will be needed," said Aziz. The cabinet secretary also spoke of a permanent pay commission. "We fully support a permanent pay commission." At present a new pay commission has to be formed every time prices go up; a permanent pay commission could raect more immediately to price inflation or reduction, he said. The secretaries committee includes members Mollah Waheduzzaman, secretary of prime minister's office, Kazi Habibul Awal, law secretary, Iqbal Mahmud, establishment ministry secretary, Dr. Mohammad Tareque, finance division secretary, Kamrul Hasan, defense secretary and Abdul Majid, planning secretary. b
