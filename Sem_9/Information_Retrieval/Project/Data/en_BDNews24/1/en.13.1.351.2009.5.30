 Rajshahi, May 30 (bdnews24.com)Classes resume at Rajshahi University on Monday, 82 days after fierce clashes between Chhatra League and Chhatra Shibir in March left Shibir's RU unit general secretary Sharifuzzaman Nomani dead, scores injured and forced the university to close its doors sine die. The university's 16 residential halls reopened on Saturday, with RU vice chancellor Prof Abdus Sobhan asking all students to attend classes regularly to make up losses incurred because of long closure since Mar 13. He also urged all teachers to ensure examinations are held on schedule. Proctor of Syed Amir Ali Hall, Dr Saiful Islam, told bdnews24.com about a third of the students had returned to halls by Saturday afternoon. "The students may register back with the halls any time between 6am and 10pm with necessary information including their names, department and cellphone numbers," said Islam. bdnews24.co
