 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)The Westin Dhaka is promoting modern Australian cuisine from May 30 to June 12, as part of the hotel's initiative to introduce a taste of different countries of the world. As a lead-in the "High Commissioner's Eleven: Tastes of Australia" was a presentation of Australian foods imported in Bangladesh, attended by distinguished guests from the media, celebrities, industry and government. Australians and Bangladeshis have in common a love of cricket and fine food, says the high commissionerand both came together, mingled with music at the gala dinner on Friday hosted by the Australian high commissioner Dr Justin Lee at his residence. The foods were served amid a fanfare of Australian music, mimicking domestic one-dayers in Australia where batsman enter the field to their favourite song. Lee said a variety of Australian produce now coming to Bangladesh, which he said were unique for its quality and freshness. "Food exports are a core component of our bilateral trade worth A$130 million in 2008, up 22 percent from the previous year," he added.
