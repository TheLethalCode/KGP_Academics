 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com education correspondent Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) - The University Grants Commission will launch a probe to prevent irregularities at private universities, the regulatory body's chairman said on Sunday. Necessary steps will be taken in light of "survey and study" into the universities' activities, Nazrul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com. "Irregularities are continuously taking place at private universities. We will launch a survey to identify which ones are breaking rules again and again and what rules are most commonly broken," said Khan. "We will further study why rules are not being followed and what to do to remedy this," he said. There are 51 private universities in the country; all but a few face allegations of irregularities as well as sub-standard education, he said. A previous probe committee, led by former UGC chairman Mohammad Asaduzzaman, recommended eight private universities be closed down because of sub-standard education. Five were later closed on the basis of investigation by a subsequent judicial commission. Demands have since been raised to formulate tighter laws to regulate private universities, though the universities have been against such a move. The past caretaker government formulated a private university ordinance in a bid to replace existing law with more a stringent one. The present government, coming to power in January, has formulated its own draft law instead of passing the caretaker government's ordinance in parliament. "The draft law now stands at the final stage. We will submit it to the education ministry next week. It will hopefully be placed in parliament in the next session," Khan said. "The new law will curb irregularities in private universities." b
