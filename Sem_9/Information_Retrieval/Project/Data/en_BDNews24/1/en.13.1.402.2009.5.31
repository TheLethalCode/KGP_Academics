 QALQILYA, West Bank, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six people were killed on Sunday when forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas raided a Hamas hideout, just days after Abbas promised in Washington to fulfill his security commitments. The violence erupted when police encircled a house in the West Bank town of Qalqilya where a top Hamas field commander, Mohammad Samman, and his deputy Mohammad Yasin had taken refuge, witnesses and security officials said. Both Hamas men and the homeowner died in the shootout, along with three policemen. It was the bloodiest internal Palestinian clash in the occupied West Bank since the Western-backed Abbas launched a security drive and revived peace talks with Israel in 2007 after breaking with Hamas over its takeover of the Gaza Strip. Samman and Yasin had ignored calls to surrender, witnesses said. Palestinian security forces spokesman Adnan Damiri said police had tried to negotiate a peaceful end to the standoff. "Thousands of shots were fired at the security forces," Damiri said, adding that large quantities of explosives were discovered in the Hamas hideout. The raid in Qalqilya could boost Abbas's credentials in Washington at a time when U.S. President Barack Obama is at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Jewish settlements in the West Bank. SECURITY STEPS Obama hosted Abbas in the White House on Thursday and complimented him on security steps he has taken in the West Bank under the 2003 peace "road map" that includes a call for a crackdown on militants. Abbas, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, said he was committed to "law and order" in the West Bank and to fulfilling "all of our obligations under the road map, from A to Z." Obama noted that Abbas had been working with U.S. General Keith Dayton, who is helping the Palestinian Authority train its security forces. It was not immediately clear if U.S.-trained forces took part in the Qalqilya operation. Israel, which has not met its road map commitments to halt the expansion of Jewish settlements, has said the Palestinians need to do more to meet their security obligations. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, whose responsibilities include overseeing settlement construction, will hold talks in Washington this week in a bid to ease friction with Obama. In Gaza, Hamas denounced Abbas's forces as "Zionist agents." On Thursday, Israeli forces killed a fugitive leader of Hamas's military wing near the West Bank city of Hebron. Hamas accused Fatah of helping Israel track him down. Fatah denied the allegation. Hamas says Abbas's Fatah-dominated security forces are pursuing a politically motivated crackdown on its activists. Fatah has made similar complaints against the Hamas administration in Gaza. Hamas said 22 of its members were arrested in the West Bank on Saturday. A Palestinian security official said the detainees were involved in hiding weapons, money laundering and incitement to violence. Egypt has set a July 7 deadline for a Hamas-Fatah reconciliation deal.
