 MADRID, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Forlan scored his 32nd Primera Liga goal of the season to help Atletico Madrid secure a place in Champions League qualifying with a 3-0 win over visiting Almeria on Saturday. Abel Resino's side had needed only a draw to fight off the challenge from fifth-placed Villarreal, who won 3-2 at Real Mallorca thanks to a double from Joseba Llorente.

Deportivo finished just outside the Europa League places in seventh, four points behind Valencia. Forlan's goal, a typical long-range effort, added to strikes from Sergio Aguero and Raul Garcia to seal a sixth consecutive win for Atletico and the Uruguayan striker is almost certain to win a second European Golden Shoe award. It was his 12th goal in Atletico's final eight matches of the season and he wins Spain's "Pichichi" award as top scorer.

The final day of the season on Sunday starts with Osasuna, Sporting Gijon, Real Betis, Getafe and Real Valladolid separated by two points and scrapping to avoid the one remaining relegation place. Recreativo Huelva and Numancia have already been relega
