<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 31 (bdnews24.com)A former deputy director of National Security Intelligence, retired major Liakat Hossain, will go before the Task Force for Interrogation in Dhaka for further grilling in the notorious 10-truck arms case, a CID official said Sunday. Muhammad Muslim, special superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Department's Chittagong zone, said Liakat will be produced before Chittagong magistrate's court for further remand to extract more information on the 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of arms in the port city. Liakat was cautious about giving information during his four-day remand that ended on Sunday, said Muslim. He said Liakat gave some important information, but did not disclose enough for the sake of investigation. Liakat was arrested at his Dhanmondi residence on Monday following the statement of a former NSI director, retired wing commander Shahabuddin, arrested previously. NSI former director general Brig Gen (retd) Abdur Rahim, Shahabuddin and former NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan, all held in the case, have all given statements in court following interrogation by the TFI. bdnews2
