 ST ETIENNE, France, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France midfielder Patrick Vieira was pondering his future at Inter Milan on Monday after an injury-hit season with the Serie A champions. Vieira is back with the France squad for two friendlies against Nigeria and Turkey this week. "I feel physically and mentally fit to play in a big club and with the French team. The big club I don't know where it will be yet," the 32-year-old Vieira told reporters. "As long as I have not discussed with Inter to see what they want to do, I do not know what I will do. I need to discuss with my coach (Jose Mourinho) to see whether I am part of his plan or not." Vieira, who has been hit by a string of injuries in his knee, thigh and hamstring, has featured in 19 league matches with Inter Milan this season. France play Nigeria in St Etienne on Tuesday and face Turkey in Lyon on Friday
