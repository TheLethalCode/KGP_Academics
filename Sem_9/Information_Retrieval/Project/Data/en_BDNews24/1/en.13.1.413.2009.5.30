 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)The central bank chief has expressed his hope that despite the global recession the remittance inflow in the current fiscal year would cross $9.5 billion dollar, half a billion higher than the previous year. "This remittance will assist Bangladesh in combating the global recession and maintaining the trade balance," governor Atiur Rahman said on Saturday. The Bangladesh Bank's foreign reserve is now at its all time high due to the positive inflow of remittances, he said, standing at $6.5 billion dollar on Thursday. He said this healthy reserve and the positive trend of remittance inflow will play a vital role for the country in overcoming effects of the global recession. Rahman was addressing a dialogue on 'Rethinking Trade Finance 2009: An ICC Global Survey' organised in the capital by the International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh (ICC-B). "Although banking and financial sectors in developed countries have taken a major blow from the recession, Bangladesh is still cushioned from its impact. Our banks and financial firms are still on a strong footing," he said. "Export income and remittance inflow also remain relatively unscathed by negative impact of the economic meltdown. We hope despite the recession the remittance inflow will cross $9.5 billion." Atiur was optimistic in saying that the country will earn a six percent growth in the GDP in the current 2008-09 fiscal. The central bank has constantly been studying the global economic condition, he said. The governor saw boosting internal demand as the way to minimise the impact of the recession. "Our most effective strategy is to increase our own demand for our own products, which means placing our own products in our own market." "But this does not necessarily mean that exports will get less importance," said the governor. Atiur said the government has already announced a stimulus package to offset the negative impact of the recession. Among the measures, the central bank has capped the lending rate at 13 percent, except consumer and credit card loans, he highlighted. It has also fixed the interest rate for opening LCs for eight essential import products at 12 percent. Commercial banks have also been specially asked to provide loans to productive sectors including agriculture and Small and Medium Enterprises, he said. Call for more NRB investment Under the shadow of the recession in other countries, Atiur also called for non-resident Bangladeshis to bring their money to Bangladesh. "Many expatriates have ability to invest hugely in this country." "In the perspective of the recession, if the opportunity to invest in here means they will profit and the country will be benefited as well," he said. bdne
