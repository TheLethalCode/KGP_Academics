<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Minutes after saying that he would return a reported Tk 1 lakh he had taken from the MP Club's fund for medical treatment abroad, chief whip Abdus Shahid has gone back on his word. He told reporters in a news briefing on Sunday that he would return the money he had taken as chief whip of the opposition in the 2001-2006 parliament for heart treatment in Bangkok. "If necessary, I will return the money," Shahid announced when asked if he would give it back to steer clear of controversy. He called the press conference at his office to "protest" the reports published in newspapers on the alleged misappropriation of Tk 1 lakh from the MP Club. But, he made a stunning reversal minutes later. "No, I will not return the money. Why should I give the money back? This is one of my privileges," he told bdnews24.com after the press conference was over. "I said that (I will return the money) by the by." He said the MP Club had a welfare fund for the members. "Many MPs have got money from the welfare fund. I applied for the fund and the club committee gave it to me." Shahid snubbed reporters at the briefing for writing on his funds withdrawal. Chief whip of the previous parliament Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the ex-officio president of the club, took Tk 18 lakh while secretary and BNP whip Wahidul Alam got Tk 4 lakh, all for reported heart treatment. A parliamentary panel probing former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar's corruption on Thursday disclosed that Shahid had also taken money. It said the entire income of the club, over Tk 64 lakh, was spent by the outgoing committee.
