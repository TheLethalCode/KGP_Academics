 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh gave an excellent account of themselves before losing by 38 runs against Australia in their first ICC World Twenty20 warm-up game at Trent Bridge on Monday. Faced with a daunting 219-run target, the Tigers bravely replied with 181-7 in 20 overs mainly due to Shakib Al Hasan's 29-ball 54 that featured six fours and two sixes. Knowing it needed a spectacular start, opener Tamim Iqbal responded by hitting Nathan Bracken for three fours and a six to amass 18 runs in the first over while his partner Junaed Siddique also followed him to smack three fours off Brett Lee with the scoreboard reading an amazing 31 for no loss in the first two overs. Australia captain Ricky Ponting brought his key weapon Mitchell Johnson, who did not disappoint his leader to remove Junaed for 12 with his second delivery, leaving Bangladesh at 32-2 in 2.2 overs. Then quickest pacer Lee struck in the next over to dismiss dangerous Tamim, who risked high to play the over-pitch delivery straight to Bracken at mid-off leaving the Tigers wobbling at 34-2 in 3.2 overs. Tamim hit 21 off nine balls studded with three fours and one six. However, Mohammad Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan kept the onslaught going and added 58 runs for the third wicket. By that stage the Tigers were 92-2 in nine overs. Australia by comparison had made 104-2. Ponting again kept his hope on Johnson, who then beat Ashraful with a 90mph delivery as the Bangladesh captain got the bottom edge onto the middle stump. Before being bowled, Ashraful played a 24-ball 26 hitting five boundaries. Shakib, world's number one all-rounder, then built up another partnership with on-song Mahmudullah Riad to put on 40 runs for the fourth wicket before Shakib fell to Bracken in the 14th over, leaving the side at 132-4. Ponting took a diving catch at extra-cover to see off Shakib, who played an entertaining 54 off 29 balls that included two sixes  off Andrew Symonds  and six fours. Later, Lee, Bracken and Johnson picked up one wicket apiece to slow down Bangladesh's run-wheel and Bangladesh eventually ended up their innings on 181-7 though Mahmudullah was not out 31 off 25 balls with the help of three boundaries. Earlier, Australia, opting to bat first, posted a massive 219-6, riding on a 100-run opening partnership between Shane Watson and Brad Haddin. Watson and Haddin had started cautiously to make 12 runs in the first two overs but then sent the Bangladesh bowlers to all parts of the ground before third change bowler Mahmudullah was introduced in the ninth over. He broke the 100-run opening partnership having Watson caught by Raqibul Hasan with his first delivery and then picked up Haddin off his third delivery to reduce Australia to 102-2 in 8.3 overs. Watson hammered a 23-ball 52 studded with three sixes and six fours while Haddin, dropped on four by Tamim off Mashrafee Bin Mortaza in the first over, made 47 off 29 balls that included four fours and two sixes. Ponting and Symonds continued the onslaught before Raid again struck to remove the pair to return 4-37 in his four-over quota. Symonds was caught at gully by Junaed Siddique while Pointing was stumped by Mushfiqur Rahim for 14 off 12 balls. Michael Clarke (35 off 18 balls) and Symonds' 27 off 14 balls were the notable scorers. bd
