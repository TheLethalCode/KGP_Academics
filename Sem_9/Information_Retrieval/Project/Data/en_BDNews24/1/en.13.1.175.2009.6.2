<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has accused the government of attempting to "sell the country", and shirking the pledges it made to the people in favour of keeping promises to India. Khaleda made the allegations in public speeches across the city as a three-day programme to mark the death anniversary of her late husband and former president Ziaur Rahman concluded on Monday. The opposition leader reiterated her party's stance against the proposed Tipaimukh dam in the Indian state of Monipur, saying it would cause untold harm to Bangladesh's water resources. She also criticised the government's failure to keep prices of essentials under control. Khaleda called on all to thwart what she said was a plot to turn country into a 'failed state'. "A conspiracy is going on against the country's independence and sovereignty at home and abroad and all have to be alert to it," she said. "The country is now in great distress. The price of commodities is going up. There is no sign of things getting better," Khaleda said. She said the people had been without democracy for two long years. "But, no improvement has been seen even after this government came to power through elections." During the day-long programme, the former prime minister opened food distribution centres for the poor in Rampura, Khilgaon, Jatrabari and Demra staff quarters, to mark the 28th death anniversary of General Zia, widely acknowledged as BNP's founder. The party's standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, vice president Soroari Rahman, joint secretaries general Mirza Abbas and Gayeshwar Chandra Roy accompanied her. Khaleda fed the poor at a total of 85 spots throughout the capital during the three-day death anniversary programme, from Saturday to Monday. General Zia was assassinated by a group of army officers at the Chittagong Circuit House on May 30, 1981. bdnews24.co
