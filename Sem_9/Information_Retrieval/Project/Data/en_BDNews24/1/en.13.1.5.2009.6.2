 CHICAGO, Tue Jun 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Delinquent loans at small and medium-sized US businesses showed signs of having peaked in April, according to PayNet Inc, a firm that provides risk-management tools to the commercial lending industry. PayNet on Tuesday said that accounts in moderate delinquency, or behind by 30 days or more, slipped to 4.15 percent in April from 4.37 percent in March.

"There are still a lot of write-offs and non-performing loans that have to work their way through the system," Phelan said. Demand for capital spending loans also remains depressed, he added. PayNet, based in Skokie, Illinois, collects and analyzes real-time loan information, such as originations and delinquencies, from more than 200 leading US capital equipment lenders. The company's proprietary database encompasses more than 14 million current and historic contracts, worth some $645 billion.
