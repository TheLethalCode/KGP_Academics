 Singapore, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan is confident its nuclear assets will not fall into militant hands because it is constantly reviewing security and getting help from friendly countries, a senior defence official said on Sunday. "We are very confident," Defence Secretary Syed Athar Ali told Reuters in an interview, speaking about the safety of its nuclear arsenal. "I think this is under constant review. There will be always be improvement in taking measures as far as security is concerned, as far as command and control is concerned." He said the army will stay in the Swat valley beyond current military operations and until police take control. The military said on Saturday Pakistani forces have regained full control of Mingora, a week after re-entering the main town in the Swat valley to dislodge thousands of Taliban fighters that have led to worries over Pakistan's internal security.
