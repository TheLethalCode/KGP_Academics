 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Robinho is unsatisfied at Manchester City and wants to return to Santos where he began his career, the president of the Brazilian club said Friday. Marcelo Teixeira said he spoke to Robinho for an hour and a half, during which the player asked about the possibility of returning to Pele's former club. "He expressed an interest in this respect, because of his dissatisfaction at the English club," Teixeira told reporters. "But, financially, it's very difficult to compete with the European clubs today." Robinho joined Manchester City last September from Real Madrid. He produced some magical moments and scored 14 goals in the Premiership but also fell foul of manager Mark Hughes in January after leaving the club's training camp in the Canary Islands and received a club fine. He also produced a number of lacklustre performances, especially away from home. In April, Robinho said he was happy at the club and was in for the long haul. "There are no regrets on my part about coming here. This is only my first year, and I try to get better every year," Robinho told the club's website (www.mcfc.co.uk). "Hopefully in the future I will be even happier at this football club. My aim is to remain here for a long time." Robinho burst onto the scene as an 18-year-old with Santos, helping them win the Brazilian championship in his first season in 2002. But he left for Real Madrid in acrimonious circumstances in 2005, refusing to train after the club turned down Real Madrid's initial offer for him
