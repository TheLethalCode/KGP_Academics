 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu was picked up by Detective Branch police on Tuesday as he emerged from a High Court hearing on a 'no arrest or harassment' order in the BDR mutiny case. Police chief Noor Mohammad told bdnews24.com Pintu was picked up by police just after 5pm at the High Court mazar gate. Pintu had submitted a petition to the court after his name appeared in the national enquiry committee's report on the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The probe report stated: "Some helpful civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river." After the government made the report public at the end of May, Pintu, fearing he would be taken into custody in connection with the case, petitioned the High Court for a 'no arrest or harassment' order. The BNP leader appeared before the bench of justices Tarikul Hakim and Azizul Haq at 3pm on Tuesday for a hearing on the petition. The bench gave no ruling on the plea. bdne
