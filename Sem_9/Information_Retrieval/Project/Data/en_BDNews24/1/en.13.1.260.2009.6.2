 NASSAU, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexican teams are almost certain to remain outside South American competition next season with no signs of agreement over a return, a senior regional soccer official said on Monday. Mexico, part of North and Central American Federation CONCACAF which also includes Caribbean nations, has featured as a guest in leading South American competitions. However, Mexico withdrew its clubs and national team from all South American competitions last month in protest at the refusal of teams to play them due to the swine flu crisis. "I don't think there will be a quick solution," said CONCACAF general secretary Chuck Blazer when asked if a swift return for the teams would be possible. Blazer said CONCACAF supported Mexico's stance and intended to look into the arrangements for 'guest teams' in South America at their meeting in November. However, Blazer said he could well hold informal private meetings with his counterparts from the South American federation (CSF) during the FIFA congress this week in the Bahamas. Mexico withdrew from South American games after players from Uruguayan and Brazilian teams refused to travel to Mexico for two scheduled games against Mexican teams San Luis and Guadalajara in the Libertadores Cup, a regional club competition. In addition to the Libertadores Cup, the CSF organizes the Copa America for national teams and the Copa Sudamericana for clubs. The Mexican national team first appeared in the Copa America in 1993, reaching the final where they lost to Argentina while Mexican clubs joined the Libertadores Cup five years later. There have been over 5,000 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in Mexico with 97 deaths
