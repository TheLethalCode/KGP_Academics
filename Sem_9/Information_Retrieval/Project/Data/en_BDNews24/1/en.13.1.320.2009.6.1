 SYDNEY, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian police broke up a sit-in protest by Indian students in Melbourne on Monday following a spate of attacks, as calls mounted for a wider probe into the country's international student sector. Indian students say the attacks, which have left one student with serious injuries after being stabbed with a screwdriver, are racially motivated, but police say the attacks are both racial and opportunistic crime. "I think that some of the attacks are racially motivated," said Victorian state police chief Simon Overland. "I think some of the attacks are opportunistic in that they just happen to be Indian students in the wrong place at the wrong time," Overland told reporters on Monday. The attacks on Indian students in Melbourne escalated into a diplomatic issue last Friday, with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh telephoning Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to express his concern at the violence. Australia's international student sector is the country's third largest export earner, behind coal and iron ore, totalling A$13 billion ($10 billion) in 2007-08. Reports of some education operators forcing foreign students to live in cramped conditions and not delivering promised services have made Australian newspaper headlines this year. "The horrifying recent attacks on a number of Indian students have cast a stark spotlight on some of the challenges faced by international students in Australia," said Greens Senator Hanson-Young, the party's spokesperson on education. "Student safety is just one issue that must be addressed, as well as student welfare, access to adequate accommodation, exploitation and discrimination within employment, the conduct of migration agents, and visa requirements," said Hanson-Young, adding she would seek a parliamentary inquiry into the international education sector in Australia. Australia is a major destination for Indian students studying abroad, who recognise the high quality and cost competitiveness of Australian education services. Enrolments of Indian students in Australia have increased at an average annual rate of around 41 per cent since 2002. There were over 97,035 Indian enrolments in Australia in 2008. Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean said the national government held talks with police in mid-2008 after the Indian government first raised concerns about student safety. "It is very disturbing what has happened," Crean said. "It is something we do seriously have to address and we will. I think we can get on top of it.
