<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)Rumours that state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed had stepped down spread on Monday, while home minister Sahara Khatun said that she herself had been unable to contact him all day. "I last saw [Tanjim] on Friday," the home minister told bdnews24.com at 8pm. "I have been trying to contact him, but his phone has been switched off. I failed to reach him the whole day." Unconfirmed reports emerged that Tanjim, after some five months in office, had submitted his resignation to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, when members of the media saw him entering her Hare Road residence in the afternoon. Although there was no mention from any official source of the resignation, the rumour grew to be the hottest topic at the secretariat. Asked about the reports, home minister Sahara said, "If he steps down, he would naturally go to the prime minister, though he may let me know as a courtesy." bdn
