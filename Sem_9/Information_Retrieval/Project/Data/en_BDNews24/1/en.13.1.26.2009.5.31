<TITLE> No travel bar for Syed Iskander: HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has ordered the government not to bar BNP leader Syed Iskander from going abroad or returning to the country for the next three months. The order from a two-judge bench of justice Tarique-ul-Hakim and justice Azizul Haque came Sunday following a petition by Iskander, brother of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. During the hearing, Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon said the court order was needed because Iskander "was barred from flying abroad and he may be barred again". Following a separate petition by former commerce minister Altaf Hossain, the same bench issued a rule to the government asking why a similar 'no travel bar' order should not be given for Altaf. Meanwhile, BNP leader and ex-MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu filed a petition with the bench seeking an order to prevent arrest or harassment by the government, following the inclusion of his name in the probe report of the BDR mutiny. In the petition, Pintu said he feared "arrest or harrassment" as the probe report claimed he assisted the BDR mutineers to flee. Deputy attorney general Khurshid Alam Sarker said a hearing on Pintu's petition might be held on Monday. bdn
