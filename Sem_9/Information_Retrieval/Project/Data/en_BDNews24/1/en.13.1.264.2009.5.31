 Singapore, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's independent courts, not international organisations, will investigate or prosecute security personnel for any alleged human rights violations, Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said on Sunday. "Sri Lanka is a sovereign country with its own legal framework," Bogollagama told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a security conference in Singapore. "We have a very strong separation of powers (and) the judiciary is independent." Sri Lanka earlier this month declared victory over Tamil Tiger rebels, ending a 25-year insurgency that had cost tens of thousands of lives, and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.
