<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafiq Ahmed has rejected opposition party BNP's demands for a fresh probe into the BDR mutiny by an all-party parliamentary committee. BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain made the demand on Friday at a media briefing in the main opposition party's official reaction to the national enquiry committee report made public earlier in the week. "It is not logical to demand a parliamentary committee to investigate the BDR incident as it is being investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department and police," he said Saturday while replying to reporters' questions at the National Press Club after a Bangladesh Child Health Foundation lottery draw. On whether the CID's findings would be disclosed in parliament, the law minister said, "It cannot be said now. But their report could be presented and discussed there if members of parliament want." The trial process will start as soon as their investigations are complete, he added. BNP has also asked for the findings of the army's own internal investigation into the mutiny to be made known through in camera sessions in parliament. Delwar claimed the national enquiry committee's probe did not reveal the full facts and wasted time and money on such a grave incident as BDR massacre. The report of the government-formed committee, headed by Anis-uz-Zaman Khan, was submitted to home minister Sahara Khatun on May 21 and its summary was made public last Wednesday. Some 65 people, including 57 army officers deputed to BDR, were slain in the February mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters of the 55,000-strong border force. Spate of 'crossfire' killings Reporters also confronted the law minister on Saturday about the recent spate of 'crossfire' or extra-judicial killings, highlighted in the press. "Neither I nor the government support these killings," said Shafiq. "Cases have been filed for every incident of such killing and those are being investigated." "It is better not to say any more before the investigations end," he said. b
