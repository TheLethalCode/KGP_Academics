 PARIS, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A half-hearted Ana Ivanovic surrendered her French Open crown without much of a fight when she was totally outclassed in the fourth round by a Belarussian teenager who never lost belief. Victoria Azarenka has been rising up the ranks steadily and she finally announced her arrival on the big stage when she condemned the Serbian eighth seed to a 6-2 6-3 defeat. As Ivanovic bid an early farewell to Roland Garros, champion-in-waiting Dinara Safina's headlong charge towards a maiden grand slam title showed no sign of running out of steam. The Russian top seed flattened Aravane Rezai 6-1 6-0 to charge into the quarter-finals. Men's third seed Andy Murray was also in sparkling form as he strung together four successive wins on his least favourite surface for the first time by stamping out the challenge of Croatia's Marin Cilic with a 7-5 7-6 6-1 win.

The win not only made him the first Briton to reach the last eight since 2004 but kept Murray in the race against Roger Federer to secure the world number two spot by the end of the tournament.

"I'm just surprised that it's really like five games that I lost before getting into the quarters. It's not a bad feeling, and I hope if I continue like this I can go a long way." Slovak Dominika Cibulkova made it through to the last eight of a grand slam for the first time when she outwitted Hungarian Agnes Szavay 6-2 6-4. The 20th seed sealed victory over Venus Williams's conqueror with a sweetly struck forehand down the line after a long rally. Fernando Gonzalez lived up to his nickname of 'Speedy' as he darted into the last eight with a 6-2 6-4 6-2 win over Romanian 30th seed Victor Hanescu. The Chilean, who will next face Murray, has yet to drop a set at this year's ev
