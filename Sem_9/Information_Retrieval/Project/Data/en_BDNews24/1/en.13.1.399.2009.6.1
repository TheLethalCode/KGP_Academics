 RIO DE JANEIRO, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Inter Milan striker Adriano scored on his debut for Flamengo to give his new team a 2-1 win over Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship on Sunday. Adriano, rejoining the club where he began his career, played the full 90 minutes despite admitting that he is still not fully fit after two months out of action. "When I'm feeling good and happy, it doesn't matter if I'm 100 percent fit or not," he told reporters in a touchline interview. "The important thing is to play for Flamengo again, score a goal and win the match. There's no money that can buy this happiness." "I've got back my happiness," he added. "I think it was a good debut but I know I can do more. Little by little, with humility and dedication, I'm going to get back to my best." Adriano walked out on Inter Milan in April, failing to return to Italy after a World Cup qualifier for Brazil against Peru where he was an unused substitute. The Serie A club later agreed to end his contract after he said he was not happy in Italy and wanted time to re-think his career. He joined Flamengo shortly afterwards. Adriano was involved in Flamengo's first goal when Atletico defender Antonio Carlos turned the ball into his own net under pressure from the Brazil international. A crowd of nearly 72,000 at the Maracana then saw Adriano head the second from Leonardo Moura's cross two minutes after halftime. Rafael Moura pulled one back for the visitors in the 69th minute. Sao Paulo, champions for the last three years, produced their best result of the season as they beat Cruzeiro 3-0 at the Morumbi, with Washington, Borges and Dagoberto sharing the goals. Paulo Renato scored twice to help Santos to a 3-1 win over arch-rivals Corinthians
