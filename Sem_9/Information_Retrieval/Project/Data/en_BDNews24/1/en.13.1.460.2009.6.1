 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)The extended period for petitions to withdraw 'political harassment' cases may have netted as many as 20,000 applications, said state minister for law, Kamrul Islam as the deadline came to an end Sunday. Islam told bdnews24.com, "We will take final decisions about the filed petitions over the next month, which will be followed by the process of cancellation." "The process may need two further months to complete," he said, speculating that the number of applications may cross 20,000. A total of 2,781 petitions have been so far submitted to the Dhaka deputy commissioner and district magistrate's office, Nazmul Alam, an assistant at the DC's office, told bdnews24.com. A total of 165 petitions with Dhaka metropolitan public prosecutor's opinions have been so far sent to home ministry through the Dhaka District Committee. The Awami League-led government announced the move in February to repeal 'politically motivated' cases filed under previous governments. The original April 15 deadline for submission of petitions was extended twice. "The deadline will not be extended anymore," Sheikh Momena Moni, senior assistant secretary for home, told bdnews24.com Offices of deputy commissioners in the country's 64 districts were asked to go through the applications and send their comments via public prosecutors to the home ministry, in each case within 45 working days of receipt of the petition, she said. A ministerial committee would then prepare a final list of cases for withdrawal after scrutiny. "It will take some time to receive information from all over the country," she added. The Awami League-led government is thought by many to have announced its move to cancel 'politically motivated' cases to deal with a raft of graft cases against top politicians pressed during the immediate past interim administration. Around 50 high profile figures, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina and former prime minister Khaleda Zia have petitioned against cases during the two-year emergency government. Dhaka deputy commissioner Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com that there were 11 cases against Hasina sent to the home ministry, 20 cases against Khaleda and her family members and four cases against former president Hussein Muhammad Ershad. Among Awami League leaders, Tofail Ahmed, Mosharraf Hossain, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Hazi Selim, Hazi Mokbul Hossain, Sajeda Chodhury, Obaidul Quader, Jahangir Kabir Nanak and Kamal Ahmed Majumdar have petitioned to have cases withdrawn. Among BNP leaders, Moudud Ahmed, Nazmul Huda, Mirza Abbas, Aman Ullah Aman, Nasir Uddin Pintu and Giasuddin Al Mamun have filed. bdnews24.
