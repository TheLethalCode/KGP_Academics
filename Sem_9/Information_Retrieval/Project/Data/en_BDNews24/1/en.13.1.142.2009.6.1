 WASHINGTON, Mon Jun 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US consumer spending fell in April from March, despite personal income posting the largest increase in 11 months, a government report said on Monday, showing activity in the second quarter getting off to a slow start. The Commerce Department said spending slipped 0.1 percent after a revised 0.3 percent fall in March. That was slightly better than market expectations for a 0.2 percent fall in spending.

If you take that out it doesn't look as good as it seems," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. Savings jumped to a record annual rate of $620.2 billion. The savings rate rose to 5.7 percent in April, the highest level since February 1995, from 4.5 percent the previous month. Households, buffeted by job losses and falling asset values, are cutting spending on nonessential items, preferring to save any extra income. Inflation nudged up in April, with the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, at 1.9 percent on a year-over-year basis from 1.8 percent in M
