 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid said Sunday he would provide all MPs offices in their constituencies in addition to ones in Dhaka. The speaker earlier announced that MPs not holding any public offices would get chambers in the buildings adjacent to the parliament building in the capital. Hamid said he would also try to provide vehicles to the chairmen of the parliamentary standing committees. There are 47 parliamentary standing committees in the current ninth parliament. "I will turn the former MP hostels into offices for MPs. "Besides, I think the MPs should have offices in their constituencies. I will make a proposal in the upcoming parliament commission in this regard," Hamid told reporters on Sunday while inaugurating a media centre in the parliament premises. Parliament commission, ahead of the national budget every year, is the body to recommend expenditure for every fiscal year. Hamid said the chairmen of the parliamentary standing committees had very poor logistic support from the parliament secretariat. "I will try my best to provide cars with flags inscribed with parliament's monogram for the chairmen's use," he said. Claiming himself "over-neutral", the speaker said he would never deprive the opposition in the House. He said journalists were part of the workings of parliament and said he would provide all possible logistic support to reporters to perform their professional duties. Hamid on Sunday handed over a large space at the ministers' hostel to facilitate journalists of private television channels in broadcasting footage of parliament sessions. Deputy speaker Col Shawkat Ali, chief whip Abdus Shahid, chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque, whips and journalists also addressed the handover ceremony.
