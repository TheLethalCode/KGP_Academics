 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has sought Thailand's cooperation in a raft of projects, including rail and road, construction of a deep seaport, a new international airport, electricity generation and coal extraction. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain at a meeting with visiting Thai foreign minister Kasit Piromya on Monday also asked for help in the implementation of the second Padma bridge project and the development of the agriculture sector. Hossain told the visiting minister that Bangladesh was going to join the Asian Highway belatedly to connect with 27 countries. He said a good number towns in Thailand had conditions similar to those of Bangladesh in the not-too-distant past, but they had seen great changes. Hossain added that the experiences of Thailand in building an elevated expressway could also help Bangladesh. The communications minister informed Piromya that Bangladesh started construction of the 5.58 km long and 26-meter wide Padma bridge at Mawa, at an estimated cost of $ 1.8 billion with JICA and World Bank funds. Thailand could invest in the construction of the second project on the Padma bridge, from Aricha to Daulatdia, projected to cost $1 billion. Hossain mentioned that a Thai organisation had also worked in the construction of the Rupsa bridge. Besides, cooperation from Thailand was sought for the Dhaka-Chittagong four-lane expansion project and the Dhaka-Jessore rail line construction. Piromya said in the past the Thai industry ministry had worked to attract foreigners for investment. Now, Thailand in turn was investing in Laos and Cambodia and there was also scope for investment and easy lending to different projects in Bangladesh . He also assured Hossain of Thai investment in the private sector. b
