<TITLE> Ancelotti named new Chelsea manager </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Carlo Ancelotti was appointed as the new manager of Premier League Chelsea on Monday, becoming the club's fifth manager in less than two years. Ancelotti, 49, who announced his departure as coach of AC Milan on Sunday, has signed a three-year-contract and will start on July 1, the club said in a statement. "Carlo was the outstanding candidate for the job. He has proved over a long period his ability to build teams that challenged for, and have been successful in, major domestic and European competitions," the statement read. "We are sure everybody at Chelsea will give him a warm welcome and we are all looking forward to working with him." Ancelotti had great success as a player and coach with AC Milan, winning two Champions Leagues and a Serie A title during his eight years in charge at the San Siro. Guus Hiddink had taken the role of temporary Chelsea coach after the dismissal of Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari in February. Hiddink, Russia's national team coach, completed his three-month stint at Stamford Bridge by winning the FA Cup on Saturday with a 2-1 victory over Everton. "They've (Chelsea) had too many changes and they recognise that themselves," Hiddink said after the Wembley win. "Stability is needed now." They had that under Jose Mourinho but after his surprise departure in September 2007, the stability and the trophies dried up. Avram Grant took them to within a missed John Terry penalty of Champions League glory and also to a Premier League runners-up spot but left soon after. Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich's desperate need for another big name appointment led to Scolari but the Brazilian World Cup winner left after Chelsea's assault on the Premier League title was seemingly fizzling out. Dutchman Hiddink revived Chelsea and they finished third in the Premier League, reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League before their FA Cup success. THIRD ITALIAN Ancelotti becomes Chelsea's third Italian manager following Gianluca Vialli, who coached the club from 1998-2000 and Claudio Ranieri who was there from 2000 to 2004. He is well used to working for demanding owners and working for Abramovich will differ little from having flamboyant Italian Prime Minister and Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi as a boss. His dealings with the unforgiving British press may be trickier to start with, however, given his limited English and nervousness in news conferences. "No one has said that I must definitely learn English," he said recently. "Anyway, I'll sort the problem out calmly." This will be his first job overseas following stints at Reggiana, Parma and Juventus prior to joining Milan
