 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)The officials of Anticorruption Commission did not attend the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings on Tuesday. Former ACC secretary, now land secretary, Md Delwar Hossain attending the meeting, though, presided over by committee chairman Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir that began at the parliament building at 11:30am. The government had sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members in early April to attend an April 12 meeting of the parliamentary watchdog. But former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and his successor Habibur Rahman were absent as were other incumbent officials. The letters said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties. The ACC was asked to appear with all procedural documents of the commission since its inception, along with its latest annual and audit reports. The parliamentary watchdog on April 12 declared the ACC "in contempt of parliament and the constitution" for refusing to appear before the committee on the day. Officials at the parliament secretariat said the ACC sent a letter on May 28 explaining the reasons to its skipping the meeting. Alamgir said at the time: "We have sought clarification from them, under which law they have refused to appear before the committee." The committee gave the members of the ACC until seven days prior to the next meeting on June 2 to clarify their position. Former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and then the acting chairman Habibur Rahman, among the other members, decided not to attend the standing committee meeting, saying the watchdog had no legal authority to summon the commission. "The ACC is an independent body and accountable only to the president for its activities," said Habibur Rahman at the time. The law on the issue was being consulted and a decision will be taken after everything was reviewed, Rahman, now the ACC chairman, had said.
