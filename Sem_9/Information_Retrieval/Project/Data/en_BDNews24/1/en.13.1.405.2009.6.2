 MILAN, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil playmaker Kaka wants to stay at AC Milan despite fresh interest from Real Madrid following the election of Florentino Perez as president. "I say it for the last time, I don't want to leave Milan. In this period I prefer to stay quiet because I don't want to be misinterpreted," he told reporters on Tuesday. "To the millions of Rossoneri (AC Milan) fans I say my decision has been made. I have said I want to stay. Now please leave me in peace." Kaka almost joined Manchester City in January for a world record fee in excess of 100 million euros ($142 million)
