 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin on Saturday announced that they were going to offer scholarships to the school footballers playing in the ongoing Citycell National School Football Championship. "So far based on available information I know that the standard of the ongoing football championship is very good meaning there is no lack of talented footballers in the country although there was no school football in the last five to seven years. "And regarding this we are going to take a school development programme offering some of them scholarships provided by Citycell or BFF itself in every year," said Salahuddin at a press briefing at the BFF House. The BFF boss said, "I want to let those school footballers as well as their parents know this scholarship through you so that the players and their parents would be inspired by the announcement." As soon the school championship is over the BFF will conduct a one-month trial programme and later pick some quality players for the scholarships. Salahuddin said that the number of the players being picked for scholarships wasn't important to him as he needed quality players and it might be 20, 30, 40 or some odd number and that he would be pleased if three to four players came out of this process each year. He added that the scholarship would include everything like food, accommodation, and apparels even school fees for next three years till he was in office and hoped that the his successor would continue the programme too. The legendary footballer said that once they finalised the players for the scholarship, all responsibility went to the BFF. "Those who are going to be picked will live according to their own lifestyle at home with the BFF just providing them scholarships as well as short-term training," said Salahuddin. "So that the lifestyle of those selected players will not be hampered." The BFF president realised what he was attempting was a big step for him, but was confident to see the light of the youth development. Salahuddin also disclosed a plan that the BFF was willing to run a football academy in Sylhet BKSP, whose 75 percent work had already been done. "We have desired to get the Sylhet BKSP to run a football academy and the then National Sports Council chairman agreed to allot it to the BFF," said Salahuddin adding that he had already talked to a few companies about sponsoring the academy. "A well-known local company has agreed to sponsor the academy providing Tk 24 crore for eight years on condition of running the academy under their names, but they first wanted to see the allotment paper of the NSC and we are hoping to get it in a short period of time." Until the Sylhet BKSP is allotted to the BFF and the football governing body will run the development programme of the school footballers through organising training partly somewhere. BFF vice-president Kazi Nabil Ahmed, BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi and technical director Shahidur Rahman Shanto were present on the occasion. bd
