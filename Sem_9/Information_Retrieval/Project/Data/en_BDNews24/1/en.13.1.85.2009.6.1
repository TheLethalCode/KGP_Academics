 HANOI, Jun 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vietnam has confirmed two more H1N1 flu patients, state-run television quoted health officials as saying on Monday, a day after the first case surfaced in the Southeast Asian country. VTV 1 reported a woman and her 9-year-old child who returned from a trip to the United States on May 25 were confirmed to carry the H1N1 virus and were being treated in two hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City. The state broadcaster quoted Health Ministry spokesman Nguyen Huy Nga as saying their condition had stabilised and fevers had subsided. On Sunday, Vietnam announced the first case of H1N1 infection after a 23-year-old Vietnamese student who returned from the United States was tested positive for the virus. State media reported on Monday authorities were tracking nearly 200 passengers who were on the same flight with the student from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City on May 26. Vietnam requires any suspected H1N1 cases to be isolated for seven days
