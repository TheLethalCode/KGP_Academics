<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh completed their ICC World Twenty20 preparations on a losing note when they suffered a four-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka in their official second and final warm-up at Trent Bridge in Nottingham on Tuesday. Sri Lanka reached 152-6 with two ball to spare after Bangladesh made a modest 151-6 in their stipulated 20 overs mainly due to a late 70-run partnership between Raqibul Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahman. Already five wickets down, Sri Lanka needed 25 runs from the last 18 deliveries and Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza came to bowl in the 18th over and removed Jehan Mubarak (16 off 14 balls) after being beaten for two successive fours and finally competed the over giving away 14 runs, meaning the opponents required another 11 runs from just 12 deliveries. Left-arm spinner Shakib then conceded four runs in the penultimate over to have claimed the wicket of de Saram (3) and Rubel Hossain was given the last over responsibility. The quick bowled tightly with his first two balls to bring some excitement, but conceded a boundary with the third delivery to Angelo Mathews, who also took a single to level the score with two balls still remaining. Rubel then bowled wide to give Sri Lanka a four-wicket victory, basically set up by Sri Lankan skipper Jayawardene, who blazed 43 off 28 balls studded with six fours and one six before being Rubel's victim. Opener Tilakaratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya gave Sri Lanka a good start adding 17 and 29 runs respectively. Mashrafee and Shakib took two wickets each. Earlier, a late effort from Raqibul Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim helped Bangladesh post a modest total on the board as the duo together put on 70 runs for the sixth wicket to take the side to 142-6 from 72-5. The Tigers' attempt to go for quick runs from the start saw half the side back in the dressing room by seven overs after captain Mohammad Ashraful won the toss and decided to give his team a chance to set a target. Raqibul played an unbeaten 40-ball 38 that included only three fours while Mushfiqur added 34 off 28 balls with the help of two sixes and one four before the wicketkeeper fell to Sanath Jayasuriya. Bangladesh saw just one run came from the opening over bowled by Nuwan Kulasekara, but in the next over left-handed opener Tamim eased the pressure smashing three successive fours off Farvez Maharoof, who, however, had the last laugh to take Junaed Siddique (2) with a slower delivery off his last ball in the same over. Three balls later, Tamim followed Junaed to be run out following a misunderstanding with captain Mohammad Ashraful, who first called Tamim, but later decided not to leave his crease and bowler Kulasekara removed the bails at the non-striker's end. Tamim struck 14 off 10 balls smacking four fours. Ashraful along with new batsman Shakib Al Hasan took the side to 50-3 in 6.3 overs before pacer Isuru Udana tempted the Bangladesh skipper, who chased a widish delivery to edge behind the stumps. Ashraful made 16 off 15 balls studded with two fours. Bangladesh were soon reduced to 72-5 with on-song Mahmudullah Riad edging Udana to keeper Kumar Sangakkara for a two-ball one and Shakib was removed by a slower delivery from Ajantha Mendis. Shakib hammered four fours in his 17-ball 23 knock. bd
