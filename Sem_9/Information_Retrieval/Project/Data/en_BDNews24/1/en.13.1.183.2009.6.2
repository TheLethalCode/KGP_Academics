 PARIS, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With Rafael Nadal out of the picture, Roger Federer is the hot favourite to win the French Open but the world number two refused to buy into the hype. Nadal's four-year Roland Garros reign was ended by Swede Robin Soderling on Sunday in one of the biggest ever upsets in tennisand now fans and pundits alike are backing Federer to finally get his hands on an elusive French Open title to complete his collection of major crowns. Federer reminded everyone he still had a long road ahead, especially since he had to come from two sets down to beat Tommy Haas on Monday. "It (Nadal's defeat) just shows that it's hard to win day in, day out at a particular tournament," Federer said after reaching the quarter-finals. "It just shows that we're all human. We all lose at some stage. People always make it sound so simple  (but) you come out and you always have guys going after you, like Tommy Haas today," added the 13-times grand slam champion. "Everybody believe in their chances now but in the mean time, it adds pressure. It is a relief but it also puts more pressure." Next on Federer's plate will be either American sixth seed Andy Roddick or French 11th seed Gael Monfils, whom he beat in four sets in the semi-final last year in Paris. "You try and stay in the draw but at the end of the day you're focusing on your shots and your match and on how you play and the game plan against that player," said Federer. "Of course, my dream scenario is to beat Rafa here in the final but I have to concentrate on my part of the draw and make sure I come through like today." "I think if you make it to the finals then it's a different scenario. Because whoever I play in the final I probably have a decent record against, which would not be the case with Rafa," he added. "It definitely changes it up if I were to make the final. But we're not there yet, so honestly it hasn't changed a whole lot for me." Although world number three Briton Andy Murray is the highest seed left in top half of the draw, the Swiss thought Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko had more chances of getting through to Sunday's final. "I think Davydenko has it. He has been written off a little bit. I've been disappointed that I haven't heard much about him because he is a great player," said Federer, who has beaten Davydenko in all their 12 encounters. Davydenko will face Soderling in the quarter-finals
