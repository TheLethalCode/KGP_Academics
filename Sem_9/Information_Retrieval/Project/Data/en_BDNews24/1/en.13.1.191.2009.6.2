 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)The once-treasured lighthouse on Kutubdia island is sinking due to rising sea levels and unabated erosion that has caused half the island to disappear in a matter of decades. The once 60 sq km island has been reduced to a mere 25 sq km since the 1960's, says Coast Trust executive director Rezaul Karim Chowdhury. The lighthouse built in British times is no more an integral part of the island as erosion has left the structure, now separated from the island, to sink or swim in the choppy seas. The long-abandoned lighthouse, still of historical importance, is now barely visible during the high tide. Meanwhile, islanders are losing their centuries old homesteads, while rising population densityas the island's more than 100,000 inhabitants are forced to occupy less and less landgives rise to social and economic unrest. Low-lying Bangladesh's vulnerability to global climate change and rising sea levels is the main reason for the sad state of Kutubdia island and its lighthouse, experts say. Coast Trust, a non-government organisation working in the area, says analysis of satellite images has confirmed that great chunks of land have been engulfed by the Bay in recent past decades. SAARC Meteorological Research Centre (SMRC) also records the sea levels rising along the coast of Bangladesh. An SMRC study pointed out that the sea level at Hiron Point in the Sundarbans, at the island of Char Chhenga and at Cox's Bazaar are registering significantly increased tidal heights. SMRC's senior research officer Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com that with higher seas, salinity and coastal erosion was also increasing. Farming, one of the two main livelihoods on the islandthe other being fishingis gradually being abandoned due to shrinking arable land, while people are made homeless refugees. Fisherman Brajo Hari Das, 48, has been forced to take refuge in a temporary shelter on the embankment after his home was washed away by the sea. "We are not receiving any governmental services, no support at all," he told bdnews24.com. Though not aware of the causes of sea level rise, 27 year-old Taposhi, also made a refugee by erosion, said the menace poses most threat during the months May-August. Dr Md Jafar, of Chittagong University's marine science institute, told bdnews24.com, "The tidal highs are increasing. The erosion is exacerbated with the advent of monsoon." "It's not only Kutubdia, but Hatia, Bhola and St Martin's island are also threatened by erosion, with the south-eastern coast experiencing the worst effects," he said. bd
