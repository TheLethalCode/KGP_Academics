 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, widow of former president Ziaur Rahman, paid tribute at the grave of her late husband along with party leaders and thousands of supporters observing his 28th death anniversary on Saturday. Khaleda laid a wreath and offered prayers at the Sher-e-Banglanagar mausoleum of the former army chief and president who was assassinated on May 30, 1981 at Chittagong Circuit House in a 'failed coup' orchestrated by a section of the army. Khaleda went on to distribute food among the poor at the Mohammadpur Eidgah grounds. The BNP launched three days of programmes on Friday to observe the death anniversary of the party founder, beginning with a discussion at the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh in the capital. On Saturday morning, the national and party was flying at half-mast at the party headquarters at Naya Paltan. The anniversary programme will culminate on May 31 with a discussion programme. Ziaur Rahman, then a major, first came to public notice as he announced Bangladesh's independence war from Kalurghat radio station on behalf of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Mar 27, 1971. General Zia, one of the sector commanders of Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan, was subsequently widely criticised for imposing military rule and rehabilitating the anti-liberation elements in politics. He took the charge as chief of army just after the then president Mujibur Rahman was assasinated along with his family members on Aug 15, 1975 by army men. On Nov 7 the same year, Gen Zia became deputy chief martial law administrator under president ASM Sayeem's government and took charge as chief martial law administrator on Apr 21, 1977. He was sworn in as president of the state on Apr 21, 1978
