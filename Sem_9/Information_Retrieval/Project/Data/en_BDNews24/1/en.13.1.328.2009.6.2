 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) has finalised 140 events for the South Asian Games to be held in early 2010 in Bangladesh. The 11th edition extravaganza has included highest number of disciplines 23 in this Games history with the inclusion of new disciplines golf, cricket and handball. The 2006 SA Games in Colombo had earlier seen the highest number of 20 disciplines. "The technical committee, which was given the responsibility to settle the events, has recently finalised it after having talked to the general secretary of the respective 23 federations and we are now waiting to send the event-list to the participating nations," BOA vice-president Mizanur Rahman Manu told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Afghanistan and hosts Bangladesh are scheduled to take part in the regional meet. Athletics will see highest 21 events  13 for men's and eight for women's  following by swimming, which has included 17 events  11 for men's and the rest for women's. Besides, shooting (seven for men's and five for women's), Taekwondo (five each for men's and women's), ushu (six for men's and four for women's), karate (five each for both men's and women's) and judo (10 men's events) are other five disciplines to cross the double digits. Other disciplines are badminton (four each for men's and women's), boxing (six for men's), cycling (two for men's and one for women's), golf (two for men's), kabaddi (one each for men's and women's), squash (two men's events), table tennis (four for men's and three for women's), archery (two each for men's and women's) weightlifting (four men's events), wrestling (five men's events), basketball (one men's event), cricket (one men's event), volleyball (one men's event) and football (one men's event). Of 140 gold events, the hosts' training committee is expecting at least 18 gold medals, seven more than their ever finest success in the Dhaka SAF Games in 1993. The BOA president and secretary general, however, had earlier said that they were targeting 13 gold medals from the Games. "To be truth, we have a base to dream of claiming 18 golds as we have started our training since January and it will continue before the Games get started and definitely there will be reflection of the long-term training on the medal table ," said training committee chief Mizanur Rahman Manu. Manu also said that most athletes for the individual event had already taken biomechanical tests to look into their ability. He informed that they had started the first-phase training with 885 athletes as well as coaching staffs and it has now been reduced to 677 for the second-phase training that began last month. The government has already allocated Tk 25 crore for the training and the athletes in the camp have been getting better facilities as well as allowances compared to previous preparations for any other competitions and games. The BOA vice-president, Manu, expects three gold from shooting, two gold each from swimming, taekwondo, ushu, karate and archery. One gold each from football, athletics, handball, weightlifting and judo is being expected. Except from this 18, the organiser also hopes two more gold medals from wrestling and golf. bd
