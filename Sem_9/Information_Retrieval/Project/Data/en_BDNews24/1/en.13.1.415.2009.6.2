 NEW YORK, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Visitors to the Big Apple will be able to scope out some of the city's famous sites that have been featured in films and television shows with free podcasts unveiled by the city on Monday. Listeners to the walking tours will be guided to the firehouse featured in the popular 1984 film "Ghost Busters" and the bar where the Cosmopolitan cocktail was created. The walking tours called, "Made in NY: Walking Tours of Film and TV Locations," will also feature street locations from films such as Woody Allen's 1977 hit, "Annie Hall," and movies such as "Kramer vs. Kramer, "Sophie's Choice," and "Green Card." "It's so cool to be guided to the locations that were filmed on our city streets and in front of such iconic buildings," actor Matthew Modine said in a statement. Modine, who starred in the film "Married to the Mob" and actress Julianna Margulies, of the television series "ER", will narrate the podcasts that will begin with two tours in downtown Manhattan, each one hour long. The first tour will run from the Tribeca district down to City Hall, taking in The Brooklyn Bridge and Foley Square, which is regularly seen in TV series "Law & Order." The second tour travels through the financial district, past the Statue of Liberty and shows locations from films including "Wall Street," "Working Girl," and "Men in Black." Other sites featured in the podcasts are from the TV series "Spin City" and "30 Rock." The podcasts are available through www.nyc.gov/film . Other New York areas will be featured in future podcasts, officials said
