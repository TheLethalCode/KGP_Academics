 Dhaka June 2 (bdnews24.com)Former ACC secretary, now land secretary, Md Delwar Hossain has said he "clarified his position" on Tuesday at a meeting of a parliamentary watchdog that summoned members of the Anticorruption Commission to review its performance. Hossain was the only one, among current and former officials of the antigraft body summoned, to attend the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings, chaired by committee chief Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir from 11:30am. Tuesday's was the second meeting the ACC members have refused to attend. Former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and then the acting chairman Habibur Rahman, among the other members, decided not to attend the previous meeting in April, saying the watchdog had no legal authority to summon the commission. Hossain, who also skipped the previous April 12 meeting, told reporters on Tuesday: "In April, I received a letter just four days prior to the meeting ... I did not have time to acquaint myself with parliamentary procedure in such a matter." "This time I had a month and a half to prepare." Hossain, who was in charge of the ACC in Feb 2007 at a time when the commissioners resigned en masse, said: "I have clarified my position and taken all responsibility for the Anticorruption Commission when there were no commissioners." "If they think I am responsible for any wrongdoing, I am ready to accept any punishment." He was in charge during that time when 'lists of VIP graft suspects' came out naming top politicians and businessmen. The government had previously sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members in early April to attend the April 12 meeting of the parliamentary watchdog. The letters said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties and the activities and procedures undertaken during the two-year rule of the military-installed interim government. The ACC was asked to appear with all procedural documents since its inception along with its latest annual and audit reports. The standing committee declared the ACC officials "in contempt of parliament and the constitution" for refusing to appear before the committee on the day. Alamgir, the panel head, said at the time: "We have sought clarification from them, under which law they have refused to appear before the committee." The committee gave the members of the ACC until seven days prior to Tuesday's meeting to clarify their position. "The ACC is an independent body and accountable only to the president for its activities," said Habibur Rahman at the time.
