Since he will remain out of the country for three days he will do the last-minute work in Ashgabat. "I will have to attend the conference of IDB, a significant partner in our development efforts. I will do the last-minute polishing in the three days outside the country," he told bdnews24.com at the Secretariat. The budget session will start on June 4 and the finance minister will present the budget in parliament on June 11. He has given some inkling of the upcoming budget at some pre-budget discussions.
