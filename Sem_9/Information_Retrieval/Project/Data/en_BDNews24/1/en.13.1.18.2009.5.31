Quoting a NBR letter received on Sunday, Sadi said the letter stated the BFF is a national as well as a non-profit organisation, which is involved in developing football for the long term through sponsorship money from different companies, and considering this aspect the BFF has been given exemption from paying VAT on all earnings of donations, contributions and sponsorship money. Sadi informed that under the exemption this fiscal, they would now get Tk 90 lakh from their sponsorship money of Tk 6 crore  Tk 5-crore deal with Citycell and the rest with Nokia.
