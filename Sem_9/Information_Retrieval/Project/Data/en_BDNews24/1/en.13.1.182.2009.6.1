 MADRID, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan has won the European Golden Shoe for the continent's leading marksman for a second time, the club said on Sunday. Salzburg forward Marc Janko failed to find the net in the Austrian team's 4-1 home defeat by Altach on Sunday, so Forlan's 32 Primera Liga goals will secure him the prestigious award. Uruguayan Forlan, who has just turned 30, won the Golden Shoe jointly with Thierry Henry in 2004-05 after netting 25 goals for Primera Liga club Villarreal.
