 HERAT, Afghanistan, Mon Jun 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dozens of people in northwestern Afghanistan protested on Monday against civilian deaths, but local authorities say some elders in the area were to blame for helping a Taliban ambush. Residents of Bala Murghab district of Badghis province say six civilians, including women and children, were killed during firefight between Afghan and Taliban forces.

The rising civilian death toll from operations to fight the Taliban insurgency has become an inflammatory issue, and is eroding support for the government of President Hamid Karzai and his foreign backers. Around 2,000 civilians were killed last year in insurgency-related violence, UNand aid agencies say, and public anger rose again last month when US airstrikes hit homes full of women and children. Karzai said 140 civilians died. In a separate incident Afghan troops backed by foreign air strikes killed four Taliban insurgents in Ghazni province on Sunday, provincial district chief Abdul Ghafoor said. In Wardak, west of Kabul, Afghan and US forces killed four militants and detained two suspected militants during an operation to capture a Taliban commander in Sayed Abad district, the US military said in a state
