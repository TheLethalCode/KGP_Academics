 PARIS, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Being the underdog suits Maria Sharapova at the French Open, where she enjoyed being backed by the fickle Parisian crowd in a 1-6 6-3 6-4 third round victory over Kazakh Yaroslava Shvedova on Friday. In recent years the Russian has endured a torrid relationship with the Roland Garros fans and was famously booed off court when she was knocked out in 2007 and 2008. But no longer the world number one, the 102nd ranked Russian seems to have become a firm favourite as she is on a comeback trail following a nine-month layoff with a career-threatening shoulder injury. "Allez Maria!" the fans screamed as they cheered her on while she gasped for breath after running down many of her opponent's cunning drop shots. Summing up the change of attitude towards her, Sharapova quipped: "You're ranked outside the top 100, so people like you." "When you're number one in the world, for some reason they don't like you anymore. It's amazing how the society works. "Especially here in France, I think they always love the underdog, and they always love the one that comes back from behind, or the one that's not expected to win. I'm probably that person," added the three-times grand slam champion, who will next face China's Li Na. A beaming Sharapova blew kisses to all corners of the Centre Court after overcoming a miserable start to down Shvedova. PERFECT RECIPE Sharapova found the perfect recipe to strike up her relationship with the French crowd by unleashing winners after falling one set down on a sunbathed Centre Court. She pocketed the opening game on her opponent's serve but Shvedova broke straight back when the Russian sent a backhand wide. She dropped serve again with her third double fault in the fourth game and then struggled to return Shvedova's heavy first serve. The Kazakh mixed her game with drop shots and bagged the first set when Sharapova returned long after 37 minutes. The former world number one broke for 3-1 in the second set as the clock ticked past the hour. But she served a double fault at 40-30 in the following game and instead of going 4-1 up, Shvedova broke back. Sharapova hung on to break again with a fine backhand down the line and followed it up on serve to level the contest. Shvedova then faded and bowed out with a weak backhand into the net after two hours 27 minutes. "I could not serve at 100 percent because a muscle was pulling (in my arm) and because of this my arms got tired and it was difficult to hit the balls," said the Kazakh, who came to the post-match press conference with an ice pack wrapped around her arm
