 LONDON, May 31 (bdnews24.com) - Ricky Ponting was left with a bruised right wrist after being hit while batting in the nets at Nottingham, but has been cleared of any major injury ahead of the World Twenty20. Ponting has had a long-standing problem with his wrist, which required surgery last year, and was immediately attended to by Alex Kountouris, the physio. He was picking up a ball in the nets when struck by a shot from Michael Hussey and the blow ended his session. "He copped a whack on the wrist and had it iced for the rest of training," a team spokesman told AAP. "He's fine, though, and he'll be back [on Sunday]. There was no need to have an X-ray." Australia were preparing for a warm-up match against Bangladesh on Sunday. They will also face New Zealand on Tuesday before starting the World Cup with a game against West Indies at The Oval on Saturday. Courtesy: Cric
