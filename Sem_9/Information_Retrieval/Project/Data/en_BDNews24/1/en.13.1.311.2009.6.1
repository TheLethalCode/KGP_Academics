 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  Two men were killed and two injured in separate shootouts with police and RAB in the country between Sunday night and Monday. With the latest toll, at least 4 men have died and 18 been injured in police shootouts over the past month, in addition to seven killings in similar encounters with Rapid Action Battalion. The two dead men Monday were identified as a convicted felon Aktar Hossain Kalu, 25, and Guru Mongol, 30, a member of a gang of robbers. Kalu was shot dead in an encounter with police at the Botanical Gardens in the capital. Shah Ali police chief Jakir Hossain Mollah said Kalu was suspected to be planning a crime. He has been accused in different cases including mugging and extortion, Jakir said. Akbar Ali Babu, elder brother of the victim, said Kalu sold vegetables at Mirpur-1 after being released from prison a month ago after serving six years in an arms case said. Babu said police picked Kalu up from Uttar Bishal in the capital's Mirpur area at around 7pm on Sunday. On contacting the police station, the family found he had not been taken there, said Babu. On Monday morning, they came to know that he had been shot dead in an 'encounter' with police at the Botanical Gardens, said Babu. In a separate incident a RAB-11 patrol team caught Mongol and a gang of some eight highway robbers as they were stop cars on a road at Shibpur in Narshingdi, between 3:30 am to 4am, RAB-11 officer Jahangir Alam told bdnews24.com. The gang opened fire and the RAB retaliated, said Alam. Mongol, who was also identified as son of Joynal Abedin Sarcar, chairman of Baghabo Union, died in the shootout that ensued. A case has been filed with the concerned police station. 2 injured RAB arrested two bullet-hit suspects after separate 'shootouts' in Dhaka on Sunday night and early on Monday. A RAB-10 officer, flight lieutenant Humayun, said three suspected criminals intercepted RAB men in plain clothes at around 8pm on Sunday night in a bid to mug them at Boubazar in Jatrabari. They open-fired at the RAB members who retaliated and the shootout left one of the gang, 20 year-old Mohsin, injured while the others managed to flee, said Humayun. RAB seized a sharp knife from Mohsin, who was admitted at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In another incident, a gang of four muggers also attacked a RAB-10 team to mug them at Kadamtali in Shanirakhra in the capital at around 12:45am on Monday, said Humayun. The criminals fired at the elite force prompting them to retaliate. Hafiz, 18, was hit by a bullet in the legs while the others escaped, said the RAB officer. bdnews24.com/
