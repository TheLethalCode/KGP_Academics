 MADRID, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid's new director general Jorge Valdano said on Tuesday he was unaware of any agreement to sign Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo. It has been widely reported in Spain that a pre-agreement set up by former Real president Ramon Calderon was in place to sign the Portuguese playmaker but this was denied by the club in a statement last month. Valdano, who was brought in to join the team of new president Florentino Perez, said on Cadena Ser radio when asked about the reported Ronaldo deal: "I still don't know." "I don't know if Florentino, who arrived at the Bernabeu this afternoon, had any physical contact with any contract that is said to exist," he added. "I still haven't seen it." Perez began a second term as Real president on Monday and has promised to create a spectacular sporting project built around some of the world's best players. Perez signed Manuel Pellegrini as coach from Villarreal on Monday but has yet to announce any deals for players
