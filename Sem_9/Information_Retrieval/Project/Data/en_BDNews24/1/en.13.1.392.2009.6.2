 CHENNAI, India, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's cricket board has welcomed back 79 cricketers to the fold after they cut ties with the 'rebel' Indian Cricket League (ICL). The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in April that any players wishing to be considered for the international side had to ditch the unofficial league by May 31. Among the players readmitted were former caps Hemang Badani, Dinesh Mongia and Sridharan Sriram. "The BCCI, after scrutinising their requests, has written to the concerned state associations that these players are eligible to play in the domestic tournaments for this year," the BCCI said in a statement on Tuesday. "Guidelines with respect to participation in Indian Premier League will be intimated in due course." While the players will be eligible to rejoin official domestic cricket, they will need to serve a "cooling off" period of one year from their return date before they qualify for international selection again
