 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will introduce Daylight Saving Time from midnight on June 19, in a bid to save power, the cabinet decided on Monday. Clocks will be set one hour ahead at midnight to 1.00am, said the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad. The government is introducing DST, as practiced in many parts of the world, as the country faces acute energy shortages, especially in summer. Azad cited the example of 70 countries which advance clocks as necessary. "Energy consumption is increasing in our country day by day due to socio-economic development," he said. The power demand peaks to 5000-5500MW in the evenings, with the deficit standing at 800MW from 1000MW during the peak hours, he said. "Days are longest between March to September, with more hours of sunlight. The power deficit can be overcome by extending the hours of sunlight even further," he said. The national grid will be able to conserve power as the move means the sun will effectively set 'an hour later' on June 20, saving consumption of artificial light. The power ministry has been planning the move for some time. The press secretary did not say how many months DST would be effective. "The government will decide and make an announcement later." The state minister for power said earlier this month that the new timing may continue until the end of September. b
