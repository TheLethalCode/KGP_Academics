<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has asked the speaker to take legal measures to make the Anticorruption Commission's former chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and two present commissioners Habibur Rahman and Abul Hasan Manzur Mannan to appear before it for a performance review. The parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings on Tuesday upheld its previous opinion that the Anticorruption Commission officials not appearing before the committee amounted to "contempt of parliament and parliamentary procedure." The parliamentary panel spared the ACC's former secretary, now land secretary, Md Delwar Hossain from the speaker's legal actions as he attended the meeting. But it recommended that the Cabinet Division take departmental action against him for his statement to the media on parliamentary standing committee's jurisdiction to ask the ACC to be accountable to the watchdog body. Hossain, who outright rejected attending the standing committee's April 12 meeting, turned up to "clarify his position" at the meeting of the watchdog that summoned the ACC members. He was the only one, among current and former officials of the antigraft body summoned, to attend the meeting, chaired by committee chief Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir from 11:30am at parliament building. Tuesday's was the second meeting the ACC members have refused to attend. "The Anticorruption Commission's former chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and its two incumbent commissioners Habibur Rahman and Abul Hasan Manzur Mannan have told us through a letter (on May 28) that they are not bound to appear before the parliamentary standing committee meeting as the commission is an autonomous body," Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, the chairman, told reporters after the meeting. They said they will only appear before the president, if summoned. "This is not acceptable to the committee. Therefore, we have requested speaker, in line with parliament's sovereignty, to take necessary legal actions to guarantee their presence at the meetings of the standing committee." Alamgir said it was up to speaker Abdul Hamid to decide what measures would be taken. The next meeting of the committee is on June 9, the chairman said. "None has the right to flout parliament and the parliamentary standing committee. "Their absence amounts to contempt of parliament," said Alamgir who was one of the politicians jailed by the ACC after the declaration of the state of emergency by the military-installed caretaker government of Fakhruddin Ahmed. The committee chairman said criminals cases could be filed against the three defaulting officials. Hossain, who also skipped the previous April 12 meeting, told reporters on Tuesday: "In April, I received a letter just four days prior to the meeting ... I did not have time to acquaint myself with parliamentary procedure in such a matter." "This time I had a month and a half to prepare." Hossain, who was in charge of the ACC in Feb 2007 at a time when the commissioners resigned en masse, said: "I have clarified my position and taken all responsibility for the Anticorruption Commission when there were no commissioners." "If they think I am responsible for any wrongdoing, I am ready to accept any punishment." He was in charge during that time when 'lists of VIP graft suspects' came out naming top politicians and businessmen when the ACC had no chairman and commissioners from Feb 2, 2007-Feb 18, 2007. The committee chairman said Delwar Hossain worked as per the instruction from some quarters and published a list of 50 corruption suspects, mainly politicians. "His actions from Feb 2, 2007 to Feb 18, 2007 was not right," said Alamgir, who was among the 50 arrested politicians arrested based on that list. "We have recommended the government strengthen the Anticorruption Commission into a truly anticorruption body, not a subservient one," the committee chairman said. The parliament secretariat had previously sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members in early April to attend the April 12 meeting of the parliamentary watchdog. The letters said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties and the activities and procedures undertaken during the two-year rule of the military-installed interim government. The ACC hierarchy was asked to appear with all procedural documents since its inception along with its latest annual and audit reports. The committee gave the members until seven days prior to Tuesday's meeting to clarify their position. "The ACC is an independent body and accountable only to the president for its activities," Habibur Rahman had said at the time. The standing committee declared the ACC officials "in contempt of parliament and the constitution" for refusing to appear before the committee on April 12, but gave another chance defend them at the June 2 meeting. Committee members T I M Fazle Rabbi Chowdhury, Md Khaledur Rahman Tito, Biren Shkider, Moinuddin Khan Badal, S K Abu Baker Bazlul Haq Harun and Zainul Abdin Farroque attended the meeting. bdn
