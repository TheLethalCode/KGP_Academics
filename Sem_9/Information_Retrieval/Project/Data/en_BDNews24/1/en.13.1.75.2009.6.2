 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Citycell National School Football Championship will be held on Wednesday with Victoria High School of Moulvibazar taking on Barisal Town School at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The match will kick off at 5:00pm with Bangladesh Television telecasting the game live from the country's premier venue. The boys from Moulvibazar are flying high after an emphatic 4-0 win over Gabindaganj School of Gaibandha but it would be unwise to underestimate their opponents, who struck a last gasp injury-minute goal to see off Tangail's Shuti VM School 4-3 at the same venue. "Our opponents have a very strong midfield but so do we. So the team that takes control early will have the advantage. We hope to score at least one goal before half-time and if we do that, we would be able to defend," Victoria School skipper Ripon, who leads the tightest defence in the competition, was quoted as saying by bffonline.com the official website of the Bangladesh Football Federation. The high-scoring side from Moulvibazar have conceded just one goal so far against 21 but Ripon, a centre-back, knows the opposition strike pair would be a real threat. "In addition, they have a superb playmaker in Jumman so we have to stop the trio. But our coach has taken good care of us and he treats us like his sons." Victoria coach Ekramur Rahman Rana said that his boys are very disciplined and have worked hard to come this far. "I congratulate the BFF and Citycell for reviving the school tournament and hope it would be held every year from now on. The boys come from a very poor background but they dream of becoming stars. This is a big opportunity for them to shine," told Rana, who prefers a 5-3-2 formation. At the other end, left-back Rahin will lead Town School, who are expected to start with a 4-3-3 -- one of the most attacking formations of the game. "We are here to win the championship and I have faith in our team work which has been very good so far," said Rahin. "We are strong in all three departments." However, their star player Jumman has a minor injury but is expected to start. "We may even switch to 4-2-4," informed Town Schools coach Moshiur Alam Swapan. "The boys lacked temperament in the semi-final but recovered quickly to win the match in extra time. This is the first visit to Dhaka for most of my players and they are enjoying the trip. I would request the sponsors and the federation to make this event permanent in the calendar to inspire the kids," he added. State Minister for Youth and Sports Ahad Ali Sarkar will attend the final to distribute prizes among the winners while Citycell's CEO Michael Seymour will be present. bd
