 PARIS, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As the dust settled on four-times champion Rafael Nadal's shock exit, the locker room chatter was all about Roger Federer's chances of winning an elusive French Open title now that his nemesis was out of the way. The Swiss, whose chances of completing a career grand slam was dashed by Nadal in each of the last three finals, has now found himself installed as the hot favourite for the crown. Whether they had won or lost their own matches, the players shared their opinions on what the previous day's upset meant for the world number two's pursuit of a record-equalling 14th grand slam title. "He (Federer) must have been really happy yesterday," Serena Williams told a news conference after booking her place in the quarter-finals. "(Or) maybe he wasn't. Maybe he wanted to play him in the final again and get revenge. "I think that it's anyone's tournament. You can't just say, Oh, I can win it now. He still has to win all these matches. He's a great player, and obviously I want to see him to do well." Svetlana Kuznetsova was not having much luck with her forecasts. "I'm terrible with predicting something, because in another press conference they asked me who was going to win, and I said, (Novak) Djokovic is in good shape. He loses," the Russian seventh seed said. "They said, Do you think somebody can beat Rafa? I say, I doubt it  (because) Rafa looks like a machine. "Definitely I still hope Roger can do it. I still would love to see him win it." She also pointed to British third seed Andy Murray as a contender, a view shared by Argentine Juan Martin del Potro who could face Federer in the semi-finals. "Of course, there's Roger, there's Murray. They're excellent players. Plus (Tommy) Robredo, who really is a specialist on clay," he said. "But the favourite, I think "the" candidate for this tournament, is now off the courts." One player seemed fed up with all the discussion about the world numbers one and two. "I don't want to talk about Rafa. I'm here to talk about myself. I'm ready, I'm playing good and I'm in the quarter-finals," said Robredo
