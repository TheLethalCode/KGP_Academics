 Istanbul, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey has confirmed its third and fourth cases of H1N1 flu, two Turkish citizens who flew in from the United States, the Health Ministry said late on Saturday. The two have been put in quarantine, are under observation and are in good condition, the ministry said in a statement. Both arrived in Istanbul on Friday, one from Houston via Amsterdam, the other on a flight from New York. Both were diagnosed after going to hospital with high fever and muscle soreness. Turkey reported two cases of H1N1 two weeks ago, an American man and his mother who were flying via Turkey to Iraq. One of the flu sufferers reported on Saturday flew to Turkey on Turkish flag carrier Turkish Airlines and the other on Dutch carrier KLM. Lebanon and Cyprus confirmed their first cases of the H1N1 virus on Saturday. The virus has infected at least 15,600 people globally and killed 113, most of them in Mexico.
