 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 1200 posts lie vacant in the forest division, state minister Mostafizur Rahman said on Saturday, linking the lack of manpower to the gradual but relentless destruction of Bangladesh's forest resources. "It is often said that forest bandits are equipped with more modern arms than foresters. Besides, corruption is another reason for destruction of forests," said the state minister for forests and environment. The government has taken steps to fill the empty posts and effective steps are also being taken to prevent tree theft, said Rahman. He was speaking at a press conference ahead of a month-long National Tree Plantation Movement and Tree Fair-2009, kicking off Sunday. Rahman painted a bleak picture of the country's forestland.. "A country needs at least 25 percent real forest land to keep its environmental balance. But, Bangladesh has barely 15 percent forest cover left," said the minister. However, even this latter figure is disputed by many as there is little up-to-date data on how much forest has been destroyed in recent years. According to some estimates, the country has only 6-7 percent forest cover remaining. The government will take up major reforestation projects as well as encouraging tree-planting on homesteads to protect environment and meet people's demands for forest resources, said Rahman. He said the government had allocated around Tk 43 crore for different projects, including one that aims to plant 1.2 million trees on 12 thousand hectres of land and along 400 miles of road. The government has also announced prizes under 16 categories under the National Tree Plantation Movement, said the minister. They include a first prize of Tk 20,000, second prize of Tk 15,000, third prize of Tk 10,000 along with a certificate for each winner. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to inaugurate the National Tree Plantation Movement and Tree Fair 2009 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on Sunday. The month-long fair will be housed at the Dhaka International Trade Fair grounds adjacent to the BCFC Centre at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the capital. Acting chief forest conservator Abdul Motaleb told reporters that a total of 125 institutions are taking part in this year's fair. b
