<TEXT>
 Gazipur, June 02 (bdnews24.com)Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia has accused the government of bowing to "foreign masters". The BNP chairperson said the Awami League government had attempted to hand over transit facilities to India, but "BNP checked the conspiracy with the support of people". "They are repeating the same conspiracy by trying to create a corridor in the name of Asian Highway," said Khaleda at a meeting at Shahid Barkat Stadium in Gazipur on Tuesday. She again voiced her party's concern about the proposed Tipaimukh dam in the Indian state of Monipur, saying it was not in the country's interests, also citing the establishment of the Farakka dam during the previous AL rule. "Awami League is planning to create an open market for our neighbouring country." "If the government does not step back from executing their promises to 'foreign masters' and end misrule we will stretch our arms in protest." The BNP chairperson at the same time slammed the Awami League government for not allowing the opposition a voice in parliament. "We want to speak in parliament but Awami League is not giving us the scope. They have snatched our seats," she claimed, with a veiled reference to an ongoing dispute about seating arrangements in the House. "Although AL was not elected by the people's vote, we accepted a staged election result to get rid of Emergency Powers Rules. And we continued offering our hand of support for the government," she said. Khaleda once more rejected the government's probe report on BDR incident. Delwar echoes Khaleda The BNP secretary general also joined in claims of a "conspiracy being hatched against the sovereignty and independence of the country." "A game is being played against the independence and existence of the country," Khandaker Delwar Hossain told a separate meeting Tuesday, organised by BNP supporters to mark the 28th death anniversary of the late president Ziaur Rahman at the National Press Club. "Under the circumstances, it will not do to remain silent onlookers," he said Delwar complained that the caretaker the Dec 29 parliamentary election was staged in such a way that "a pro-Indian force could come to power to protect Indian interest". Awami Leauge was implementing the pledges it made to foreign countries rather than delivering on electoral promises, he said in an echo of a statement made by Khaleda the day before. On the construction of the controversial Tipaimukh dam, he said," The construction of the dam must be stopped and it is the responsibility of the elected government to resist it." "The construction of the dam will endanger the ecology and existence of Bangladesh and our economy would be dependent on others," he said. bdn
