 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Giovanni Trapattoni's Ireland were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw with Nigeria in an international friendly on Friday. Nigeria midfielder Michael Enemaro opened the scoring against the run of play after half an hour, beating Ireland defender Kevin Foley to a low cross to score from three metres out. Ireland continued to press afterwards with captain Robbie Keane creating several chances for strike partner Leon Best, who was denied a first goal when his header hit the post after 36 minutes. Two minutes later, Keane equalised when he broke Nigeria's offside trap before rounding goalkeeper Austin Ejide for his 39th international goal. Ireland, second in World Cup qualifying Group 8, face Bulgaria in Sofia on June 6 while Nigeria play Kenya in their Group B African World Cup qualifier a day later
