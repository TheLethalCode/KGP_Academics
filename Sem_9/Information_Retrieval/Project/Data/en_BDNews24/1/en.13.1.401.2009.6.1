 Dhaka, June 1(bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday directed the government to appoint a food court for every district in a year to curb adulteration in food. The bench of Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Mamtajuddin Ahmed also ordered appointment of requisite numbers of food analysers and food inspectors on a public interest litigation filed by human-rights organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. This directive was issued to the food secretary, law secretary, health secretary, Supreme Court registrar and food advisory council's member secretary. The court also asked the government to submit an affidavit by July 1, 2010, on the implementation of the directives. After the hearing, advocate Manzil Murshed said there was provision for appointment of food analyser in every district under section 4 of the 1959 Pure Food Ordinance. Section 41 of the ordinance mentioned constitution of the food court in every district. He further said for lack of control, adulteration in food has taken an epidemic proportion. Dangerous chemical substances are mixed with food putting life of the people under serious threat., he added. Morshed said though the food advisory council was constituted in 2005, no effective step was taken to contain adulteration. He also said it is the fundamental right of every citizen to live. But those rights are being infringed because of adulterated food. Additional attorney general M Enayetur Rahim and deputy attorney general Karunamoy Chakma also took part in the hearing. b
