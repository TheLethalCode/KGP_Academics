 JERUSALEM, Mon Jun 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel would continue to build within Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, defying US President Barack Obama's call for a freeze. But in a nod to Washington three days before Obama addresses the Muslim world from Egypt, Israel moved against one of the dozens of outposts settlers have erected without authorisation, removing three caravans near the Palestinian city of Nablus. Speaking to parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee in Jerusalem, Netanyahu called for "reason and logic" in dealing with settlements in the West Bank, territory Israel captured in a 1967 war. Obama has called for a full settlement freeze, under a 2003 peace "road map" that also obliges Palestinians to rein in militants. The World Court has described all Israeli settlements on occupied land as illegal. "You can't freeze life" in the settlements, an Israeli official quoted Netanyahu as telling the committee in comments that echoed statements the prime minister made last week. "Freezing life would not be reasonable." Netanyahu has said construction has to go on in settlements to accommodate the "natural growth" of families who live there. The road map's construction freeze also applies to "natural growth". He has proposed that Obama accept understandings Israel reached with former president George W. Bush allowing building within existing settlement blocs while barring Israel from building new settlements and expropriating more Palestinian lands, officials said. U.S. PRESSURE Obama's speech on Thursday will be watched carefully in Israel and the Arab world for signs of pressure on the settlement issue that is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A senior Israeli official said Netanyahu hoped to sidestep U.S. pressure by committing to uproot smaller hilltop outposts built without government permission, a step also required by the road map. In the West Bank, dozens of settlers set fire to Palestinian fields and scuffled with Israeli security forces after the caravans at the Nahalat Yosef outpost were removed on Monday. Two weeks ago, Israel flattened a small outpost near the Palestinian city of Ramallah but residents returned to rebuild. Half a million Jews live in settlement blocs and smaller outposts built in the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem. Palestinians hope to create a state in those areas, as well as in the Gaza Strip, now controlled by Hamas Islamists. In other violence in the West Bank on Monday, settlers threw stones at a Palestinian car, injuring six people, medics said. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said he was not aware of casualties among Palestinians. He said an Israeli motorist, who was an Arab, was slightly hurt after settlers stoned his car. Police were searching for the assailants. Israeli police regularly report Palestinians throwing stones and petrol bombs at Israeli-registered vehicles in the West Bank. One motorist was shot dead last year. Attacks by settlers on Palestinians are less frequently reco
