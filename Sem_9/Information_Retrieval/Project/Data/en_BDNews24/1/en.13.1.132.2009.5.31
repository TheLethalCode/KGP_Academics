Atiur emphasised the need for analytical review of all programmes to arrive at suitable social welfare policy and anti-poverty strategies. Meanwhile, the issues of unregistered urban workforce has an urgent need to be addressed, said the BB boss. WB country director Xian Zhu, in his welcome note, said that Bangladesh has made considerable progress in social security.

Former central bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed said that safety net programmes should be joint efforts by public and private sectors. He also stressed on developing programmes to meet local needs rather than adopting foreign programmes.
