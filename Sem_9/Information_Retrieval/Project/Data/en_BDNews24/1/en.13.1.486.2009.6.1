 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has called on all to thwart what she said was a plot to turn country into a 'failed state'. "A conspiracy is going on against the country's independence and sovereignty at home and abroad and all have to be alert to it," she said on Monday. "The country is now in great distress. The price of commodities is going up. There is no sign of things getting better," Khaleda said. The former prime minister fed the destitute in observance of the 28th death anniversary of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, which fell on May 30, in front of Aganagar-Gudamghat under Keraniganj Upazila in Dhaka. She said the people had been without democracy for long. "But, no improvement has been seen even after this government came to power through elections." BNP standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, vice president Soroari Rahman, joint secretaries general Mirza Abbas and Gayeshwar Chandra Roy were present. The opposition leader earlier opened a food distribution programme among the destitute at 11:45pm at Rampura in the city. She later inaugurated food distribution programmes at Khilgaon, Jatrabari and Demra staff quarters. The three-day food distribution programme that started on Saturday ends on Monday. The last programme is supposed to be held at Aminbazar under Gabtali in the city. Khaleda is also supposed to participate at various food distribution programmes at 21 spots under Shyampur, Dhonia, Kadamtali and Keraniganj. She fed the needy at 85 spots for two days. General Zia was assassinated by a group of army officers at the Chittagong Circuit House on May 30, 1981. b
