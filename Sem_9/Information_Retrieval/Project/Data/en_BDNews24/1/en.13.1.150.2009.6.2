 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League and the main opposition BNP have not been able to settle the dispute over front row seating arrangements in parliament with its second session due to start on Thursday. "I have been holding talks with both the treasury and the opposition benches to settle the dispute over seating," speaker Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "The ruling party has agreed to offer five seats, but the BNP wants seven," he said. "I hope the matter will be resolved". At present, the BNP has four front row seats on the row facing the treasury bench, the Liberal Democratic Party has one, and the others on the row belong to the AL-led ruling coalition members. Chief whip of the opposition Joynul Abdin Farroque emerging from the meeting said: "We have not been given the 'respectable offer' as was previously promised by the Speaker." "I will take the proposal (of five seats) to BNP's parliamentary board. They will decide whether we will join the next session of parliament." Chief whip Abdus Shahid, however, maintained the ruling party's offer was a acceptable one. "We have not dishonoured the opposition with this offer. We made it according to parliamentary procedure." Shahid blamed immediate past speaker Md Jamiruddin Sircar for the instigating the dispute. The Jatiya Sangsad has a total of 29 front row seats that includes ruling and opposition benchesplaced in the form of horse shoe. Sircar, now a BNP MP, using his discretionary power enshrined in the rules of procedure of parliament, gave all front and second row seats at the left of the Speaker to the opposition. But the Awami League objected, saying the opposition party should not get more than three front row seats as the party had won only 30 seats against the total 300. Hamid reduced BNP's front row seats to four from eight at the start of the ninth parliament. BNP disputed the arrangement, saying the bench opposite the treasury was the 'opposition bench' after all, and began a parliamentary boycott on Jan 28. They returned to the House on Feb 23 as Hamid assured that he would give the opposition more seats if they joined budget session. Towards the end of the first session, BNP had requested speaker Hamid to deliver on his pledge of increasing their front bench seats, with an indirect hint of boycotting parliament again if his commitment remained unfulfilled. The rules of parliament say the speaker has the authority to change seating arrangements from time to time, in consultation with both the ruling and the opposition parties in parliament.
