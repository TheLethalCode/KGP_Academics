 Singapore, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan expects its military operation to defeat Taliban militants in the Swat valley to conclude in two or three days, a senior army official said on Sunday. "Only five to 10 percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within two to three days, the pockets of resistance will be cleared," Syed Athar Ali, secretary of defence for Pakistan, said at a regional defence meeting in Singapore. His comments came after the military said on Saturday that Pakistani forces had regained full control of Mingora, a week after re-entering the main town in the Swat valley to dislodge thousands of Taliban fighters. Recapturing Mingora, 130 km northwest of Islamabad, would raise the prospect that some of more than 2 million people who have fled the conflict zone could soon begin to go home, alleviating a humanitarian crisis. The United States and other Western allies have been heartened by the army's show of resolve in Swat. There had been fears for the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the Taliban threat had been allowed to spread any closer to the capital. Around 300,000 people lived in Mingora until the Taliban occupied the town in early May when the army first launched an offensive in Swat, an alpine valley in the country's northwest. Islamist militants have carried out a series of bomb and gun attacks in Pakistani cities during the last few days, in a bid to take the heat off their comrades retreating in Swat. There are expectations the army will turn its focus on the South Waziristan tribal region, bordering Afghanistan, once Swat has been pacified.
