 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)Film actor and alleged crime kingpin Monowar Hossain Dipjol was released from Dhaka Central Jail on Monday after the Appellate Division did not stay the High Court verdict cancelling his sentences in two arms cases. He was released at 6pm, an official of Prison Department told bdnews24.com on condition that he not be named because he was not authorised to brief the media. RAB arrested Dipjol, also a former BNP ward commissioner, on Dec 8 last year from a flat at Adabar and later sent him to Darus Salam Police Station. A Dhaka court later ordered him into jail, showing him arrested in six cases and custody warrant in three cases. Dipjol went into hiding after a changeover on Jan 11 in 2007. A special judge's court, set up in parliament complex, sentenced him to 17 and seven years in two arms cases in his absence on July 27, 2007. The High Court quashed the verdicts on Apr 26 this year. The government appealed the verdicts at the Appellate Division on May 3, but the chamber judge's court at the Appellate Division stayed the verdicts. The Supreme Court later withdrew the orders. The two arms cases were filed with Mirpur Model Police Station against Dipjol on Jan 16, 2007. bdnew
