<TITLE> North Korea's Kim moves to anoint youngest son as heir </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has signalled the anointment of his youngest son as heir to the ruling family dynasty as the two Koreas bolstered their militaries along a disputed sea border on Tuesday. North Korea has turned increasing belligerent since its internationally condemned nuclear test last week, actions analysts believe Kim Jong-il is using to give him greater leverage over power elites at home to nominate his own successor. It has raised alarm in the region over how far iron ruler Kim, 67 and thought to have suffered a stroke last year, may be prepared to take his latest military grandstanding. North Korea has asked the country's main bodies and its overseas missions to pledge loyalty to Kim's youngest son Kim Jong-un, various South Korean media outlets quoted informed sources as saying. "I was notified by the South Korean government of such moves and the loyalty pledges," Park Jie-won, a member of the opposition Democratic Party, said in a statement. He declined to name his source but the South's Yonhap news agency said Park was among a group of lawmakers briefed on Monday night by the country's spy agency about the succession plans. Kim Jong-un, born either in 1983 or early 1984, was educated in Switzerland and intelligence sources have said he appears to be the most capable of Kim's three known sons. Even by North Korea's opaque standards, very little is known about the son, whose youth is a potential problem in a society that adheres closely to the importance of seniority. "There is a significant link between North Korea's recent military provocations and succession issues," said Lee Dong-bok, an expert on the North's negotiating tactics. STOCKPILED AMMUNITION South Korea's Chosun Ilbo quoted a military source as saying the North had stepped up its military training, stockpiled ammunition and imposed a no-sail order off its west coast waters to prepare for a possible fight with the South. In Seoul, the navy said it was deploying a guided-missile naval vessel to the same area in the Yellow Sea, close to the disputed border that has seen two deadly clashes between the rival states in the past 10 years. The navy rarely announces such moves and it underscores the hardline being taken towards its communist neighbour by conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak who earlier in the day won support at a meeting he hosted of southeast Asian leaders who jointly condemned last weeks' nuclear test. Many analysts say the North may opt for a skirmish on the sea border as the next step as it ratchets up tension but few believe it would dare put its million-strong but poorly equipped army into direct battle with the U.S.-backed South Korean military. GUARDED SECRETS The succession has been one of the most closely guarded secrets in the highly secretive North. The South's Yonhap news agency quoted an informed source as saying the request for an oath of loyalty by North Korean officials to the youngest son came shortly after the nuclear test on May 25, which was hailed by the North's propaganda as a crowning achievement in Kim Jong-il's "military first" rule. Kim Jong-il, dubbed the "Dear Leader" by his state's propaganda apparatus, was groomed for decades to take over from his father and state founder "Great Leader" Kim Il-sung. The third generation of Kims is unknown to most North Koreans. But the South Korean daily Dong-a Ilbo reported that a song had been written for the third son, calling him "The Young Leader," another sign of his rise. In April, Kim Jong-il put to rest any doubt about whom he sees as his second in command when he elevated his brother-in-law Jang Song-taek to a powerful military post, analysts said. Analysts said they see the energetic and urbane Jang, 63, as the real power broker after Kim who will groom the successor. Jang, who once fell out of Kim's favour, has in recent year's been Kim's right hand man, they said
