 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)The met office on Tuesday said rain was likely in the south but called off storm alerts at maritime ports, causing a breath of relief after cyclone Aila's recent devastation. Meteorologist Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com, "The three maritime ports have been asked to lower local cautionary signal three as the weather showed signs of improvement." He said the monsoon winds were hovering over Bangladesh and the northern Bay of Bengal, however. "Though they are getting weaker, they may cause rainfall in the southern parts of the country," he said. The monsoon, usually beginning early June, has arrived earlier than usual this year in Aila's wake, say met officials. The weather office on Monday had advised Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar and Mongla ports to hoist local cautionary signal three until further notice. Panic spread along the Aila-hit coast as seas turned choppy once again. Cyclone Aila, which tore across the coastal belt just a week before, claimed over 150 lives and ravaged homes and lands. bd
