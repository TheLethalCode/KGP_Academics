 PARIS, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venus Williams was sent packing from the French Open with a humiliating 6-0 6-4 defeat by Hungary's Agnes Szavay in the third round on Friday. The American, who lost at the same stage in 2007 and 2008, did not recover from a miserable start as 29th seed Szavay advanced to meet Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova after 81 minutes. "I had a tough day, and I didn't get the ball in the court, and that didn't help me at all," Williams told a news conference. "It was just, a day where they didn't go in. So it was a little difficult to recover from that first set. I'm used to beating people 6-0. "I'm not used to my shot not going in and losing a set 6-0. So it completely was foreign ground for me." Williams needed three sets to overcome her first two opponents at Roland Garros and on Friday it seemed as if she had forgotten to turn up on Suzanne Lenglen Court when she lost the first set without even winning a game. It was the first time in almost two years Williams suffered that kind of an embarrassment. The American's last bagel was in a 7-6 0-6 6-4 victory over Russia's Nadia Petrova in a Fed Cup tie in July 2007. MISSED SHOTS The five-times Wimbledon champion notably missed an easy volley in the fourth game as Szavay was content with hitting the ball into the court. "Sometimes the more shots you miss, the harder it is to make the next one," said Williams. "It's just so important to leave that miss in the past and move forward." The 2002 runner-up fought back in the second set, forcing a break point in the third game when Szavay netted a forehand. The world number 31, however, produced a forehand down the line as Venus was trying to increase the pressure on her backhand side. A jaw-dropping backhand winner finally earned the American a break for 4-3. It was not enough to discourage Szavay, who broke straight back courtesy of yet another unforced error from Williams. Szavay kept up the momentum and ended Williams's Paris run on her first match point when the American netted a backhand. Williams was able to get a small amount of revenge on Szavay later in the day when she and her younger sister Serena teamed up to beat the Hungarian and her Argentine partner Gisela Dulko 2-6 6-1 6-2 in the doubles
