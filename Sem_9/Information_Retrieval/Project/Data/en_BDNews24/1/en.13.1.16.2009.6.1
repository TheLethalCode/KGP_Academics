 BAGHDAD, Jun 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb planted in a vegetable market killed four people and wounded 13 in southern Baghdad on Monday, police said, the second time the market has been attacked in just over two weeks. Police said the death toll from the blast in Baghdad's Doura district in the early hours, when farmers and merchants gather at the market, was unlikely to rise further. On May 21, a bomb in the same market killed three US soldiers and 12 civilians. The number of Iraqi civilians killed by violence fell last month to its lowest level since the 2003 US-led invasion, figures from the Ministry of Health showed, but militants still launch frequent bomb attacks
