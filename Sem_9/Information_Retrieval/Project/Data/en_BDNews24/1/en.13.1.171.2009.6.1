 PARIS, Mon Jun 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Air France plane flying from Brazil to Paris has gone missing with 228 people on board, the airline said on Monday. Its last known location was unclear. The Brazilian air force said its planes had begun searching for the airliner off the northeast coast of Brazil. Flight AF 447 has 216 passengers and 12 crew on board. It left Rio de Janeiro on Sunday at 7 p.m. (6:00 p.m. EDT) and was expected to land at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on Monday at 11:15 a.m. (5:15 a.m. EDT). "Air France regrets to announce that it is without news from flight AF 447," an Air France spokesman said. Henry Wilson, a Brazilian air force spokesman, said planes had taken off from the island of Fernando de Noronha off Brazil's northeast coast to look for the Air France jet. An Air France-KLM spokeswoman in Amsterdam said there had been no radio contact with the missing plane "for a while". The plane was an Airbus 330-200, according to the Paris airports authority website.
