 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu was detained on Tuesday, in connection with the BDR mutiny probe, as he emerged from the High Court after seeking a 'no arrest or harassment' order in the case. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner AKM Shahidul Haq said Pintu was arrested by Detective Branch police on charges of abetting the mutineers in fleeing the scene during Feb 25-26 armed uprising. "He will be handed over to Criminal Investigation Department as CID is investigating the case," said Haq. Pintu had submitted a petition to the court after his name appeared in the national enquiry committee's report on the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The probe report stated: "Some helpful civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river." After the government made the report public at the end of May, Pintu, fearing he would be taken into custody in connection with the case, petitioned the High Court for a 'no arrest or harassment' order. The BNP leader appeared before the bench of justices Tarikul Hakim and Azizul Haq at 3pm on Tuesday for a hearing on the petition. The bench gave no ruling on the plea. bdne
