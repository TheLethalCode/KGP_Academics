<TITLE> Exiled Hindus at Kashmir shrine hope to return soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TULUMUL, India, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Kashmiri Hindus who fled an Islamic insurgency in the Himalayan state 20 years ago, gathered at a holy shrine in the strife-torn region on Sunday to pray for an early return to their homeland. More than 250,000 Kashmiri Hindus, known as 'Pandits', fled their burning homes when a revolt against Indian rule in Kashmir broke out in 1989. Since then, migrant Pandits have gathered every year on this day at the white marbled shrine surrounded by huge green chinar trees and shimmering streams to chant hymns and walk barefoot, carrying marigolds, rose petals and earthenware lamps. Hundreds of gun-wielding police and soldiers guarded the Khirbhawani temple, the holiest shrine of Kashmiri Hindus in the disputed region, as the pilgrims offered prayers. "We all feel it (peace), the situation has improved very much and we think the time is ripe to return to our motherland," said 55-year-old teacher Awtar Krishan Koul, his optimism springing from a sharp drop in rebel violence in recent years. Officials say violence in Kashmir, involving Muslim militants and Indian troops, has fallen to its lowest level since the start of the revolt, which has killed tens of thousands of people. "I am a victim of the violence but still I want to return to the (Kashmir) Valley," said 35-year-old housewife Sarla Nehru, who said her brother was killed by militants in 1990. As she spoke, many pilgrims were making offerings of milk to the deity they consider the goddess of peace. The migration of the Pandits was the largest since Britain's 1947 partition of the subcontinent into mainly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan, officials say. India's National Human Rights Commission puts the number of migrant Kashmiri Hindus at 300,000. Some Kashmiri Pandits made their way to New Delhi in 1989, others scattered to other parts of the country, but thousands live in abysmal conditions in the state's winter capital, Jammu, with families of five to six packed in a room. Kashmir's main separatist alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, and the government have repeatedly urged them to return. But many young Pandits remain sceptical. "I am sure this place will always be dangerous for us, I don't want to die here," said engineering student Awatar Bhat. "After two decades of terrorism, I don't think Muslims and Hindus can live together." From the 13th century, when Islam became Kashmir's majority religion, until 1989, Muslims lived side by side with Pandits. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three post-independence wars over Kashmir, but violence has fallen markedly across the region since they began peace talks in 2004. Outside the ancient Khirbhawani temple, Muslim boys and girls sold flowers, plants and lamps to Hindu pilgrims, as troops searched for explosives and frisked worshippers.
