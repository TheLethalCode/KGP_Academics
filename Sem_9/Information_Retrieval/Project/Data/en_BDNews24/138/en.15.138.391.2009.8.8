 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government is working toward a coordinated policy and approach to protect intellectual property rights in Bangladesh, and wants to bring all related agencies under one roof. Two ministries are already working on it. However, the officials of industry ministry and the cultural ministry are not seeing eye-to-eye. At present, the patent, design and trademark registry offices are under one directorate of the industry ministry while the copyright office is under the cultural affairs ministry. A suggestion was put forward, in a meeting of the Bangladesh Better Business Forum in June last year, to bring all offices related to intellectual property rights under one roof with the creation of a Bangladesh Intellectual Property Organisation (BIPO). The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and development partners have also suggested merging the related offices, say government officials. Enamul Haque, registrar of the patents, designs and trademarks directorate, told bdnews24.com earlier this week, "The offices under this directorate, as well as the copyright office, are all interrelated with one another. If they come under one roof then better services can be provided." But, in spite of several meetings between the officials of the industry and culture ministries they have failed to agree on the proposed new agency. Officials of the industry ministry say the cultural ministry is opposing the initiative because the proposed BIPO would be under the industry ministry. "We are trying to take the initiative to unite the four offices for convenience. But we are unable to do so for objection from the cultural ministry," said one top official, not wanting to be named. Cultural secretary Sharful Alam told bdnews24.com, "We are not for any kind of rushed decision. We will have to do our homework and analyse the positive and negative aspects of such a move." "We are yet to reach any conclusion." "We have said that a conclusion could have been reached had there been inter-ministerial meetings to discuss the pros and cons before making such a decision," said Alam. The present patents, designs and trade marks directorate itself emerged from a similar decision not long ago to unite the previously independent trademarks registry and controller of patents offices that had once been under the control of the commerce ministry. The Trademarks Act and The Patents and Designs Act in 2003 "to ensure effective functioning of the merged offices newly styled as the 'Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Directorate" under the industry ministry. The copyright office, meanwhile, was founded in 1962 to govern copyright and related rights for books, music and other creative works in Bangladesh. It is situated at the National Library building at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The culture ministry on its website says, "Copyright law is a section of 'Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)' law." Tanjib-Ul Alam, a Supreme Court lawyer specialising in intellectual property rights law, said, "All these related issues are dealt with by one agency in many countries in the world," he said. "But here, we have to go to the trademark office for a logo and to the copyright office for a name." Businesses and industry say they need better copyright, patent and design policies to keep pace with the international community Industries minister Dilip Barua has repeatedly stressed the importance of intellectual property rights, and their proper application in business, for socio-economic development. "It is very sad that Bangladesh has had no comprehensive intellectual property policy," said Barua in April. He said the current world scenario requires modern legislation. The government has taken initiatives on this since coming to power in January. It passed the Trademarks Law 2009 and is formulating an updated patent and design law, say industry ministry officials. Barua has recently mentioned a diversity of cultural products that needed protection, such as Jamdani saris, rosh malai, famous folksongs, traditional dances, and the rich culture of indigenous communities. Bangladesh Computer Association President, Mostafa Jabbar, has said there is absolutely no application of copyright law against piracy in bangladesh. The music, film and software industries were on the verge of ruination "thanks to piracy", say industry leaders. Bangladesh, meanwhile, has been named the worst offender for software piracy in the Asian Pacific region and the second worst in the world. According to the Global Software Piracy Study 2008, conducted by IDC, the IT industry's leading global market research and forecasting firm, software piracy in Bangladesh rates at a staggering 92 percent. The worst offender is Georgia at 95 percent, followed by Armenia and Zimbabwe joining Bangladesh at 92 percent. The IDC report warned that piracy is crippling the local industry and costing local retailers $102 million a year. Officials say land has already been allocated at Agargaon for the Bangladesh Intellectual Property Organisation (BIPO). Automation of patents, designs and trade marks directorate is also underway. All that remains is for the two ministries is to bury their differences in the interests of strengthening intellectual property rights in Bangladesh to safeguard local industries and raise the country's reputation abroad. b
