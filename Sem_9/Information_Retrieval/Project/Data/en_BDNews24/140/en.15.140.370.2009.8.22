 WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama praised the Afghanistan election on Friday as a move in the right direction but warned that violence may continue as official results are finalized. "This was an important step forward in the Afghan people's effort to take control of their future even as violent extremists are trying to stand in their way," Obama said at the White House. "Over the last few days, particularly yesterday, we've seen acts of violence and intimidation by the Taliban, and there ... may be more in the days to come," he said. Obama praised the millions of Afghans who came out to vote on Thursday despite the threat of violence. "I was struck by their courage in the face of intimidation and their dignity in the face of disorder," he said. "There is a clear contrast between those who seek to control their future at the ballot box and those who kill to prevent that from happening." Obama said the United States had not supported a specific candidate in the election and promised to continue working to strengthen security and governance in Afghanistan as the election results are set. Afghan President Hamid Karzai's campaign and chief rival Abdullah Abdullah both said on Friday they had won the poll. The election is major test for Karzai after eight years in office and for Obama's new regional strategy to defeat the Taliban and stabilize Afghanistan. "Our goal is clear: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and their extremist allies. That goal will be achieved," Obama said. "We look forward to renewing our partnership with the Afghan people as they move ahead under a new government.
