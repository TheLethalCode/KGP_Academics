 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)State counsel Anisul Haque has said the state will apply for an Oct 4 hearing date to begin the long-stalled appeals process in the Bangabandhu murder trial. Haque also said on Sunday that he had submitted an abstract of the government's arguments against the appeals of the convicted. He told reporters at his Supreme Court chamber, "The next step in the the appeals hearings depends on the chamber judge of the Appellate Division." He said, "I will apply to the chamber judge on Monday for a date for appeal proceedings to begin. We will apply for a hearing on October 4." "It is not possible to start the hearing before August 27, when the Supreme Court goes into a month-long vacation. Moreover, hearing of the BDR murder reference will start from August 25." "So we will ask for a hearing October 4, the day the Supreme Court returns from vacation," Haque said. The hearing may start on that day if the chief justice, who is the authority to fix the date, allows. Asked what arguments were presented in the abstract, Haque said that the state argued in favour of the previous High Court rulings in the case. Independence architect Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were killed on Aug 15, 1975, with the convicts still having appeals pending 34 years after the killings. The administration of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed, installed after Sheikh Mujib's assassination, passed an ordinance in November 1975 indemnifying the killers and closing the door to a trial for many years. The Awami League government, coming to power in 1996, revoked the indemnity law to clear the way for trial. Mujib's former personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case against 20 people that year. On Nov 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded the death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused. The High Court upheld the death sentences of 12. Five of the 12 appealed against the sentences from behind bars, while six of those convicted remain overseas. The appeals remained pending over the years for lack of Appellate Division judges, until the Awami League government made four new appointments last month. The government is also working to bring back the six absconding convicts from abroad. bdnews2
