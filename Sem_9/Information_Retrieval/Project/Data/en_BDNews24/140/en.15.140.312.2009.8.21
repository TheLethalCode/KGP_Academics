 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka consolidated their dominance on the fourth morning of the first Test with New Zealand on Friday, reaching lunch on 76 for one in their second innings having already built a 229-run lead. New Zealand's fight to save the opening Test was not helped by a stomach bug effecting seven members of the playing eleven. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and batsman Jesse Ryder were the mostly severely affected and forced to stay at the hotel as their team mates were bowled out for 299, a deficit of 153, after 35 minutes of play on the fourth day. Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Daniel Flynn, Tim McIntosh and Chris Martin were also affected, team manager Dave Currie said. Spinner Muttiah Muralitharan finished with four for 73 from 42 overs while seamer Thilan Thushara claimed four for 81 as the Sri Lankans took the final two wickets of New Zealand's innings. Daniel Vettori was last man out, bowled by Thushara for 42. Opener Tillakaratne Dilshan then gave the hosts a rousing start, blazing 46 off just 31 balls with six fours and one six. Skipper Kumar Sangakkara was unbeaten on 20. The one casualty for Sri Lanka was left-hander Tharanga Paranavitana (five) who edged a delivery from Iain O'Brien to slip. Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara allowed the tourists to use reserve wicketkeeper Reece Young in the second innings, because of the illness suffered by Ryder, who was McCullum's backup in the starting side.
