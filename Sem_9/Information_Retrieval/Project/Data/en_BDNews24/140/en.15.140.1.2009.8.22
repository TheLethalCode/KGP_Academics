 Chittagong, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)-A bus carrying over 40 passengers on Friday night hurtled off a bridge into a roadside ditch at Hathajari in Chittagong, leaving at least 10 injured, police said. The crash occurred at 10pm as the bus tried to avoid a collision with a CNG-run auto-rickshaw. The bus careered through the Bhanagr Pool bridge railing. Police recovered ten people from the crashed car and took them to the local hospital. Officer in charge of Hathazari Police Station Ismail Hossain told bdnews24.com that police and fire servicemen started the rescue work at 9:45pm. According to local journalist Keshob Kumar, the bus that had been heading for Khagrachharhi from Chittagong went underwater as the depth of the ditch increased due to heavy rainfall over the past few days. Assistant police commissioner of Hathazari region Babul Akhtar told bdnews24.com at midnight that the rescue work was going on as more passengers might be trapped in the bus. Deputy director of fire servicemen at Chittagong region Jashim Uddin told bdnews24.com: "Locals are saying that 20-25 more bodies can be trapped in the bus." "Five fire service units have been running the rescue work." "But it will take more time as there was a lot of water in the ditch." bd
