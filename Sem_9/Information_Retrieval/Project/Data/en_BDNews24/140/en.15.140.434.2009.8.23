 Dhaka, August 23 (bdnews24.com) Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak opened a training programme for volunteers under the Cyclone Preparedness Programme on Sunday that ultimately aims to instruct over 40,000 coastal residents in how to deal with natural calamities. "Through this government initiative volunteers from coastal areas will be able to work independently," Razzak told the opening ceremony of the CPP initiative at the Fire Service Training Centre in Mirpur. Training will initially be given to 44 leaders, who will pass on their knowledge to local volunteers located in the coastal belt. The leaders' training is expected to be completed before the end of Ramadan. The training will include techniques on how to deal with natural calamities including tsunamis. "The government also has plans to increase the height of coastal embankments, and build safe houses and cyclone shelters as part of a wider infrastructure and rehabilitation project, to be started by December," said Razzak. At present, the CPP is working in 32 coastal upazilas, with four upazilas in Khulna and Satkhira, which were hit hard by Cyclone Aila, expected to join the initiative soon. The government has also formed a probe committee to investigate discontent among volunteers over their honorariums under the CPP. "The government will take steps following the investigation, which should be submitted within a few days," he said. b
