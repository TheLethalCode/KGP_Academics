<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia called on the government on Saturday to stabilise the price of commodities in the market, ensure law and order and a steady supply of essential utilities for the month of Ramadan. "I demand the government, at the very least, stabilise the prices of consumable goods, as our government succeeded in doing," Khaleda said in a statement issued on the eve of Ramadan. The former two-time prime minister claimed that her government had been successful in stabilising the price of essentials in previous years by supplying subsidies and monitoring the market during Ramadan. Khaleda said the government also had to maintain electricity, gas and water supplies across the country during the fasting period so the people did not suffer unnecessarily. She said the government was responsible for spiralling kitchen market prices ahead of Ramadan. "Unstable prices of essentials have been a burden on the people, whose income has reduced in comparison to the past," she said. "One of the government's most important election pledges was to provide the people with commodities at cheap rates," said Khaleda. She said the government had demonstrably failed to fulfil the pledge over the previous eight months. "A death-rattle in public life has followed the spiralling price of essentials," she said.
