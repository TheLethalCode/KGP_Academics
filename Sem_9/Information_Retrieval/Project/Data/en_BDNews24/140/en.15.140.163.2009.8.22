<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)Trade body BKMEA has said its member organisations will sell rice at a fixed rate to workers in the knitwear sector during Ramadan to help protect them from the worst affects of expected price hikes in kitchen market essentials. "The association has taken the step to protect the workers from the influence of elevated prices during Ramadan," Mahfuza Akhter, public relations officer of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufactures and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com on Saturday. BKMEA will start the operation this week, with food minister Abdur Razzak expected to inaugurate the initiative in Narayanganj on Aug 26, said Akhter. Under the system, eligible employees will be permitted to purchase five kilograms of rice a month at the fixed rate of Tk 16 a kilogram. The food directorate will supply the rice. Head of the Directorate General of Food, Badrul Hassan, and BKMEA vice-president Jahidul Haque Bhuiyan signed a deal on the initiative on Thursday. Akhter said as many as 100,000 employees of around 1,600 BKMEA member organisations would benefit from the programme. The rice sales will start in the Narayanganj area before being rolled out in the rest of the country, she said. Akhter said BKMEA had been selling rice and other essentials to its workers at reduced rates over Ramadan for the last two years.
