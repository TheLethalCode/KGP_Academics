 Dhaka, August 23 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court issued an immediate one-day stay on a High Court order issued to authorities on Sunday to release jailed former minister Shahjahan Siraj on bail "within an hour". A High Court bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and SM Imdadul Haque had issued its order at 1pm, to release the former minister and produce him in the court by 2pm, on a contempt petition filed by Siraj. Siraj's petition sought to have contempt of court charges pressed against the government for failing to release him despite his being awarded High Court bail in two graft cases. "The court has ordered the home secretary, IG prisons, DIG prisons, jailor, jail superintendent and acting jail super to release Shajahan Siraj within an hour," Siraj's daughter, barrister Sarwat Siraj, told bdnews24.com after the High Court order. "It also ordered authorities to produce him in court at 2pm," she said. The government immediately sought to appeal against the High Court order. Appellate Division chamber judge, Md Mozammel Hossain, at 2.30pm, stayed the High Court order for a day on the government's petition seeking leave to appeal. It also stayed the bail orders granted to the BNP leader, convicted in the two graft cases, for a day. Hossain set Monday for a hearing on the government's petition. Siraj's lawyer, barrister Rafiqul Haque, told the High Court in the earlier hearing, "On August 18, the High Court granted Shahjahan Siraj bail in the two cases and he has submitted the bail bonds. But he was not released despite the court order." Additional attorney general AKM Jahirul Haque, however, told the court, "Siraj received bail in the two cases prior to August 18, but the Appellate Division stayed the bail orders. Siraj then went and got bail anew from the High Court." The High Court said there was no problem in his being granted bail afresh. As the additional attorney general sought more time to prepare for the proceedings of the contempt charge, the High Court ordered the government to release the accused and produce him in the court within an hour's time. The High Court had said it would otherwise rule the government in contempt of court. Shahjahan Siraj, a former forests and environment minister of the BNP government, was sent to jail after he surrendered to court in connection with the two graft cases on June 30. Siraj was sentenced to eight years on August 29, 2007, for tax evasion. He was sentenced to 13 years on April 23, 2008, in an illegal wealth case. His wife Rabeya Siraj, son Rajib Siraj and daughter-in-law Farzana Khan have also been convicted in tax evasion cases. bdnew
