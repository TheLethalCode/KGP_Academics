 VALENCIA, Spain (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton grabbed his first pole position of the season at the European Grand Prix on Saturday in an all-McLaren front row. The 24-year-old, winner of the previous race in Hungary, took his 14th career pole ahead of Finnish team mate Heikki Kovalainen on a sizzling afternoon in Valencia with air temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius. The Briton last occupied the front of the grid slot in China last October. "It's great to know that we can continue with the momentum of the last race," said Hamilton, whose title hopes have long evaporated after starting the season with a woefully uncompetitive car.

"I made a mistake on the last corner which cost me a lot of time, but it doesn't matter. This is all a test for me, this is the only way I can learn," the 38-year-old Italian told BBC radio. "I am still enjoying it and tomorrow the race will be exciting. I will do my best to hopefully, maybe, overtake somebody." Spain's local favourite Fernando Alonso qualified eighth for Renault, with his new French team mate Romain Grosjean starting in 14th place. Adrian Sutil lifted Force India's spirits in their quest for a first point, seizing 12th place in a Mercedes-powered car with a major upgrade for the wee
