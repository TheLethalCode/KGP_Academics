 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)--Main opposition BNP has hinted at not attending the third session of the ninth parliament that begins on Sept 7. The government has failed to create the right environment for the opposition to go back to parliament, said secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. BNP boycotted the first session over a row over the distribution of seats on the front row and stayed away from the second session too. "Their [government] cases are being withdrawn while the cases against the opposition activists are being tried. How will we go to parliament in this situation?" Scores of cases filed for political persecution during the tenures of BNP-led coalition government and caretaker administration against the leaders and workers of Awami League are being withdrawn by the incumbent government headed by the AL. However, the committee working on these cases has yet to suggest withdrawal of any cases against BNP leaders. Earlier in the morning, Delwar placed floral wreaths on the grave of Ziaur Rahman, late president and founder of BNP, at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Leaders of the newly formed convener committee of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal of Dhaka metropolitan city (north and south) accompanied him. The BNP secretary general demanded proper trial for all killings including those in the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on the AL rally. "We are against all forms of killings including those in the August 21 [grenade attack]. The incident was investigated during the rule of our government. But this government did not like that investigation. So, they have started the investigation anew." BNP leader and former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu is a defendant in the case. "Awami League does not believe in democracy. Democracy was dead up to August 14, 1975 since independence during their tenure. "This time, after taking power, they have transformed the country into a prison by killing and torturing the leaders and workers of the opposition party," Delwar alleged. He criticised the government's stance on proposed construction of Tipaimukh Dam by India and the partial withdrawal of army from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, among other things. "The government is busy catering for those who put them in power. They are not protecting the rights of the people of this country." He said the ruling AL is engaged in extortion and terrorism and curbing of the opposition's right to speak. b
