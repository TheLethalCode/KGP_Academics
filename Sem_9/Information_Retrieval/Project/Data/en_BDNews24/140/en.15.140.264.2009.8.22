 Mohsinul Karim, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, August 22 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka City Corporation has said it plans to replace their aging open-roofed garbage trucks with a 100-strong fleet of modern covered vehicles, although plans to utilise the capital's waste to produce energy and fertiliser have stalled. "The import process for the vehicles has begun, with the assistance of Jica (Japan International Corporation Agency), and a tender has been floated," Tareq Bin Naser, project director of DCC's waste management cell, told bdnews24.com on Saturday. Naser said the Japanese government was giving the assistance under its environment and climate change fund, and the vehicles should be in the country by February. "The vehicles will include 35 CNG-driven compaction vans, which will shrink the waste. A DCC workshop is being opened for maintenance of the vans," said Naser, also an expert on waste management in the Asia-Pacific region. He said DCC planned to stop the practice of dumping the city's waste in the open, but added that there are currently few specific rules regarding waste management in the city. "NGOs or commercial organisations collect domestic waste from different areas of the city. At present, DCC is registering these organisations and giving them certificates," Naser said. "They are also being given demarcated areas to dump the waste on. DCC will then remove the waste in a timely fashion from those areas," he said. Naser said social workers at the ward-level and new education programmes in schools would drive home the importance of proper household waste management and improve social awareness on the issue. The DCC official, however, said it would be impossible to start a planned project to produce energy and fertilisers from waste materials in the immediate future. He said various methods of utilising the city's waste to produce biogas and fertilisers had been tried, but interest from investors had been minimal. "A non-governmental organisation called Waste Concern built six plants to produce fertiliser on land from different organizations, including DCC," said Naser, who added that demand for the fertiliser remained low due to high production costs. "Unfortunately, almost all of their plants are now closed," he said. The cost of electricity produced from waste material would also be prohibitively high, said Naser, who added that the government would have to heavily subsidise any such projects. Anwar Hossain Talukdar, senior assistant of DCC's local government division, said the city corporation still collects waste manually, a system that no longer exists in any other country in the world. Talukdar told bdnews24.com the city's only large-scale landfill site at Sayedabad was now being modernised. "We are also setting up another landfill at Aminbazar in the city, which should be completed by next year," said Talukdar. "With two landfills, there should be no problem with waste management for the next thirty years," he said. bdn
