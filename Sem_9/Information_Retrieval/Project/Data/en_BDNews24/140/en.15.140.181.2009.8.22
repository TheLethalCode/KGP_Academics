 Patuakhali, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)Awami League parliamentary whip ASM Firoz said on Friday that construction of six planned bridges to connect Dhaka with the south of the country would half the travel time needed to reach the seaside tourist resort of Kuakata. "It will take only four hours to reach Kuakata from Dhaka if constructions of the Padma, Dapdapiya and Labukhali bridges, as well as three other spans in Kalapara district are completed," Firoz told reporters at Patuakhali Circuit House on Saturday. Firoz said Kuakata had the potential to become one of the leading tourist destinations in the world, with employment opportunities in the town possibly reaching 500,000 in the tourist sector alone. He said the popular tourist resort on the Bay of Bengal would get a much needed boost from improved communications. "One of Kuakata's attractions is that you can watch both the sun-rise and sun-set from the same spot .However, many tourists are unwilling to travel there because of the poor roads," said Firoz. Road communications with Kuakata were snapped for 12 hours on Thursday, when the pontoon at the Hajipur ferry crossing in Kalapara upazila sank. Road communications with Kuakata have been severed seven times in the previous month alone. Turning to another topic, Firoz said opponents of the government were trying to create uncertainty on the issue of the army's withdrawal from the Chittagong Hill Tracts. "According to the peace accord, the government will provide security to settlers in the region as well as the hill people. But, if necessary, the government could redeploy the army in the area," he said. bdnews
