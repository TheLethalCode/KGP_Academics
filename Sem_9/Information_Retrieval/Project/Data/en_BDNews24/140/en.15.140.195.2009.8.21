 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Sheikh Selim on Friday demanded trial of then the army chief who did nothing to save independence leader and president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from being killed in 1975. Selim said their activities must be investigated. "What sort of army chief were you that you did not go while the president asked you to?" he said addressing maj gen K M Shafiullah at a discussion meeting in Dhaka to mark the fifth anniversary of the grenade attack on an AL rally. "You could have proved your patriotism by sacrificing your life, but you did not. You could not stop 200 soldiers with your 50,000-strong troops." "Bangabandhu tried you over phone for hours but you did not go to help him out," he added. "You have to pay for this."
