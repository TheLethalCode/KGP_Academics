 Gazipur, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)--A Gazipur court on Friday jailed seven Islami Chhatra Shibir activists, arrested at the Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET) campus on Thursday. Police raided the Shibir-controlled 'Dhanshiri' hall on Thursday night and arrested Imrul Kashem Porag, 23, Billal Hossain, 25, Wahab Ali, 27, Md Yasir Arafat, 21, Shariful Islam, 22, Manjurul Islam, 24, and Ahammad Imtiaz, 21. Officer-in-charge of Joydebpur Police Station Abdur Rashid said police arrested them on suspicion since they failed to prove their identity. Khalilur Rahman, assistant sub-inspector of general recording office of Gazipur court, said senior judicial divisional magistrate's court ordered them into jail at 4:30pm. The tension between pro-Awami League Bangladesh Chhatra League and Jamaat-e-Islami- backed Shibir rose over sticking of posters of a Shibir-supported coaching centre ahead of the National Mourning Day on Aug 15. The announcement of cancelled exams on Thursday led to further unrest on the campus as protesting students ransacked buildings and staged demonstrations that spilled onto surrounding roads. Students were directed to leave the campus by 6pm, but they defied the order and vandalised property on the campus. Later, police drove male students out of the hall at 10pm. bdnews24
