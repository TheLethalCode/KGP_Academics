 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)A recent survey on public perception of the police suggested that police reforms may be working in model thana areas where crime was perceived to be reduced and access to justice was seen improved compared to a baseline survey conducted in 2006. The findings of the 2008 survey showed that police earned the confidence of people in the model thanas since the Police Reform Programme (PRP) was first implemented in 2005. Complaints, crime level, influence and bribery were perceived to be reduced. The government of Bangladesh, with the United Nations Development Programme, UK's Department for International Development) and the European Commission, has been running the programme in 11 model thanas throughout the country to encourage police to be more responsive to the needs of poor and vulnerable communities. A baseline survey was conducted in 2006, with the follow-up survey carried out in December 2008 to assess the effectiveness of the programme. Inspector General of Police Nur Muhammad revealed the findings of the 'Public Attitude Follow-up Survey' on Friday at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. The survey was conducted in seven of the 11 model thanas, four non-model thanas and two control thanas around the country. The surveyors interviewed both general public respondents and police personnel. The findings said contact with police and number of complaints lodged (General Diaries/First Information Reports) increased as police responses, filing of complaints and the process of taking statements improved in the model thanas. It also said the Community Policing Forum, a venture comprising civil society representatives along with administrative personnel, was gradually becoming popular. Significant number of victims, both men and women, received police assistance in the Victim Support Centres and said they were satisfied with the process of reporting crimes to the police under the PRP. The survey respondents appreciated the recruitment of women police and supported more recruitment. They also said incidence of bribes to the police reduced tremendously, though most of the police personnel were still highly dissatisfied with their current salaries and allowances and sought for a raise competitive with other services. "External pressures" on the police also appeared reduced, the survey says. Though the survey report said that might be due to the fact that pressure groups were much less active due to the two-year state of emergency (imposed in 2007 and 2008). However, external pressure on police operations still remains a significant issue, the report said. Very few people were found to be aware of Open Day House, a regular views exchange meeting held by police inviting public opinion, and recommendations came for providing permanent space and resources to organise the event. The survey report recommended, on a whole, to implement the government's political commitment to ensure law and order in the country, ensuring that they would function in an environment free from external interference and influence. The training programmes for the police personnel were found very effective and suggestions were made for further training in crime prevention, investigation, use of fire arms, IT and on gender sensitivity. It said a modern police force must have modern equipment for investigation, surveillance and monitoring. The PRP, after its perceived success in model thanas, will continue to its second phase from October this year.
