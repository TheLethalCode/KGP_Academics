 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)Scholastica, one of the country's largest private schools, announced it would close its doors for an indefinite period from Sunday "as a precaution against swine flu", although health and education officials stressed on Saturday there was no government directive to close educational institutions. The number of confirmed H1N1 cases reached triple digits on Saturday, and authorities have all along been advising schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. "But the government had not issued any notice regarding school closures because of swine flu," Dr Mahmudur Rahman, Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told bdnews24.com on Saturday. Subodh Chandra Dhali, the education ministry's senior information officer, also told bdnews24.com that no directive had been issued by the ministry to close educational institutions as a precaution against the H1N1 flu virus. Dr Rahman said, "The situation is still under control." He said four more cases of swine flu had been confirmed in Bangladesh on Saturday, taking the total number of cases detected in the country to 102. Three of the four new cases have been admitted to hospital, said Rahman, who added that the other victims of the virus had either made a full recovery or were recovering. Farhana Alam, vice-principal of the English-medium Scholastica, told bdnews24.com, "The school will remain closed from Sunday (Aug 23) until further notice as a precaution against the spread of swine flu." She said a text message had been sent out to guardians of Scholastica pupils on Saturday advising them of the decision. Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque, earlier in the week, said there was no need to panic, although the number of confirmed swine flu cases had more than doubled in a matter of days, from just 37 on Aug 15 to 74 on Aug 18. He suggested that people across the country should go to their nearest health centre if they have any respiratory problems coupled with fever. He also told people to be aware of simple measures they could take to prevent spread of the H1N1 virus. "People must use handkerchiefs when sneezing. One should refrain from spitting in public and should wash hands using soap and water after fits of coughing," the minister told a briefing on Thursday after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat. Haque said: "We have handled the situation well so far. The authorities have been directed to beef up preparations to deal with the situation for the future." bdnews24.
