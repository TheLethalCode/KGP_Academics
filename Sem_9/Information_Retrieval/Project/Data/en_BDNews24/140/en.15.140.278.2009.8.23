 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Sunday slammed city developer RAJUK for a financial black hole, as the government agency's statements were still missing from the years 2002-06. The parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings also strongly advised the agency to refund deposit money with interest to applicants who failed to get plots in RAJUK projects. The committee chairman Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir said RAJUK had not prepared its financial statements for the five years from 2002 to 2006. Committee member Moinuddin Khan Badal told bdnews24.com, "We are very dissatisfied with the financial management of RAJUK." The committee at its meeting Sunday observed that RAJUK has collected hundreds of crores of taka in deposits over the years as part of applications for plots in different developments, but delayed for years in refunding them to failed applicants. Alamgir said, "RAJUK after years of delay, during which it accrues interest on the deposit money, only refunds the original amount to failed applicants," said Alamgir. "We have recommended that RAJUK return the money to the clients with the interest the money generates," he told reporters at parliament's media centre. The chairman, a former secretary to the government, said there was no legal bar in refunding the money with interest. "Instead, RAJUK does injustice by not repaying interest," he said. Badal said, according to available figures, RAJUK currently holds deposits totalling Tk 427 crore collected from applicants for plot allocations in different developments. Committee seeks list of plots Alamgir said his committee had also asked RAJUK to submit a list of influential people who received plots in the past despite already owning plots or flats in city. "We have proof that former advisers to the caretaker government Mainul Hosein was allocated government plots though he had several houses in Dhaka city," said Alamgir. "He concealed information about the houses," said the chairman. He said, according to the terms and conditions of plot allocation, RAJUK could at any time cancel plots allocated to anyone if any of the information submitted to the agnecy proved wrong.
