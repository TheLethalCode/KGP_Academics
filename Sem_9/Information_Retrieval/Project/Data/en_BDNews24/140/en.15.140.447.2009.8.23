 Dhaka, Aug 23(bdnews24.com)Contradictory statements from government officials and market operators over "spiralling prices" have left unscrupulous traders with a chance to profiteer, leaving confused consumers out of pocket. In the latest ministerial statement on the issue, commerce minister Faruque Khan on Sunday said he had advised all divisional commissioners to take legal action against traders making excessive profits on kitchen market goods. Retailers in the country's kitchen markets, however, routinely point the finger at wholesaler 'syndicates' for hiking prices, while the wholesalers pass the blame to criminal gangs and other extortionists demanding illegal tolls in the transport sector. Not to be left out, finance minister AMA Muhith earlier on Sunday blamed the media for hyping concerns over kitchen market price hikes, giving retailers a readymade excuse to inflate their prices. "It is right that some prices have increased. But we have not seen the kind of dissatisfaction from consumers as reported in media," Muhith told reporters after a meeting on commodity prices at the Secretariat. On Aug 16, food minister Abdur Razzak said endemic corruption in the transport sector was at the root of the perennial problem of elevated prices of Ramadan essentials. Razzak claimed as much as 70 percent of the money required to hire trucks goes on countless demands for extortion made while the goods are transported, which the public ended up paying for. A cold-storage worker from Thakurgaon told bdnews24.com at Kawran Bazar on Saturday night that businessmen in his area bought and stored 90 kilogramme sacks of potato from local producers for around Tk 1,170. "A sack is sold for about Tk 1,400 at the local market," he said. "But when the potatoes arrive in Dhaka they are sold at about Tk 28 a kilogramme in retail markets, which means that one 90 kg sack sells for around Tk 2,500, up from Tk 1,170," the cold storage worker said. In Joypurhat, a sack of potatoes is even cheaper, around Tk 650 taka, but the price is the same when it hits the capital's markets. It is this huge price hike or 'price-fixing' that is routinely blamed on so-called wholesaler syndicates. Truckers and traders at Karwan Bazar, the main destination for kitchen produce from across the country, say its the same for all produce coming in from across the country. Wholesalers, however, say extortion costs during transport of goods to Dhaka force them to put their prices up. One Kawran Bazar wholesaler told bdnews24.com on Saturday night, "We also have to give tolls to the wholesalers association and to musclemen. And after bearing the expense of a godown and shop, we do not have much profit left at all," said On the same night, truck driver Anwar Hossain at Karwan Bazar said he had to count Tk 1700 in bribes and tolls at eight stoppages on his way to Dhaka from Jessore carrying vegetables, including the staple onion. "A police sergeant took Tk 400 at Magura," Anwar said. However, truck drivers from the north and districts closer to the capital said they do not have to give much in the way of illegal tolls, but they still had to pay police bribes, quoting between Tk 300 to 1000 depending on the route. Another wholesaler, Mohammad Sharif, said certain price hikes at certain times were unavoidable. He said the price of chillies had risen exhorbitantly in recent days due to supply shortages resulting from heavy rains, while demand for brinjal, a Ramadan staple, had shot up simply because of huge demand. But Monir Hossain, a retail vegetable seller from Muhammadpur, says wholesalers make "hefty profits" whatever their complaints and excuses. "I buy from Karwan Bazar wholesalers. But according to the price we give to the wholesalers there, we retailers barely earn much. If anyone sees hefty profits, it is the wholesalers," he said. Commerce minister Faruque Khan told reporters at the National Press Club on Sunday that experience of past years had proved the market could not be regulated through legal action alone. He said a trip to two markets in the city had revealed goods being sold at significantly higher prices than fixed by the Dhaka City Corporation. This, of course, comes as little surprise to city shoppers. bdnews24
