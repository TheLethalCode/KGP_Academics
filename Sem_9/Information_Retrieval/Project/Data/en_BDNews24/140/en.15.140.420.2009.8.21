 NEW DELHI, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India gave Pakistan on Friday a new dossier of evidence to prosecute Hafiz Saeed, the suspected mastermind of the three-day carnage that killed 166 people in Mumbai in November, television channels said. The new dossier on Saeed, founder of a Pakistani militant group blamed for the attacks on Mumbai, comes two weeks after Islamabad said evidence supplied by India against Saeed was too weak to prosecute him. Indian officials have insisted Pakistan has enough evidence to successfully prosecute leaders of the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group, including Saeed. Times Now news channel and other television channels said the dossier on Saeed's involvement was handed over to Pakistani High Commissioner Shahid Malik by Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao after a meeting in New Delhi. No immediate comment was available from the foreign ministry. Saeed was detained in the wake of the Mumbai attacks after a U.N. Security Council resolution put him on a list of people and organisations supporting al Qaeda. But in June, the Lahore High Court released him on grounds of insufficient evidence, prompting the Pakistan government to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court for his re-arrest.
