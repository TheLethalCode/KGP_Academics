 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Sunday extended a stay order on the government notice to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia to vacate her cantonment house, by four more months, a lawyer said. The bench of justices of Syed Reefat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury gave the order on a petition by Khaleda regarding the notice to quit her 6 Moinul Road residence. Khaleda's lawyer Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan told bdnews24.com that the court had extended the stay order for another four months effective from Aug 26. Deputy attorney general Mojibor Rahman Miah stood for the government in the hearing. The court initially stayed the government notice for three months on May 27. The directorate of military lands and cantonments served Khaleda the original notice on April 20, asking her to immediately vacate the cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. Khaleda, who is also leader of the opposition, filed a petition with the High Court on May 3 challenging the executive order. The HC bench of justices Syed Reefat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury accepted the petition for hearing on May 12 after four benches declined it. The cabinet had earlier decided to cancel the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that Khaleda had violated the lease terms. Before her cabinet took the decision in April, however, prime minister Sheikh Hasina had told parliament that Khaleda should vacate the house to make way for blocks of apartments for families of army officers killed in the February BDR mutiny. The massive 2.72-acre spread was originally the official home of the deputy army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia, who later became army chief and then president through controversial means. After the murder of Ziaur Rahman, in a military coup in 1981, his widow Khaleda was also awarded a house in Gulshan in addition to the cantonment house the family had been occupying since the 1970s. b
