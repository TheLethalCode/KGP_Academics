 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)The fifth anniversary of a lethal grenade attack on an Awami League anti-terrorist rally this day in 2004 that killed at least 24 people and left scores injured, has come back to haunt the nation amid popular resolve to renewed drive to root out terrorism. The attack is widely believed to have been an assassination attempt on Awami League president and incumbent prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was opposition chief in 2004, during the BNP's previous term in power. "August 21 is a tainted day in the political history of Bangladesh," said Hasina and called for an end to all forms of terrorism and militancy in the country in a statement issued on Thursday. Hasina, who survived the attack but had her ears damaged from the loud explosions, added that proper trial of perpetrators of the attack would help end terrorism in the country. Several central leaders were injured too: among them was former Dhaka mayor Mohammad Hanif who died after suffering from the injuries he had sustained in the blasts, for a long time. Home minister Sahara Khatun got injured too. President Zillur Rahman, who lost wife Ivy Rahman, the AL's women affairs secretary, to the gory incident, also issued a separate message. Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam in a statement has urged the party adherents and its associate organizations to observe the day. Two cases, one for murder and one under the Explosives Act, were filed in 2004. The proceedings of the two cases have been running concurrently. According to the prosecution, the BNP-led administration made an attempt to throw previous investigations off track. Three former investigation officers of the cases now face criminal proceedings for instigating false witness testimonies, among other charges. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the cases on June 11 last year against 22 people, including former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu and his brother Maulana Tajuddin, suspected of supplying the grenades, and Mufti Hannan, leader of the banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul Jihad-al-Islami. Of the accused, 13 including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars, while the rest, including Tajuddin, remain on the run. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified, including president Rahman, Hasina and home minister Sahara Khatun. The Awami League has organised a number programmes to mark the anniversary on Friday, with the prime minister scheduled to lay a wreath at a temporary monument in front of the party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, dedicated to those who died in the tragic events of that day. Party leaders and activists will also observe a one-minute silence. Later in the day, AL leaders will meet at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh building for a discussion. Further probe On Aug 3 this year, a Dhaka speedy trial tribunal ordered further investigation to ascertain the origins of the grenades, with the court taking the unusual step of granting investigators two more months on a petition by the prosecution. Under the circumstances, the cases were sent back to Dhaka District Sessions Judges Court on Aug 16, as it would not be possible to try the cases within the 135 days stipulated for the speedy trial tribunal. The cases had been transferred to Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 during the rule of the immediate past caretaker government. Bail to be challenged, accused to be grilled again Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 judge Masdar Hossain had earlier granted bail to two accused Arif Hasan Sumon and Munshi Mhibullah, the only bail to be granted to date in the cases. Chief public prosecutor Syed Rezaur Rahman told bdnews24.com on Thursday that investigators would apply to cancel the bail as the further investigation and interrogation work may face obstacles because of the bail. The present investigation officer Abdul Kahar Akhand said all the accused currently behind bars in Bangladesh would be remanded for interrogations again. "We will petition the court to place the accused on remand again soon," Akhand told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "In addition to grilling 14 accused in the case, efforts will be made to bring two brothers Mottakin and Morshalin, back to Bangladesh after their arrests in India." "There is evidence of their involvement in the grenade attack." CID senior assistant superintendent of police Akhand was appointed on Aug 13 as further investigation into the grenade attack was ordered. bdne
