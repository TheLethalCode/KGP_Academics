 Shihabuddin Kislu, from New York New York, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)Former army chief Moeen U Ahmed's comment that he has given back democracy is "sour grapes", the prime minister's adviser Alauddin Ahmed has said . "He is very cunning man. He could not get hold of power. Had he done that, you would have seen what he would have done," he told reporters after an international seminar on the contemporary politics of Bangladesh in New York on Thursday. Asked if the Moeen would be tried, he said the people can tell in time whether there will be a trial or not. He said everybody will have to remain cautious so that the democracy is not impeded by Bangladeshis and foreigners who would want to teach it. "We are yet to assimilate ourselves into democracy in spite of living under a democratic system for a long time, this is our tragedy," said Ahmed, who spoke on behalf of the government at the seminar. There is a lack of mutual respect, collaboration and goodwill in politics which can be achieved if democracy is practiced for several consecutive periods, he said. He said there will be international conspiracies again if the government fails to fulfill the sky-high expectations of the people. "It is true that there has been a slide in the law and order but the government has been able to bottle up militancy and terrorism," said Ahmed. The government is trying to curb petty crimes by increasing manpower and salaries of the police, he said and added that the administration was determined to eliminate the session jam at the National University. BNP MP Mujibur Rahman Sarwar emphasised the unity of the government and the opposition in the greater interest of the country. He said 'the seat of power' is the biggest problem and that's why no-one has been able to follow moral principles. "During the rule of the caretaker government we have seen the two leaders speak for democracy, again many from the two different parties got close in jail. "But that relationship died out over the struggle for power. Putting up one face under aggression and another when in power is not good for any party," said Sarwar, who spoke on behalf of the opposition. Alluding to the foreign diplomats, he said, "Is that right what the officials of the level of joint secretary are doing in our country?" Taking the responsibility of Jan 11, 2007 changeover as a politician, he said, "General Moeen has followed in the footsteps of [former Pakistan president] Parvez Mosharraf." "Everything can be passed by majority rule. But a parliament without the opposition, can it be imagined? "It is not fair that all cases [filed for political persecution] against the ruling party men will be withdrawn but none of the opposition party's." The seminar, organised by Probashi Bangladeshi Nagorik Committee, was presided over by Lalbagh commissioner Mosharraf Hossain Khokon. Consul general M Shamsul Haque, prime minister's health adviser Modasser Ali's personal secretary Sirajul Islam Molla, general secretary of Probashi Nagorik Committee Kamruzzaman Babul, Uttorbongo Foundation's Abul Kashem and Mohsin Ali spoke among others. bd
