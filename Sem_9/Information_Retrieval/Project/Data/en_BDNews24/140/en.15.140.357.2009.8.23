 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)The government has petitioned two Dhaka courts against bail granted to two men accused in the murder and explosives cases filed in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. Bail was granted to Arif Hassan Sumon and Mofizur Rahman on Aug 12 by speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain. Investigating officer Abdul Qahhar Akand moved against the bail order on Sunday, at two separate courts after the cases were transferred last week from the speedy trial tribunal. The explosives case will now be conducted at the First Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court and the murder case at the Second Metropolitan Special Court, counsel for the state Abul Kalam Azad told reporters on Sunday. Azad said the petitions to cancel the bails had been filed separately at the two courts. Judge ANM Boshirullah of the First Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court set Monday to hear the petition against the bail in the explosives case, while judge Fazila Begum of the Second Metropolitan Special Court fixed Aug 30 to hear the petition against bail in the murder case. On Aug 3, the court took the unusual step of ordered further investigation into the 2004 grenade attack on a petition by state prosecutors. The court also asked the inspector general of police to submit the investigation report within 2 months. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as the new investigations would take the trial period over 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial rules. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including BNP leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, his brother and alleged grenade supplier, Maolana Tajuddin, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars, while the remaining accused are on the run. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the two cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. bdne
