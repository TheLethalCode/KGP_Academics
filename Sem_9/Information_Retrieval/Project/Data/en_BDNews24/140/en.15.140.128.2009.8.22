 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  A local property developer was blamed after nine members of a family were abducted at gunpoint from their house at Sutrapur on Saturday, beaten and held at a nearby workshop for eight hours before being rescued by police. Moniruzzaman Tuku, Dhaka Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, told bdnews24.com four suspects had been arrested in connection with the incident. He said a gang of criminals, introducing themselves as policemen, went to 95 Hrishikesh Das Lane at around 3:30am. The criminals forced the houseowners and family members to leave the house at gunpoint and detained them at a nearby workshop, said Tuku. Police stormed the workshop, Janata Engineering Works, on information from the arrested men and rescued the kidnapped family at around 11.30am. Three cousins, Shambhu Das, Nitai Das and Mahabir Das, who own the 100-year-old three-storey building at Hrishikesh Das Lane, alleged that the kidnappers were linked to a local property developer. Shambhu Das, an employee of the Export Processing Bureau, told bdnews24.com that the developer had been pressuring his family to strike a deal on the property. He said the kidnappers had beaten them. Cousin Nitai Das, a shop owner, said the gang gagged their mouths and looted valuables from the house before taking them at gunpoint to the workshop. Also blaming the property developer, Nitai said: "They have been pressuring us to sell the house but we did not agree." He also said the kidnappers had forced them to signed a blank sheet of paper while they were held by force in the workshop. Police said they were looking into the matter. "The arrestees are being grilled," Tuku said. Kartik Chandra, a tenant of the house, said he and his family, hearing a noise in the night, came out of their room and saw that the house owners were being taken away. "As we went forward the criminals threatened to kill us. We entered our room again," he said. "We informed neighbours and police of the matter as soon as we were able." Sutrapur police chief Tofazzal Hossain said that they went to the house on information that a robbery had taken place there. Later they detained a suspect, Md Babul, 32, and three others for suspicious activities in the vicinity of the property. "We were able to rescue the family from the Janata Engineering Works after questioning Babul, who owns the workshop," Tofazzal said. The three other arrestees were Akhter Hossain, 27, Nizamuddin Hossain, 28, and 'Sohagh', 28. "We have confirmed that the incident was planned by the kidnappers to grab the house. We are investigating the matter further," said Tofazzal. He said police had previously heard allegations that a local developer had been pressuring many in Sutrapur to sell houses and temples in the predominantly Hindu area. Some of the locals, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com that the arrestees were Awami League activists. Muhammad Ali, president of Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League's Ward 80 unit, admitted that the suspects might be local AL supporters but denied they had any links to the party. bd
