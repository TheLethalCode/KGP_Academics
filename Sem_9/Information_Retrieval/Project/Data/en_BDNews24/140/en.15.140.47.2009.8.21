 Shehabuddin Kislu writes from New York New York, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)--The government is not considering the cancellation of the caretaker government system at the moment though some ruling Awami League leaders have been speaking for it, an adviser to the prime minister said on Friday. "The government has made no decision on the abolition of the caretaker government system," Alauddin Ahmed, who advises prime minister Sheikh Hasina on education, said in New York on Thursday. Earlier on Tuesday, Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said that the caretaker government "experiment" had failed, and a national debate should decide whether or not to continue with the system. The ruling party's spokesman had said the time had come to rethink the interim government system, and all those involved in the electoral process should debate the issue. "Let the Election Commission consider the opinion of all the political parties on the matter," said Ashraf, the local government minister. "It is his personal opinion," Alauddin told reporters when asked to comment after an international seminar on 'Contemporary politics in Bangladesh'. Deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury had called the parliament members to abolish the caretaker government system on June 28 during the budget session of parliament. AL MP Suranjit SenGupta also advocated the repeal of the system. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain criticised Syed Ashraf for his comments over caretaker government on Wednesday. Delwar said the AL-led Grand Alliance government was intent on doing away with the caretaker government system since it wanted to control the next elections. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Aug 12 said the caretaker government system was for political parties to decide and the EC's main concern was the security of the voters. The other election commissioners told bdnews24.com on Thursday that the EC was unwilling to discuss the issue of whether the caretaker government system should remain during the planned upcoming dialogue with political parties. A national debate should decide whether or not to continue with the system. But it would not be on the Election Commission's agenda, they added. The system was introduced after the political unrest in 1991. The AL strongly advocated the system at that time, while a reluctant BNP eventually conceded to the proposal. The two main political parties have reversed their role on the issue. bdnew
