 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)The police cannot work independent of political influence under a political government and are forced to obey orders as a job responsibility, police chief Nur Muhammad has said. "Police are a part of the administration and their performance depends on how the governments use them," he said at a programme on police reforms in the city on Friday. Police Reform Programme (PRP), aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Police by supporting key areas of access to justice, disclosed the findings at the session on 'Public Attitude Follow-up Survey' conducted in Dec 2008 at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. "We are not safe though the survey shows an improvement on crime situation," the inspector general of police said The findings show that public confidence in the police have grown since the PRP was implemented in 2005. Complaints against the force, crimes, influence and bribery have also reduced. The government, with the assistance of the United Nations' Development Programme, UK's Department for International Development and the European Commission, is executing the PRP to make the police more responsive to the needs of poor and vulnerable community. SM Shahjahan, a former police chief, said the reform recommendations and initiatives by the PRP would ensure disarming the influential and helping the people, where the need for service is focused than being forced. The reforms should continue though vested groups within the police, administration, political leaders and businessmen would not approve of them, he added. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder said the revised draft of the proposed Bangladesh Police Ordinance is under scrutiny and will be approved after some more changes. The performance of the police has improved with the successful introduction of model police stations and community policing by the PRP in the past years, Sikder added. Stefan Priesner, country director of UNDP, emphasised the importance of a modern law to govern police and appreciated the activities of the Anticorruption Commission in curbing corruption in society. The second phase of the programme will be launched this Oct.
