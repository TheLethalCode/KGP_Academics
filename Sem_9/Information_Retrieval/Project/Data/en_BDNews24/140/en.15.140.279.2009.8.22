 BERLIN, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Since Usain Bolt took 11 hundredths of a second of both his 100 and 200m world records at the World Championships everyone has been wondering just how low he can go. Now, the biomechanical breakdown of both races has been released and it makes incredible reading. En route to his 200m record of 19.19 seconds Bolt ran the first half of the final in 9.92 seconds.

In the 100, where he clocked 9.58, he belied his own talk of being a slow starter by reaching the 20 metre mark in 2.89 seconds - fastest in the field and three hundredths ahead of Tyson Gay, known to be explosive from the blocks. In the 100 the Jamaican reached a top speed of 12.35 meters per second, almost 28 miles per hour, and took 40.92 steps compared with the 45.94 of second-placed Gay, whose 9.71 was the third-fastest 100m ever.
