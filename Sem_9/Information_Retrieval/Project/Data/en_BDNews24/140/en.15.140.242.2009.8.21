 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday paid respects to those who died in a lethal grenade attack this day in 2004 at the party's central office premise at Bangabandhu Avenue. Hasina, also ruling Awami League chief, laid wreaths and observed a two-minute silence in a ceremony attended by hundreds of party leaders and supporters. The fifth anniversary of a grisly attack on an anti-terrorist rally that killed at least 24 people is being observed for the first time since the AL-led Grand Alliance swept to power in Jan. 6 this year. The attack is widely believed to have been an assassination attempt on Awami League president and incumbent prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was opposition chief in 2004, during the BNP's previous term in power. Afterwards, Hasina left for the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh for a discussion meeting organised by the party. bdnew
