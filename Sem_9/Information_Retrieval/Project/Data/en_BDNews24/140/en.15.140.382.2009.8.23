<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Airline Pilots' Association sought the prime minister's assistance on Saturday to save Biman Bangladesh Airlines, by resolving a long delayed decision to lease three airliners for the national carrier while it awaits delivery of ten new aircraft. "Biman has been losing potential revenue as a result of delays in securing aircraft, and other airlines are taking advantage of the situation," Captain SM Helal, president of the BAPA, told a press briefing at the Biman administration office. Captain Helal called for an immediate meeting of Biman's board of directors to evaluate proposals to lease interim aircraft. In April 2008, Biman signed an agreement with aircraft manufacturer Boeing to buy ten new airliners with a view to replacing its aging fleet of three DC-10s and two Airbuses. Two of the new airliners are due to be delivered by 2011, while the rest should be in service within seven years. As a temporary measure, the board of the national carrier decided to lease two Boeing 777 airliners on an interim basis in 2008 and a further two in 2009. But the initiative faltered due to a lack of the aircraft in the market. Biman then looked to lease a number of Boeing 737-800 airliners, and invited suppliers to submit proposals in May 2008. Several well-known leasing companies submitted proposals, but the offers lapsed due to delays in the scrutinising process. In a meeting on Aug 18, the board also rejected a proposal to lease three Boeing 777-200 ERs, made by EuroAtlantic Airways, saying the company's proposal also lacked transparency. Recent reports in the media have claimed the Boeing 777-200 ERs have a poor record for fuel efficiency. Helal rejected the reports, saying fuel consumption of the airliners was lower than the comparable Airbus manufactured plane, and fit for operating on long-distance routes. He said Biman had to maintain long-distance services to stay competitive in the airline industry. Biman has been suspending flights on a regular basis for some time, while its competitors take advantage of the reduced competition created in Bangladesh in the notoriously cut-throat sector
