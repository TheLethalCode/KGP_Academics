 GWERU, Zimbabwe, Sep 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said on Sunday his party would rather withdraw from power-sharing talks than sign an unsatisfactory deal and challenged President Robert Mugabe to call a new poll. "We are saying to him you can call another election under international supervision and let's see who is going to win that race," he told a rally to celebrate his Movement for Democratic Change's MDC) ninth anniversary. Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in a March 29 election but fell short of enough votes to avoid a June run-off, which was won by Mugabe unopposed after Tsvangirai pulled out, citing violence and intimidation against his supporters. "We would rather have no deal than a bad deal," Tsvangirai told his supporters. The post-election talks are deadlocked over how to share executive power between old foes Mugabe and Tsvangirai, putting off any chance of rescuing Zimbabwe from its economic collapse. Mugabe has said he would form a cabinet with or without Tsvangirai. The MDC leader told the rally in the city of Gweru in central Zimbabwe that there would be no power sharing deal until Mugabe ceded more power to the opposition. "The issue that we are facing here is that Mugabe must accept to surrender some of his powers for the power sharing arrangement to work. If that doesn't happen there is no deal," he said. He was speaking in both English and the local Shona language.
