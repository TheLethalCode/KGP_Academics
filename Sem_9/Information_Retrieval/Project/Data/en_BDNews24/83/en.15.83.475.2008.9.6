 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnew24.com) - Owners of hundreds of garment factories in Gazipur have said they are giving the government until Sept 25 to ensure their investments are safe and secure. If no proper security measures are taken by Sept 25, they say, 810 readymade garments units in the area will be closed. Owners of about 100 RMG units from the area met BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez Saturday noon and gave the deadline in a memorandum handed to their leader. "In recent times, incidents of attack, ransacking and arson in the garments factories in Gazipur have been rampant," Rashid Ahmed Hossainy, whose Nexus Group has factories in Gazipur, told bdnews24.com. "Some people posing as workers are behind these terrorist acts. All of us, factory workers, executives, owners are feeling insecure," said Hossainy, who signed the Saturday memorandum. "We requested the government time and again  but to no avail." The Gazipur owners also handed over a "token key" to the BGMEA president as an expression of their plan to put all their factories under lock and key. "An ultimatum has been given to the BGMEA president. If no action is taken by Sept 25, 810 RMG units in Gazipur areas will be closed for indefinite period," Hossainy said. The BGMEA said it was a serious development. "I have taken the contents of the memorandum seriously and called an emergency board meeting," he told bdnews24.com, after receiving the memorandum. The BGMEA president said the decisions of the board meeting would be "conveyed to the proper government authority on an emergency basis". The desperate garment owners had earlier met in a club in Dhaka to decide their course of action. "Owners of about 400 garments industries of Gazipur area held a meeting at Uttara Club Thursday. The meeting decided to give a memorandum to the BGMEA president," Kazi Zakir Hossain, chairman of Meditex Industries Ltd at Gazipur, told bdnews24.com. A total of 91 garments factory owners of Gazipur area signed the memorandum submitted to the BGMEA president.
