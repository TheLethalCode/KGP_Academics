<TITLE> Yunus eyes lawsuit for GP control </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Biswadip Das Sept 5, (bdnews24.com)  Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus has said he is considering legal action to wrest full control of the joint-venture Grameenphone from Norway's Telenor ASA. "The recent activities (of Telenor-controlled management) in Bangladesh leave me with little alternative other than to investigate the possibility of taking legal action," Yunus, now in Oslo, had said in a statement issued on Thursday in the Norwegian capital. At a news conference on Friday evening, however, he said a lawsuit was only a "remote possibility." "This is not an outcome that we think is necessary," Yunus told the news conference. "It is a possibility, a remote possibility." "We are not the kind of people to rush to the courts." Norwegian telecom group Telenor holds a 62 percent stake in Bangladesh's largest mobile-phone operator, with Yunus-owned Grameen Telecom Corp holding the remaining 38 percent. In Thursday's statement, the Nobel laureate said Grameen Telecom and Telenor had run into differences over "business ethics and corporate governance". Government-owned Telenor, the largest phone company in the Nordic region with stakes in operators in Russia, Pakistan and Thailand, is running Grameenphone against "non- profit'' objectives, Yunus said. "In light of the recent alleged illegal activity, that transfer should now occur as soon as possible before further damage is inflicted on the Grameen name." "Although Grameen Telecom will see that social objectives will be implemented in the management of the phone company, Grameenphone, it will seek to maintain and expand the growth and the profits in the phone company." Telenor refused to honour an agreement sealed in 1996 to transfer its majority holding to his Grammen Telecom by 2002, the Nobel laureate said. "Back in 1996, Telenor and we agreed that the joint company within six years should be a locally operated company with Bangladeshi management and Bangladeshi majority ownership. This has not happened. "Telenor now tells me that it was a mistake to rely on their words," Yunus said. "We now are being told that the words of the written agreement in a legal sense are non-committing statements. We relied on the words of the agreement." Telenor, however, has its own interpretation of the 1996 partnership deal. "In the conflict regarding the ownership of Grameenphone, Telenor disagrees with Muhammad Yunus that we have an agreement to sell our stake in the company to him," the Oslo-based company said in a statement released from its headquarters. "We would like to emphasise that the shareholder agreement clearly states that any disagreements should be resolved through the Swedish courts." The professor was scathing about Telenor's way of doing business or running Grameenphone. "The agenda of Telenor to maximize returns for the benefit of its owners is, however, in conflict with the social and non-profit agenda of Grameen Telecom. Yunus said in the statement: "Unfortunately, the telephone company recently has been criticized for labour violations by its contractors, for violation of environmental law and for engaging in illegal telecom activities in Bangladesh. "Journalists have recently revealed cases where children have been working for the subcontractors of Grameenphone." He also referred to the telecoms regulators fining the company for rogue operations. "Bangladeshi authorities on two different occasions found that the telephone company was not in compliance with Bangladeshi law. In total, the company was fined US $60 million. "US $60 million is a huge amount of money. In Bangladesh, USD 60 million is enough to pay for over 2 million cataract eye operations, giving that many people their sight back. "It is enough to educate over 500,000 girls for one year. "The breach of Bangladeshi law imposed a risk of loss of the company's license as telephone operator. Furthermore, I personally have been condemned by the Bangladeshi media for this violation of Bangladeshi laws and have been accused of making illegal money. "We recently have received the police report from the authorities' investigation of the illegal activities. Another company, Malaysian-based DiGi Telecom Ltd., is accused of contributing to the illegal activities. DiGi Telecom also is accused of laundering money through an account in Singapore. DiGi Telecom Ltd is owned 61% by Telenor. "It can be perceived to the committee members that the majority shareholders of Grameen Phone Ltd are involved in encouraging the illegal VoIP business in the international field." "The reputation of Grameen and the hard and honest work of its now 300,000 telephone ladies have been an important factor in the success of the phone company in Bangladesh. "The telephone ladies became internationally acclaimed as successful entrepreneurs through mobile technology, and Telenor reaped financial benefits from this. "Now the goodwill the Grameen name provides to the telephone is being undermined by these alleged illegal activities." The cellphone operator's operating profit nosedived 89 percent to Tk 51.10 crore in the second quarter to June from Tk 4,26.9 crore in the same period a year ago. The company's market share narrowed from 63 percent in 2006 to 47 percent as of June 2008. In the six-operator market, however, Grameenphone still stays in the leading position with 20.84 million customers followed by Egyptian Orascom Telecom's Banglalink with 10 million customers and Aktel with 7.98 million customers as of July. It was the most profitable part of the Norwegian company's global mobile network for the last quarter of 2006. In line with the company's half-yearly performance until June, its revenue earnings also saw a negative trend. The company's revenues dropped 2 percent in June to Tk 2,8686.43 crore compared to Tk 2,944.9 crore in June last year. In the three months to June 30, GP's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins had decreased by 43 percent to Tk 388.00 crore from Tk 689 crore a year earlier. The company has faced charges of anomalies, including international call termination through VoIP. The company paid Tk 418.4 crore in fine for its alleged involvement in VoIP. b
