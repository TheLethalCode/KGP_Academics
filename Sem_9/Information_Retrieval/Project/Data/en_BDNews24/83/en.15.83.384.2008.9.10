 Washington, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday launched an all-out effort to persuade the US Congress to approve an agreement to end a three-decade ban on nuclear trade with India this year. Rice went to Capitol Hill to call on House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman to discuss how to win congressional approval for the accord before U.S. President George W. Bush leaves office on Jan. 20. A spokesman for Pelosi said she Rice discussed the process for considering the agreement once it is submitted. "The Speaker looks forward to reviewing the submission in detail and consulting with Chairman Berman and members of the leadership in determining the appropriate course of action," spokesman Nadeam Elshami said. With the Democrats in control of both houses of Congress, Pelosi and Berman, both from California, are key players in deciding whether U.S. lawmakers will vote on the deal this year and hand Bush a foreign policy victory in his final months. "We think that there is a possibility of getting this passed this year and we are going to do everything we possibly can," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. "Whether it does or not, it's not going to be for lack of effort." McCormack said Rice hoped to send the paperwork to Congress within the next two days. But India must also take steps to satisfy U.S. legal requirements. Rice has lobbied top Democrats and Republicans as well as key members of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees, the spokesman said. The United States took a major step toward enacting the agreement on Saturday when it secured the approval of the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group to lift the global ban on nuclear trade with nuclear-armed India. U.S. congressional blessing is the last hurdle to the deal, which the Bush administration believes will forge a strategic partnership with the world's largest democracy, help India meet its burgeoning energy demand and open a nuclear market worth billions of dollars. But the agreement has raised international misgivings because India is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty meant to stop the spread and production of nuclear weapons and a companion international agreement banning nuclear tests. UNDERMINES SPREAD Critics believe the deal undermines efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and sets a precedent allowing other nations to seek to buy such technology without submitting to the full range of global safeguards. Before sending the deal to Congress, the administration must certify India has made "substantial progress" toward an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on an "additional protocol" of safeguards to verify it is using civilian nuclear facilities only for peaceful purposes. It must also certify that India has formally adhered to the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary pact that aims to limit the spread of ballistic missile technology. Once the agreement has been sent to Congress, under current law it must remain for 30 days before it can be voted on. Given that Congress is expected to adjourn by the end of September so lawmakers can campaign for the Nov. 4 U.S. election, there is not enough time to meet the 30-day requirement without a "lame duck" session after the election. Congressional aides said there were ways to circumvent the 30-day requirement but all required the solid support of the Democratic leadership of both houses of Congress.
