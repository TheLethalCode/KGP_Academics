 WASHINGTON, September 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong announced Tuesday he was coming out of retirement next year to raise awareness about cancer. A return to the peloton by Armstrong had been rumored for weeks and the 36-year-old American made it official on a video blog on his website ( http://www.livestrong.com/lance2009/ ). "After long talks with my kids, the rest of my family, a close group of friends, I have decided to return to professional cycling in 2009," he said. "The reason for this is to launch an international cancer strategy based on the fact that we lose eight million people around the world to this disease - more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined." A survivor of testicular cancer, Armstrong will race in the Tour de France, the Amgen Tour of California, the Paris-Nice, the Tour de Georgia and the Dauphine-Libere, the cycling journal Velonews reported Monday, citing anonymous sources. Armstrong did not reveal his plans but said he would unveil them on September 24 in New York City. USA Cycling spokesman Andy Lee said they were "extremely excited" about the return of Armstrong, who won the Tour de France, cycling's most famous race, a record-breaking seven consecutive years from 1999-2005. "As a cancer survivor and seven-time Tour winner Lance has brought a tremendous amount of attention to competitive cycling in America and his success is largely responsible for the significant growth USA Cycling has experienced over the course of the last 10 years," Lee told Reuters in an e-mail. 'UNPRECEDENTED EXCITEMENT' "A comeback to the sport's marquee event would bring with it unprecedented intrigue and excitement and would most likely have a similar impact. "A return would be one of the most exciting things to happen in American cycling in a long time." Armstrong, who retired following his 2005 Tour triumph, has been an outspoken advocate in the fight against cancer, raising funds and awareness of the disease. He has lobbied President Bush to increase funding for cancer research and over the weekend questioned the two U.S. presidential candidates about how they would go about accelerating the fight against the disease. Armstrong has been dogged with accusations that he used drugs to help him win the Tour so many times after surviving cancer but he never failed a drug test. The Texan has spent most of his time since he retired raising money to fight cancer and help survivors through the Lance Armstrong Foundation. He has run a few marathons and recently took part in a mountain bike race. Armstrong has often said that he did not miss racing, because he had had to deprive himself of fun, food and drink while trainin
