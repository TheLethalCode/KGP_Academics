 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Bail bonds for former prime minister Khaleda Zia were submitted by lawyers Wednesday to four separate courts handling the GATCO, Niko, Zia Orphanage Trust and Barapukuria cases. Khaleda's lawyer Advocate Sanaullah Maih told bdnews24.com that the bail bonds of the four graft cases against were submitted and accepted by the courts. "The courts have informed us that all the papers relating to the bail bonds have been sent to the jail authorities. We hope if there is no other problem she will get released today." The Anticorruption Commission had earlier in the day appealed against the High Court bail orders in the GATCO and Niko graft cases. Advocate Sufia Khatun filed the two appeals at the Appellate Division around Wednesday morning. The High Court granted Khaleda three months' bail in the two cases on Tuesday, clearing the last legal barriers to her freedom from prison. After filing the appeals Khatun told bdnews24.com: "I have filed two appeals at the directive of the Anticorruption Commission for a stay on the High Court bail orders." "The vacation bench of the Appellate Division chamber judge is supposed to be in session on Sept 15. The hearing on the two appeals may be held any day if the judges agree," she said. The BNP chairperson had earlier secured bail in two other graft cases involving Barapukuria coal mine and Zia Orphanage Trust. The GATCO case was filed on Sept 2 last year and the Niko case on May 5. Khaleda and some members of her cabinet were accused in the cases. It has been alleged that the accused persons by misusing power handed the work of operating Chittagong port and Kamalapur Inland Container Depot to Global Agro Trade Company (GATCO), causing the state a loss of close to Tk 1,000 crore. The Niko case alleges that the agreement with the Canadian company on exploration of oil and gas made the state count about Tk 13,777 crore in losses. Khaleda and younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 last year, a day after the GATCO case was filed. Coco is now receiving medical attention in Thailand on bail. bdnews24.co
