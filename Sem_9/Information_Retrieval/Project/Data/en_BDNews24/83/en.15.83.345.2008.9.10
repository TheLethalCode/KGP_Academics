<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com) - FBCCI president Annisul Huq said Wednesday that the prices of essentials are edging downward, adding that the help of the law enforcing agencies to control market prices is no longer necessary. Annisul Huq was exchanging views with the leaders of wholesale and retail market committees of Dhaka city at the FBCCI auditorium. "The market trend is not upward now. The prices of different commodities in the international market are going down. Its positive impact will be felt in the local market," the FBCCI president said. Wholesale and retail traders however demanded FBCCI intervention to ensure that the price of a commodity falls in the local market in line and in time with global market prices. Haji Mohammad Mohiuddin Bhulu, vice president of Shyambazar Wholesale Market Traders Association in Old Dhaka, said: "When price of a commodity goes up in international market its price leaps up every hour here" "Now prices of many commodities are going down in the world market. But our importers are selling at the previous price," he pointed out. "The businessmen must be honest and sincere. They should not think of profit only," he added. Mohiuddin Bhulu said this was why prices are not falling in the market in line with people's expectation. Haji Mohammad Golam Maula, general secretary of Moulvibazar Traders Association, also pointed out: "In the last three months international market prices of most of commodities including rice and edible oil has fallen." He requested the government and the FBCCI to monitor how far its impact has been felt in the local market. Annisul Huq claimed that market monitoring by the FBCCI has produced positive results, adding that control by law enforcing agencies of markets was no longer needed. "The members of the FBCCI price monitoring task force visited different wholesale and retail markets in the city over the last few days and found that prices have fallen slightly," he said. He mentioned green chilli, onion, edible oil and potato being among the essentials that were lower-priced in the market now compared to the start of Ramadan. However, the price of rice did not decrease, he pointed out. "We hope that prices will go down further," Annisul added. bdnews
