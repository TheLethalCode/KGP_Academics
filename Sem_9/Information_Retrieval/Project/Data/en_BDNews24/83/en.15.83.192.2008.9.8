 Delhi, September 8 (bdnews24.com)-- Rickey Ponting is set to loose his status as the best cricketer of the world this year. The Australian captain, who won the ICC Cricketer of the Year Award for the last two occasions, has been left out of the list of nominees for 2008, unveiled in Delhi Monday. Three players  Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the West Indies, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardena and South Africa's Dale Steyn have been nominated in both the Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year categories in the LG ICC Awards 2008. The winners will named at a grand event in Dubai Wednesday. The other nominee for the Cricketer of the Year prize is South Africa captain Graeme Smith while his team-mate Jacques Kallis is a further nominee in the Test category. None of the four players shortlisted for the Cricketer of the Year Award has previously lifted the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy after it was established in 2004, so there is certain to be a new name to join the roll-call of winners. Players who have secured the game's top individual honour in the past are Rahul Dravid of India (2004), England's Andrew Flintoff and Jacques Kallis of South Africa (joint winners in 2005) and Australia captain Ricky Ponting (back-to-back winner in 2006 and 2007). India's one-day and Twenty20 International (T20I) captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is another player with plenty to look forward to on Wednesday. Dhoni is also nominated for two prizes  the ODI Player of the Year and the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year, the latter for his captaincy in leading India to the inaugural title in South Africa last September. And Simon Taufel has a chance of an unprecedented five successive Umpire of the Year awards after being nominated alongside Mark Benson, Aleem Dar, Steve Davis and Rudi Koertzen. This year's LG ICC Awards includes eight individual prizes, including a new one for the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year. It also features the selection of the Test and ODI Teams of the Year and the award to the side that has adhered most to the Spirit of Cricket. The nominations for six of the awards were made by a five-man ICC selection panel chaired by West Indies legend Clive Lloyd. The panel also includes former Australia captain Greg Chappell, ex-South Africa all-rounder Shaun Pollock, former Sri Lanka opener Sidath Wettimuny and former Bangladesh batsman Athar Ali Khan. This panel will also select the ICC Test and ODI teams of the year. The winners of these six individual awards will be voted upon by a 25-person panel from around the world, made up of renowned former players, respected members of the media, and an elite umpire and elite match referee. Meanwhile, the nominations for the Women's Cricketer of the Year Award were decided after each of the world's top 10 teams was given the opportunity to nominate two players. This award will be voted on by a separate 16-person voting academy featuring former players and other experts on the women's game. The Spirit of Cricket Award will be voted on by all the international captains as well as all members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires and Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. The Umpire of the Year Award is voted on by the captains and the match referees. The LG ICC Awards ceremony is now in its fifth year and this will be the first time it has been staged in Dubai. Previous ceremonies were held in London (2004), Sydney (2005), Mumbai (2006) and Johannesburg (2007). The shortlists for the LG ICC Awards 2008 are as follows: Cricketer of the Year Shivnarine Chanderpaul Mahela Jayawardena Graeme Smith Dale Steyn Test Player of the Year Shivnarine Chanderpaul Mahela Jayawardena Jacques Kallis Dale Steyn ODI Player of the Year Nathan Bracken Mahendra Singh Dhoni Sachin Tendulkar Mohammad Yousuf Emerging Player of the Year Stuart Broad Ajantha Mendis Morne Morkel Ishant Sharma Associate Player of the Year Ryan ten Doeschate Alex Obanda Niall O'Brien Thomas Odoyo Twenty20 International Performance of the Year Chris Gayle Mahendra Singh Dhoni Brett Lee Yuvraj Singh Women's Player of the Year Nicola Browne Charlotte Edwards Lisa Sthalekar Claire Taylor Spirit of Cricket Bangladesh New Zealand Sri Lanka West Indies Umpire of the Year Mark Benson Aleem Dar Steve Davis Rudi Koertzen Simon Tauf
