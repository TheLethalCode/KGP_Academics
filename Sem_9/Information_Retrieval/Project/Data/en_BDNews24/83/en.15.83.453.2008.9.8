<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said the caretaker government should tell the people how much success it has achieved in curbing widespread corruption before quitting the office. "The caretaker government repeatedly said that the country had been mired in corruption. People have the right to know how much corruption the government has been able to curb," he told reporters after a programme marking World Physiotherapy Day. "I believe the government will let the countrymen know whether it was able to implement its pledges," said the former caretaker government adviser, who attended the programme on a wheel chair. Akbar Ali who had been ill for sometime underwent spinal surgery in the U.S. He came back home on July 24. Asked to comment on the current situation of the country, he said: "I am not well aware of the country's present situation as I have been ill for a long time. I should not make a comment on the matter." On whether he believed the national elections would be held in December, he said: "I hope so. I believe the caretaker government will be able to accomplish a free and fair election." "I want to see the last of it. Still there is time, let's see what happens," he said when asked if he thought the government has relented on the antigraft drive. Earlier, he told the function: "We only blame the universities for student politics. But politics is there in all professional organisations of doctors, lawyers and teachers." "The politics of the professionals is most destructive," Akbar Ali said. He blamed politics for the ramshackle health services. Bangladesh Physiotherapy Association organised the programme. bdnews24
