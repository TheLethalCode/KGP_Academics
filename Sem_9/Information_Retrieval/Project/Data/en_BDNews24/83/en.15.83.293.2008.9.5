 NEW YORK, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Since exhibiting some vulnerability in a season so far devoid of a grand slam title, Roger Federer has enjoyed more spirited support from fans and has shown more of his outgoing and carefree side on the court. Federer said winning Olympic gold in Beijing last month, when he triumphed in doubles after being ousted from singles, also lifted his spirits in the run-up to the U.S. Open where he aims for a fifth successive crown. The Swiss drew the loudest roars from the crowd during a parade of former champions last week to launch the U.S. Open and has been unafraid to show his emotions en route to booking a place in the last four at Flushing Meadows. "I'm in good spirits because the Olympic gold definitely helped (me) not be more happy on court but maybe more outgoing," Federer said after beating Luxembourg qualifier Gilles Muller 7-6 6-4 7-6 in the quarter-finals on Thursday. "I'm always like this, especially in the practice, you know. I guess for a while I put my head down in the matches and just tried to keep that unbelievable run I had going instead of trying to disturb myself with any sort of reactions. "Maybe it's a time where I can show a little bit more and it (emotion) comes out," added the Swiss, who was overjoyed to win his first Olympic medal with compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka in Beijing. "So for me it's not a big change because I practise more than I play matches. It's normal, really." Federer's record run of 237 consecutive weeks at the top of the rankings was ended last month by Spaniard Rafael Nadal. SWISS MASTER Despite being the four-times defending Open champion, the Swiss master was seeded second for the final grand slam event of the year. That may also have fueled Federer's popularity at the U.S. Open with many fans eager for him to regain his grip as world number one. Against the big-serving Muller, Federer frequently cried out in frustration after missing a shot or screamed skyward to raise his own spirits when a breakpoint opportunity beckoned. "I've always tried to show emotions as much as I could, without really disturbing my concentration," the 27-year-old said after holding off Muller in two hours 26 minutes. "Who knows, maybe it is just a couple of weeks and I'm going crazy and after that you'll see me more relaxed again. I don't know yet. "But I've always been a very relaxed guy so this is nothing really too drastic of a change.
