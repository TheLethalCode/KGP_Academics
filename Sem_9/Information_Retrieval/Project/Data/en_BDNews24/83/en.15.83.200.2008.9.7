<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will invite the BNP again after it refused to join the ongoing third-round dialogues on Sunday, the chief election commissioner has said. "We'll wait for the BNP. The dialogue isn't going to draw to a close without their participation," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters after attending a number of meetings with different parties. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said to reporters, "Responding to BNP's letter, we'll issue another letter." BNP sent a letter signed by the secretary general to the CEC instead. "BNP will not take part in today's (Sunday) dialogue, the secretary general conveyed the message in a letter addressed to the chief election commissioner and I've just delivered it," said Rizvi to reporters on Sunday at the EC headquarters. He reached the letter of BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain to the chief election commissioner at the office of his private secretary Mostafa Faruque around 10:15am. "The secretary general in his letter said the BNP will not join the dialogue on Sunday as this meeting has been convened only to discuss the political parties' registration. "[It] will not help in any manner resolve the current deadlock in which we all are stuck, unable to make any headway," Rizvi told reporters, elaborating on his party's stance on the ongoing round of the electoral dialogue. He said, "There's hardly any space left for us to join any dialogue with the government, when they kept us, a major political party, out while burdening the nation with 'undemocratic and anti-people' laws and regulations." "Under the circumstances, no elections can be held fairly." bdnews
