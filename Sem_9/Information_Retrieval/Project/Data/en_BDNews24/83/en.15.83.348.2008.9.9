<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina forward Carlos Tevez apologised on Monday after being sent off in the first half for the second time in three international appearances. Tevez was booked in the 16th minute of Saturday's 1-1 World Cup qualifying draw with Paraguay for a tackle from behind and received a direct red in the 31st for a studs-up challenge on Dario Veron. Argentina were losing 1-0 at the time but manage to salvage a draw with a Sergio Aguero equaliser. "I'm sad because I left my team mates with 10 players again," said the Manchester United player, adding that the first tackle should have been a straight red. "In the first incident, the referee could have sent me off. They were two senseless tackles, a rush of blood to the head which has made me miss another important Argentina game," he told the TyC cable sports channel. He implied that the second incident was unintentional. "The Paraguayan was very cunning, as I soon as I lost the ball, he started rolling around on the pitch." "I apologised to my team mates but they said I didn't need to. I can't find an explanation for what I did. The game was calm and I felt it was my match." Tevez, suspended for Wednedsay's visit to Peru, said he had received a talking-to from coach Alfio Basile. "I felt I had the coach's confidence," he said. "When we spoke, I told him how I felt and asked for forgiveness. Fortunately, he understood me." Tevez was previously dismissed in November's match in Colombia. Argentina, winning 1-0 at the time, went on to lose 2-1
