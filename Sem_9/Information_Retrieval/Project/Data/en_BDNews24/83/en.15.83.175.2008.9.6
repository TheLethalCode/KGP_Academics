 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  The probe committee, formed after the cancellation of a bid on the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway expansion project, has submitted its report to the cabinet secretary, a government official Saturday. Health secretary AMM Nasiruddin, member of the committee, said that the report was submitted on Thursday, but said he could not give any details. "All I can say now is that we have made a number of recommendations so that such big projects do not require repeated bids," the health secretary said. Tender-related complexities would be reduced if the recommendations were followed properly, he said. Asked whether the committee recommended a fresh bid for the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway project (Daudkandi section), Nasiruddin said that they were not asked to do so. On July 7, the communications ministry asked the Roads and Highways Department to stop the process of tender for the project to expand the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway into four-lanes. The tender was at the final stages at the time. On cancellation of the tender by the communications ministry, the companies taking part in the bid filed a writ petition before the High Court on July 21 challenging the legality of the cancellation. A HC bench took the petition into cognisance after an initial hearing and issued a rule nisi on the concerned people including the communications secretary asking them to explain within two weeks why the tender was cancelled. The HC also ordered a stay on the cancellation order. The cabinet division formed a committee at the start of August, headed by implementation, monitoring and evaluation secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, to examine why the tender process for expansion into four lanes was cancelled at the final stage. The communications ministry in its tender cancellation order had said: "The tender was scrapped as it did not fulfil the condition of public procurement regulations," Rahman said. As per stipulations, the company that wins the tender is supposed to submit the deposit money within 28 days. But in this case, the winning tender for the project was asked to deposit the money within seven days. The communications ministry scrapped the tender process on the excuse of its mistake adding that the ministry had also transferred the project director in a short time. Amid such complications, there was also an allegation that a number of officials of the ministry initiated the cancellation of the project at the final stage of the tender process in a bid to protect the interests of a certain quarter, the ministry had said. The invitation for the tender was concluded after the approval of the law ministry and the National Board of Revenue, with foreign consultants. The names of the successful companies were announced at the time. The past four-party alliance government had initiated the project to expand the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway into four lanes, at an estimated budget of Tk 1,750 crore. Tenders were initially invited in 2006 for the construction work. But that tender process was also cancelled due to allegations of irregularities and corruption against the communications ministry. The project was again approved on Jan 30, 2007, after the present caretaker government came to power. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), presided over by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, gave the approval to an estimated budget of Tk 2,168.38 crore. Tenders were again invited and ten construction firms participated in the process, in line with previous qualifications. Among them, nine firms qualified on the basis of the lowest quotations to work in ten parts. The tender process was finalised on April 23. But the tender was again cancelled at a stage when the winning firms were waiting for work orders. The construction firms had accepted the conditions of the tender that stated that they would have to deposit money within seven days instead of 28 days. The advisory committee on government purchase on July 28 refused to give the go-ahead for re-tender to the communications ministry as it was facing charges. bdnew
