 MADRID, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Patience and intelligence are the watchwords for Spain coach Vicente del Bosque ahead of their second 2010 World Cup qualifier against Armenia in Albacete on Wednesday. The European champions got off to a winning start on Del Bosque's competitive debut at the helm with a 1-0 victory over Bosnia in Group Five on Saturday. But the Bosnians made it hard for the hosts, crowding the midfield and defending in numbers, until striker David Villa broke the deadlock in the 57th minute. More of the same can be expected from Armenia. "All our opponents see us as champions and take appropriate steps by shutting up shop, but I have confidence in this team," Del Bosque said. "It is important we approach the game the same way as we did against Bosnia, with intensity and concentration. As I have already said our worst enemy is ourselves. "Winning Euro 2008 has given us the confidence and the patience to resolve these types of games. Spain has the intelligence, the skills and the football to overcome rivals like these." Del Bosque has said he plans to make few changes to the side who laboured for the best part of an hour on Saturday before really imposing themselves on their opponents. Perhaps the only modification will be to start Santi Cazorla on the wing instead of Diego Capel. The Sevilla winger Capel, who was a constant menace against Bosnia, was the only new face to feature in the match from the squad Luis Aragones led to victory at Euro 2008 in June. Barcelona's teenage forward Bojan Krkic, who has yet to make his senior side debut, looks set to watch from the sidelines again, with Daniel Guiza the first change option behind solo striker Villa, in Del Bosque's 4-1-4-1 formation. Fernando Torres is out injured. Armenia slumped to a 2-0 defeat at home to Turkey in their Group Five opener on Saturday, and lost influential centre back Robert Azumanyan to injury. They have played Spain four times and never scored let alone picked up a point in their previous meetings, conceding ten goals along the way. Probable teams: Spain: Iker Casillas; Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Raul Albiol, Joan Capdevila; Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Marcos Senna, Cesc Fabregas, Diego Capel or Santi Cazorla; David Villa. Armenia: Roman Berezovski; Sargis Hovsepyan, Romik Khachatryan, Alexander Tateosian, Levon Pachayan; Artur Voskanyan, Ararat Arakelyan, Artavazd Karamyan, Aghvan Mkrtchyan; Hamlet Mkhitaryan, Edgar Manucharyan
