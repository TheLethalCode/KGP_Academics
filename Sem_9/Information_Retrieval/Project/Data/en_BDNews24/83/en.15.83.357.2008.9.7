 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin wants to watch the national football team closely at the next month's Mardeka Cup to spot the their weaknesses. "I want to see the weaknesses of the team with my own eyes by watching the matches they will play in Mardeka Cup next month," said Salahuddin at his office on Sunday. The Mardeka Cup is scheduled for Sept 15-25 in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. "Whenever the team fails in a tournament many things are cited as reasons for the failure, but this time I want to see the players' performance on the pitch," said the former national striker. "Once I find out the weaknesses, I will take initiatives to get over those limitations as I have a bigger ambition. The main focus is that the team perform well in the SAFF Games at home in 2009." The BFF on Thursday announced a 30-member preliminary squad for the Mardeka Cup with from three giants Abahani, Mohammedan and Brothers Union cramming it. Coach Shafiqul Islam Manik will hardly get all the players together before the Eid-ul Fitr as the clubs apparently unwilling to release their players for the 11-team second edition of B. League scheduled for a Sept 13 start. Asked about the need for a camp for the national team ahead of the tournament, the BFF boss said there was no need to arrange any special camp. He said he would not mind even if the team went down 7-0 against any side in the tournament. The B. League committee, however, is trying to squeeze some time from the schedule after the Eid-ul-Fitr to allow coach Manik to explain to the players what he expects from them. Salahuddin believes the performance of the team would gradually go up if they could organise the tournaments and league regularly. Bangladesh are scheduled to take part in the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar on November 19-25 and Salahuddin hinted that he would also witness Bangladesh's matches in the tournament. Bangladesh lost in the Cup final in 2005 under Argentine coach Diego Cruciani. b
