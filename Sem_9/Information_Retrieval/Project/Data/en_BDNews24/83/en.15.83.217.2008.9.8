 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has said it will not accept any unilateral move by the government and the Election Commission to impose new electoral laws, a party leader said Monday. "We are not bound to oblige if the government and the Election Commission take any unilateral decision and we will make our stance clear [Tuesday]," acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after holding separate meetings with the allies in the 14-party coalition. "Gone are the days of [making] unilateral decisions. If anything untoward occurs following the [one-sided] decision of the Election Commission, elections will be disrupted," the acting general secretary warned. The AL held meetings on Sunday and Monday with its partners ahead of the third-round dialogue with the Election Commission. The party sat with the Workers Party of Bangladesh, Ganatantri Party and Samyabadi Dal on Sunday and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu), Gano Azadi League and Communist Party of Bangladesh on Monday. The demands AL would make at Tuesday's dialogue include national elections ahead of all other elections, withdrawal of the state of emergency, upazila polls after parliamentary polls, bar on registration of parties that pursue religion-based politics and ban on the war criminals to run elections. Terming the provision of 'negative' votes 'amusing', Ashraful said: "We will ask the Election Commission to take out the provision." He protested the provision that asks political parties to disband front organisations. "All the countries of the world including India, the United Kingdom and the United States have associated organisations," he said. On the provision that there should not be any foreign branches of the parties, he said: "The provision of forming foreign branches depend on the law of the relevant countries." Asked to comment on their arch-rival BNP's skipping the electoral dialogue, he said: "The BNP has said that it will join the dialogue and elections after the party chairperson is released." "As the leader has not been released yet, the party is not joining the dialogue." "The government and the Election Commission need to make sure that all parties go to the elections. The elections will not be acceptable if all parties do not take part." A eight-strong AL delegation will join Tuesday's electoral dialogue. The party earlier attended the first and second-round of dialogues with the EC. bdnew
