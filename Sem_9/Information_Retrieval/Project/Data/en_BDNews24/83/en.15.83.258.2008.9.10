<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Abdul Jalil on Wednesday secured bail from the High Court in a graft case and said he would resume working as general secretary of the Awami League. "I was released on parole for treatment on condition that I'd not engage in politics during the parole period. Getting fully cured, I returned home on August 31," Jalil said at a press conference organised at the Supreme Court Bar Association soon after his bail order. "Since my parole should end today (Wednesday), I appealed to the High Court for bail and the High Court has granted me bail until October 20." "As per the Awami League constitution, I'm supposed to be continuing to work in my old official capacity. Being respectful to the rule of law, I was waiting for my bail orders. As a bailed person, I now announce my resumption of official duties as the Awami League general secretary." Replying to a query, he said, "My wife had only submitted a prayer for sending me abroad then." In detention, Jalil had talked about quitting politics, when necessary. Pressed for comments, Jalil said, "I've practised politics for long 45 years. I'll continue to do so in the name of people's welfare as long as I'm alive. You all know what befalls one when in jail and otherwise." Earlier in the day, the High Court granted him provisional bail in the case on charges of illegal acquiring of wealth and concealing wealth-related information. The court asked the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the accused should not be granted permanent bail in the case. The vacation bench of Justice Mirza Hossain Haider and Justice Mamnun Rahman gave the bail order after hearing Jalil's petition. Barrister Ameer-Ul-Islam on Tuesday made the bail appeal. The home ministry on Tuesday extended Jalil's parole until Sept 20. bdnew
