 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - Key BNP allies Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote informed the Election Commission Monday of their decision to forego their scheduled session in the third-round electoral dialogue. Representatives of both parties submitted letters to the personal secretary of the chief election commissioner. Earlier on Sunday BNP did not attend its scheduled dialogue session. The commission sent the party a second invitation to join the dialogue. But the EC would not do the same to Jamaat and IOJ, teh chief election commissioner said. The IOJ session was set for 11:30am and Jamaat for 2pm Monday. The two parties in their letters demanded announcement of the national elections schedule. In a letter addressed to the chief election commissioner Monday, Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid said their participation in the first two EC convened dialogues had yielded no "positive or realistic results at all". The party said their filing of a writ petition challenging the Representation of the People Order (amendment) ordinance was another factor that influenced their decision. It also mentioned the EC's import of transparent ballot boxes, despite the availability of used ballot boxes, and keeping a provision for negative votes as reasons for their shunning the meeting. After submitting letter Jamaat's legal affairs secretary Jashim Uddin Sarker told reporters: "We have filed a writ petition challenging the RPO(amendment) ordinance and the court has issued a rule nisi on the petition." "Under the circumstances the party does not want to discuss electoral laws and regulations. We have notified our position in the letter," he said. Asked whether the two parties would be sent second invitation chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told bdnews24.com: "It will not be required. The parties have stated that they would not join the dialogue until the petition was not resolved." "We have nothing to do with it," Huda said. In its letter signed by secretary general Md Abdul Latif Nizami, IOJ said: "The writ petition challenging the legality of redrawing of constituencies and registration of political parties is awaiting High Court hearing." "The party does not consider wasting time by holding talks in this regard." It asked the EC to hold national elections by scrapping registration regulations and delimitation of constituencies. Parties that have attended the third-round dialogue sessions include the Workers Party of Bangladesh, Samyabadi Dal, Ganotantri Party, Jatiya Party (Ershad), Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu). bdnews24.co
