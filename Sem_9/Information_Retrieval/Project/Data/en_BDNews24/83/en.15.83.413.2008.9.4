 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Power Division on Thursday urged people to conserve scarce power by switching off unnecessary lights, air coolers and other electric appliances. It issued a press statement saying initiatives had been taken to enhance power generation to cope with the demand during Ramadan. The statement came a day after outraged locals in Narsingdi vandalised a Rural Electrification Board office and an angry mob in Bogra blockaded the Dhaka-Bogra highway to protest frequent power-cuts as the holy month began. Power Division secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan on Thursday said power generation increased 400 megawatts over the last one week but was far from enough to meet the increasing demand. Attempts are on to cope with the situation by making 'equal load-shedding' all over the country, he said. He, however, denied excessive power cuts anywhere. Power-starved people in Narsingdi vandalised REB office and set fire to a private car, two pickup vans and six motorcycles to protest frequent outages in the early hours of Wednesday. Angry people in Bogra put a blockade on Dhaka-Bogra highway in Ariabazar area under Shahjahanpur Upazila on Wednesday night. On Aug 24, power loom workers in Narisingdi blockaded Dhaka-Sylhet highway. Syed Wahidul Islam, general manager of Narsingdi REB-2, said, "We get 18 megawatts (MW) a day against a demand of 38 MW. On Tuesday, we got just 17 MW." The Power Division in the statement said 3757 MW electricity was produced on Wednesday, 400 more than a week ago. Additional power-cuts became necessary due to higher demand during iftar , tarawih prayers and sehri , it said. A senior official at the Power Division, who wished not to be named, said power plants on Wednesday generated 1002 MW less power than their capacity. Shortage of gas contributed to 831 MW of power not being produced. Thirty-six MW more power could be generated if there were enough water in Kaptai. Besides, three power units that can produce 135 MW remained closed because of repairs. The demand for power on Thursday was 4,400 MW and the highest production was 3,800 MW. In the lead-up to Ramadan, the government made assurances that it would limit outages during the month. The chief adviser's special assistant for power M Tamim had said outages would be kept to a minimal level during iftar , tarawih prayers and sehri , in part by ceasing routine maintenance work at power plants during the month. bdnews24
