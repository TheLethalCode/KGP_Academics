<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)Physiotherapy students of the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR) submitted a memorandum to the ministry of health on Wednesday, calling for removal of its director AKM Ishak. The students, whose recent agitations forced NITOR authorities to cancel classes, also pressed for re-investigation into an alleged assault on them by hospital staff. They rejected a probe committee's report on the incident. At least 20 people were injured on Sept 4, after the students clashed with hospital doctors and staff over demands for a full fledged college. Police arrested nine people including one teacher in the incident. Authorities were forced to halt all classes until further notice, director Ishak had said. Three student representatives handed over the memorandum to the personal secretary of the health adviser on Wednesday. Their demands also included resumption of classes, arrest and penalty of those involved "in the attack against students" and withdrawal of cases against the students involved in the clashes, alongside their original demand for a full fledged college of physiotherapy. bdnew
