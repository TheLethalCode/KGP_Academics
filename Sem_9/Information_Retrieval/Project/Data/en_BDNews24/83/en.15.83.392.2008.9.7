 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP is not sitting with the Election Commission in the ongoing dialogue on registration, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed has said . "BNP will not take part in today's (Sunday) dialogue, the secretary general conveyed the message in a letter addressed to the chief election commissioner and I've just delivered it," said Rizvi to reporters Sunday at the EC headquarters. He reached the letter of BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain to the chief election commissioner at the office of his private secretary Mostafa Faruque around 10:15am. "The secretary general in his letter said the BNP will not join the dialogue on Sunday as this meeting has been convened only to discuss the political parties' registration. "[It] will not help in any manner resolve the current deadlock in which we all are stuck, unable to make any headway," Rizvi told reporters, elaborating on his party's stance on the ongoing round of the electoral dialogue. Delwar wrote in his letter, Rizvi said, the neutrality of the EC has, of late, been questioned seriously after it behaved in a scandalous manner, favouring a 'particular political party' waiving all regulations. Replying to a query, he said, "There's hardly any space left for us to join any dialogue with the government, when they kept us, a major political party, out while burdening the nation with 'undemocratic and anti-people' laws and regulations." "Under the circumstances, no elections can be held fairly." Rizvi was accompanied by the former lawmaker Sohrabuddin, Shirin Sultana and others. The EC has invited 16 political parties to the third round of its dialogues, where its meeting the BNP was scheduled for midday Sunday. The EC is holding meetings with the Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bikalpodhara and Jatiya Shamajtantrik Daal (JSD-Inu) in the day. bdnews
