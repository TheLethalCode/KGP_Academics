<TITLE> Oil rebounds from 5-month low as OPEC cut surprises </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil jumped more than $1 to near $105 a barrel on Wednesday, rebounding from a five-month low after OPEC agreed a small but unexpected production cut that some analysts said showed their resolve to keep prices above $100. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it had agreed to revise its complex output targets to a new limit of 28.8 million barrels per day (bpd), which the cartel's president said effectively meant reducing supply by about 520,000 bpd versus July over the next 40 days. Most analysts had expected the group to maintain formal targets at its meeting in Vienna, although some had suggested that its members could tighten compliance to help stem a near 30 percent slump in oil prices since July. US crude for October delivery surged $1.37 to $104.63 a barrel as of 3:28 am EDT, shaking off a brief mid-day wobble due to continued strength in the US dollar. Prices hit a five-month low of $101.74 on Tuesday. London Brent crude rose $1.56 cents to $101.90, after falling below $100 on Tuesday for the first time since April. "Since the market is over-supplied, the conference agreed to abide by September 2007 production allocations (adjusted to include new members Angola and Ecuador and excluding Indonesia and Iraq), totaling 28.8 million bpd," the group said in a communique after a nearly five-hour meeting. OPEC President Chakib Khelil warned that he still saw surplus oil supply building on the market by the end of the year. Analysts said the group had sent a clear message to the oil market, which has been battered by a recovery in the US dollar and a darkening economic outlook that has spurred an exodus of investment funds from the whole commodities complex. "It certainly shows that OPEC is not afraid to defend a $100 price level," said Jonathan Kornafel, Asia director at US-based options trader Hudson Capital Energy. The calculations of the new target were complicated by the inclusion of new members and the removal of Indonesia, which asked that its membership be suspended. Some analysts questioned whether the cuts would fully materialize without details on which countries would be expected to curb supply. But others said the fact that OPEC chose to make its decision explicit -- rather than merely agreeing to tighten compliance with existing limits -- was significant. "We think this is a serious deal for a real cut... In this market, direction matters and this is a turn," UBS economist Jan Stuart said in a report. Still, the risks to global oil demand posed by high prices and endangered economic growth loom large, threatening to undermine a rally that has lifted prices from $20 since 2002. "I don't think the cut can actually stop the current downtrend in the oil market," said Susumu Ogasawara, a manager at Ace Koeki Co Ltd in Tokyo. "The focus will shift back to falling demand and concerns about the global economy." The oil cartel, which controls about 40 percent of world oil production, agreed to meet again in Algeria on Dec 17. STOCKS, HURRICANES Traders were seeking direction from US inventory data later in the day, which was to show a fall in crude stocks by 4.4 million barrels in the week to September 5 after Hurricane Gustav shut down fields, a Reuters poll of analysts found. Gasoline stocks were seen falling by 4.2 million barrels and distillates by 2.7 million barrels. Hurricane Ike's progress toward the US Gulf of Mexico kept most oil and natural gas production shut in for a second week, although its path has recently shifted south and west of the biggest concentration of production platforms, aiming instead toward the Texas refining hub of Corpus Christi
