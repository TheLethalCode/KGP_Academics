Pakistan cricket suffered two major setbacks this year with Australia postponing a test tour in March and the eight-nation Champions Trophy being postponed by the ICC last month because of security concerns. "It is very frustrating for the players the way two important events have been postponed this year. It is so depressing that despite being a major cricket playing nation we do not play a test match this year," Malik told reporters. Pakistan played its last test against India in December and their next test series is not until January when India tour. Malik said for cricket to thrive in Pakistan it was important for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ensure teams toured the country. "The ICC needs to step in and play a more decisive role. If teams keep on refusing to tour Pakistan despite assurances even from our government we will become an isolated cricket nation," he added. The Pakistan Cricket Board had tried to arrange an alternate series after the postponement of the Champions Trophy but without success. South Africa declined to take part in a tri-series this month with Sri Lanka, citing the need to give players a rest after their tour of England.
