 WASHINGTON, Sep 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-il failed to appear at a triumphal military parade on Tuesday celebrating North Korea's 60th birthday, prompting a US intelligence official to say he may have had a stroke. "It does appear that Kim Jong-il has suffered a health setback, potentially a stroke," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. She said there have been no signs of a change in governing power and that assessing whether Kim was still capable of governing would "call for a lot of speculation." South Korea's largest daily, the Chosun Ilbo, said Kim, 66 and suspected of suffering from chronic illness, collapsed last month, citing a South Korean diplomatic source in Beijing. Kim, as leader, attended the parades for the 50th and 55th anniversary of the state founded by his father Kim Il-sung. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino, asked about the possible stroke, "We do not have any information on that report."
