<TITLE> Yunus may sue Telenor: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OSLO, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus may take legal action against Telenor in a bid to gain full control over Bangladesh operator Grameenphone, Norwegian news agency NTB reported on Thursday. Yunus has repeatedly referred to a deal where Telenor agreed to transfer its share in the company to Grameenphone, but Telenor has replied saying that the deal was not valid. "I hope that a lawsuit will prove to be unnecessary, because Telenor's owners will demand that the company is standing by the intention which was communicated in 1996 about transferring ownership and control through Grameenphone to the poor in Bangladesh," NTB quoted Yunus as saying in a message. Grameenphone, the top cell phone operator in Bangladesh, was founded in 1996 by Norwegian telecom group Telenor and Grameen Telecom, which was originally launched by Yunus. Telenor has a 62 percent stake in Grameenphone, with Grameen Telecom owning the remainder.
