<TEXT>
 Dhaka Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone's majority shareholder Telenor ASA issued a statement Thursday on the allegations of child labour and unfit working conditions that emerged earlier this year over its operations in Bangladesh. A senior official of the Norwegian telecom group was quoted as saying dangerous working conditions including child labour are a major problem in Bangladesh, but "neither Grameenphone nor Telenor can take responsibility for social wrongdoings in Bangladesh". A television documentary unleashed a flood of criticism in Norway in May after it revealed dangerous working conditions, accidental deaths and use of child labour by what the documentary producers alleged was a subcontractor of Telenor in Bangladesh. "Telenor has recently been made aware of unacceptable working conditions at a subcontractor to a supplier to Grameenphone in Bangladesh," Telenor said in a release published on its website Thursday. "In connection with this matter, which has now caught media attention, Telenor wishes to make some further clarifications," the statement said. "On Sept 4, Telenor received a request from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) as to whether or not it had any knowledge of the company Gazi Engineering." NRK had filmed child labour and hazardous working conditions at this company, and asked Grameenphone to look into the matter, Telenor said. "Grameenphone immediately started investigations, and [Thursday morning] identified the company," the statement said. "Gazi Engineering is not a subcontractor to Grameenphone, but a subcontractor to a supplier of construction services," Telenor stated. Hilde Tonne, executive vice president of Telenor was quoted as saying: "This clearly shows the dilemmas we face when doing business in developing countries." "Telenor is systematically working to evaluate and develop health, safety and environmental issues with our subcontractors, but there will always be challenges in developing countries and we have in the past few months concentrated on those that we are in direct relationship with," Tonne said. "When we or others reveal unacceptable conditions further down the value chain, we will of course respond. We are now on to the case." "It is a fact that our presence and long-term work in countries like Bangladesh yield positive spin-offs for the society as such," Tonne was quoted as saying. "Dangerous working conditions, including child labour, are a major problem in Bangladesh. Neither Grameenphone nor Telenor can, however, take responsibility for all social wrongdoings in Bangladesh, but we have taken our share of the responsibility to improve conditions with our suppliers and to work for long-term improvements in all the communities where we operate," said Tonne. Telenor hold a 62 percent stake in Bangladesh operator Grameenphone, which employed the unnamed "supplier of construction services" to make mobile antenna towers. bdn
