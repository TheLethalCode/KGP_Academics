 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Krishak Sramik Janata League urged the Election Commission at the dialogue on Tuesday not to allow Jamaat-e-Islami to register for opposing the country's independence from Pakistan. After the dialogue with the EC, KSJL general secretary Habibur Rahman Talukdar said, "Jamaat-e-Islami cannot be allowed to register with the Election Commission. The Election Commission has no right to register any ant-liberation war organisation including the Jamaat-e-Islami." The third round of dialogue between the Election Commission and political parties reached its last day on Tuesday. "The KSJL demanded immediate lifting of the emergency and holding of the parliamentary polls as soon as possible," he told reporters. On the Upazila elections, Talukdar said, "The Election Commission should not be taking any step which might jeopardise the national polls. We believe that holding the Upazila polls first may hinder the national elections." The five-strong KSJL joined the dialogue at 10:30am. The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Jiku) delegation arrived at 11:45am at the EC Secretariat for participating at the dialogue next. The party's executive president Md Shafique led a four-member delegation to the meeting. At the end of the meeting at 12:45pm, general secretary Abdul Malek Ratan told reporters, "The EC told us that they'll announce the schedules of both Upazila and parliamentary polls in three or four days." As the floods have already swamped scores of Upazila, the number of the Upazila where polls should be held would be reduced, Ratan quoted the EC as saying. JSD (Jiku) told the EC that they had no objection to holding the Upazila polls before the general elections and staging the polls under the emergency, he said. The EC has been in the meeting with NAP (Mozaffar) subsequently since 12:45 pm. The National Awami Party (Mozaffar) delegation led by its general secretary Enamul Haque include Amena Ahmed, MA Ghani, Abdul Wahab and Ismail Hossain. The top polls office is scheduled to sit with the Awami League at 2pm. bdnews24.co
