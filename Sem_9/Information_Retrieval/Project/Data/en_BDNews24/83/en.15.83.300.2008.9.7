<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Administrative directives alone cannot help to close down the blaring price differences between the wholesale and retail markets, the commerce adviser said on Sunday. "The price gap between the two markets can be narrowed through market management development," Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters after a review meeting on market price of essentials and supply situation at the Secretariat. The adviser said prices of some essentials had come down whether some others had remained stable. Prices of rice, lentil, edible oil, onion and cheap peas remained stable until the sixth Ramadan, he added. But prices of aubergine and cucumber increased. Though it was 'off season' these vegetables had huge demands during the month, he said. "Prices are falling in the international market. It's a good sign for us. We'll see the impact here soon," the adviser said. "We have ensured three things  secure supply line, stable rate of prices and special arrangements for the poor by providing subsidies." The government was continuing its efforts to keep the market prices within the reach of the people, he said. "We are working so that prices remain stable all the time, not for one day." "We have stocks of 11.87 tonnes of rice in September. To have such stock in this month (of Ramadan) is a record for us," Hossain Zillur said. On the open-market sale of rice the adviser said: "The OMS programme drew huge response at the beginning. (But) as the prices of rice fell the sale slowed down." On the interim government's 100-day employment-generation programme, he said: "Some 20 lakh people will receive Tk 20 crore per day through this programme after Sept 15." "This will make a positive impact in the market," he said. On Sunday's meeting, the adviser said: "Market monitoring is the government's regular job. Various organisations including food directorate, [Trading Corporation of Bangladesh] and BDR are doing the job." "We have spoken to the organisations about the international market situation, supply of commodities in the market. We also discussed whether any steps could be taken for the poor and whether the market situation was being kept at a tolerable level in the Ramadan," he said. bdnews2
