<TITLE> Nuclear suppliers approve US-India deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Vienna, Sept 6 (bvdnews24.com/Reuters) - Forty-five nuclear supplier states on Saturday approved a US proposal to drop a ban on trade with India, advancing a US-Indian atomic energy deal, diplomats in the closed meeting told Reuters. The decision followed a tense debate over conditions for the move demanded by Nuclear Suppliers Group members to minimize any damage to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which India has not joined. Details were not immediately known. One hurdle remained before the US-India deal could take force -- ratification by the US Congress. It must act before adjourning in late September for elections or the deal could be left to an uncertain fate under a new U.S. administration.
