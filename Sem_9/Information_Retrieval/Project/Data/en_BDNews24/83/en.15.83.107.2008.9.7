<TITLE> Serena focused on grand slam title, not top billing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, September 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While the top ranking will be on the line when Serena Williams meets Serb Jelena Jankovic in the U.S. Open women's final, the American has her sights squarely set on clinching a ninth grand slam crown. Twice champion at Flushing Meadows, Williams will be bidding for her first title here since 2002, and her first major since last year's Australian Open when the rescheduled women's final takes place on Sunday. "Number one is not my goal right now," the muscular 26-year-old told reporters. "I know I'll get that eventually if I continue to play the tournaments. I just want to be able to win the grand slams, and play and stay healthy. I think the ranking will definitely come." The women's final, initially scheduled for Saturday, was postponed to Sunday evening after the remnants of Tropical Storm Hanna washed out most of the day's play. Fourth seed Williams, however, was unperturbed about the weather delays. "I'm ready to play tomorrow," she said, after reaching the final on Friday after sweeping aside Russian Dinara Safina 6-3 6-2. "I'll be ready for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, doesn't matter." Jankovic, 23, reached her first grand slam final with a 6-4 6-4 win over Russian Elena Dementieva and accepts she will need to be at her best against Williams. "Overall I think she is the strongest player on the tour, together with her sister," said the Serb, who beat Williams on the way to the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January. POWER GAME "Nobody has the power they have. If you want to win when they're in form, you have to be on the top of your level, go for every shot and really have to run a lot. It will be difficult, but it's doable." The second seed, who briefly claimed top spot in the world rankings last month, is 3-3 with Williams in career meetings and has a burning to desire to win her first grand slam. "Mentally, I feel I'm a lot stronger because I really believe in myself," said Jankovic, who would return to the top of the rankings with victory on Sunday. "I really want to do this and I think it's about time for me to make that step forward, to break that barrier and go a long way. "I want to win a grand slam and this is why I came here." Fellow Serb Novak Djokovic, who clinched the Australian Open title in January, backed her to win. "She's very, very, very good player," Djokovic said after he missed out on a place in the men's final. "She's been very consistent (and) she's going to be very motivated to win her first grand slam title." Although Williams will be widely viewed as the favourite because of her grand slam pedigree, she played down her billing. "I don't feel (as if I'm) expected to win," the world number three said. "I'm going against someone that's ranked higher than me. "I feel like I have nothing to lose. She has a lot of pressure to win her first grand slam and I'm just enjoying every moment." Weather-permitting, the women's final is scheduled to start at 2100 local (0100 GMT Monday) on the Arthur Ashe Stadium cour
