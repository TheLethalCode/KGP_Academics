 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  With around 150 upazilas in 22 districts of the country already flooded, the Election Commission is set to give a decision Wednesday on upazila polls slated for October, a top election official said Monday. Election Commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com Monday that EC will present its stand on Sept 10 (Wednesday) after taking into count the views of the political parties. The EC has also had talks with the government on the local polls. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain and EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir met with the chief adviser Sunday night. Kabir, echoing Commissioner Sakhawat, told bdnews24.com Monday that any EC decision would depend on both the floods and the outcome of the third round dialogue. Senior EC officials, meanwhile, have been hinting that the EC is now thinking of an alternative line on upazila elections. "Given the opposition by political parties to upazila polls and the flood situation in the country, the EC may announce a probable date for national elections first," one senior official said. The schedule is likely to be announced in the first week of November, they said. The chief adviser has already said that the national elections would be held in the third week of December. But the EC must take into account the fact that nearly a third of the upazilas are already flooded. The EC had said last week it was looking to hold elections to those Upazilas not affected by floods. At a regular briefing at the EC Secretariat, secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir told reporters a list of the flood-affected upazilas was being drawn up. Asked whether they saw the floods as the main obstacles to holding upazila elections, Kabir said: "Floods have been affecting many districts and upazilas. We are collecting a situation report." Water Board director general Hossain Shahid Mozaddad Farooq told bdnews24.com Monday: "Around 150 upazilas in 22 districts of the country have already been flooded. Though there is possibility of improvement in the situation in October, nothing can be said definitely now." "In the devastating floods in Sep-Oct, 2007 a total of 47 districts were inundated." WDB sent an overall picture of flood situation to the water resources ministry Monday. Up to Aug 20, the final voter lists for 297 upazilas had been published. The EC has said it was planning to hold elections to around 300 upazilas. Political parties, including the Awami League and BNP, have been opposing the holding of upazila elections before national elections. In three rounds of dialogue with the EC most parties have demanded announcement of the schedule for national election ahead of any other polls. bdnews
