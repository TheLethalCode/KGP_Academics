<TITLE> Gas price may be hiked: ERC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  Power tariffs might not be increased until January for the small-scale users, but gas prices might, the chairman of Energy Regulatory Commission has said. Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com Thursday power prices might be hiked for the big customers, which means the domestic users may not see any immediate rise. Since the government would like to finalise such decisions by September 30, a public hearing will be held on Sept 24 on gas price enhancement, Rahman said. Earlier, another public hearing was held on August 20 on the Power Development Board proposal placed with the ERC on June 15. The PDB proposed enhancing power tariffs on average by 41 percent. PDB's large customers include DESA, DPDC, DESCO, OJOPADICO and REB. They will in turn be able to propose power tariff increases for their customers, once the PDB enhances them, said an ERC official. Holding public hearing and relevant verifications may take at least three months, said the official who did not want to be named. The increases, therefore, might not be possible to implement before January. bdnews
