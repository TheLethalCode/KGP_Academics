 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia should sit together in the interest of democracy, says lawyer barrister Rafiqul Haque who defends both former prime ministers in court. "They should sit together in the interests of the country and democracy. They can meet at my place," the lawyer told reporters at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, after Khaleda had secured bail in the Niko and GATCO cases against her. "There has been enough bickering. The Awami League and the BNP have to stop this and work together in the interests of the country," Haque said. The lawyer said the two leaders should behave like politicians. "They must learn from great politicians of the subcontinent such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Muhammad Ali Jinnah." If they fail to realise this, even after the experience of the last one and a half years, incidents like 1/11 will continue to take place, he said. "Sheikh Hasina is the daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Khaleda Zia is the wife of former president Ziaur Rahman. I feel very lucky that I represent both of them." He said he did so in the hope that the rule of law would prevail. "I do not see it as Awami League or BNP." On AL's opposition to senior BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman's bail, the lawyer said: "They should keep in mind that (AL's general secretary) Abdul Jalil too will have to come to the High Court to seek bail." Barrister Haque said Khaleda had secured bail in all the cases against her through due legal process. He came down hard on the government saying it had arrested many people in violation of human rights. "I have been working to establish the rule of law," he repeated. bdnew
