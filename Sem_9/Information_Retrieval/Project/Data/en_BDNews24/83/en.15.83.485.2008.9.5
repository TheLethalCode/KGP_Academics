<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry has blamed the price hike of essential goods on the wholesale traders at Karwan Bazaar and urged the government to rein them in. It has also urged the government to take initiatives to stop toll collection from the retailers. FBCCI president Annisul Huq after a visit to Gulshan-2 and Mohammadpur Town Hall kitchen markets on Friday said Karwran Bazaar wholesalers were charging prices much higher than other wholesale markets were. "There are allegations that they are not giving receipt to the retailers. So the government will have to take initiatives to control the traders at Karwan Bazaar," he said. According to the list given by the FBCCI commodities price monitoring taskforce on Friday, local ginger sold at Tk 40-45 a kg at Shyam Bazaar, and Tk 74-76 at Karwan Bazaar. At Shyam Bazaar a kg of aubergine sold for Tk 30-40 but at Karwan Bazar it was Tk 60-62. A kg of green chilli sold at Tk 50-60 at Shyam Bazaar but at Tk 60-70 at Karwan Bazaar. The taskforce also said traders at Karwan Bazaar were charging exorbitant prices for other essentials including onion, potato and cucumber. The prices go up further when it goes to retail market from wholesalers, it added. On visits to the two kitchen markets, the FBCCI team found that aubergine was selling at Tk 60-70, green chilli Tk 80, ginger Tk 80-90, local onion Tk 32-34 and sugar Tk 38. Huq, the FBCCI chief, said, "The market is comparatively stable. If the Karwan Bazaar traders give receipt to the retailers the price would come down further." He said they had asked leaders of the Bazaar committees not to let the wholesalers sell commodities to the retailers without receipt. The FBCCI president quoting the retail traders said, "When they return after buying commodities from the wholesalers they have to pay toll. We will ask the government to stop toll collection to lower the prices." FBCCI vice president Abu Alam Chowdhury said, "The retailers have said that they have to pay toll to police and hooligans after buying commodities." The taskforce convenor Kamal Uddin Ahmed and FBCCI director Shafkat Haider were also with the team during market monitoring visits. bdne
