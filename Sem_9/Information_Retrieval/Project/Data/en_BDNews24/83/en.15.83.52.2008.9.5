<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil visit Chile in a World Cup qualifier on Sunday knowing defeat could hasten the downfall of beleaguered coach Dunga. Second-placed Argentina, buoyed by the gold medal won by their under-23s at the Beijing Olympics, host leaders Paraguay on Saturday while Peru coach Jose Del Solar goes into the game against Venezuela with his job also on the line. Brazil have slumped to fifth in the table with nine points from six games, one point behind Chile. The top four qualify automatically while fifth place would condemn Brazil, the only team to have played at all previous 18 World Cup finals, to a two-legged playoff against a nation from the CONCACAF region for a place in South Africa. A 2-0 defeat in Paraguay followed by a goalless draw at home to Argentina in June meant the pressure mounted on Dunga before his decision to lead the Olympic team backfired when they managed only a bronze medal. "This is all normal, it's not the first nor the last time that this happens with the Brazil team," Dunga told reporters. "The most important thing is the squad keeps working. We must base our work on criteria, on concepts and on professional conduct." KAKA OUT Brazil are missing playmaker Kaka, who had an operation on his left knee in June, and midfielder Anderson has withdrawn through injury. Ronaldinho, who played in the Olympics as an over-age player but failed to shine, has been included in the squad and could make his first full international appearance since the 2-1 win over Uruguay in November. Paraguay's excellent strike duo of Roque Santa Cruz and Salvador Cabanas are doubtful for Saturday's visit to Buenos Aires while Argentina midfielder Fernando Gago is suspended. In Saturday's other games Colombia, third on 10 points, host sixth-placed Uruguay (eight) in Bogota while Ecuador (five) face Bolivia (four) in Quito. Peru, bottom on three points, meet Venezuela (seven) in Lima in their first match since a 6-0 thrashing by Uruguay in June. Coach Del Solar omitted strikers Claudio Pizarro and Jefferson Farfan, who are available again after having 18-month bans for indiscipline slashed to three. Striker Paolo Guerrero is also missing as he begins a six-match international ban for his sending-off against Uruguay when he insulted the referee
