<TITLE> Constitutional court ousts Thai PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Sep 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's Constitutional Court ordered Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej to stand down on Tuesday, accusing him of breaking the law by hosting TV cooking shows while in office. The verdict prompted mixed reactions from protesters occupying Government House to try to force Samak from office, with some cheering his demise, and others fearing the belligerent 73-year-old would simply be voted back to power by his party. Wittaya Buranasiri, chief government whip from Samak's People Power Party, a successor to the disbanded party of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, echoed the defiance his boss has shown throughout the three month campaign against him. "I insist that our party leader will be the prime minister," he told reporters within minutes of the verdict. There was no immediate reaction from Samak. The stock market, which has fallen 24 percent since the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) launched its push at the end of May, closed down 0.3 percent, having failed to react to the verdict. The PAD's main gripe is that Samak is a puppet of Thaksin, who was removed as prime minister by the army in a 2006 coup. The group, a mix of royalist businessmen, academics and activists united by their hatred of Thaksin, had hoped the conflict of interest charges against Samak for hosting the commercial TV cooking programs after becoming prime minister. Samak testified in his own defense on Monday, denying any wrongdoing as the star of "Tasting, Grumbling" and "Touring at 6 a.m.". He suggested the case was politically motivated and said the 80,000 baht ($2,300) his driver received was to cover the cost of fuel and ingredients for the show. He gave up the role in April, more than two months after becoming prime minister. MARKET VISIT With the thick skin that has typified his behavior throughout, Samak toured a meat and vegetable market in the northeastern province of Udon Thani on Tuesday, before chairing a "mobile" weekly cabinet meeting. He declined to answer questions from reporters afterwards. At a pro-government rally on Monday evening in the town, a stronghold for his seven-month-old government, he vowed not to resign or call a snap election. "I declare that I will not dissolve parliament. I will not quit. I will fight on," he told thousands of cheering supporters. The standoff between the government and PAD has paralyzed administration decision-making at a time of slowing economic growth and high inflation. It has also scared away visitors to the "Land of Smiles", with airlines and hotels reporting cancellations as more countries issue travel warnings in the wake of Samak's declaration last week of a state of emergency. The tension spilt over into bloodshed last week when a man was killed in a street battle between pro- and anti-government groups, trigging a declaration of a state of emergency from Samak that the highly politicized army chose to ignore. Two years after its removal of Thaksin in a coup, the army has insisted it will not intervene again, but senior officers acknowledge the political crisis has reached a stalemate. If the deadlock continues or more people are hurt or killed, the crisis could also trigger a move by revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has stepped into several disputes during his six decades on the throne. In 2006, when Thaksin faced a prolonged campaign by the PAD, the king summoned the country's top judges to tell them to resolve the political "mess" after the opposition boycotted a general election, rendering the result void.
