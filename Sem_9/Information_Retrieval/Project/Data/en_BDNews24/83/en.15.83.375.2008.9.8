 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The processing of Tarique Rahman's UK visa application will be completed on Monday, according to a lawyer of the BNP senior joint secretary general. "The visa application procedure will end today; we will apply for a German visa on Tuesday," advocate Ahmed Azam Khan told bdnews24.com at the British High Commission in Gulshan. "If the latter is also processed quickly, we will be able to send Tarique abroad within the shortest possible time," he said. Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman have also applied for UK visas, the lawyer said. The joint BNP secretary general was released on bail on Sept 3 and remains under treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Joint replacement specialist of BSMMUH Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon, also a member of the medical board formed for Tarique, told bdnews24.com Sunday that his back pain had worsened. "Visitors have been requested to stay away, and the procedure to send him abroad as soon as possible is underway," Dolon said. He said Tarique had been advised to take complete bed rest until then. bdnew
