 Tashan, China, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry residents wailed and protested as rescuers in northern China kept hunting on Wednesday for dozens of victims feared trapped by a deluge of mud after a mine waste reservoir collapsed. State media reported searchers have confirmed 56 dead after heavy rain triggered Monday's collapse of the holding pond at the Tashan mine in Shanxi province. But some news reports and local officials have suggested the thick mud that blanketed hundreds of meters could hold more dead, possibly 100 or more. Dozens of friends and relatives hoping for news of people feared trapped were kept away from the site by police. Many of the dead were apparently migrant workers from southwest China. Some relatives and friends of the missing accused officials of cold-hearted incompetence. "It's not because of the rain. It wasn't a natural disaster, it was man-made," said a migrant worker surnamed Zhang, who said his friend was probably killed. "Whole families have gone. So many are dead. Why aren't you digging out our relatives?" a middle-aged woman, Zheng Xiongmei, screamed at a local official. The Chinese government took extraordinary steps to ensure the nation was trouble-free throughout the Beijing Olympic Games in August. But this disaster, the first big accident since then, is a reminder that the country's mines often remain perilous. CROWDED MARKETPLACE Residents from seven nearby villages had crowded at a marketplace that was buried by the collapsed reservoir, the Beijing News reported. The Communist Party propaganda chief of Xiangfen county, where the mine in located, dismissed the reports of hundreds of dead as "rumor" but refused to estimate the toll. "It's all conjecture at the moment," the propaganda chief, Dong Fengyi, said in an interview. Teams of officials were registering names of people who locals and migrant workers said were missing, she said. By Wednesday morning the rain that had earlier hampered rescuers had eased. More than 1,100 police, firefighters and villagers have been hunting for survivors, according to state media. But hopes appeared dim of finding any more two days after the disaster, and lifting away the dense mud could take days. Officials have blamed reckless mining in this polluted region that is scattered with small mines and smelters. "They knew about that reservoir and did nothing," cried one woman, trying to get past the police cordon to the mudslide. She said seven relatives were missing, including her husband. China's mining industry is the world's most dangerous, killing nearly 3,800 people last year, as high demand for raw materials from a booming economy pushes managers to cut safety corners. Most victims are coal miners. But strong iron ore demand has encouraged miners to dig up even low-grade ore, often with little regard for safety or the environment. bd
