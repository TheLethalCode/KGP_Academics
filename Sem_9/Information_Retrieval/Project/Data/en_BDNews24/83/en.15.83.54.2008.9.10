 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation on Wednesday unveiled the logo and fixture of the second B. League, the professional football league, triggering a dispute over the procedure of the allotment of matches. BFF vice president Salam Murshedi unveiled the logo  a football atop a big shield and a golden ribbon over the shield inscribed with the writing Citycell B. League  at Hotel Purbani. He also revealed the 22-rounds fixture with home and away games. "After election, we had committed to keep football on the pitch throughout the year and have already completed the Citycell Federation Cup and Inaugural Citycell Futsal Tournament. We hope that the B. League will also complete successfully," said Murshedi in his welcome speech. Defending champions Abahani Limited will take on Rahmatganj MFS in the opener at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. The league will run through to Sept 27 before the Eid-ul-Fitr vacation and resume on October 5 or 6. Clubs have raised questions over what format the B. League committee follows to complete the fixture. For instance, last year's runners-up Mohammedan Sporting Club are set to get early relief after playing high-voltage matches against Muktijoddha Sangsad, Sheikh Russel KC, Brothers Union and Abahani Limited, all seen as title contenders, successively. B. League manager Abu Nayeem Shohag said they had followed the Asian Football Confederation guidelines for the fixture. "If they follow the AFC guidelines, why didn't they hold a draw for all 11 teams this year," questioned Nurul Alam Chowdhury, the president of Sheikh Russel KC. Abahani manager and BFF member Sattyajit Das Rupu said he had no idea about the AFC guidelines and that the BFF did not provide the guidelines to them. He said they should have attached the AFC instruction to the fixture. Brothers Union manager Amer Khan said it was not fair that a certain team would get extra advantage and that the BFF should follow last year's team standings. Khan accused also said the BFF of being hostile towards them during the Federation Cup draw, keeping them out of four top-seeded teams despite being the Federation Cup champions. The former footballer called for a review of the fixture "in the greater interest of football". b
