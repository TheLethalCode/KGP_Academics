<TITLE> No real gas crisis: economist </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  An artificial gas crisis has been created in the country to protect the interests of some foreign companies, economist Anu Muhammad claimed on Saturday. He alleged that the crisis was intended to pave the way for signing agreements with foreign companies to lease offshore gas fields and coal mines. "We are not supposed to be short of gas before 2012," Anu Muhammad said, at a discussion ahead of the publication of a review on corruption in marketing and distribution of natural gas in the Chittagong region. "The decision of not providing new gas connections in certain areas of the country, including Chittagong, was fraudulent and ill-motivated," said the economist. He said the ownership of the country's gas fields had slipped from the hands of the Bangladeshi people due to the discriminatory deals during previous governments. He said the present government was not interested in resisting corruption either. "Foreign companies now control the gas fields," Anu Muhammad said. He claimed that these foreign companies were "taking the gas fields hostage" by making irrational demands. Transparency International Bangladesh and Shwachetan Nagorik Committee organised Saturday's discussion, at which TIB researcher Golam Mostafa presented a draft report on BGSL. Anu Muhammad said Bakhrabad Gas Systems Limited (BGSL) could have been more profitable if it had not signed a deal with the foreign-run Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company Limited (Kafco). According to the report by researcher Golam Mostafa, BGSL had to pay Tk 1,637 crore in subsidies due to the agreement with Kafco. The government suffered Tk 3,825 crore in losses as of May 2007. BGSL's system loss was 1885.39 million cubic feet from 2002 to 2007, according to TIB's figures. BGSL managing director Quamrul Islam, however, disagreed with the TIB report on system loss, saying the figure stood at 250.35 million cubic feet, worth Tk 256 crore, over the period. Quamrul added that steps were taken to reduce system loss. He said about 3,500 connections were disconnected on allegations of irregularities. Twenty-two officials and employees were punished in last three years. TIB also reported that as of 2007, BGSL employees had received a total of Tk 396 crore in bribes for new gas connections in the Chittagong region since inception. The report was prepared on the basis of interviews with 603 BGSL clients, 40 officials and employees of BGSL, journalists and energy experts. Golam Mostafa said 56 percent of clients had to pay bribes for gas connections, at an average rate of Tk 11,053 for a household connection and Tk 45,447 for a non-residential connection. bdnews
