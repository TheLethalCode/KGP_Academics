 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has made a U-turn regarding the holding of upazila polls before national elections, for which he had previously voiced strong support. Ershad, attending the party's dialogue with the Election Commission Saturday, said JP "has no objection if the upazila polls are held after the national elections". The Jatiya Party, led by its chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad sat with the Election Commission on Saturday on the first day of the EC's third round dialogues. The third round of talks between the EC and political parties is aimed at smoothing the differences brewing over the schedule of upazila and national polls and registration of parties according to new electoral laws. The JP session, starting around 2pm at the EC Secretariat, marked the first dialogue that Ershad has attended personally. Ershad did not participate directly in the first and second rounds though other JP leaders attended. Bangladesh Workers Party, Samyabadi Dal and Ganotantri Party also sat for third-round talks on Saturday. Election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hussain, just before the dialogue sessions began Saturday, told reporters: "We are set to start the third round dialogue with political parties. We have heard their views in the media, we want to hear them now directly." Emerging from the meeting, Ershad told reporters: "We have demanded of the Election Commission to announce a specific date for the national election. We have no objection if the upazila polls are held after the parliamentary elections." At the same time, he added: "Whenever they are held, Jatiya Party is ready to participate in the upazila elections." Ershad also said: "Jatiya Party has no difference of opinion with the Election Commission on registration of political parties. However, time is required to amend the party constitutions." He expressed hope that his party would be able to complete the registration process after holding party council within the next month. JP presidium member GM Quader told reporters that his party also demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency before the elections. The six member JP delegation in Saturday's talks included acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud, presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed, Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu and secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawlader. The EC side comprised chief election commission ATM Shamsul Huda, election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain and EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir. The EC has invited 16 political parties to the third dialogue. On Sunday it will sit with BNP, Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. On Monday, it will hold talks with Liberal Democratic Party, Islami Oikyo Jote, Jatiya Party (JP), Jamaat-e-Islami. On Tuesday, the EC is scheduled to sit with Awami League, Krishak Sramik Janata League, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Rob) and National Awami Party (Mozaffar). The Election Commission held the first round of electoral dialogue with political parties in September last year. The national elections are scheduled to be held in the third week of December and the EC plans to hold polls to at least 250 upazilas in October. However, most political parties, including Awami League and BNP, have are opposed to upazila polls before the Jatiya Sangsad elections. bdnews24.com
