 Chittagong, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - A crisis management committee has been formed to solve problems prevailing in the Chittagong garments sector. The Chittagong committee was formed at a meeting of the national level crisis management committee, at the port city's Circuit House Monday. Those present underlined the urgency for BGMEA and garments factory owners to pay due salaries and bonuses to workers before Eid. The government formed the 10-member national level committee last year, with the joint secretary of the labour ministry as its head, in the backdrop of labour unrest and instability in the garments sector. It came into force on May 1 last year. The Chittagong committee will review the overall situation in 516 garment units in the port city, and take steps to avert instability in those factories. The committee will also look after the workers demands related to salary and bonus. Chittagong deputy commissioner has been made chief of the 16-member crisis management committee for Chittagong. Joint director of the directorate of labour has been made member secretary of the CMC. The committee will meet at least once every two months. Deputy commissioner Ashraf Shamim presided over Monday's meeting, which discussed in detail the present situation of the garments sector in Chittagong. bdnews
