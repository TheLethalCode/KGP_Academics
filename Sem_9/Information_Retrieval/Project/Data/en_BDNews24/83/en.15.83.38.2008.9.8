<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The democratic process must not become stuck because of the inept conduct of any political group, said a Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu) leader on Monday. Mainuddin Khan Badal was speaking to reporters after a meeting with the Awami League on Monday over ongoing dialogue with the Election Commission. Asked if the dialogue or the parliamentary polls would be meaningful without BNP's participation, the JSD leader said: "The democratic process cannot get stuck due to a particular party's failure or ineptitude, as the nation hasn't leased out its decisiveness to any political alliance." After BNP's decision to boycott its scheduled session of the third round electoral dialogue on Sunday, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had said the EC would wait for the political heavyweight. "The process will not draw to a close without BNP's participation," the CEC said. After Monday's meeting between AL and JSD, at the Gulshan home of acting AL president Zillur Rahman, Badal said: "JSD wants the emergency lifted immediately. We'd also like parliamentary polls first, which is mandatory for the present government to hold." "The upazila polls, on the other hand, is a legal obligation to be fulfilled." On registration of political parties, the JSD leader said: "Some rules, regulations and popular opinions have rendered the registration process difficult. Certain obstacles should be removed to allow the political parties to register properly." Badal described the AL's attendance at an iftar gathering at the Saudi ambassador's residence on Friday where Jamaat-e-Islami leaders were also present as 'an accident'. "As the acting president Zillur Rahman admitted, it was only an accident." "There may be a difference of opinion or two among the allies under the 14-party umbrella, but we all hold only one opinion about the trial of war criminals." Communist Kendro-AL meeting Awami League also met with another of its alliance members, Communist Kendro, on Monday. Communist Kendro joint convenor Wajedul Islam Khan also said they wanted the emergency lifted and parliamentary polls held ahead of any other. "The Election Commission must announce the election schedule as per the election roadmap." He said the demand for holding war crime trials should also be brought up again at the third-round dialogue. The meetings were attended by Zillur Rahman, Sajeda Chowdhury, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury and Syed Ashraful Islam among others from the AL camp. bdnews24.co
