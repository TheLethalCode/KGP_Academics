<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  Lawyers for former prime minister Khaleda Zia would appeal for bail in GATCO and Niko cases in the High Court vacation bench on Sunday, a lawyer said on Friday. "We'll file appeals in the High Court on Sunday for her bail in the GATCO and Niko cases," barrister Nasiruddin Ashim said to journalists. "If the High Court fixes a time for the hearing, [we'll be prepared]. We hope Khaleda Zia will get bails in the two cases as other accused persons in the cases have been granted bail." Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Thursday said, "If Khaleda Zia gets bail in the two cases the former prime minister will get released." He also said the government would not oppose her bail petitions. However, barrister Ashim described the commerce adviser's comments as "simplistic". "Khaleda Zia will be released through legal process. There is no scope here for the government to intervene in court matters." The GATCO case was filed on September 2 last year and the Niko case on May 5. Khaleda and some members of her cabinet were accused in the cases. In the charge sheet of GATCO case, it has been alleged that the accused persons by misusing power gave work of operating Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Container Depot to Global Agro Trade Company (GATCO). The action caused the state a loss of close to Tk 1,000 crore. The Niko case alleges that the agreement with the Canadian company on exploration of oil and gas made the state count about Tk 13,777 crore in losses. bdne
