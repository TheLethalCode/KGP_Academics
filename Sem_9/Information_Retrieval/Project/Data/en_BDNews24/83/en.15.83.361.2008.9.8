<TEXT>
 Bangkok,Sep 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's Constitutional Court will rule on Tuesday whether Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej violated the constitution by hosting television cooking shows while in office, a judge said on Monday. If found guilty of conflict of interest, Samak will have to step down, potentially satisfying thousands of protesters barricaded within his official compound for two weeks. The embattled prime minister appeared in court on Monday, denying he was paid a salary by a private media company to conduct the shows, "Tasting, Grumbling" and "Touring at 6 a.m.". "I was hired, but not their employee," Samak told the court in a televised hearing. He gave up hosting the shows in April, more than two months after he was sworn in as prime minister. The constitution bans the prime minister and cabinet ministers from working for profit-oriented private entities. Tuesday's ruling comes unusually fast for Thai courts, where cases can linger for years. This case stemmed from a complaint made by senators on May 25, the same day a street campaign began against Samak. He has offered to hold a referendum on his seven-month rule, but the protesters led by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), who have taken over Government House, have rejected the offer. The highly politicized military has insisted it will not intervene but senior officers acknowledge that the political crisis has reached a stalemate. Analysts say Samak's offer to hold a referendum makes it harder to force his ouster through intervention either by the military or by revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has stepped into disputes in the past. In 2006, when then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was facing a campaign for his ouster, the king told the country's top judges to resolve the crisis after the opposition boycotted general elections. They were unable to do so before the military launched a coup against Thaksin in September of the same year. b
