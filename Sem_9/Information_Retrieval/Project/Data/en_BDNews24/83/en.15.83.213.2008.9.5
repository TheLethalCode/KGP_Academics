<TITLE> Can Bangladesh lift their performance? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  After having surrendered meekly in the first two matches, Bangladesh will look to show their real strength against World Champions Australia in the final ODI at TIO Stadium in Darwin Saturday. The Tigers hit a new batting low in the first match to be skittled out for just 74 runs, two runs less than their previous lowest against India and Sri Lanka. Besides, they conceded an eight-wicket defeat in the second match to lose the three-match series with one match to go. Captain Mohammad Ashraful after the second match said that they were a much better team than that and they could play much better cricket and it was just not happening for them at the moment. And, he himself as the Bangladesh captain, has also been going through bad patch by scoring just eight runs in the first two matches. On the eve of the third and final match, Ashraful has asked the openers to lift the game. "Our two openers got out very early in the first two matches and the problem that is we need an opening start, like ten overs or 12 overs to stay there," Ashraful was quoted as saying by cricinfo. Bangladesh openers Tamim Iqbal and Mehrab Hossain together put on 12 runs in the first match while they failed to add a run on the board in the second match before being separated leading Bangladesh to collapse at 58 for five and 57 for five in the successive two matches. For his promising effort in the second match to score 21 batting at number 3, Junaid has been rewarded to open the innings with Tamim, who scored 21 and first-ball duck in the first two matches. Admitting the fact that Bangladesh's performance has been going down in recent times, Ashraful said, "After the World Cup, our performance graph is going down, it's true, because I'm a new captain and also because we have a new coach, and the team is also a very new, young side." "We are practicing really hard but the results are not coming," Ashraful said. "Although we are a young and very talented side, we need a little bit of experience." On the other hand, Australia without some key players doesn't want to take the visitors lightly in the final match despite having wrapped up the three-match series. "I'd like to see if we could do another number on them and hopefully get them out for not many, or if we bat first, get a lot of runs," said Australian pacer Stuart Clark.
