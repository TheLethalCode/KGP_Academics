<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Water resources adviser CS Karim said the government was making all-out efforts to tackle countrywide floods, as waters of the major rivers including the Padma, Jamuna, Dharla, and Bangali continued to swell Saturday. The adviser also said a 48-kilometre long flood and erosion-protection embankment would be constructed to protect the people of Jamalpur. He made the pledge during a visit to the erosion-prone Islampur and Dewanganj upazilas in Jamalpur on Saturday to witness the situation for himself. Karim said the Water Development Board had made a number of proposals to stop river erosion in the area. The ministry asked the WDB to submit a long-term project to protect the people of Jamalpur from flood and erosion, he said. He said the WDB would send a proposal to the ministry on the Islampur and Dewanganj embankment on Sept 22. "I will try to get the project approved by ECNEC," he said. Director general of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAEX) Shamsul Islam, WDB director general HS Mozaddad Faruque and WDB additional director general Abul Kalam Md Azad accompanied Karim to Jamalpur. They visited Futani Bazar of Chukaibari Union in Dewanganj and Bahadurabad Rail Station Ghat in Islampur. Abul Kalam Md Azad told bdnews24.com that the embankment project would cost over Tk 100 crore. "If the project is approved by December, I hope we will see no erosion in the next rainy season," he said. The river Jamuna had devoured over 20 villages in the last two years, locals said. DAE director general Shamsul Islam told bdnews24.com: "Crops on 157,181 hectares in 21 districts of the country have gone under flood water." WDB chief Mozaddad Faruque, however, stressed: "There is nothing to panic about. It is a normal flood situation. Such flood is necessary for our agriculture." On dam breaches in several districts over the past few days, Abul Kalam Md Azad said: "If river erosion occurs it will breach embankments." Denying allegations of badly constructed embankments, he said: "It is not true. We construct embankments with all our efforts to save people's lives and property." "We are monitoring the floods round the clock. Ten monitoring teams from Dhaka have gone to different parts of the country." On protecting the capital from floods, he said: "The low lying areas of Dhaka may be flooded over the next two days." "We have taken all out preparations to face it. Buckland Dam at Sadarghat has already been raised with sand bags." bdnews24.com/c
