 Kandahar, Afghanistan, (BBC Online) - Two explosions have rocked a police station in Afghanistan's southern city of Kandahar, killing at least six people, officials say. They say at least seven people were injured after two suicide bombers detonated their bombs in quick succession inside the station. US-led and Afghan forces have been battling Taleban insurgents in the region in recent weeks. In June, at least 350 rebels were freed during a jailbreak from Kandahar jail. "There were two suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the police headquarters one after another," Ahmad Wali Karzai, head of Kandahar's provincial council, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. The bombers targeted a senior border police commander, General Abdul Razaaq, who was injured in the attacks, reports say. Officials believe that some civilians could be among the casualties. Police sealed off the area shortly after the explosions. In a separate development, a suicide bomber attacked a Nato convoy in the western city of Herat but caused no casualties, officials say.
