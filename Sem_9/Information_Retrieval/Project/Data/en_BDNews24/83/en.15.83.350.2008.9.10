 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, on an official visit to the Netherlands, has urged European and Dutch business houses to take advantage of the "market-friendly liberalised rules of Bangladesh", the foreign ministry said Wednesday. Speaking Tuesday evening at The Hague Chamber of Commerce, at an event attended by European and Dutch business representatives, the foreign adviser said: "Bangladesh is one of the most attactive investment destinations in the region today." "We have liberalised our economy in a way that has surpassed many of our neighbours. We offer attractive incentives to foreign investors, legal protection against nationalisatin, generous tax holidays and unrestricted repatriation of capital and profits." "Also we are home to inexpensive, productive and easily trainable labour force," the ministry quoted the adviser. Iftekhar added that investors should take advantage of the increasing regional cooperation in economic fields in South Asia, which provide a huge market for industries located in Bangladesh. The adviser also held two separate meetings Tuesday at the Dutch Parliament House, with members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and with the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, said the foreign ministry. He was received by the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Relations, Fred De Graff, at the first meeting. Iftekhar spoke of foreign and domestic policies of the government, reforms undertaken by the caretaker government and preparations of the forthcoming elections scheduled for December. The senators showed keen interest in the upcoming elections and praised the steps being taken to make the elections "free, fair and credible", the ministry said. Members of Parliament from both the government coalition and opposition parties were present at the second meeting, where questions were asked on the electoral reforms. Earlier in his visit, the adviser had meetings with his Dutch counterpart Maxime Verhagen and development cooperation minister Bert Koenders. He was also guest of honour at a dinner hosted by the Bangladesh-Dutch Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam. bdnews24.com/rah/1637hours
