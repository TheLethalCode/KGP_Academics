 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)Rapid Action Battalion have arrested four people, including the RAB website hacker Shahee Mirza. Saboteurs hacked into the RAB website (www.rab.gov.bd) Friday night. RAB media cell director Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com that they picked up four persons from a Mirpur residence Saturday night. The arrestees claimed they were students of a private institution. Shahee, 'leader' of the arrested youths, confessed to their hacking other sites belonging to different organisations. He also admitted the name and e-mail address he had posted after hacking the RAB site were real. Abul Kalam Azad said RAB would hold a press briefing at its headquarters later in the day. As people entered the website of the elite security force Friday night, they found the words 'Hacked by Shahee_Mirza' posted there. The hacker alleged that the government had not taken sufficient steps for the development of IT in the country, though it had passed laws to prevent cyber crimes. Hacker Shahee claimed in the message he left on the site: "You don't know what cyber security is and you don't know how to protect yourselves either." "Hackers are no criminals, but they happen to be at least ten times better than your (RAB) experts. You guys can't even perceive how meritorious we are," the young hacker said. bdnews
