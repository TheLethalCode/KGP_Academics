 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  Khondokar Jamil Uddin Thursday took over as the general secretary of the Bangladesh Hockey Federation promising to take hockey to the fifth place in Asia after his four-year tenure. Except the president nominated by the government, the 19 members of the 28-member executive committee were elected on Aug 28 after five vice presidents, the general secretary, two joint secretaries and the treasurer were elected unopposed. "I would love to see Bangladesh in the fifth place in Asia when I quit from my post after the four-year stint," Jamil Uddin told reporters in his first office. Bangladesh are in the seventh position in Asia after India, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan, China and Malaysia. "It is a big challenge for me as well as the whole committee and I will be pleased if I could improve hockey even a little during my tenure," Jamil said, "I will take advice from the experienced organisers in the committee." Jamil said that his first priority was to concentrate on school hockey and appoint a physio and a trainer for the national team before the Asia Cup. "I have already contacted the Australian Hockey Federation unofficially through a relative for a physio and a trainer and they have showed positive signs," said Jamil, well-known as a cricket organiser. When asked whether he would contest in the cricket board's election, he said, "I can't say anything now." Defending himself, Jamil said, "Whether I am technical, is not the issue. You see, the chief the ICC (International Cricket Council) and the BCCI (Board of Control of Cricket in India) committees are also non- technical persons and I think my main job is to run the federation smoothly." The businessman-turned-organiser said that he would try to ensure the financial assurance for the senior players through giving them jobs in different corporate houses. He also said that he wanted to see such a pool where both the club and the player benefited and no pool player remained without a club after transfer. When asked whether he would pull out of the pool system, Jamil's reply was that they would consider the matter. Among the elected members, Abahani Limited have no representative on the BHF committee as the director and vice president of the club's hockey committee, Shahriar Alam, and his followers boycotted the election withdrawing nominations on August 20 and did not turn up at the polling centre.
