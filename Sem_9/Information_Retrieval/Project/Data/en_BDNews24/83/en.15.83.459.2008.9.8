 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has said despite spending billions since independence the government's literacy drive was far from achieving the goals it had set out to. "The literacy movement got formal shape at the end of the last century. In independent Bangladesh many programmes have been taken to achieve literacy and huge money has been spent for the purpose. But after all this our achievement in the area remained limited. We should have achieved much more." Fakhruddin made the remarks at a function organised by the primary and mass education ministry at the Osmany auditorium in the city on the occasion of International Literacy Day on Monday. "The light of education and knowledge need to be spread to every sphere to build up honest, just and patriotic citizens and leadership for future. All have to come forward with whatever they have. We must ensure that nobody is denied access to quality education." The interim administration head also said, "Alongside moral education emphasis should be given on job-oriented education. The vast population has to be turned into manpower by making them educated and literate." Fakhruddin said, "To free the nation of disparity, corruption and injustice it is imperative to enlighten all citizens with education." "An ever-vigilant population is necessary for establishing democracy, good governance and justice in society." Primary and mass education adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury presided over the programme. Secretary to the ministry Mohammad Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan gave the address of welcome. The secretary said the rate of literacy in the country was 63 percent. Awards were given out in different categories including in the best teacher and best educational institution. bdne
