<TITLE> India's Infosys confident to win Axon bid: CEO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Infosys Technologies, India's second-largest software services exporter, said it is confident it will succeed in its 407 million pound ($713 million) bid for Britain's Axon Group and that there was no rival offer. "We are confident that our bid will go through, because we believe it is a fair valuation, and we have got the support from the board and management of Axon," Chief Executive Officer S Gopalakrishnan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. "As for any rival bids, nothing officially has been communicated to us at this point. We expect the (acquisition) process to be completed by the end of November," added Gopalakrishnan, who was in Singapore for the Forbes Global CEO conference. If completed, the deal would be the largest overseas acquisition by an Indian information technology services firm. Indian outsourcing firms such as Infosys and its bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services are expanding in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America to cut dependence on the United States market, which accounts for more than half the sector's revenue. On Tuesday, India's Economic Times newspaper reported Indian information technology services firm HCL Technologies plans to bid for consultancy Axon, offering 15 percent more in an attempt to thwart the bid from Infosys. Last month, Nasdaq-listed Infosys agreed to buy Axon, valuing the firm at 600 pence a share. Axon's shares have since jumped above the offer price on market expectations of a counterbid. The shares closed at 628 pence on Tuesday. "The markets are difficult at this time. A full cash offer is a pretty good offer," Gopalakrishnan added. He declined to comment on whether Infosys was willing to revise its offer in the event of a counter bid, saying the situation was "hypothetical". By 1 am EDT on Wednesday, shares of Infosys were little changed in a Mumbai market down 0.8 percent. India's export-driven software services sector, helped by a large pool of English-speaking graduates and comparatively cheaper wages, is struggling to keep up its scorching pace of growth as its mostly-US based clients delay projects in a tough environment for the global financial sector and economy. Gopalakrishnan said customers were delaying making a decision when it came to new projects, echoing similar comments made by the chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services on Tuesday. "Companies are concerned about the uncertainty in the broader macro-economic environment," Gopalakrishnan said. Infosys, which develops applications, designs supply chains and offers back-office services, counts ABN AMRO, Goldman Sachs and Philips Electronics among its more than 560 clients
