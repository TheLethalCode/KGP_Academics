 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com) Awami League ended its two-hour meeting with the Election Commission at 4pm on Tuesday, the last day of the third-round electoral dialogue. The seven-member AL delegation was led by the party's acting president Zillur Rahman, and included Syed Ashraful Islam, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury and Amir Hossain Amu. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman, emerging from the EC Secretariat, told reporters: "The dialogue was successful. We have demanded the release of Sheikh Hasina and lifting the state of emergency before elections." "Upazila polls cannot be held before parliamentary elections, nor can any city corporation polls," Zillur said. Ashraful Islam said: "We have agreed on different issues. But we can not say right now what they are." "We have clarified our stance to the commission. Let's see how the commission responds to them. We will deliver our statement after the commission delivers its own," he said. Asked whether the dialogue would be a meaningful one without the BNP-led four-party alliance, Ashraf said: "We hope the alliance will join the dialogue." AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said: "We want an election with the participation of all parties. We have told the commission the same." On the party's view about war criminals, he said: "War criminals will not be allowed to join the elections. The commission holds the same view." On registration of political parties, Tofail said: "According to the electoral roadmap the deadline to be registered was June 30. That deadline is past." "We don't have any objection to registering. But we want some relaxations. We hope the commission will take a realistic decision within a short period," he said. AL earlier said that it would press a number of demands to the EC including holding no other elections before national elections, announcing the national elections schedule and withdrawing the state of emergency. Other AL demands include relaxing a number of conditions for registration of political partiesincluding banning foreign party branches and front organisationsas well as scrapping the provision for 'no' votes and allowing teachers of MPO educational institutions to contest elections. Asked whether the EC had agreed with the party's demands, Ashraful said: "We will inform you later."
