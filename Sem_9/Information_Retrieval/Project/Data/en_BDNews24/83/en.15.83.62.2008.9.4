 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government has extended the temporary release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from detention by another month to Oct 6. The home ministry issued an order to that effect on Thursday. The Awami League chief was released from detention on medical grounds on June 11. She flew to the USA the following day for medical treatment. Her stay outside prison was extended to Sept 6 after her husband M Wazed Miah requested chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed to withdraw the cases against his wife and extend her release on Aug 5. Earlier on Thursday, Hasina's special assistant Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com that she had instructed her personal staff not to appeal again for extension of her temporary release that ends on September 6. "We think there is no need for fresh prayers for extension when the government is well aware of her health condition," Hasina's counsel barrister Fazle Noor Tapash told bdnews24.com. "The government can very well issue an executive order enabling Hasina to stay abroad as long as required to complete her medical treatment," he said. bdnew
