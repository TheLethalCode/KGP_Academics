 HELSINKI, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany will be looking for more of the same from Lukas Podolski in their World Cup qualifier against Finland on Wednesday, four days after he led a Group Four rout of Liechtenstein. Podolski found the net either side of halftime in Saturday's 6-0 victory in Vaduz and the Euro 2008 runners-up are promising the same positive approach in Helsinki's Olympic Stadium. "We know Finland are a completely different proposition," coach Joachim Loew told reporters after the team's victory in their opening qualifier. "We will of course analyse the match and think things over  (but) we're going to play attacking football in Finland as well." Germany will be missing injured captain Michael Ballack once again, while leading striker Miroslav Klose is clearly struggling for form. The real positive from Saturday's win in Liechtenstein was seeing how well Podolski, Klose's team mate at Bayern Munich, was able to link up with Piotr Trochowski on the left side of the German attack. Podolski, who has once again been confined to a bit-part role at Bayern this season, took his international scoring record for Germany to 30 goals in 56 matches. BIG HOPES, FULL STADIUM The Finns are clearly looking forward to the contest, despite the strength of the opposition. Striker Daniel Sjolund said: "A full stadium and Germany as opponent, what else could one ask for? I hope we get a great result to boot." Finland will be without two influential midfielders as Jari Litmanen is injured and Alexei Eremenko Jr. was not selected after a drink-driving conviction. "We have a strong team," Finland coach Stuart Baxter said. "We believe in our skills and in our dreams." Finland beat Israel in a friendly last month which Baxter said had showcased Finnish technical skills and team spirit. The two sides also met in World Cup qualifying in 2001, with the Finns drawing 2-2 at home and 0-0 in Germany. Striker Mikael Forssell, who scored both their goals in Helsinki, said: "Let's hope I play as well and we win this time." Finland have never qualified for the finals of the World Cup or European Championship, but came close to making it to Euro 2008 under previous coach Roy Hodgson. Probable teams: Finland: Jussi Jaaskelainen; Petri Pasanen, Sami Hyypia, Toni Kallio, Ari Nyman; Joonas Kolkka, Markus Heikkinen, Roman Eremenko, Mika Vayrynen; Mikael Forssell, Jonatan Johansson Germany: Robert Enke; Clemens Fritz, Serdar Tasci, Heiko Westermann, Philipp Lahm; Bastian Schweinsteiger, Simon Rolfes, Thomas Hitzlsperger, Piotr Trochowski; Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski
