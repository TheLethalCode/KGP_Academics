 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party Of Bangladesh on Sunday asked the Election Commission not to register Jamaat-e-Islami for the parliamentary polls. "Jamaat-e-Islami is not eligible for registration as per our Constitution and EC's registration rules (90-Ga)," general secretary Mojahidul Islam Selim told reporters waiting outside the EC secretariat. He spoke to the media after emerging from the ongoing third round of the Election Commission's dialogues with political parties on registration under new electoral laws. "Therefore, the party must not be registered with the Election Commission. None of those parties who had opposed the cause of the Liberation War can be registered, we said," he added. At the dialogue, the CPB also demanded the lifting of the emergency, announcement of parliamentary polls dates and disqualification of war criminals from contesting elections, Selim said. He said, "Conditions for registration need to be relaxed to accommodate the newly emerged political parties." Replying to a query, the CPB leader said the Upazila polls may be delayed due to the floods, but the national elections must not be pushed back. Selim also remarked that the EC and the government seemed not too keen any more on holding a black money-free polls. At the dialogue held at the EC secretariat from 10:00am onwards, the six-member CPB delegation comprised Selim, Shah Alam, Dibalok Shingha, Mahbub Alam, Sajjad Zahir Chandan and Ainun Nahar Lipi. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hossain and EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir were also present. Bikalpodhara The EC's next meeting with Bikalpodhara Bangladesh started at 12:15pm. Bikalpodhara's eight-member team led by Abdul Mannan included Mahi B Chowdhury, Abdur Rouf, Shah Ahmed Badal, Shariful Islam, Shahidur Rahman, Abdul Aziz Akhand and Mainuddin Chowdhury. Mannan later told reporters: "We apprised the government of our support to holding the Upazila polls before the parliamentary election." "We also assured the government of our cooperation even if they decide to hold the parliamentary polls under the emergency." "The national polls should not be marred in any case in the name of the Upazila elections." JSD The third meeting of the day at the EC headquarters was between the EC and the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD-Inu). JSD's Hasanul Huq Inu was accompanied by Syed Jafar Sajjad, Mainuddin Khan Badal, Sharif Nurul Ambia and Robiul Alam. The EC has invited 16 political parties to the current round of dialogue. The government as well as the EC already made it public that the parliamentary polls will be held in December. The EC also plans to hold the polls to 350 Upazila in end-October. Most political parties including the Awami League and the BNP have so far been opposing the idea of holding Upazila elections before the national polls though. The BNP was also due to take part in the dialogue on Sunday, but it made it known to the top elections office that it would not. The EC on Saturday held talks with the Workers Party of Bangladesh, Samyabadi Dal and Jatiya Party (Ershad) and is to sit with Liberal Democratic Party, Islami Oikyo Jote, Jatiya Party (JP) and Jamaat-e-Islami on Monday. On Tuesday, it is scheduled to sit with The Awami League, Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Janata League, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Rab) and National Awami Party (Mozaffar).
