 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com) - Former BNP lawmaker Bilkis Islam, assaulted by party workers at BSMMU hospital Wednesday, has filed a case with Shahbag police accusing five persons. Present at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University at the time of Tarique Rahman's release, she was assaulted by a section of party workers who branded her "pro-reformist". She later left the area under police guard. Bilkis told bdnews24.com in Thursday: "I have never been a pro-reform person. A quarter inside the party was behind the incident to harass me politically out of envy. That quarter always tries to downsize its opponents." The former MP said that she was involved in BNP politics for 20 years. She was loyal to the leadership of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman. In the last parliamentary election, Khaleda Zia got her elected an MP from the reserved seats, she said adding she had never been with the pro-reform faction of the party. Shahbag police sub-inspector Delwar Hossain told bdnews24.com: ""The former lawmaker has filed a case in connection with her assault. Five persons have been accused in the case." bdnews2
