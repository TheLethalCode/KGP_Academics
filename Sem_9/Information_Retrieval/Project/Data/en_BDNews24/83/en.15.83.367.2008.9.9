 Chittagong, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Chittagong court on Tuesday sentenced a former member of the outlawed Jamatul Mujahedin Bangladesh to ten years in jail for the bombings in Chittagong on Aug 17, 2005. Chittagong divisional speedy trial tribunal judge Shafiqul Karim handed down the verdict in the case filed with Khulshi Police Station. The convict, Jabed Iqbal, was Chittagong regional commander of the banned Islamist party. JMB kingpins Shaikh Abdur Rahman, Siddiqur Rahman (alias Bangla Bhai) and Ataur Rahman Sunny who were also accused in the case were executed last year for a separate terror attack. State counsel Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com that the JMB commander Jabed and the others had planned and executed the bombings. Ataur Rahman Sunny sent the explosives to Jabed, who made the bombs with his accomplices and carried out the attack at the port city's GEC intersection and other venues, said the lawyer. The court acquitted two other accused in the case, Delwar Hossain Jahid and Abu Zor. Of the accused Jahid is currently fugitive. The Islamist militant group carried out countrywide bombings on Aug 17, 2005, including eight blasts in Chittagong. There was no casualty in the attacks. A case was filed with Khulshi Police Station, with the investigation officer later pressing charges against six people. Jabed and two other former JMB activists were earlier sentenced, in August, to ten years in jail in another case filed with Halishahar Police Station. bdn
