<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Brothers Union clinched the title of the inaugural Futsal tournament with a thrilling 4-3 win over Abahani Limited Monday at the wooden-floor gymnasium close to Bangabandhu National Stadium. Abdullah Parvez struck twice while Ariful Islam and Motiur Munna netted one goal each for the Gopibagh-based outfit. Jahid Hasan Emily, Mamunul Islam and Abul Hossain scored one apiece for Abahani. The match was a throwback to the clash between the two clubs in 1985 when Abahani came from two goals down to beat Brothers 3-2 on their way to their First Division title. But this time Brothers, who took a 3-0 lead, held on to their nerves after Abahani pulled 3-3 at one stage. Playmaker Motiur Munna was the saviour for Brothers when he lashed a chest-high ball home with Abahani keeper Tareq lying on the wooden pitch, sending the fans, officials and players into raucous celebrations. Abahani could have won the match had striker Emily not squandered a spot kick just before Munna's strike. Brothers, initially comprising keeper Shakil, Jahid Hossain, Munna, Amit Khan Shuvro and Abdullah Parvez, started off with great pace and press hard into Abahani's territory. Parvez came close to opening the account in the very second minute but failed to connect a Jahid pass. Parvez, man of the tournament, found the back of Abahani net in the eighth minute with a left-footer although Abahani keeper Tareq got a hand onto the ball. In the next minute, Brothers almost scored another, but Abahani defender Siraji made a goal-line save when a Munna lob was heading to the open net. Parvez, a former Abahani player, shrugged off his marker Wali Faisal to drag home from the left to give Brothers a 2-0 cushion in the 10th minute. Defender Arif made it 3-0 from a goal-mouth scramble six minutes later. Abahani hardly had any impact before Emily pulled one back from a free-kick in the 17th minute and Mamun drove a left-footer to reduce the margin two minutes from break. After the breather, a determined Abahani showed signs of bouncing back with Abul Hossain and Jahed Parvez Chowdhury substituting Siraji and Tipu.. They were level soon when Abul from the left hammered a powerful shot to rattle the far-post and Brothers' Munna, trying to clear it, volleyed the ball into his own net in the 31st minute. However, it was Munna, who finally rescued All Orange outfit two minutes from time to help Brothers Union lay their hands onto the first-ever Futsal trophy. Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin distributed medals and trophies among the winners. BFF vice presidents Badal Roy and Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, members Khurshid Babul and Anwarul Haq Helal were among others present. b
