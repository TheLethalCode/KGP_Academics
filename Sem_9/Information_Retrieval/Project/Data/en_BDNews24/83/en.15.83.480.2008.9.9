 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina could slip behind Paraguay and Brazil in this week's South American World Cup qualifiers after a tricky visit to Peru. Paraguay and Brazil have straightforward ties at home to Venezuela and Bolivia respectively while Argentina, without a win in their last four qualifiers, have been hit by suspensions, injuries and a possible crisis of confidence. Alfio Basile's Argentina team also face opponents who have been revitalised after claiming their first win of the competition on Saturday, when they beat Venezuela 1-0. Argentina will be without suspended forward Carlos Tevez and midfielder Javier Mascherano in Lima on Wednesday, while goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri is injured. Paraguay, who drew 1-1 in Argentina on Saturday, lead the 10-team South American group with 14 points from seven games while Brazil and Argentina have 12 apiece. Peru, who last qualified for the World Cup in 1982, are hoping Saturday's win can give them a platform for another three points. "We have to build on what we did on Saturday and improve in some areas because our opponents need to win and that is dangerous," said captain Nolberto Solano, who is doubtful because of a bruised thigh. "We can't drop any more points at home." Paraguay, who have a 100 percent home record, expect forward Roque Santa Cruz to be fit to face Venezuela in Asuncion on Tuesday, although defender Julio Cesar Caceres and midfielder Enrique Vera are both suspended. Brazil host bottom-of-the-table Bolivia in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday, where the notoriously fickle crowd may provide a useful gauge to the popularity of coach Dunga who was in danger of being sacked before Sunday's 3-0 win in Chile. Despite the result in Sunday, many Brazilians still resent Dunga's ultra-cautious tactics. In other games on Wednesday, Chile and Colombia will attempt to overcome disappointing weekend defeats when they meet in Santiago while Uruguay and Ecuador, both winners on Saturday, clash in Montevideo. Uruguay, 1-0 winners in Colombia, have moved upto fourth with 11 points, one ahead of Chile and Colombia. Trailing but still not out of the running are Ecuador (8), Venezuela (7) and Peru (6)
