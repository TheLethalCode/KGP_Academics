 LONDON, September 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former captain Michael Vaughan, who stood down during this year's series defeat by South Africa, is among 12 players given central contracts, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Tuesday. The ECB also named a 15-man squad for the lucrative Stanford Super Series and November's one-day series in India, also under Pietersen. Ryan Sidebottom, who missed the recent 4-0 one-day series win over South Africa, is included in place of Tim Bresnan in an otherwise unchanged squad. Vaughan, desperately short of runs for England and his county Yorkshire this season, retains his place in the group led by new captain Kevin Pietersen. "The award of a central contract reflects the selectors' view that Michael still has a role to play in the England test squad over the next 12 months," national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement. "As we build toward the Ashes in 2009, we feel that Michael's experience of previous Ashes campaigns and his excellent personal record against Australia will be an important asset to the squad." Vaughan led England to victory in the memorable 2005 home series against Australia. The only change in the 12 is Stuart Broad coming in for Matthew Hoggard. Seven other players have been awarded "increment contracts", where the ECB supplements their county salaries; Tim Ambrose, Ravi Bopara, Samit Patel, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Graeme Swann and Luke Wright. Central contracts: Anderson, Bell, Broad, Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Flintoff, Harmison, Monty Panesar, Pietersen, Sidebottom, Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan. ODI Squad: Kevin Pietersen (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Stephen Harmison, Samit Patel, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Graeme Swann, Ryan Sidebottom, Luke Wrigh
