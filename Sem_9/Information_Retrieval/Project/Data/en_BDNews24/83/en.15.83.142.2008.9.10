 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Khaleda Zia will be released from special jail as soon as her bail papers reach the authorities, said home adviser MA Matin on Wednesday. He pointed out that the government had not challenged the bails Khaleda had secured in the GATCO and Niko cases. The Anticorruption Commission filed an appeal with the Appellate Division on Wednesday challenging the High Court's bail orders. Asked to comment on this, Matin said: "The ACC filed an appeal against the Khaleda Zia's bail orders. The matter is being looked into." "But the government has not filed any appeal against the High Court bails granted to Khaleda Zia. She will be freed as soon the relevant bail bonds reach the jail authorities," the home adviser told reporters at the Secretariat. Khaleda secured three-month bail in the GATCO and Niko corruption cases on Tuesday, clearing what her lawyers said was the last legal barriers to the BNP chief's release from special jail. bdnews24.
