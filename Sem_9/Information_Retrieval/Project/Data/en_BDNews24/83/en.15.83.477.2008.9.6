 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)Improved coordination among ministries, as well as input from trade bodies, consumer groups and academics, are critical to Bangladesh's trade negotiations in the global arena, said speakers at a seminar Saturday. The seminar on 'Negotiating Trade Agreements in a Pro-Poor Manner' was organised by private research body D.Net at the city's Brac Centre Inn Saturday. Economist and executive director of Centre for Policy Dialogue, Mustafizur Rahman said the poor in least developed countries (LDCs) were being marginalised in the process towards a globalised economy. Mustafizur, who chaired the seminar, stressed the importance of trade agreements for LDCs that avoid adverse impacts on the poor. Former diplomat Md Zamir identified the dearth of serious research, as well as inadequate preparation by Bangladeshi delegations prior to negotiations, as the main hurdles to the success of international trade talks. He also emphasised the need for transparency and a focused approach in the government's trade policies rather than shifting goals. Dr Shah Md Ahsan Habib of D.Net, in his keynote presentation, pointed out that the problems faced by LDCs are not about negotiating the right set of rules. "Rather it is mainly on the supply side where development is needed," said Habib who teaches at the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM). Former commerce secretary Sohel Ahmed Chowdhury also focused on developing trade capacity before looking into pro-poor issues. "Bangladeshi negotiators have not reached a point where pro-poor elements can be emphasised." Businessman and FBCCI president Annisul Huq highlighted the need for more resource persons or whom he termed "experts in trade affairs". "The private sector has zero resources at present and we ourselves are not that knowledgeable." Sharing his experiences as a member of trade delegations, the FBBCI president said he had felt that the negotiators were not prepared or well-equipped. "Even the foreign missions lack adequate resource personnel," he added. Huq recommended increasing such a 'resource base' and suggested more input from the private sector on what was needed. Businessman Manzur Ahmed, and an adviser to FBCCI, suggested that national trade policy should focus on safeguarding and promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The seminar, on protecting interests of the poor in trade agreements, was attended by former bureaucrats, economists and members of civil society. bd
