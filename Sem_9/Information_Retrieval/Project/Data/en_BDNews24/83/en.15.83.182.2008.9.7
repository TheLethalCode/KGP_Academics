 Srinagar, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One person was killed and three wounded on Saturday when police fired on hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators protesting against New Delhi's rule in Indian Kashmir, police and witnesses said. Police used tear gas as protesters tried to enforce a strike in Kashmir, the divided Himalayan territory hit by fresh anti-India protests. Last month at least 35 protesters in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley were killed by government forces and 1,000 injured in some of the largest pro-independence rallies since a revolt against New Delhi's rule began in 1989. Witness Imtiyaz Ahmad said Javid Iqbal was hit by a bullet in the chest. Thousands of protesters carrying Iqbal's body in Srinagar shouted: "Indian forces go back, we want freedom." The fresh protests, which began last month, were sparked by a decision to grant land to build shelters for Hindu pilgrims travelling to Kashmir for an annual pilgrimage. Muslims were enraged, forcing the government to backtrack. Hindus then protested, blocking the highway to the Kashmir Valley. They relented after the state government offered to allow temporary shelters to be built during the annual pilgrimage. Muslim separatists have rejected the deal. On Saturday, police across the region erected additional barricades to keep protesters at bay as thousands of soldiers and policemen patrolled deserted streets. The pro-independence strike closed shops, school, colleges and government offices, officials said. Police put separatist leaders under house arrest on Friday to stop them from leading fresh protests. "By trying to crush us, Indian troops are making our freedom struggle and Kashmiris stronger," hardline leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said. "I appeal to people to continue peaceful protests against Indian occupation."
