<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  The flood situation in the country will start improving from Tuesday as Brahmaputra waters have started receding at Nunkhoa point in Bangladesh, a senior FFWC official said on Sunday. Saiful Islam, executive engineer of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, at a press conference also said Jamuna waters were stable on Sunday. "Jamuna waters will start ebbing from Monday. So will the waters of the river Padma," Saiful said. The FFWC engineer said water levels would not rise at any other points in next four or five days. SH Mojaddad Faruque, director general of the Water Development Board, said, "Full moon is still up to eight days away. If water does not rise during the next full moon, it will not rise this year." Saiful said there was no reason to be panicked given the raging floods in the Indian state of Bihar. Floodwaters of Bihar flowed away through the Padma causing it to swell. Flood situation in Bihar improved, he said. The WDB chief said up to 25 percent lowlands of the country is flooded every year. "It's normal. It is necessary for agriculture." On the breach of embankments, Faruque said all embankments were under watch. But "there was no system to observe the earthen embankment round the clock", he added. He said the embankments damaged last year could not be repaired due to lack of funds. The WDB did not get enough money to tackle flood, he said. bdnew
