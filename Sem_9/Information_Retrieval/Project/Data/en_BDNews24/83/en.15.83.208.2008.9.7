 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com) - The medical board formed to treat recently freed Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Qader has advised him to go abroad for treatment. The head of the medical board Dr Anisul Huq told bdnews24.com Sunday: "Both of [Obaidul Qader's] arms are wasting away due to a neurological disorder." "He needs to go abroad for better investigation and treatment into the complaint." Qader's lawyer AKM Amin Uddin Manik said the four-member medical board, led by Dr Anisul Huq of BSMMU Hospital's neuromedicine department, has advised him to go to a country where he can have a metal-friendly MRI scan for the neurological complaint. The board has advised him to go to Apollo Hospital in New Delhi, India, as he still has fragments of shrapnel in his body following the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an AL rally. It has also advised three weeks' bed rest. Qader was arrested on March 9 last year on charges of corruption. He was admitted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital after being released on bail Friday. bdnews24.
