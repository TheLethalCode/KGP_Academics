<TITLE> Hurricane Ike over Gulf of Mexico, targets Texas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Havana, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Ike swirled over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, targeting Texas near the US offshore oil patch after toppling decrepit buildings in Cuba's capital and ripping the communist-run island from end to end. Ike, a Category 1 storm but strengthening late on Tuesday with 130 kph winds, left a long trail of destruction across the Caribbean and had energy companies fearful it could do the same to their Gulf oil rigs as they scurried to evacuate workers and shut down production. Forecasters said Ike would likely regain power in the Gulf's warm waters and become a major storm again, revving up to a Category 3 on the five-step hurricane intensity scale with a minimum of 178 kph winds. But latest projections pointed Ike toward the middle of the Texas coast, skirting to the west of the main region for offshore production in the Gulf, which provides a quarter of U.S. oil and 15 percent of its natural gas. Oil futures dipped more than $2 to below $105 on the forecast, although the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami warned that its projections were subject to change. New Orleans, still scarred by Katrina, which killed 1,500 people and caused $80 billion in damage on the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005, appeared to be out of danger. At 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT), the hurricane center said in its latest advisory the storm was 195 km west of Havana and regaining strength as it churned west-northwest at 15 kph. Ike wreaked widespread damage on the east and west sides of Cuba. Few official figures have emerged yet, but state-run media showed a panorama of destruction across the island, still reeling from the more powerful Hurricane Gustav 10 days ago. Ike struck eastern Cuba on Sunday with 195 kph winds and torrential rains that destroyed buildings, wiped out the electricity grid, toppled trees, leveled crops including sugar cane fields, and turned rivers into roaring torrents. COSTLY CUBAN CLEANUP After dumping up to 40 cm of rain on the island the downpour continued on Tuesday even as Ike moved away, causing widespread flooding and growing alarm among officials. Ike's damage could total between $3 billion and $4 billion, according to some official sources, said Elisabeth Byrs of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at a news briefing in Geneva. Cuba said Ike did no serious damage to its key nickel mines and processing plants and it expected to restart production of its top export in a few days. Havana, which barely escaped the full wrath of Gustav, was pounded by Ike's winds and rain on Monday and Tuesday, which toppled at least 16 of the many beautiful but crumbling old buildings in the capital. "It sounds like Havana has been invaded by an army of ghosts," Havana resident Maria Valdez said, referring to the howling winds that blew through streets littered with fallen trees, foliage and debris. A total of 2.6 million people were evacuated ahead of Ike, or about 22 percent of the country's 11.4 million population, but officials said four people died in the eastern provinces. No deaths were reported from Gustav, but state-run Prensa Latina said on Tuesday it damaged 140,000 buildings -- 90,000 of them homes -- when it blasted across the Isle of Youth and westernmost province of Pinar del Rio. After crossing the eastern provinces, Ike dipped into the Caribbean and headed northwest where it made its second Cuba landfall on Tuesday at Punta la Capitana in westernmost Pinar del Rio province. The storm ripped across the same region struck by Gustav before leaving the island near the town of Manuel Sanguily on Pinar del Rio's north central coast. Before Cuba, Ike hit Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands and the southern Bahamas as a ferocious Category 4 hurricane. Floods triggered by its torrential rains were blamed for at least 71 deaths in Haiti, where Tropical Storm Hanna killed 500 last week. The United Nations said it would launch an emergency appeal for money with about 800,000 people in Haiti in need of urgent help, nearly half of them children. The impoverished country has been hit by four storms in a month.
