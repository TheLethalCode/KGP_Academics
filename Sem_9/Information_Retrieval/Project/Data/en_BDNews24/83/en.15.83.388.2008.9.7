 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited and Brothers Union will play the final of the inaugural Citycell Futsal Tournament at the Wooden Floor Gymnasium on Monday. Brothers came from behind to hand a 3-2 defeat to Rahmatganj MFS to set up the final clash with Abahani, who made the final after Mohammedan forfeited the first semifinal on Sunday. Zakir put Rahmatganj ahead in the 16th minute before Abdullah Parvez levelled for Brothers after three minutes. Two minutes later, Rahmatganj again took the lead thanks to a Jahangir strike only for Parvez to restore parity in the 24th minute. Tapu scored in the 33rd minute to seal the match for Brothers. Following a brawl with Brothers Union in the group-phase match, Mohammedan Saturday night informed the tournament committee that they would not play their scheduled semifinal tie on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Futsal committee suspended two Brothers Union officials for the incident.
