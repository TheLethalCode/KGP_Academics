 LONDON, September 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French pride took a fresh hammering on Saturday when the national team were humbled 3-1 in Austria as Europe's big guns began their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaigns. It proved to be the only major upset on a day when holders Italy snatched a 2-1 stoppage-time win in Cyprus, European champions Spain edged Bosnia 1-0, Germany crushed Liechtenstein 6-0 and England were booed before beating Andorra 2-0. France coach Raymond Domenech needed a positive start after the debacle of his team's failure to survive the group stage at the European Championship in June. Domenech, who is bound to come under renewed fire from the French media, had promised that France would come out fighting in Vienna after limping out of Euro 2008. However, goals from Marc Janko, Rene Aufhauser and Andreas Ivanschitz left them reeling in Group Seven as Austria marked the first competitive game of new coach Karel Brueckner with a stunning win. "It's never nice to lose," Domenech told reporters. "I have my feelings about what happened but I need to watch the game on video to confirm my impressions." World champions Italy made a stuttering start as Marcello Lippi began a second term in charge of the Azzurri, having steered them to 2006 World Cup glory over France. Two goals from Antonio Di Natale, the second a stoppage-time winner, earned a 2-1 victory over Cyprus in their Group Eight opener in Larnaca. Former Real Madrid coach Vicente Del Bosque began his reign as coach of Spain with a home victory in Group Five against Bosnia, courtesy of David Villa's second half strike. Del Bosque took over from Luis Aragones after Spain's Euro 2008 final victory over Germany. The Germans were far more convincing on Saturday in their Group Four demolition of Liechtenstein, helped by two goals from Lukas Podolski either side of halftime. England, with Italian coach Fabio Capello kicking off his first international qualifying campaign, ambled to victory against tiny Andorra in Barcelona in Group Six, although the travelling England fans booed the team at halftime. A more accurate reading of the task facing Capello as he tries to restore England's flagging fortunes comes on Wednesday when they play Croatia in Zagreb. Croatia, who beat England twice in qualifying for Euro 2008, trounced Kazakhstan 3-0. "It is hard for any team to find space when they are playing against a team with nine 10 or 11 players in the box, it is impossible to find the space," Capello said after his blushes were spared by two goals from substitute Joe Cole. ITALIAN SUCCESS Fellow Italian Giovanni Trapattoni, also taking charge of his first competitive fixture as Ireland coach, enjoyed a 2-1 victory over Georgia in a match played in Germany because of Georgia's recent conflict with Russia. Elsewhere, Euro 2008 semi-finalists Turkey beat Armenia 2-0 in Group Five and Group One favourites Portugal were 4-0 winners in Malta in Carlos Queiroz's first competitive game in charge since taking over from Luiz Felipe Scolari. There were disappointing starts for Romania, Poland and Sweden, all of whom played at Euro 2008. Romania were humbled 3-0 at home by Lithuania in Group Seven, Sweden were held 0-0 by Albania in Tirana in Group One and Poland drew 1-1 at home to Slovenia in Group Three. Andriy Shevchenko scored a last-minute penalty to give Ukraine, who qualified for the finals for the first time in Germany two years ago, a 1-0 victory over Belarus in Group Six. Europe's 53 teams are chasing 13 of the 32 final berths in South Africa with the nine group winners qualifying directly along with four runners-up who come through a playoff roun
