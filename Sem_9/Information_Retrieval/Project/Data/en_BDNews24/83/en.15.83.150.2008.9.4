Noman appeared before the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge and appealed for bail. Judge Md Azizul Haque granted him anticipatory bail on a Tk 50,000 bond. In the hearing former additional attorney general Abdur Rezak Khan said Noman had been sick and been under treatment abroad for long.
