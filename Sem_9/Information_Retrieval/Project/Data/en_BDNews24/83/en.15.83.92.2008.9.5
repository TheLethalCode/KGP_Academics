 MUMBAI, Fri Sep 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An anonymous call threatening to bomb Mumbai city sets off a hair-raising search for the attackers in a new Bollywood thriller opening on Friday, the latest in a slew of Indian films based on terrorism. Most of these films are set in Mumbai, that has witnessed some of India's worst terror attacks, including the 2006 train bombings that killed 187 people. Director Neeraj Pandey said "A Wednesday" chronicles events unfolding over four hours on a Wednesday afternoon, most of the action happening at the police headquarters in Mumbai. "We did extensive research on the way the police force functions and our crew even underwent training from the Mumbai police," Pandey told Reuters in an interview. Though there are several references in the film to the train bombings, "A Wednesday" does not include footage of the blasts. "A Wednesday" has been made on a budget of 35 million rupees ($780,000). Last month, another Bollywood film "Mumbai Meri Jaan" (Mumbai, My Love) explored the broader human tragedy of the commuter train bombings and its effect on the city's residents. Some more films based on terrorism have been received well by the Indian audiences over the past two years
