 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com) Educationists and board chairmen have put increasingly higher pass rates down to changing attitudes of teachers, greater awareness among guardians and anti-cheating measures. Three out of four students have passed out this year's HSC exams. Just over 76 percent of examinees on Wednesday passed Higher Secondary Certificate and other equivalent examinations this year, the pass rate being more than 10 percentage points higher on last year's figures. The total number of GPA-5 scorers this year is 19,108 under the seven HSC boards, twice the number of last year. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "The efforts of the teachers and guardians, monitoring system of the boards and overall development of education system are the reasons of higher pass rates." Besides the government's decision to halt the salaries and allowances of the teachers and staffs of the colleges where less than five students pass out exams, is one of the reasons behind that. Asked about the reason this year's better results Dhaka City College principal Md Hafizuddin told bdnews24.com: "We are witnessing good results in SSC and HSC exams over the past few years." "Students are doing better in English papers, which was seen as the hardest course before and teachers have broadened their attitudes in marking exam copies now." "The guardians are also now more aware," he said. "The addition of numbers of the fourth subject is another of the prime reasons," the principal said. Dhaka College principal Boshirul Haque told bdnews24.com: "As there is no scope of copying, students have now realised that there is no alternative to study. This is the main reason of success." "Besides guardians are more conscious now, particularly mothers. They are monitoring regularly whether their children are studying." Former Dhaka board chairman Shaheda Obayed told bdnews24.com: "If evaluation is done properly the result is definitely good news." "If students succeed in higher studies we will understand that this is really a good result," she said. bdnew
