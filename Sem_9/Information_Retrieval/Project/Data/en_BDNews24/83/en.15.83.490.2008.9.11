 Harare,Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday he was hopeful that a power-sharing deal could be signed with the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change on Thursday MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also sounded an optimistic note, saying he had been told by South African President Thabo Mbeki that "very little work" was needed for the deal to come through. A power-sharing deal would end two months of wrangling and help ease the crisis since Mugabe's re-election unopposed in a June presidential poll re-run condemned around the world. Tsvangirai, who won the initial election in March but failed to garner adequate ballots for an outright victory, boycotted the second vote over attacks on his supporters. Asked by Reuters if he was hopeful of a deal after Wednesday's talks, Mugabe said: "Yes, I hope so, I hope so." "So far the progress is encouraging, so far so good, we are hopeful of signing tomorrow," Mugabe said as he left the hotel where negotiations have been taking place. Separately, Tsvangirai told journalists Mbeki had advised him very little work remained on the deal. "I've been advised by the convener (Mbeki) that very little work is left ... the position is that we have been advised by the facilitator that we re-convene at 4 (p.m. local time on Thursday)," Tsvangirai said. Officials said the talks would resume at 1400 GMT on Thursday. Zimbabweans hope a deal can pave the way for the re-habilitate an economy in meltdown, as shown by inflation of over 11 million percent and severe food and fuel shortages that have driven millions across the country's borders, straining regional economies. ECONOMIC MELTDOWN In another sign of the economic decline that has been worsened by the political deadlock, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said on Thursday it would license 1,000 retailers and 200 wholesalers to sell goods in foreign currency. Fuel can also be sold in foreign currency. "We are doing this for an initial period of 18 months, as an experiment," Central bank Governor Gideon Gono told reporters. The most used foreign currencies in Zimbabwe are the South African rand and the US dollar. The central bank has repeatedly re-denominated the Zimbabwe dollar to try keep up with inflation. In its latest move it lopped off 10 zeros on August 1 to help bring relief to consumers forced to carry large bags of money to buy everyday goods. The Zimbabwe dollar's the official rate to the US dollar stands at 60, but has plunged to 2,000 to the greenback on a thriving black market. Mugabe and Tsvangirai said on Tuesday they had made progress and a jovial-sounding Mugabe said to reporters "We are optimistic, we are never pessimistic" as he arrived for Wednesday's talks between his ZANU-PF, Tsvangirai's MDC and a breakaway MDC faction. Swaziland's foreign minister told Reuters that Mbeki -- mandated by regional grouping SADC to mediate an end to the crisis -- had told Swaziland's King Mswati III that he expects to end his mediation efforts by the end of the week. A meeting of SADC's defense and security committee was postponed from Wednesday to give Mbeki time to deliver a final report on his mediation, Swaziland's Foreign Minister Mathendele Dlamini said. Zimbabwe's state-run Herald newspaper said Mbeki had presented a proposal sharing executive powers, the main sticking point in the negotiations. It also looked at structuring an all-inclusive government
