 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Demand for subsidised rice on open-market sale fell as rice prices dropped sharply in the market with Aus rice entering the market, a senior government official said on Monday. "Up to 73 percent of the allotted OMS rice is being sold a day," food secretary Molla Waheeduzzaman told reporters at his office. The food secretary said the inflow of Aus rice in the market and release of hoarded rice were the main reasons behind the fall in prices. Asked if the OMS of rice would be closed, Waheeduzzaman said, "The ministry has nothing to do in this regard." "A committee of food planning will make decision. The OMS does not need to be continued the way it is going on," Waheeduzzaman said. He said there was not much demand for OMS of rice in the market. Besides, the demand kept falling in the northern region, in particular. Rice prices in market is less than the government-fixed ones. Waheeduzzaman said the government did not have any plan to further lower rice price. It may rather stop OMS. According to the secretary, the government has now about 12 lakh tonnes of food in stock. The government procured 7.84 lakh tonnes of rice and about 45000 tonnes of paddy during the Boro season, he added. The food secretary said about 1.53 lakh people in 23 districts were affected by the floods. The government has allocated Tk 1 crore in cash and 10,000 tonnes of food for them, Waheeduzzaman added. "There is no danger of big flood in the country if India does not experience fresh heavy rainfall and waters does not roll down into Bangladesh. The government is keeping an eye," the official added. bdn
