 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Chief Political Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Politician and former minister Anwar Hossain Manju, now in Washington, says he will return home after Eid-ul Fitr to face a string of charges. "I am not a fugitive. I'll return home soon," Manju said, in a telephone interview with bdnews24.com. The former communications minister in the Sheikh Hasina-led 1996-2001 administration and one of the owners of the Bangla-language daily Ittefaq, Manju claimed he was "innocent" and vowed to fight it out in the court. Already convicted in four cases, including three for corruption, Manju has been sentenced to 32 years in jail. "I am taking preparation to face the allegations in the court," said Manju, who had served as energy minister in the 1980s when former military dictator General Ershad ruled the country. He said he was now staying in his daughter's home in Washington. His wife former lawmaker Tasmima Hossain, sentenced to six years in jail for corruption, is also with him. bdnews24.com: When will you return home? Manju: As far as I can gather, it seems the process of restoring democratic environment has started in the country. It is a good sign. So I am going to return home soon. bdnews24.com: When do you plan to return? Manju: Very soon. The High Court is now on vacation. I am targeting a date after the vacation. Because the only recourse available for me is the court of law. bdnews24.com: You have already been convicted. How are you going to face it? Manju: The cases filed against me were meant to harass me. Those cases were filed to malign me politically. I want to face all these charges in the court. One thing I must mention here that I had secured bail from the High Court before I left the country. Those who call me fugitive are just not right. bdnews24.com: What is your opinion about the convictions in the special tribunals set up to try to the corrupt? Manju: The cases filed against me and leaders of other political parties have generally been questioned by all. Because these cases have been filed under the emergency law and then tried in special tribunals. Many, back home and here in the US, believe that these corruption cases under the EPR are all politically motivated. If the accused were tried under the traditional law, people would not have raised such questions. I believe no one raises any question about the transparency of the trial conducted in the traditional courts. bdnews24.com: How do you look at the current state of affairs in politics? Manju: Political parties and politicians have to be tolerant and farsighted if we want to restore democracy. This is more necessary for the leaders. It is the lack of competence of the leadership that has hampered the democratic process. bdnews24.com: Do you have any doubts about the promised parliamentary elections in December? Manju: The country has been under the state of emergency for a long time. Now the situation has returned to normal. So steps should be taken without delay to hold the parliament election. A fair and free election with participation of all parties can only ensure the progress towards stability and development. I think the caretaker government and the Election Commission are working in this regard. I hope our politicians would be farsighted enough to help restore the democratic process. This is the least people expect of them.
