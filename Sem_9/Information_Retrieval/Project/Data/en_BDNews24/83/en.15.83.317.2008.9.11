<TITLE> South Korea on alert for possible changes in North </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul,Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet to prepare for possible changes in North Korea after speculation its leader Kim Jong-il had suffered a stroke, an official said on Thursday. Kim, 66, has led communist North Korea for 14 years, under which the reclusive country has seen it anaemic economy shrink, its ballistic missile arsenal swell and UN sanctions imposed due to its nuclear programme and first atomic test two years ago. "We should have thorough and precise readiness so we can respond to any situation without confusion," President Lee Myung-bak was quoted as saying in a statement from the spokesman of the presidential Blue House. The meeting was late on Wednesday. "There was a report that Chairman Kim is recovering from a stroke in the brain circulatory system and does not appear to be in a serious condition," a Blue House spokesman said. US and South Korean intelligence officials said earlier that Kim had suffered a stroke. The South's intelligence said Kim was recovering well, while North Korean officials reportedly said there was nothing wrong with their leader. The statement said the South had spotted no unusual troop movements in the North, but Lee had asked his government to step up readiness plans for possible contingencies. The mystery surrounding Kim also leaves a frightening question mark for South Korea, for which a worst-case scenario would be the collapse of the North, leaving it facing social chaos that could wreck Asia's fourth-largest economy. "The latest incident proves that this scenario (of unification) is no longer a distant prospect but an unavoidable reality we may have to face right now," South Korea's largest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, said in an editorial. Kim's death would create huge uncertainty over leadership in a country whose deep distrust of the outside world is backed by a 1.2 million-strong army and possibly atomic weapons. The North has threatened to turn the capitalist South to dust and considers Japan and the United States mortal enemies. In a move that could heighten tension, North Korea is nearing completion of a missile test site capable of shooting off rockets that could hit all of South Korea and most of Japan, U.S. broadcaster CNN cited analysts as saying. NUCLEAR DEAL Kim's illness comes as the North appears to be backing away from an international nuclear disarmament deal and analysts said progress would almost certainly be scuttled if there was a leadership struggle. "My first inclination is that it will go to a hunker down mode and not pursue a breakthrough or a breakdown," said Peter Beck, an expert in Korean affairs at American University in Washington. "I would be surprised if they broke the deal. They would only do that if that felt that they really needed to rally the public." Kim's health and possible successor are two of Pyongyang's most closely guarded secrets. South Korea said in a 2006 intelligence report that when Kim died, it expected the North Korean government to lapse into a brief coma and then hunker down with top military officials battling for power, perhaps in partnership with one of Kim's three known sons. Kim, whom state media calls the Dear Leader, was groomed for years to succeed his father and the North's founding president Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994. During his time in power, Kim has crushed dissent and placed an enormous distance between himself and any potential rival, which means there is no clear heir
