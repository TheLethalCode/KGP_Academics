 CARDIFF, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were denied the chance to climb to second in the one-day international rankings when the fifth and final match of the series against South Africa was abandoned after only three overs on Wednesday. Kevin Pietersen's men were already four up in the series and a 5-0 whitewash would have lifted them from third to second in the world behind Australia. After England won the toss and elected to bowl, South Africa reached six for one with Herschelle Gibbs falling for three to a diving catch by wicketkeeper Matt Prior off Stuart Broad. Intermittent downpours then ruled out any further play. South Africa won the test encounter 2-1 to record their first series victory in England since 1965
