 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court Monday deferred witness deposition for the fourth time in a Tk 3 crore extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others, as the plaintiff reported sick. Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Sessions Judge's Court-5 set a new date of Sept 23 after the prosecution lawyers requested two weeks' time. On August 28, the High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed ordered the government to show cause within six weeks why the case proceedings should not be declared illegal. Businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the case with Gulshan police on June 13 last year against Sheikh Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Later charges were also pressed against Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana. The case alleged that the accused took Tk 2.99 crore in bribes from the plaintiff during 2001, while Awami League was in power, in exchange for a contract to set up Siddhirganj power station. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year and was shown arrested in the case, the same day, after the case was brought under EPR. The government released Sheikh Hasina on parole for eight weeks on June 11. She is currently in the US seeking medical treatment. bdnews2
