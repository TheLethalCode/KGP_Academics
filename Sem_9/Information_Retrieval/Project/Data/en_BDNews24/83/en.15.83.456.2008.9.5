 TRIPOLI, Sep 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top US diplomat Condoleezza Rice arrived in Tripoli on Friday on the first trip by a US secretary of state to Libya since 1953, and said it was proof that Washington had no "permanent enemies". Rice was set to meet Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi during her brief trip, which Washington hopes will end decades of enmity and violence and comes five years after Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program in 2003.
