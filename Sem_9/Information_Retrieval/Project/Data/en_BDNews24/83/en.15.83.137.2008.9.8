<TEXT>
 By Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)  Tata Motors will continue to suspend their operations at Singur in West Bengal, where the world's cheapest car is being built by the company. Sumon K Chakrabarti, the chief national correspondent of CNN-IBN, writes exclusively for bdnews24.com. "Tata Motors Ltd. is distressed at the limited clarity on the outcome of the discussions between the State Government of West Bengal and the representatives of the agitators in Singur," a company spokesman said on Monday. "So, Tata Motors is obliged to continue the suspension of construction and commissioning work at the Nano Plant,". Sources say Tata will only review their stated position if the company is "satisfied if the viability of the project is not being impinged." "We have to see that the integral nature of the mother plant and our ancillary units are being maintained and all stakeholders are committed to develop a long term congenial environment for smooth operations of the plant in Singur," said Debasis Ray, head of Corporate Communications of Tata Motors. But Dinesh Trivedi, a spokesperson of the agitating Trinamool Congress, immediately reacted by insisting that suspension of work is "Tata's internal problem and not because of his party." bd
