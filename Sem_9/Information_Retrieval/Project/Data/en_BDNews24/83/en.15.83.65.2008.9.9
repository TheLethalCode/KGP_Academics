 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent London, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)The UK-Bangladesh Climate Change Conference, hosted by the British government, begins Wednesday with Bangladesh hoping for greater financial support for future adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change. The 39-member Bangladesh delegation, led by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, arrived Tuesday to attend the one-day conference at the London headquarters of the Royal Geographic Society. The Bangladesh government is set to present a 'Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan', and seek international support arguing that less industrialised nations like Bangladesh while attributing least to pollution are the worst affected by global climate change. The UK's secretary of state for international development Douglas Alexander and Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the 2006 Stern Review on climate change, will be among the British speakers. Representatives from donor agencies, including the World Bank, will also attend the conference on Bangladesh's vulnerability to climate change to address financial support for a multi-lateral adaptation fund. "This conference is a good beginning from Bangladesh's point of view as the British government through DFID will announce a package of financial support from adaptation fund," Dr Atiq Rahman, who will present a paper on Bangladesh's vulnerability to climate change at the conference, told bdnews24.com. Chairman of Climate Action Network, South Asia, Dr Atiq said there was a likelihood that the other donors such as the Danish, the Dutch and the World Bank would announce financial support for the adaptation fund. "The aim (of the conference) is to increase international focus on how Bangladesh is adapting to climate change and how much more needs to be done, both domestically and globally to stop it from worsening," DFID's country representative to Bangladesh Chris Austin told bdnews24.com. He said climate change presented serious challenges to Bangladesh's development and must be taken into account in future planning for the country. Global temperature rises, from excessive use of fossil fuels leading to generation of greenhouse gases, are predicted to displace millions of Bangladeshis among the populations of other vulnerable countries. According to predictions of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea levels will rise by at least 86cm by the end of the century, inundating vast tracts of coastal Bangladesh. According to the IPCC's estimate, rising seas may permanently submerge 6 to 8 percent of the coastal and low-lying lands of Bangladesh by 2050. The IPCC also predicts that global warming will increase the frequency of natural disasters like floods, cyclones and droughts, posing a long-term threat to food security not only for Bangladesh but worldwide. bdn
