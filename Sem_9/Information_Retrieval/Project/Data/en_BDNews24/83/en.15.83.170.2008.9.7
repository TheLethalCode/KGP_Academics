 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government has relaxed a ban on trade union activities, on nine conditions, allowing the workers' organisations to hold indoor programmes, the government announced Sunday. The home ministry notice said: "The government, in line with the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006, has relaxed the ban on activities of trade unions in industries, commercial institutions, ports and factories on nine conditions" The trade unions will now be able to hold polls, taking permission from the concerned metropolitan police commissioner or district magistrate, it added. The nine conditions include informing the police and the administration 48 hours before holding any meeting. No more than 100 people will be allowed to attend any such meeting. The unions must apply for special permission for any rally of more than 100. But the number of attendants will not exceed 500 by any means. Any such rally must be held indoors. There will be no politics allowed at any meetings or rallies. No gathering will be broadcast live, the conditions include. The government imposed the ban on trade union activities alongside the ban on political activities on Jan 11 last year when a state of emergency was imposed. The trade unions have since been demanding withdrawal of ban on their activities. bdnew
