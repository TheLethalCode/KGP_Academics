 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation is planning a Super Cup pitting top eight B. League teams against each other next year with Tk 1 crore in prize money on offer for the champions. "The president (Kazi Salahuddin) has proposed introduction of the Super Cup with top eight B. League teams and the emergency committee have agreed in principle to organise the tournament," said Anwarul Haq Helal after a meeting at the BFF House on Tuesday. "The participants will not be given appearance fees, but the third and fourth finishers might be awarded, but the decision has yet to be made," said Helal adding that they would invite foreign teams in the future. Helal, former BFF general secretary, said they had decided to award the champions Tk 1 crore and the runners-up Tk 25 lakh. He hinted the Super Cup might take place in February subject to completion of the B. League, which is set to start on Sept 13. The league will run through to Sept 27 before the Eid-ul-Fitr vacation and resume on October 5 or 6, Helal said. The Eid vacation for the 30 players called into the provisional national squad for the Mardeka Cup has been cancelled, Helal added. The selected players will be sent to a conditioning camp. The Mardeka Cup is scheduled for Oct 15-25 in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur and the BFF president will witness Bangladesh's all matches. The BFF will unveil B. League's logo Wednesday at a ceremony at a local hotel. Defending champions Abahani Limited will take on Rahmatganj MFS on the inaugural day at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The meeting also decided the BFF would sit with representatives of the district and divisional football associations (DFAs), affiliated with the BFF, on Sept 17 to listen to their demands and problems to execute local football schedules. The DFAs are facing problems to hold the local football league as they are not affiliated with the National Sports Council, which has already allotted funds for its affiliated district sports associations to run local sports, including football. b
