 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will decide on taking part in the third round dialogue with Election Commission only after chairperson Khaleda Zia is released from detention, a policymaker said has said. The party's policymaking standing committee member Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui informed reporters Monday about the party stance after a meeting that discussed the second invitation letter from the chief election commissioner to join the ongoing talks. "Once our party chairperson is freed, we'll join the dialogue and contest the polls all right. We've reviewed the CEC's letter and are now drafting a set of relevant recommendations," said Siddiqui. "All decisions will be made after [Khaleda's] release, not before." Earlier in the morning, another meeting was held at BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain's Nam flat home to discuss the CEC's letter. Standing committee member Siddiqui, MK Anwar, Joynal Abedeen and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, among others, attended it. Delwar wrote to the chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Sunday expressing BNP's inability to attend the dialogue on registration and other issues. Huda in turn sent Delwar another letter by a special courier. The BNP leaders sat on Monday to discuss the second invitation letter. bd
