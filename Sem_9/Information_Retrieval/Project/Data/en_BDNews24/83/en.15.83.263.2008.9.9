<TITLE> Dunga says Chile win proves he is on right lines </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Beleaguered Brazil coach Dunga hit back at his critics on Monday and said his team's 3-0 World Cup qualifying win over Chile proved he was doing a good job. Dunga also told a news conference he had not used critical comments from President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to fire up his players. "This win gives us the certainty that we are doing the right thing," he said before Brazil's match against Bolivia on Wednesday. "We have shown that, with more time to prepare the team, that our work is correct. If criticism solved problems, then Brazil would never lose and would always be champions, because Brazil are always criticised." Dunga praised Ronaldinho, who missed a penalty in the first half and was taken off in a tactical switch in the second. "He was only taken off because we had a player sent off," said Dunga. "He had been doing his job well. "He showed the maturity that we want in the Brazilian team. He's the twice World Player of the Year and, even though he was upset, he sat on the bench supporting his team mates." Brazil had failed to score in their previous three games, including defeats against Venezuela and Paraguay, a performance blamed on Dunga's ultra-cautious tactics. The situation worsened when the Olympic team, who Dunga also coached, won a bronze medal only in Beijing last month after losing 3-0 to arch-rivals Argentina in the semi-finals. Even Lula joined the criticism, saying that Argentina forwards such as Lionel Messi chased back when they lost the ball while Brazilian strikers expected the defence to clear up after them. "I never used those comments in any way," said Dunga, responding to a media report that Lula's criticisms had been mentioned in his pre-match team talk. In Brasilia, Lula described the outcome as a good result and said that Dunga deserved to keep his job. "You can't judge a coach before he finishes his work," said Lula. "The coach has to finish what he started. "In Brazil, if the team wins it's because the team is good. If the team loses, it's because the coach is bad.
