 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission has ordered 46 people to submit around Tk 15 crore to state coffers after hearing their statements. "The commission only asked people who had confessed to having ill-gotten wealth to deposit money," TAC secretary Khandaker Md Asaduzzaman told a press briefing. Replying to a query, he said: "Of the 46 people, we have received accounts of ill-gotten wealth from a minimum Tk 1 lakh to a maximum of Tk 5 crore." The commission's deputy secretary Shamim Al Mamun said they had set a timeframe for submission of money  from seven days to maximum 21 days - at the request of those seeking clemency. "If anybody conceals any information, he will have to bear the consequences of his actions on his own," Asaduzzaman warned. Some 209 applications had been submitted to the commission so far, he said. Of them, five were submitted directly, 153 applications were sent from the National Coordination Committee on Curbing Serious Crimes and the remaining 51 from the Anticorruption Commission. "We do not claim that the commission will be able to fulfill all of the purposes it aimed at the start," Asaduzzaman said. "No politician has yet applied to the commission." Of the total 209 applications, 191 were government officials, 13 were their wives; three were businessmen, while the remaining two did not mention their posts, the TAC secretary said. The commission found some discrepancies between the TAC forms and the estimates given by the National Coordination Committee on Curbing Serious Crimes or ACC. "We are examining them," the deputy secretary said. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed the "Voluntary Divulgence of Information Ordinance 2008" into law on June 8, paving way for the commission to come into being. According to the ordinance, anybody facing conviction in a corruption case of two years or less can seek clemency from the commission by admitting to their crime and return within a specific time the wealth accumulated through corruption. The commission began hearings on Sept 1. bdnew
