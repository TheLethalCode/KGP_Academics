 LONDON, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose on Monday as Hurricane Ike spun towards the US oil hub in the Gulf of Mexico while traders awaited OPEC's decision this week on output policy. Ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began gathering in Vienna. They were due to meet to review the policy on Tuesday and were widely expected to leave formal targets unchanged, especially as the powerful hurricane has lifted oil prices. "I don't believe there is any possibility we will change production levels," Ecuador's Oil Minister Galo Chiriboga told reporters on Sunday. There has been no comment yet in Vienna from the minister of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most influential member. US light crude was trading $1.41 higher at $107.64 by 5 a.m. EDT. It had fallen to a five-month low on Friday, pressured by weaker oil demand, mainly in the developed countries, amid an economic slowdown. London Brent crude rose $1.19 to $105.28. "Whilst observing the goings on in Vienna over the next few days, keep one eye on Hurricane Ike," Robert Laughlin with MF Global said. He said news this week may provoke swings in oil prices that could be exaggerated as levels are hit that prompt buying or selling on the basis of technical analysis of past price movements. "Volatility will be sky-high this week as the fundamental headlines may well whip-saw technicians in coming days." Hurricane Ike weakened into a Category 2 storm on Monday after roaring ashore in northeastern Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, the US National Hurricane Center said. But it was expected to regain strength, entering the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 3 storm. It may threaten Gulf oil and gas facilities, most of which still remained offline in a slow recovery from the earlier damage caused by Hurricane Gustav. The US Gulf of Mexico accounts for a quarter of US oil output and 15 percent of natural gas production. Hopes that a US bailout of its top mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, would help temper an economic downturn provided some support to the oil market
