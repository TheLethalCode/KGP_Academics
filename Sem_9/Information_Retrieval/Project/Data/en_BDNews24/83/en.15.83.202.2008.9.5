<TITLE> U.S. head to Havana after 60 year gap </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United States visit Cuba on Saturday, the first time for more than 60 years the Americans have played in the capital Havana. With a U.S. embargo stopping its citizens touring the communist-run island, there will be no support for Bob Bradley's side but the players do not expect a particularly hostile reception despite the political tension between the countries. "I don't know what to expect down there, everyone is trying to go with an open mind to just get the win," captain Carlos Bocanegra told Reuters before flying to Cuba. "When we played in Venezuela the presidents (Hugo) Chavez and (George W) Bush were not on the best terms and we had a great reception down there, everyone was fine, we get it everywhere we go." Clint Dempsey said any hostility would probably represent the normal behaviour of home fans. "I expect any time you go to any country and play against their team that they are not going to be too happy towards to you, they want their team to win," said the striker. "It doesn't matter who you are playing, what country you are in, everyone's going to be against you. We are used to that, we have that even at home sometimes with more fans for the other team," added Dempsey, referring to the games with nearby Mexico. Cuba goalkeeper Guadalupe Quintero said the political tension would add extra spice to the fixture. "There's a bit of rivalry due to the problem of our two countries. As Cubans we have to at least defend our image here in our home field, the flag is the main thing," said the 23-year-old. "Winning would be very, very, very important for the people." FIRM FAVOURITES The U.S. are firm favourites to win though, and to qualify from the CONCACAF competition while Cuba are rank outsiders. Although Cuba were the first Caribbean nation to qualify for the World Cup finals in 1938, they have not made it back since and the game has struggled to compete with the popularity of baseball and boxing. The last time the teams clashed in Havana in 1947 Cuba won 5-2. "We don't know a whole lot about them," said Bocanegra. "They could have a few surprises, athletic guys with individual talent. "For us it's just about going out and playing our own game and doing the job we know we can do." The U.S. players are looking forward to visiting the city. "Not many Americans go to Cuba and that is something we get to experience through football which is neat," said Bocanegra. "I am sure we will look back on this and say that was really cool, we got to go to Cuba and play down there and no one else has done that.
