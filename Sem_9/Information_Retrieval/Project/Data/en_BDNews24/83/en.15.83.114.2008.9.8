<TEXT>
 Meindorf Castle, Russia, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday Russia would pull out from buffer zones around South Ossetia if an international force is in place and there is a guarantee Georgia refrains from using force again. "Russia has received from the countries of the European Union, and France which is chairman of the European Union, a guarantee of the non-use of force by Georgia," said Medvedev after meeting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Medvedev said there was an agreement in principle to deploy a 200-strong EU monitoring contingent after he met Sarkozy and an EU delegation at his official residence outside Moscow to discuss the fallout of the Georgia conflict.
