 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)The BNP-led four-party alliance has demanded Khaleda Zia's immediate release, and announced a countrywide protest programme on Sep 20 to press for the schedule of Jatiya Sangsad elections and lifting of the state of emergency. Also among their five-point demands are immediate arrangements to send Tarique Rahman abroad for medical treatment and controlling prices of essentials during Ramadan. After a meeting with alliance leaders late Tuesday night, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters: "The High Court has given orders for the release of Khaleda Zia on bail today." "Until she is freed we'll continue our series of programmes to press our demands." "We are telling the government to respect the court's decision and release Khaleda Zia as quickly as possible, without creating any more obstacles," said Delwar. "We also demand that the government make immediate arrangements to allow Tarique Rahman abroad for medical treatment," the secretary general said. The four-party alliance meeting took place between 9-11pm at Delwar's NAM-flat residence. Present were Jama'at-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohamad Mojaheed, IOJ secretary general Abdul Latif Nizami, Khelafat Majlish secretary general Ahmed Abdul Quader and BJP general secretary Shamim Al Mamun. The alliance held a protest meeting earlier in the day, pressing the same demands, at the Kakrail Diploma Engineers Institute. bdnews
