 Taipei, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale rattled Taiwan on Tuesday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. The epicentre of the quake, which struck at 0743 GMT, was about 86 km east of Ilan on the east coast, at a depth of 89 km, the Central Weather Bureau said in a statement. Earthquakes occur frequently in Taiwan, which lies on a seismically active stretch of the Pacific basin. One of Taiwan's worst-recorded quakes occurred in September 1999. Measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, it killed more than 2,400 people and destroyed or damaged 50,000 buildings.
