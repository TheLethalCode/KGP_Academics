<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serb Novak Djokovic slammed Andy Roddick for suggesting he had faked several injuries in his previous match after beating the American 6-2 6-3 3-6 7-6 in a gripping U.S. Open quarter-final on Thursday. Djokovic had struggled with a hip problem and an upset stomach while battling past Spaniard Tommy Robredo 4-6 6-2 6-3 5-7 6-3 in the fourth round, prompting Roddick to say the Serb had been suffering from "16 injuries." After sealing victory against Roddick in two hours 34 minutes, the third-seeded Serb said in a courtside interview: "That's not nice anyhow to say in front of this crowd that I have 16 injuries and I am faking it. "I have nothing against anybody. Andy was saying that I have 16 injuries in the last match so obviously I don't, right?" he added, after booking his place in the last four against four-times champion Roger Federer. "I am really happy playing against Roddick on his court and in his city in his favourite tournament so to win against him is a huge effort." With the sellout crowd packed around the Arthur Ashe Stadium court booing the Serb's post-match comments, Djokovic added: "Like it or not, it's like that. "They (the crowd) are already against me because they think I am faking everything, so sorry." Two days earlier, Roddick had a spring in his step after comfortably beating Chilean 11th seed Fernando Gonzalez 6-2 6-4 6-1 in the previous round. "I feel good," the eighth-seeded American said in a courtside interview. "I've got to feel good, he's got about 16 injuries right now," he then added, referring to his quarter-final opponent. In his post-match news conference, Roddick continued to make light of the ailing Serb. When asked about Djokovic's injuries, he said: "A back and a hip? And a cramp? Bird flu anthrax SARS common cough and cold. "If it's there, it's there. There's just a lot. He's either quick to call a trainer or he's the most courageous guy of all time.
