<TITLE> Rejuvenated Federer says pressure is off in final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, September 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After a year in which he lost his Wimbledon title and the number one ranking, a rejuvenated Roger Federer said the pressure was off him after he reached the U.S. Open final on Saturday. The four-times champion was close to his best in beating Novak Djokovic 6-3 5-7 7-5 6-2 to reach his third consecutive grand slam final, where he will play world number one Rafael Nadal or British sixth seed Andy Murray. Chasing his 13th major crown, but his first in 2008, Federer said he was looking forward to the final. "The pressure is off," Federer, aiming to become the first man since Bill Tilden in 1924 to win five in a row here, told reporters. "I think now you can look forward and just try to win, really, because I think the pressure is always on in the early rounds, coming through and not getting an upset early on. "Once you get to the semis you can maybe play a little bit more freely again, because you're also playing opponents who you know most likely have a better chance to beat you." Federer also applied some reverse psychology as he waits to discover the identity of his next opponent which will not be determined until Sunday. Wimbledon and French Open champion Nadal was trailing by two sets against Murray when rain washed out play for the rest of the day. PROVE MYSELF "I don't feel like now I need to prove myself in the finals. I think if it's Rafa, he's the number one player. I don't want to put pressure on him, but that's how it was for me. I was always expected to win," said the 27-year-old. "I had maybe a little bit less this year, but nevertheless I'm defending champion. I know what it's all about." Against Djokovic, whom he beat to win the title last year, Federer was almost flawless in the opening set. Though the Serbian hit back to level the match, once Federer had taken a tight third set, Djokovic ran out of steam. "I had a feeling he was looking a little weary, a little bit tired," Federer said. "I think I broke his will as well when I got the third set. I think he let his head hang a little bit. I needed to just play really tough (after that)I knew I could get it in four." If Federer win the title, his grand slam haul will be just one short of Pete Sampras overall record of 14. But the Swiss said he did not want to be distracted by that milestone. "I think at the moment the focus is trying to defend my title here and get my fifth (U.S. Open win). I think that's what it's about right now," he said. "I know the Pete thing is obviously still very much alive and everything is possible. I mean, if I win, it's great. I'm back sort of in the race and things aren't that bad like everybody's saying. "But for this, I first need to just get the win. That would be huge
