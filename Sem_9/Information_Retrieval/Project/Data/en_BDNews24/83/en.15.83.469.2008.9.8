 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory chiefs have told telecom operators to cut infrastructure costs by sharing network with other companies, according to a new guideline unveiled Monday. "Every operator must share the network infrastructure such as base stations. It will minimise the operating cost and protect the environment," BTRC chief Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com. "The companies will thus be able to reduce the tariff and pass on the savings to other areas," the retired major general said. The BTRC chairman said network infrastructure is one of costliest components in the business. The new guideline aims to "protect the environment by reducing land use, as well as infrastructure and facility installations, thereby not changing the aesthetics of the country's landscape." It is also targeted "to optimise operators' capital expenditure on supporting infrastructure." Says BTRC: "These guidelines are applicable for sharing of passive infrastructures; optical fibre/wired access and backbone transmission network amongst all existing and future telecommunication operators having license from the Commission," "Operators shall jointly develop, build, maintain and operate new passive infrastructure for providing telecommunication services to the subscribers. However, an individual operator may build passive infrastructures with the permission of the Commission. "Licensees (except the Nationwide Telecommunication Transmission Network's Licensee) will not be permitted to build optical/wired backbone transmission network if such networks of other operators are already available for sharing.. The guideline also applies to "optical/wired backbone transmission network if such networks are not existing/not available for sharing from the existing infrastructures in a particular zone/area." The BTRC, however, can make an exception to this rule. "Tariff and charges for Infrastructure Sharing shall be mutually agreed basing on the directives issued or to be issued by the Commission. "In case of any dispute regarding the tariff and charges the decision of the Commission shall be final and binding upon the parties. "Any agreements to be executed shall be submitted to the Commission within 15 days from the date of agreement." According to the guideline, the operators shall provide capacity on its infrastructure to other operators on a non-discriminatory "first come, first serve" basis. "Infrastructure Providers shall reserve the right to refuse an application for infrastructure sharing on grounds of insufficient capacity. "Infrastructure Providers have the right to reserve not more than 25% of spare capacity. "The Infrastructure Seekers may sub lease/rent out the shared infrastructures subject to the provision of agreement. "Sharing Infrastructure is an approach to minimise the cost of network deployment and to protect the environment by reducing the proliferation of towers and facilities installation said in the guideline. b
