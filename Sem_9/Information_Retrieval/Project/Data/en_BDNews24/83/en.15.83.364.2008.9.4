 SANTIAGO, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chile are determined to end an embarrassing run of heavy defeats against Brazil when they face the five-times champions in Sunday's World Cup qualifier. The Chileans have shipped 18 goals in their last four meetings including a 6-1 pummelling in a Copa America quarter-final last year. "It's been a long time since we beat Brazil and we have also been on the receiving end of some thrashings," said defender Pablo Contreras on Wednesday. "Sunday is the ideal moment to change all these bad results," added Contreras, one of six players to serve 10-match bans after an incident at the team hotel during the Copa America. A win for Chile will heap the pressure on Brazil coach Dunga, whose team have failed to score in their last three outings. In June, Brazil lost to Venezuela in a friendly and to Paraguay in a World Cup qualifier. Dunga also coached the Olympic team which only managed a bronze medal in Beijing after a crushing 3-0 semi-final defeat by Argentina. "We have some new players and there's a new mentality," said Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal. "Although they (Brazil) are at a low ebb they are still dangerous and always go out to win, that's why they have won the World Cup." Chile are fourth in the 10-team South American group with 10 points from six games, one point and one place above Brazil
