<TITLE> New RBI chief says inflation first priority </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, sep 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao said checking inflation, which is running above 12 percent annually, was his immediate priority, signalling he was set to maintain the firm anti-inflation stance of his predecessor. Analysts expect Subbarao, who took over from Y.V. Reddy on Friday, to keep monetary policy tight after recent aggressive rate increases by his predecessor, with inflation at its highest since the current price series began in the mid-1990s. Government bond yields ticked up after his comment as the market judged there was no change in policy stance. Annual inflation, as measured by wholesale prices, has eased from a high of 12.63 percent in early August to 12.34 percent later in the month, but many economists say price pressures remain and expect it to peak late in the year at 13-14 percent. "His comments hint at the continuation of the monetary policy stance established until now," said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. "He is unlikely to relent on tight interest rates until inflation comes close to the central bank's stated objective of close to 7 percent by the end of March." The RBI raised interest rates three times in June and July to calm price pressures and inflationary expectations, taking its key lending rate to a seven-year high of 9.0 percent. It has also raised banks' reserve requirements a number of times this year to cut cash supplies in the banking system. "The immediate priority for me as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India will be to manage inflation and anchor inflationary expectations," Subbarao told reporters just after taking charge at the central bank's headquarters in Mumbai. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond ended up 2 basis points on the day at 8.49 percent after his comments. The rupee dipped to its lowest since December 2006 at 44.75 per dollar , but dealers said the fall was driven by concerns about fund outflows from the weakening stock market. BREATHING SPACE Subbarao, 59, was previously Finance Secretary at the finance ministry in New Delhi and said in June that demand management must be part of the solution in tackling prices. "The kind of statements the new governor has made as the finance secretary, it appears he is very much in favour of a tight monetary policy," said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank. "He sees monetary policy as the first line of defence against inflation." The next rate review is on Oct. 24 and analysts say lower inflation gives him time to assess the price and growth outlook. India's economy, Asia's third largest, is slowing from a rapid clip of 9 percent and above in the past three fiscal years, with annual growth in the June quarter at 7.9 percent. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on a trip to southern India, said India expected its economy to grow at about 9 percent a year in the next few years. "To ensure that this growth process is not inflationary we must step up productivity and increase output," he said. Barua said inflation pressures were dying down and money supply growth was moderating. "We may see a less aggressive stance in the next policy," he said. Subbarao has been appointed for three years at a time when India is striving to deepen and modernise its financial markets and is scheduled to make a review of the banking sector in 2009. He made clear financial sector reforms would also be high on the agenda. "The priority in the short to medium term will be of course to pursue financial sector reforms in the context of financial stability, price stability, and above all with an ear firmly to the ground on the real sector reforms," he said.
