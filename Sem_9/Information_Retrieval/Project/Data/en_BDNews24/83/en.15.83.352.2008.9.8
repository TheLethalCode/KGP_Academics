 Al Imran Shovon bdnews24.com Chandpur correspondent Chandpur, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Chandpur town's protection embankment is gradually caving in, with locals fearing that large scale erosion poses a threat to the economy of the town. A four metre section of the embankment, in the Dolmandir area of the town's Puranbazar, crumbled on Monday. A 25-metre block in Dolmandir sank and another four-metre section suffered subsidence in August. On Aug 26, seven houses in Puranbazar collapsed into the river Meghna due to sudden erosion. Meghna waters damaged a massive 300 metre section of the embankment that day. The Water Development Board has recently attempted temporary repairs with sandbags. Local people fear large scale erosion might occur in the area. Chandpur WDB executive engineer Jiban Krishna Das said nothing had been done to properly repair the Puranbazar portion of the protective embankment this year. "The last dam repair work was done two years ago," he said. The WDB recently sent a Tk 70 crore project proposal for approval to the water resources ministry as sections of the dam at Baro Station Molehead and Puranbazar caved in. The project is yet to be approved, Das said. Advocate Taher Patwari, president of Chandpur district river erosion action committee, told bdnews24.com: "Panic has been created among the people as sections at different points including Puranbazar have caved in." He demanded immediate steps to save Puranbazar from erosion. Jahangir Akhand Selim, president of Chandpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "Puranbazar is about to go into the Meghna. The government is not taking any action to save it." He demanded immediate steps to save Chanpur, a traditional business centre of the country, from erosion by the river Meghna. bdnews2
