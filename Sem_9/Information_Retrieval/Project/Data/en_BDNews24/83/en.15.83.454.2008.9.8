<TITLE> Netherlands on guard for carefree Macedonia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SKOPJE, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk faces a tricky encounter for his first competitive match in charge when the Dutch take on a euphoric Macedonia in their World Cup qualifying opener in Skopje on Wednesday. Macedonia made a stunning start to their Group Nine campaign on Saturday when Ilco Naumoski struck after four minutes to seal a 1-0 victory over Scotland. However, Macedonia coach Srecko Katanec expects a far tougher test against the Dutch, who are likely to have Real Madrid's Arjen Robben back in the fold. "The Dutch are one of the best teams in Europe and also one of the most entertaining," Katanec told reporters. "But our objective was to win three points from our opening two matches so we have nothing to lose against Netherlands after beating Scotland," he added. The Netherlands have had a mixed build-up to the match, suffering a 2-1 friendly defeat against Australia on Saturday after playing with 10 men for 47 minutes following a straight red card for goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Stekelenburg's one-match ban will come into force for their next friendly match and is available for Wednesday's match. Coach Van Marwijk was without Robben against the Australians, but expects the winger to be fit. The biggest concern for Van Marwijk will be his defensive organisation and his holding midfield duo, Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong. "After the match against Russia (in Euro 2008 quarter-final) we hoped that the team pursued that line," Van Marwijk told reporters. "Against Russia with playmaker (Andrei) Arshavin, Van Bommel and De Jong played well but against (Australia's) Brett Holman they never got control". Netherlands played Macedonia twice in the qualification campaign for the previous World Cup and were twice held to draws while they won all their other matches. So Van Marwijk will need the coming days to make sure his team will be sharp and focussed to take control in the group with Norway and Iceland as other opponents. "We have to learn our lesson from the last match but we need to do it fast as we know what we can expect against Macedonia," he added. Katanec's biggest worry will be fitness of his squad after the tough encounter against Scotland. "My players were completely exhausted after playing against the Scots in searing heat and fortunately it's an evening kick off against the Dutch" he said. "A lot will depend on the physical condition of my players because we showed that we can do damage against anyone when we are aggressive." Probable teams: Macedonia: Petar Milosevski; Nikolce Noveski, Igor Mitreski, Goce Sedloski, Vlade Lazarevski; Vlatko Grozdanoski, Velice Sumulikoski, Vanco Trajanov; Goran Pandev, Goran Maznov, Ilco Naumoski. Netherlands: Maarten Stekelenburg; John Heitinga, Andre Ooijer, Joris Mathijsen, Giovanni van Bronckhorst; Robin van Persie, Mark van Bommel, Rafael van der Vaart, Nigel de Jong, Arjen Robben; Klaas Jan Huntelaar
