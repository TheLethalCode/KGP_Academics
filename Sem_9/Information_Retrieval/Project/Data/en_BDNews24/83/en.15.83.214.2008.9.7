<TITLE> Pakistan using US funds for war against India: Obama </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 7 (bdnews24.com)Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, in a television interview, has accused Pakistan of diverting US funds for the war on terror to prepare instead for war against India. In the interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Sept 5, Obama said: ''We are providing them military aid without having enough strings attached." "So they're using the military aid that we use -- they're not, to Pakistan, they're preparing for a war against India,'' Obama told O'Reilly, the conservative TV host. He said the US must put more pressure on Pakistan to crack down on Islamist militants and act aggressively against al Qaeda. "If we have bin Laden in our sights, we target him and we knock him out," he said. Asked by the host if US was still in the middle of 'The War on Terror', and if so who was the enemy, Obama replied: "Al Qaeda, the Taliban, a whole host of networks that are bent on attacking America, who have a distorted ideology, who have perverted the faith of Islam, and so we have to go after them." "We've wasted $10 billion with Musharraf without holding him accountable for knocking out those safe havens," said Obama. Obama's interview came a day ahead of Asif Ali Zardari's victory in the Pakistan presidential election. The widower of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto swept the electoral votes on Saturday as a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in an attack on a police post in the northwestern city of Peshawarunderscoring the problems Zardari faces as Pervez Musharraf's successor. Asked whether the answer to the Pakistan problem was pulling out funding and support, Obama replied: "No, no, no, no. What we say is, look, we're going to provide them with additional military support targeted at terrorists, and we're going to help build their democracy." Pressed by O'Reilly, Obama stressed: "We can't  we can't have  and nobody talked about some full-blown invasion of Pakistan, but the simple point that I made was we've got to put more pressure on Pakistan to do what they need to do." bdnews
