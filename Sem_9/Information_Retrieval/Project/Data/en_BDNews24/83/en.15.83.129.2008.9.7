 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will hear petitions for bail for former prime minister Khaleda Zia in GATCO and Niko cases on Tuesday, her lawyers said on Sunday. Khaleda has secured bail in two of the four cases she faces and if the BNP chief is grated bail in remaining cases, there will be no barrier to her release from detention, the lawyers said. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq appealed for bail in the GATCO case to the HC bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman. "The High Court on July 14 stayed the proceedings of the case. We've filed a petition for bail for Khaleda Zia today. Other accused have already got bail," Huq said in the court. "The High Court has set Tuesday for hearing the case," Huq told reporters after emerging from the court. The bail appeal in Niko graft case was launched earlier, another lawyer, barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan, said. "The hearing will also take place in the same bench on Tuesday," he told reporters. Earlier on Friday, Khaleda's lawyer Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim told reporters: "We hope Khaleda Zia will get bails in the two cases as other accused persons in the cases have been granted bail." The GATCO case was filed on Sept 2 last year and the Niko case on May 5. Khaleda and some members of her cabinet were accused in the cases. In the charge sheet of GATCO case, it has been alleged that the accused persons by misusing power gave work of operating Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Container Depot to Global Agro Trade Company (GATCO). The action caused the state a loss of close to Tk 1,000 crore. The Niko case alleges that the agreement with the Canadian company on exploration of oil and gas made the state count about Tk 13,777 crore in losses. Khaleda and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 last year; a day after the GATCO case was filed. Coco is now receiving medical attention in Thailand on bail. bdne
