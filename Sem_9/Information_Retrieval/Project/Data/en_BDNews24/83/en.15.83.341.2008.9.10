 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner said on Wednesday the Election Commission was not announcing the schedule for general elections now. "It is not possible to announce the national elections schedule right at the moment," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters after inaugurating a training programme at National Institute of Local Government. The two-day training of trainers (TOT) programme aims to train up those who would coach field-level officials, returning officers and Upazila polls officials at the EC Secretariat. "The Election Commission will need to send the final voter list to political parties and candidates immediately after announcing of the schedule. But the lists are yet to be finalised across the country," Huda said. "However, we are contemplating a probable date." According the EC's roadmap, the final countrywide voter list is to be ready by October, the schedule for national election is to be announced in the first week of November, and to be held in the third week of December. Huda said they would brief the media on the outcome of the third-round electoral dialogue with the political parties, and their position on the national and Upazila elections on Sunday. On the dialogue with the BNP that skipped the talks, he said: "We hope to have talks with the party soon." The elections chief said the procedure for release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is almost complete. "The commission has sent letter inviting BNP to the dialogue. We have heard that the party chief has already secured bail in all cases." "We hope there is no problem to [their joining] the dialogue now," he said. Earlier, speaking at the programme, Huda said: "No unwanted person or group will be allowed to intervene in the elections." "We want to stage a free and fair election. No unlawful action will be allowed in the elections. We want to establish the rule of law." "We should be careful so that nobody could taint the image and goodwill of the commission." Addressing the returning officers, he said: "The returning boss is the 'supreme boss' in the elections. No person or army officer has right to disobey him." "A returning officer can seek assistance from the election commissioners or Election Commission secretaries, if necessary," he said. The chief election commissioner asked the returning officers not to listen to any suggestions from any organisations or persons. Huda stressed on their following electoral rules and regulations. "All should work in line with the existing laws." He also asked them to carefully examine nomination papers to stop unwanted and unqualified persons from running the polls. Huda also urged the returning officers to be careful in counting votes. "You must be careful so that nobody can steal or conceal ballot papers." The government and the political parties were assisting the commission in holding a proper election, he told the Upazila polls officials. "The commission is working independently. The political parties repeatedly urge us to work neutrally." "Many Upazila polls officials had political identities before. But you have to forget your past identities now." "You should put the country above the party." Divisional deputy election officers, district election commissioners and about 300 Upazila polls officials are participating in the training programme. bdnew
