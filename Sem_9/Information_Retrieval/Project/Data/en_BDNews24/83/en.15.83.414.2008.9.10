 Rajbari, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 600 trucks were lined up at Doulatdia ferry station on Tuesday, with some having been stranded for days, thanks to the scarcity of ferries, said officials. bdnews24.com Rajbari correspondent says the trucks were backed up for three kilometres, from Doulatdia Ghat to Doulatdia Union Parishad. Gopal Majumder, acting assistant general manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, told bdnews24.com that the number of ferries on the route had recently dropped from 12 to seven. There were only six ferries on Tuesday, Gopal said. "It is difficult for six ferries to carry goods vehicles along with the passenger transport," he added. He also blamed the congestion on strong current in water. "A ferry used to take up to 35 minutes for a one-way travel. But it is now taking over one hour." As river waters started ebbing, three sandbanks appeared near the Doulatdia landing station. Gopal said: "The crisis may get worse ahead of Eid if dredging does not start there immediately." A spokesman of the Doulatdia transport workers, Abdul Jalil Sheikh told bdnews24.com that the problem had been ongoing for three months. BITWA manager at Paturia station, Gias, said about 400 vehicles were stranded at the pier. bdnews2
