 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has granted three months' bail to former law minister Moudud Ahmed in two income tax-dodge cases and former public works minister Mirza Abbas in a corruption case. The vacation bench of the court also bailed 'Silver' Selim in an extortion case and froze proceedings of the three cases against Moudud and Mirza Abbas for three months. The Appellate Division on Monday halted for one month High Court bails to former BNP minister Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain in two cases, to AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain's son Akhter Hamid Paban in one case. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Jainul Abedin gave the orders on separate appeals from the government and the Anticorruption Commission for staying the High Court orders. The same court excluded from the cause list the 'faulty' government appeal seeking a freeze on the High Court order that stayed the proceedings of the barge-mounted power plant and Niko corruption cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina's lawyer barrister Shafique Ahmed said the High Court order staying the proceedings of the two cases against the Awami League president remained in force. Moudud, Abbas bails The High Court vacation bench of Justice Mirza Hossein Haider and Justice Mamnun Rahman heard three writ petitions of Moudud and Mirza Abbas before granting them bails.
