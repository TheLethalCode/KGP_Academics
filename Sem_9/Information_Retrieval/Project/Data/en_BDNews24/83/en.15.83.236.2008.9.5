 Reazul Bashar and Mahbub Alam bdnews24.com correspondents Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com) - The website of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has been hacked. The www.rab.gov.bd site was accessed on Friday and the website read: 'Hacked by Shahee_Mirza' RAB director (communications) Commander Moinul Hoque said they had temporarily shut down the website. "The government does not take any step for ICT development but passed a law about anti-cyber crime," the site read. Shahee_Mirza, apparently the hacker said aiming at the government, "You do not know what the cyber security is or how to protect yourself." "Listen, hackers are not criminal. They are 10 times better than your (RAB) experts. We are genius beyond your imagination," the site read. The hacked website does not show any RAB information. RAB medical cell chief Abul Kalam Azad said, "We came to know today that our website has been hacked. We're trying to know who's behind it." He said the hacking would not hamper operations of the elite anticrime force. Commander Haque said, "No website remains full proof. The FBI website was also hacked." bdnews24
