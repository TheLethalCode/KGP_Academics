<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com) A second invitation to the Election Commission's third round talks has reached BNP, after the party's decision not to attend its scheduled dialogue session on Sunday. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told bdnews24.com late Sunday night that the second invitation letter had arrived. "The EC's letter stated that the amendment of the Representation of the People Order had been made with the input of political parties in the first and second round electoral dialogues," Delwar said. "But the EC new voter list ordinance and delimitation of constituencies had not been discussed in those dialogues," the BNP leader quoted the letter as saying. The third round of dialogue was aimed at sharing views with political parties on these and other matters, and the EC was therefore inviting BNP to do the same, said Delwar. Earlier in the day, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters: 'We will wait for BNP. The dialogue isn't going to close without their participation." Office secretary Rizvi Ahmed had delivered a letter in the morning to the CEC's office from Delwar, saying BNP would not take part in the party's scheduled dialogue on Sunday. "The secretary general conveyed the message in a letter addressed to the chief election commissioner and I've just delivered it," said Rizvi to reporters at the EC headquarters. "The secretary general in his letter said the BNP will not join the dialogue on Sunday as this meeting has been convened only to discuss political parties' registration. Sakhawat Hussain, Election Commissioner had said to reporters at the time: "Responding to BNP's letter, we'll issue another letter." bdnews2
