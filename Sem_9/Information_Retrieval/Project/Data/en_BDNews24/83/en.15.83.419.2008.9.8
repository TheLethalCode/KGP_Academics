 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has announced a schedule to meet officials of key ministries as part of its efforts to curb institutional corruption, an ACC official said on Monday. A meeting will be held with land ministry officials in the second week of Sept and with health ministry officials in the third week, ACC director general (administration) colonel Hanif Iqbal told reporters at his office. The ACC's meeting with communications ministry official will be held in the second week of November and with local government division in the third week of the month. "The talks are meant to detect the sources and fields of corruption and to take effective steps to resist. There will be no discussion on any individual," Hanif Iqbal said. He said, "The government officials know it better how corruption originated and spread in the institutions. They must know about the legal and structural weakness that bred corruption." The anticorruption drives will not be successful without direct cooperation of the government employees, he added. bdnew
