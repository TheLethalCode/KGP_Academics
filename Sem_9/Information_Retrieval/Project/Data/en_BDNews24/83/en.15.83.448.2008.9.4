<TEXT>
 LONDON/MOSCOW, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - BP agreed a deal with the oligarch co-owners of TNK-BP on Thursday that overhauls the Russian oil major's management and sets a possible flotation of up to 20 percent of the company, ending months of hostile dispute. BP has agreed to a number of its partners' demands, including the replacement of TNK-BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley with BP's choice of an experienced, Russian-speaking nominee and the appointment of independent directors. The British oil company and its partners said in separate statements they had signed a memorandum of understanding which would be finalized in the coming months. BP shares rose 3.6 percent on news of the deal after the dispute, which threatened BP's interest in the Russian firm, had weighed on BP stock in recent months. "We've retained the shareholder agreement that we agreed five years ago relatively intact," BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told Reuters in a telephone interview. "We think this provides the platform for the next phase in its (TNK-BP's) development and we look forward to continuing to grow," he added. BP had accused its partners of orchestrating a campaign of state harassment against TNK-BP and its officers as a means of securing control of what is Russia's third-largest oil producer. Russia's influential deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin, a close ally of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and chairman of state-controlled Rosneft, was quoted in the Russian statement praising the partners for resolving their differences on their own. "We support TNK-BP's development and believe this company has excellent long-term prospects," Sechin said. The Soviet-born billionaire co-owners, led by Mikhail Fridman, had accused BP of running TNK-BP like a subsidiary and Dudley of favoring the British shareholder. FEWER LEGAL PROBLEMS The dispute, played out in banner copy in Western media, combined with a government attack on a blue-chip steel company and Russia's brief war in Georgia to make Russia one of the world's worst performing markets in the second half of 2008 so far despite booming commodities exports. As the dispute grew increasingly shrill, TNK-BP management faced a host of lawsuits and Dudley fled Russia having failed to renew his visa, saying he was subject to a campaign of harassment. "We hope that the issues that TNK-BP has been dealing with will become less (frequent) as we go forward," Hayward said. The CEO added that two of the four billionaires who own 50 percent of TNK-BP, Viktor Vekselberg and German Kahn, may lose their senior management roles at TNK-BP following the deal. "It's reasonable to expect that one or both of them will leave their positions, but it will be the decision of the new CEO," he said. The agreement "confirms what we have always said: That the dispute was commercial and not due to pressure that foreign investors experience in Russia," said Alexander Branis, a director at Prosperity Capital Management. Branis, whose $4.5 million fund holds a stake in TNK-BP's listed operating unit as one of its top investments, said, "We think this event will let investors focus on Russia's investment case rather than on the noise in the media." Shares in the operating unit, TNK-BP Holding TNBPI.RTS rose 18 percent. BP shares were up 3.71 percent at 525 pence at 6:25 a.m. EDT, outperforming a 1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index. IPO KEY Analysts said the end to the conflict meant TNK-BP, its management paralyzed by infighting and its operations under threat from a mass exodus of foreign staff, should now be free to concentrate on running the business and adding value. Dudley, who will leave by the end of the year, said in a statement from TNK-BP that the company will deliver its best financial results ever this year despite the conflict. "A deal would be good for BP," an analyst said following earlier reports a deal was imminent, adding BP investors had already discounted an almost total loss of its TNK-BP interest. TNK-BP's board, where each side has half the seats, will be restructured. In future, each side will appoint four directors, and three independent directors will hold the balance. "The key point of the potential resolution lies in the IPO proposal, which could increase TNK-BP Holding's free float by 20 percent, making it a substantially more liquid and therefore attractive company," UniCredit Aton analysts said. "A back of the napkin estimate suggests a 10 percent to 21 percent effect on the company's valuation." Many analysts had believed the conflict would end only when a stake in the company was in the hands of a government energy giant such as Gazprom, an instrument of the state's drive to bring Russia's oil wealth under its control
