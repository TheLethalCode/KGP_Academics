 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com) Awami League is looking for more retired military officers to join up with them, an AL leader said Saturday as a group of ex-army officers enlisted in the party. "Awami League is interested to have former army officers in the party so that they can play a vital role in the development of the country," acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said after a group of retired officers officially joined the party on Saturday. "I ask more ex-army officials to join the party," he said. Replying to a query Ashraful told reporters: "We have talked to those who joined today about how they will work for their countrymen." The officers who joined AL, at a ceremony at the house of acting party president Zillur Rahman, include retired majors Khandaker Abdul Hafiz, Hossain Ahmed Khan and Mirza Shamsul Wazed, retired captain Shahed Ullah Chishti and retired air force squadron leader Masrur-ul-Haque. The party's policy makers were faced with queries after they attended an iftar party of the Saudi envoy on Friday alongside Jamaat-e-Islami leaders. Replying to reporters' questions in Saturday, Ashraful said that AL had no problem joining in a religious programme with Jamaat-e-Islami. He stated that "religion and politics should not overlap". "We went to attend a religious programme, an iftar party, at the invitation of the Saudi ambassador." "The chief of Baitul Mokarram mosque was also present there. We say our prayers under his leadership in the mosque." "Won't we say our prayers behind an imam if he is a war criminal?" he asked. The AL has boycotted victory day and independence day celebrations over the past year at Bangabhaban, protesting the invitation of Jamaat-e-Islami who played a controversial role in the war of independence. On whether the party would continue attending religious programmes at the invitation of the embassies of Muslim countries, the AL leader said: "Let the invitation come first, and we'll see what happens later." AL presidium member Amir Hossain AMu said: "We cannot avoid any diplomatic invitation." "If our leader (Sheikh Hasina) during her regime was invited from the Pakistan High Commission, didn't she attend there?" he asked. bdnews
