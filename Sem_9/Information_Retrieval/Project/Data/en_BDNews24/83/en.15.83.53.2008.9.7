 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League's allies have censured the party's attendance of an iftar gathering at the Saudi envoy's residence alongside Jamaat-e-Islami, accusing AL of "breaching an understanding". Workers Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon said war criminals should be boycotted socially and politically. Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told bdnews24.com on Sunday: "The Awami League holds its previous position on the stance of war criminals. We want that war criminals should be tried and barred from contesting in the elections." AL's policymakers faced a barrage of questions after they joined the Jamaat-e-Islami leaders at the iftar party of the Saudi ambassador on Friday. Members of the 14-party alliance said the AL should not attend any religious programme with Jamaat-e-Islami. WPB, Ganatantri Party and Samyabadi Dal (ML) leaders spoke to reporters on Sunday after separate meetings at the house of acting AL president Zillur Rahman ahead of their third round dialogue sessions with the Election Commission. Menon told reporters after the meeting: "We don't want to create any confusion, such incidents give rise to unwanted questions." "The war criminals should be boycotted socially and politically," he said. Pressed on whether war criminals should be boycotted at religious functions, he replied: "We don't want to hurt religious sentiment. But we want to say that war criminals must be boycotted in every sphere." On Sunday's meeting with the AL, he said: "The two parties have agreed on [demands for] announcement of the schedule for national elections immediately, withdrawal of the state of emergency, holding of national elections prior to all other polls and a ban on war criminals from running elections." "The government wants to maintain the present controlled situation. We have discussed how the country can be brought back to the previous track." Ganatantri Party president Nurul Islam told reporters his party agreed with the AL on a number of issues including the priority of national elections. "We will not join any elections prior to parliamentary elections," he said. "The 14-party alliance will resist any attempt to foil the elections," Islam said. Terming the AL's participation at the iftar party with Jamaat leaders "unfortunate", he said: "The AL has breached the alliance decision on Jamaat-e-Islami." Samyabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua said: "Awami League has broken a gentlemen's agreement." "We have an agreement that the 14-party alliance will not join any programme with war criminals, even diplomatic ones," he said. On the photograph published of Zillur Rahman shaking hands with Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, he said: "Jamaat-e-Islami will use the photograph in the upcoming elections." The Awami League was scheduled to hold a formal press briefing after its meetings with the alliance parties, but AL leaders left without speaking to reporters. Ashraful spoke to bdnews24.com briefly when contacted later and said the party would hold its briefing after meetings with other alliance members, including National Awami Party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Gono Azadi League, on Monday. bdnews24.
