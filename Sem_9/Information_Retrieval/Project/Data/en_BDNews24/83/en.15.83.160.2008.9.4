 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  In a move to 'decentralise' the selection process for appointments to private secondary schools and colleges, educationists will have a say over who represents the government on appointment boards. Principals of 19 government colleges will select a representative from the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education for appointment boards of teachers and employees to private colleges as well as alim and fazil madrasas. Of the 19 principals, the principal of Dhaka College will make the selection for six districts under Dhaka division. For secondary school appointees, the office of the district education officer of the concerned area will now have a say on the DSHSE representative to the appointment board. Acting director general of the DSHSE, Prof Khan Habibur Rahman told bdnews24.com Thursday: "The decision has been taken to reduce upsets regarding appointment and to decentralise power." He said that the new decision would come into effect on Sept 15. A circular in this connection was issued Wednesday.
