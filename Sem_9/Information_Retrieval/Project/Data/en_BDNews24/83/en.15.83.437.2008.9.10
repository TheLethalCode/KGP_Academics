<TITLE> Fresh protest looms over Nano car factory </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, Sep 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Farmers threatened on Tuesday to resume protests that blocked construction work on a factory in West Bengal to build Tata Motors' super-cheap Nano car if talks to resolve a dispute over land do not produce results soon. The Nano project in the state has been mired in a land row since the snub-nosed, $2,300 car was unveiled to a rock-star reception in January. Farmers unwilling to give up their land blocked roads and, with backing from the local opposition party, threatened workers. This prompted Tata Motors to suspend work at the factory in Singur last week and scout for alternative sites. The Nano protests reflect a larger standoff between industry and farmers unwilling to give up land in a country where two-thirds of the population depend on farming. Politicisation of farmers' resentment has further complicated the issue. As Tata Motors, India's top vehicle maker, threatened to walk away from West Bengal, the state's communist government and opposition Trinamool Congress began negotiations and formed a committee to resolve the dispute. "We have not given up the protests, we have only suspended our agitation," said Partha Chattopdhayay, a senior leader of the Trinamool Congress, which has halted protests for seven days. After the first meeting of the committee on Tuesday, a member representing the farmers said they wanted land back from the project area. "We have demanded 300 acres," said Rabindranath Bhattacharya, a Trinamool Congress leader. The West Bengal government has agreed for a land-based rehabilitation for the farmers but ruled out major concessions within the Tata Motors site. The factory and its ancillary units were being built on about 1,000 acres (400 ha) of land. About 400 acres, earmarked for ancillary units, is under dispute. Officials say separating the ancillary units from the main plant would upset the project's cost calculations. "The government will maintain the integrated nature of the auto cluster," said the state's industry minister, Nirupam Sen. Analysts believe this could lead to another showdown. The committee will carry out a survey of the disputed project site on Wednesday and meet again to discuss the issue, he said. In Singur, Trinamool workers dismantled temporary camps and stages they had built on roads leading to the factory. The stand-off would undermine production capacity but is unlikely to delay the planned October launch of the Nano, billed as the world's cheapest car, as some units could come from existing plants. Trouble began after the government acquired farmland for the factory last year. The government offered compensation which some farmers rejected, demanding that at least 400 acres be returned. The Nano dispute has also led to calls for speedy reforms of a colonial-era land acquisition act that has tripped up several large industrial projects. Shares in Tata Motors touched a high of 425.50 rupees before ending 0.54 percent down at 420.40 rupees in the Mumbai market.
