<TITLE> India oil min wants higher diesel price for industry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's oil ministry will soon seek cabinet approval to charge higher diesel prices for industrial users and power plants to curb surging demand and rising subsidies, a top government official said on Monday. The ministry is also seeking an additional 25 percent tax on large cars running on diesel, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters on Monday. Diesel consumption in India has been rising sharply because the subsidised fuel is cheaper than fuel oil, luring industrial users. "We are in process of consultation with other ministries and we will soon send a proposal to the cabinet," he said. Vehicle owners have largely been shielded from surging crude prices as state-set fuel rates have been increased moderately. Analysts say India's relatively low fuel prices have contributed to the country's growing oil demand and are a factor in supporting crude prices at elevated levels. India's domestic diesel sales rose 10.3 percent in July from a year ago, but that was a slowdown for Asia's third-largest oil consumer as state firms struggled to meet an 18 percent surge in demand in the previous three months.
