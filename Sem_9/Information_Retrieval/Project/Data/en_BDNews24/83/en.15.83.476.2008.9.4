The hearings of 15 more cases will begin again on Sunday. The commission ordered 11 people on Wednesday to deposit a total of Tk 5.69 crore to state funds, in its forst order. "This is a preliminary order. The final verdict in the cases will be given after the people show proof of payment," Justice Habibur had said.
