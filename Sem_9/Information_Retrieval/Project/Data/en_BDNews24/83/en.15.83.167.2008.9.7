 Mumbai, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's move to extend a trading ban in four commodity futures suggests that the government is still worried about inflation and may wait for further correction in prices, exchange and industry officials said. In a bid to tame racing inflation, India had in May stopped futures trading in soyoil, rubber, potato and chickpea for four months. The suspension was scheduled to lapse on Saturday, but was extended till Nov 30 late on Friday. "The government is worried about inflation. It doesn't want to take any chance since it is heading for elections next year," Harish Galipelli, head of research, Karvy Comtrade Ltd, said. Annual inflation has eased from a peak of 12.63 percent in early August to 12.34 percent later in the month, but is still at its highest levels since the current price series began in the mid-1990s. National elections are due in India before May 2009. The trading suspension may stay unless prices plunge sharply due to new crop arrivals, which will start next month, he said. Arrivals of summer crops like oilseeds and pulses start from October, when prices begin to ease on fresh supplies. Commodity exchange officials such as Unopom Kausik, chief business officer, National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), the country's top agri futures bourse, termed the extension of the ban as "an extremely disappointing decision.". "It's more of a political compulsion and is not going help anybody. Traders will continue to miss a price discovery mechanism," added Kailash Gupta, managing director, National Multi Commodity Exchange (NMCE). "This is a cautious decision," added Rajiv Agarwal, member of the Forward Markets Commission, the commodity market regulator. VOLUMES UNAFFECTED Trading volumes won't be affected as investors have shifted to other commodities during the four-month ban, brokers said. "Despite the extension of suspension, volumes will not be affected as investors have switched to other commodities which are mostly non-inflationary," said Ravi Bhushan, an analyst with ICICI Direct, a top domestic brokerage. India's commodity futures trade has risen 42 percent in the first four and a half months of 2008/09 from a year ago, riding on energy, metal and agri-commodities not linked to inflation. Commodity prices on the exchanges were steady on Saturday as market was anticipating this decision, analysts said. But, the ban may hurt commodity producers and importers. "Futures market was the place where (pulses importer) were hedging their risk. Since this tool is not available, they may slow down imports," said K.C. Bhartiya, president, Pulses Importers Association of India. India is not self-sufficient in pulses and edible oil and imports in bulk quantities to fulfill rising domestic demand.
