 London, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Finance Adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Wednesday said the World Bank should oversee the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) formed to support government initiatives to adopt to climate changes. "Given the magnitude and urgency of interventions for tackling the adverse effects of climate change, I propose the establishment of a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) for harmonised actions to supplement our efforts at implementing the climate change strategy and action plan of Bangladesh," Azizul told the inaugural function of the UK-Bangladesh Climate Change conference. "Given the experience, fiduciary management capacity, and expertise, we feel that the World Bank may be given the responsibility to act as administrator of the MDTF,' the adviser said. The MDTF is aimed at funding for the adaptation and mitigation of the adverse effects of climate change in Bangladesh. The UK was the first country in the world to announce a funds of 75 million, or $133 million, to the MDTF. The funds will be used on measures such as protecting houses, schools and farms against flooding, and introducing new crop strains. Denmark also pledged to contribute to the MDTF and other countries are expected to follow suit. The adviser said he was not in favour of demanding compensation from the developed countries for climate change that caused damages to developing countries. "If we analyse the terminology compensation, there are lot of complexities and legal actions to blame a particular country for climate change," he said. "Is there any meaning of demanding compensation when there is no such research on who polluted to what extent?" Azizul told bdnews24.com. The adviser said there must be researches to assess the contribution of greenhouse gases of a particular country before demanding compensation. The leaders of the LDCs and the developing countries at past climate change negotiations blamed the developed countries for global warming and demanded compensation for the damage caused by the climate change. Many Bangladeshi climate change negotiators in the past raised the issue of realising compensation from the developed countries, whose action caused global warming and climate change. "Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past failures. Let us make a difference by taking concerted actions to face the challenge of climate change,' the adviser said in his statement. bd
