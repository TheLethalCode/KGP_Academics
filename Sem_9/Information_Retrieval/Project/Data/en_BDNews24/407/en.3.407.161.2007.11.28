<TITLE> Germany fears al Qaeda sympathy rising among Turks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany believes it has moved up al Qaeda's target list because of its role in Afghanistan, and is especially worried by signs of radicalisation among its 3 million-strong ethnic Turkish community, a senior official said. Deputy interior minister and former spy chief August Hanning said both trends were highlighted by a failed bomb plot in September that Berlin believes was directed from Pakistan by the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU), an al Qaeda affiliate. "We have the impression from this case that a decision has been taken in Pakistan, at least from the IJU if not at a higher al Qaeda level, to carry out attacks here in Germany," Hanning told Reuters in an interview. Referring to the recent plot and an attempted train bombing in 2006, he said Germany had been fortunate twice and "we hope we'll be lucky a third and a fourth time". His comments showed how Germany, which opposed the Iraq war and once considered itself far less of a target than the United States or Britain, is reassessing its vulnerability. The key factor is its presence in Afghanistan, where some 3,000 of its troops are deployed as part of a NATO-led peacekeeping operation. "From all that we know, Germany is very much seen as a hostile occupying power which is to be fought," said Hanning, 61, a chess-playing intellectual who is one of Europe's most experienced counter-terrorism officials after two years at the interior ministry and seven as head of the BND foreign intelligence agency . THWARTED PLOT In September, German police foiled an alleged plot to bomb unspecified U.S.-linked targets in Germany and arrested three men -- two German converts to Islam and a Turk living in Germany. Another German citizen of Turkish origin was arrested three weeks ago in Turkey, which Hanning called "an important logistical base" in the plot. Officials have said that fuses intended for use in the alleged bombs were brought in from Syria via Turkey. Hanning said radicalisation among members of Germany's big ethnic Turkish community, which grew out of the mass immigration of 'guest workers' in the 1960s, was a disturbing new development. "Previously we were dealing mainly with young Arab Muslims...But now it's proving apparent that ethnic Turks, or (German) citizens of Turkish origin, are playing a really significant role." He said the "normal recruitment path" for militant Islamists was to approach young men in mosques, assess their suitability as 'jihadists', engage them in intensive study of Arabic and the Koran and then send them for training in Pakistan. He said the authorities knew of 14 individuals from Germany who had attended camps in Pakistan, and suspected there were more. Some were now back in Germany but had not been arrested because receiving militant training has yet to be made a crime. Hanning acknowledged security services were "groping in the dark" to discover the true numbers of people going to Pakistan for training, because most travelled via third countries. Unlike al Qaeda's old bases in Afghanistan, which were so large they could be seen in satellite photos, the camps in Pakistan were often temporary structures in inaccessible areas, sometimes linked to madrasa religious schools. Hanning said political upheaval in Pakistan, where President Pervez Musharraf has been struggling to keep his grip on power, was making it harder for the authorities there to keep track of foreign militants. "We don't doubt the goodwill of the Pakistanis, but we can see the possibilities are rather limited at the moment." While Iraq remained a "big magnet" for foreign fighters, it was similarly hard to tell how many were travelling from Europe to join the insurgency there, Hanning admitted. "Today we have no precise overview of tha
