<TITLE> BNP factions cannot be united: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda-appointed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has denied the possibility of unity among the party's two opposing factions. "BNP is united, but some leaders have gone a different route. That will not split the party," Delwar said Sunday, speaking to reporters at his NAM flat for the first time in weeks. He also claimed he was the secretary general as per the party constitution. Delwar questioned the neutrality of the election commission as it had initially invited the opposing Saifur Rahman-led BNP faction to electoral dialogues. He expressed doubt whether the commission would be able to hold a fair election. "The commission has acted illegally. They ignored the constitution and invited the illegal faction for some reason of their own," Delwar said, claiming his faction was the legal one. "They [the opposing faction] entered the party office, led by Hafizuddin, like land grabbers with a police escort. The leaders and workers are not with them." "The activists do not have any relation with that faction. They have only a few leaders." Referring to the country's present economic condition he said: "There is no congruity between price hike and income. Inflation is increasing compared to other countries. The deterioration of the economy is not good for the country." Delwar asked the government to enforce relief operations in the southern regions. He also urged the wavering of agricultural loans in the cyclone-hit areas. He told reporters he was unaware of the 'Khaleda Zia Mukti Parishad' (council for Khaleda Zia's freedom), a group formed by pro-Delwar BNP leader Akhteruzzaman, which claims it will not join the elections without Khaleda Zia. bdn
