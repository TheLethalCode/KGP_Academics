 LONDON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British engineering consultancy WS Atkins reported a forecast-beating 46 percent rise in first-half profit on Tuesday and said its troubled Metronet work is now making money, lifting its shares to six-month highs. Atkins, which reported an exceptional loss of 121 million pounds ($251 million) from the failed Metronet consortium last year, said its work with the consortium would continue at reduced levels. Metronet was forced into administration in July after running up 2 billion pounds of unscheduled costs while renovating nine of London's 12 underground lines. "We are now working directly under a new contract or structure and currently have around 400 staff working directly for Metronet," Finance Director Robert MacLeod told reporters. "The provisions we made at the year end in March was adequate. We don't need to make more provisions." Transport for London, which runs the capital's buses and subway, put in a bid for Metronet last month and plans to break up the remains of its 17 billion pounds contract and invite other engineering firms to bid. Metronet is owned by Atkins, Balfour Beatty, the rail equipment unit of Canada's Bombardier, EDF Energy and Thames Water. STRONGER RESULTS Atkins, Britain's largest engineering consultancy, said profit before tax rose to 42.7 million pounds ($88.4 million) for the six months to Sept. 30, beating analysts' average forecast of 38 million, as revenue rose 11 percent to 633.8 million and operating margin jumped to 6.3 percent from 4.8 percent. The group also revealed a share buyback programme worth 100 million pounds and a 25 percent rise in interim dividend to 7.5 pence per share. The shares were up 5.4 percent to 12.28 pounds by 0950 GMT having earlier risen as much as 8.6 percent to a 6-month high of 12.65 pounds. "We anticipate that the group will make good progress in the rest of the year as our work in hand remains strong with 85 percent of full-year forecast revenue secured," Atkins said in a statement. The firm said Middle East business was particularly strong, with revenues from the region rising by 35 percent, while all divisions showed margin improvements. Atkins, whose work covers a wide range of industries from rail, road, defence and oil & gas, expected further margin improvement as it focuses on cost efficiencies. "Atkins results were ahead of our and the market's expectations driven by strong margin progression combined with 11 percent revenue growth," Cazenove analysts said, upgrading their earnings forecasts by 4 percent for 2008 and 7 percent for 2009. Atkins shares, which outperformed the UK support services sector by around 35 percent over the past six months, trade at 18.6 times estimated earnings, versus the sector average of 13.4, according to Reuters Estimat
