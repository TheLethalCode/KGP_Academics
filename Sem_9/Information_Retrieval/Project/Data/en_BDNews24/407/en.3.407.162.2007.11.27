 Pabna, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  NGO staff demolished a woman's house in Pabna after she defaulted on loan repayments, the affected homeowner told bdnews24.com Nazma Khatun from Udaypur village in Sujanagar now lives in the open. Staffers of nongovernmental organisation Uddipon took away the remnants of her home after pulling it down Sunday. According to allegations, Nazma took Tk 13,000 in loans from the NGO to buy her husband Mohammad Alam a rickshaw but defaulted on a Tk 350 installment. She had already paid back Tk 7,000 in 20 installments, but failed to make the latest repayment after her husband sold the rickshaw and went to Dhaka. Uddipon's Sujanagar branch manager Mujibur Rahman admitted to the demolition of the house but defended the act saying it had been done with Nazma's consent. bdnews2
