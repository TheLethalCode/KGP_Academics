 Beijing, Tue Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has again prodded the United States to oppose a controversial referendum on UN membership by Taiwan and warned Washington to stop arms sales to the island China claims as its own, state media said on Tuesday. The island's independence-leaning president, Chen Shui-bian, plans a referendum next March on whether to seek to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" despite repeated warnings from the United States and China. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has vowed to bring the self-governed democracy of 23 million people back under mainland rule, by force if necessary.

Washington, Taiwan's biggest ally and arms supplier, has drawn fire from Beijing for plans to sell Taiwan a $940 million upgrade to its missile system. "The Chinese side urges the US side ... to stop selling advanced weapons to Taiwan and not to send wrong signals to the Chen Shui-bian administration," Xinhua quoted Yang as saying. Last week, China blocked a long-planned Thanksgiving visit to Hong Kong by the Kitty Hawk, a US aircraft carrier group. Analysts have speculated that displeasure with Washington over the planned weapons system sale was a reason for the action. China later reversed course and said the Kitty Hawk could land, but the ships steamed back to their base in Japan.
