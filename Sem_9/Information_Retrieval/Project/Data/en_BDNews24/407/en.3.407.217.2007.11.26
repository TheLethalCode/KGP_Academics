<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday asked the government and the Election Commission to explain in two weeks why tens of thousands of Urdu-speaking 'Biharis' would not be registered as voters. The 'Biharis', who claim they are stranded Pakistanis, live in many crammed camps across the country. One group wants repatriation to Pakistan while another demands Bangladeshi citizenship and enrolment as voters. They came to the then East Pakistan from Indian state of Bihar during partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Pakistan took in some Biharis but later the process was stalled. Currently about 250,000 such Biharis live in overcrowded camps and they are deprived of government jobs and many other rights Bangladeshis enjoy. A two-member panel of Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and Justice Abu Tarique Monday made the ruling following a writ petition filed by eight Bihari people. In the writ petition, they said most of the people living in 11 Bihari camps across the country were born after independence. The petition claimed the young people were Bangladeshi citizens by birth. Barrister Rafiqul Islam, who stood for Biharis in the court, said Biharis must be enrolled as voters in line with the international human-rights law. He said chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in a June 14 letter to the chief adviser gave his consent to register them as voters. But it did not happen yet, Islam said. bdnews2
