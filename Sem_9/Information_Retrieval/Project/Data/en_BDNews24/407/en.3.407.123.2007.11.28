<TITLE> Savoy prince says not suing Italy for money </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The grandson of Italy's last king wants to make something clear to his unhappy, would-be subjects: he's not suing Italy for the money. Emanuele Filiberto, of the once illustrious House of Savoy, says he is pained by his portrayals in the media as a heartless gold-digger for seeking millions of euros damages against the Italian Republic for his family's exile after World War Two. Italy punished the Savoy heirs with exile for their family's collaboration with fascists, and only lifted the ban in 2002. Born in exile, Emanuele Filiberto says it was a human rights offence and has requested 260 million euros in damages. For the first time, however, he told Reuters he might reconsider that request, and just one euro might be enough to acknowledge that Italy made a mistake. "The money doesn't interest me," said the brown-haired, blue-eyed prince, from his office in Rome late on Tuesday. "I could give up the money and ask for just one euro in damages. Why not? Perhaps I'll do that." Emanuele Filiberto, also known as the prince of Venice and Piemonte, aims to file the lawsuit on behalf of him and his father with the European Court of Human Rights within two weeks. The case has resurrected painful memories for Italians, who still blame his family for signing former Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's race laws. Those led to the murder of thousands of Italian Jews in Nazi death camps. The Savoys fled Rome following the fall of Mussolini, leaving Italy at the mercy of occupying German troops. "I'm not saying today that (fascist-era King) Vittorio Emanuele didn't make mistakes. Yes, he made mistakes," Emanuele Filiberto said. "But what's it got to do with me?" HARSH HOMECOMING Emanuele Filiberto scoffed at a poll showing 90 percent of Italians oppose the lawsuit, but acknowledged another saying 80 percent do -- a grim figure for a man who wants to make Italy his home, and who just bought his first house here. Some politicians suggest the Savoys should be expelled again. Others favour seeking damages from the royal family. "I know that what I've done wasn't something popular. I'm aware (of that)," he said. "But I want to know ... should the faults of great-grandfathers be visited on the great-grandsons?" It's been a harsh homecoming for the House of Savoy in the five years since Italy lifted the exile, begun in a 1946 referendum abolishing the monarchy and creating a republic. Emanuele Filiberto's father, Vittorio Emanuele, was jailed and put under house-arrest briefly last year after being linked to a probe into corruption and prostitution. Failing to find evidence of wrongdoing, Rome prosecutors recommended dropping the case against him this week. "Sincerely, we all were afraid (last year). I didn't come back to Italy for three months," said Emanuele Filiberto, who is married to French actress Clotilde Courau and has two children. "Even today, when I walk down the street, I look behind me to see if there aren't two guys coming to arrest me." The House of Savoy has splintered, and Emanuele Filiberto lamented that some relatives publicly scorned his lawsuit. But if the Savoys are divided, Italians who rarely agree on anything have found unity -- in their disapproval of the case. "The Savoy men thought for a moment they could unite the country by coming out with this nonsense," one reader wrote to La Repubblica newspaper. "Thanks, Savoys."
