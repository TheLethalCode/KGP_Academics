<TITLE> Russia's Kudrin seeks meeting with arrested deputy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin has requested an urgent meeting with his arrested deputy, Sergei Storchak, who is charged with attempting to embezzle $43 million. "I need this meeting and need it urgently. I have asked for such a meeting," Kudrin told a news conference on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting in Moscow. Storchak, a deputy finance minister, is Russia's foreign debt negotiator. He oversees a $148-billion budget stabilisation fund, making him a key player in managing the windfall reaped from the global boom in oil and commodities prices. Some observers see the arrest as an attack on Kudrin, an influential politician who has shaped President Vladimir Putin's economic policy during nearly eight years in office. Russia holds a parliamentary election on Dec. 2 that the United Russia party, for whom Putin is number one on the list of candidates, is poised to win by a landslide. Kudrin said that on the day of his arrest Storchak had been due to address a cabinet meeting and also had documents prepared for a visit to "one of the countries with which we were going to hold bilateral negotiations." "All these documents were confiscated," Kudrin said. "At the moment a delay to my meeting with him could start to have a negative effect on the negotiation process because Storchak possessed up-to-date information." The Russian delegation at a Nov. 17 meeting of finance ministers of the 20 most industrialised and important emerging economies in South Africa planned to hold negotiations over Libya's debt during a stopover en-route to Cape Town. Storchak had been due to fly to South Africa as part of the delegation but was arrested on Nov. 15. Kudrin said he would file a petition seeking Storchak's release and hoped for an answer in several days. Storchak is also charged with forming an "organised group" with two businessmen to try to embezzle budget funds after failing to collect a debt owed by Algeria. Storchak can be held in custody for at least two months. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in jail.
