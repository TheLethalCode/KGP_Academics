 Tokyo, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vietnam hopes to reach a free trade deal with Japan next year, Vietnam's president said on Wednesday.

"I personally think it is very desirable to reach an agreement in the next round of talks taking place next year," Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet said at a news conference during a five-day visit to Japan that started on Sunday.
