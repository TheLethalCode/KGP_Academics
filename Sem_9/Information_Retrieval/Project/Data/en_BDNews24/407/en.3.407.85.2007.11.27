<TITLE> UK beef farmers ask consumers to avert "exodus" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British livestock farmers called on consumers on Tuesday to help raise farm-gate prices in a bid to avert an "exodus" from the lamb and beef sector. Figures from the English Beef and Lamb Executive (EBLEX) show beef farmers lost between 94 pounds ($194.4) and 430 pounds per head of cattle on average in the year to March 2007, against losses of 74 to 425 pounds the year before. "Either prices must rise, or we'll see an exodus from beef and sheep production the like of which we've never seen before," Thomas Binns, Livestock Board Chairman of the National Farmers Union (NFU) in Britain, said in a statement. "The difference between farm-gate prices and retail prices are quite high ... It's not the farmers whinging about price -- they just want a better share of the price," Binns told Reuters. A report by the UK's Competition Commission published last month said supermarkets were neither colluding nor systematically abusing producers and suppliers. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) say supermarkets are the biggest supporters of British farmers with 89 percent of beef and 70 percent of lamb sold sourced from British producers. "Supermarkets ... continue to be the biggest customer and the biggest supporter for UK agriculture," Richard Dodd, spokesman for the BRC told Reuters. But many farmers blame retailers for keeping farm-gate prices low. Alistair Mackintosh, who runs a farm of 125 suckler cows and 1,200 ewes in Cumbria in northern England, said the overriding factor behind his poor profitability was retailers' ability to keep meat prices low. "There has to be some price increase passed back to the farmer," Mackintosh said, adding that some farms would move from red meat production into energy crops unless more money from supermarket sales reached the producer. Mackintosh said he spent 75 pounds on feed per head of cattle and more went on preparing his animals for slaughter than he earned from selling them at the farm-gate. "There's no reason for us to produce the product ... The issue now is where to get that shortfall from," he said.
