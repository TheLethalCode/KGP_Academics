 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The inter-club footballer transfers for the Senior Division Football League will be held November 27-30 at the Bangladesh Football Federation. Some 40 players, who had played three or fewer matches in the inaugural B. League, have been allowed to play the Senior Division League, said a Dhaka Metropolis Football League Committee (DMFLC) press release Monday. No foreign player, for the first time in history of the senior division league, will be allowed to play. "To give the local players more exposure, we have decided to keep foreign footballers away from the league," DMFLC chairman Mozammel Haq Mukta told bdnews24.com. "Besides, it is too tough to handle the foreign players, who frequently bring allegations again the clubs to the FIFA. This has prompted us to keep them away," said Mukta. A total of 13 clubs will play the senior division football league, not held last season. The clubs are: Arambagh KC, Badda Jagarani Sangsad, Victoria SC, Dhaka Wanderers Club, Youngmen's Club, Dipali Jubo Sangsad, Mohakhali Ekadosh, Wari Club, Agrani Bank SC, Purbachal Parisad, City Club, Jatrabari KC and Sunrise SC. bdn
