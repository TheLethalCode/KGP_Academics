 ALMATY, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe's main human rights and security watchdog will reject Kazakhstan's 2009 chairmanship bid this week in a decision likely to add fuel to a conflict between Russia and the West, diplomats and analysts said on Tuesday. At an annual meeting in Madrid this week, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will instead offer Kazakhstan a face-saving compromise package under which the ex-Soviet state would take over as chairman in 2010 or 2011. Diplomats said Kazakhstan was ready to embrace the deal. But the rejection was likely to anger Russia which has long accused the 56-nation OSCE of bias towards the ex-Soviet world. "It's unclear whether Russia would support the compromise decision," said an OSCE diplomat on condition of anonymity. "They (Russians) may wish to turn up the temperature a bit as we have seen in the last few days." The OSCE meeting in Madrid comes just days before a parliamentary election in Russia which the OSCE has refused to monitor citing Moscow's efforts to obstruct its work. President Vladimir Putin accused the United States on Monday of trying to use the OSCE to undermine the Sunday election. "Nobody likes to lose. I think that will inevitably make things more difficult with some states," Spencer Oliver, Secretary General of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, said in Moscow, asked about a possible Russian reaction. Washington and Britain have been against Kazakhstan's early chairmanship due to concerns about its commitment to democracy. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev has been tightening his grip over Kazakhstan, seizing the right to remain in office for life and holding a snap parliamentary election in August which handed his political party all seats. The OSCE itself criticised that election as flawed. Two opposition leaders have been murdered in Kazakhstan in murky circumstances since 2005 when Nazarbayev, in power since 1989, was re-elected with 91 percent of the vote. "Kazakhstan's chances have melted away over past months," said Eduard Poletayev, an independent analyst in Almaty. But the face-saving deal, due to be announced on Friday, is designed to highlight the West's commitment to maintain warm relations with Kazakhstan, an emerging new source of oil and gas for Europe. "The issue right now is whether the OSCE would put forward any conditions and what the wording (of the compromise deal) would be," said Oraz Zhandosov, a Kazakh opposition leader. "Kazakhstan does not want any condition
