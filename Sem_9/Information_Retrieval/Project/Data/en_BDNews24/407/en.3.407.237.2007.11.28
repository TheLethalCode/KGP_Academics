 MANILA, Wed Nov 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has sent three vessels and a helicopter to pick up more than 700 fishermen left stranded by a typhoon for more than 10 days on and around islands in the South China Sea, Chinese state media said on Wednesday. Typhoon Hagibis, which has weakened to a tropical depression, killed 14 people in the Philippines last week, went west toward Vietnam and then made a dramatic U-turn over the South China Sea before returning to the Philippines.

At least 12 people had previously been reported killed in drownings, landslides and electrocutions caused by Mitag. Radio reports said that Hagibis had killed at least four children on Palawan on its return through the Philippines. Disaster officials have yet to confirm the deaths. Storms regularly batter the Philippines. Last year, Typhoon Durian killed 1,200 people and left 120,000 homeless when it crashed through Bicol in Decemb
