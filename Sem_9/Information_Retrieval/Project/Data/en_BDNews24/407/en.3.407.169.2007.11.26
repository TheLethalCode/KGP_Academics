<TEXT>
 BARGUNA, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  No government or private aid operations were underway in Agapadma as of Sunday, because the village in the southern district of Barguna is hard to reach. Sujit Haldar, a student of class nine, was among those who were exposed to the elements and were living in the open in the village, 12 kilometres from Barguna town. He said the cyclone utterly devastated his village and urged the bdnews24.com correspondents to visit his village and see the damage for themselves. Faruk Khan from the same village said: "Nobody comes to see our distress. The roads are ruined; they cannot get to us. Nobody has helped us since the disaster." Two foreign journalists who agreed to go to the village backed off after seeing the damaged road. The only unpaved road that leads to Agapadma village has been swept away in places by the storm. The water has not receded in many places on the road. Shialia High School, which is totally damaged, can be seen at the entrance of the village. Sujit used to study here. He said about 400 families of the village have nothing to eat. "Relief has been distributed at Babuganj bazaar, four kilometres away, three times in the last 10 days." "But aid distribution ended before the villagers could get there. Some of the lucky families managed to get 3kg of rice each. Others came back with nothing," he said. Local schoolteacher Uttam Kumar Hawladar alleged that the UP chairman was not giving aid to the village because it is a Hindu majority place. "Chairman Sultan Mahmud has not come to our village until now. But he is distributing relief in his own village, Kumirmara," he said. Eight people have been reported dead from the village. Livestock and paddy fields were totally ruined. The cyclone destroyed almost every house in the village. Villagers said that there are no cyclone shelters near-by, the nearest was four kilometres away in Sholatola, which is why most of them were at their homes on the night of the storm. Later when the tidal waves came, the villagers climbed tall trees to save their lives. "On the night Sidr struck, 32 people were saved as they all climbed onto a strong tree," Uttam said. Shubash Hawladar, a better-off villager, said that 200 acres of paddy field were damaged. "The only source of drinking water in this village, a pond, is contaminated by trash," he said. "Waterborne diseases like diarrhoea have already broken out." bdnews24.com/a
