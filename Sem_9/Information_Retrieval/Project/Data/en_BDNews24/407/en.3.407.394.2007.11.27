 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com) - Former star booters Tuesday urged the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) to hold a discussion on the new constitution for district and divisional football associations (DFA) before their elections. The BFF is allegedly going to establish football associations in all districts and divisions in line with the FIFA guidelines without informing the general councilors officially. The move entered a stalemate after the FIFA had directed the BFF to keep the government officials away from the DFA committees. "We believe it is not possible to run the country's football without government assistance, and FIFA and AFC were not made properly aware of it," Sheikh Mohammad Aslam read out a written statement at a press conference at the National Sports Council conference room Tuesday. "We, however, are not against DFAs in line with the FIFA guidelines," Aslam said, "But, we want to get help from the government until football gains its own strength." "It would not be a problem to form the DFAs if the BFF were a self-dependent organisation having its own playgrounds," said former defender Kaiser Hamid urging the BFF to let FIFI and AFC know about the government assistance factor in the country's context. Badal Roy blamed a few BFF officials for keeping the general councilors in the dark about the DFA in their own interest. "It is not possible to amend the BFF constitution without letting its councilors know and I can't understand what's the problem to inform the councilor about the DFA," said Roy. Former striker Salam Murshidi said, "The BFF has totally failed over the past five years and the members of the BFF only traveled overseas without rolling the football onto field." National awardees Golam Sarwar Tipu said, "We want to see football in the field." Former national footballers Khurshid Babul, Rummon Bin Walid Sabbir, Shafiqul Islam Manik, Sattajit Das Rupu and Imtiaz Ahmed Nokib were, among others present.
