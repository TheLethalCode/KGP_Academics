 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday halted two cases brought by the Anticorruption Commission against former prime minister Khaleda Zia's parliamentary affairs adviser Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and former BNP MP Salahuddin Ahmed. The bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury made the order following two separate writ petitions filed by the accused. The HC asked the ACC and the government to explain why the cases should not be declared illegal. The cases against the BNP leaders allege that they concealed information about their property in wealth statements submitted to the commission. According to details of a case, Chowdhury failed to include two cars worth Tk 1.17 crore in his wealth statement. Joint forces arrested Chowdhury on Feb 4, and the ACC filed the case with Ramna Police Station on June 13. Chowdhury's petition to the High Court contended that the case had not been disposed of within the time allowed by law. Salahuddin Ahmed allegedly concealed information regarding property worth Tk 2.81 crore in his wealth statement, submitted on Feb 25. The ACC filed a graft case against Ahmed with Shyampur Police Station on April 11. Ahmed also filed a writ petition with the High Court claiming the case had not been settled within the 90 days demanded by law. bdnew
