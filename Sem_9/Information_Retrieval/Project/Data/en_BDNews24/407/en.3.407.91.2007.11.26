<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England striker Jermain Defoe missed a late penalty but Tottenham Hotspur's unbeaten run under new coach Juande Ramos remained intact after a 1-1 draw at West Ham United on Sunday. Tottenham substitute Defoe wasted a glorious chance to win it in stoppage time when his penalty was saved by Robert Green after he had been bundled over by Lucas Neill. Carlton Cole tapped West Ham in front after 20 minutes from Nolberto Solano's low cross following a mistake from Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul. Tottenham should have been awarded a penalty five minutes before the break when striker Robbie Keane was caught by the leg of keeper Green after he had dinked the ball over his head. The visitors equalised on 67 minutes when Green failed to deal with Jermaine Jenas's inswinging free kick and defender Michael Dawson glanced his header in off the crossbar. West Ham had the better chances to snatch victory with substitute Dean Ashton, back after a knee injury, forcing one great save from Paul Robinson while Jenas cleared a George McCartney header off the line. West Ham remain 10th in the standings with 19 points while Tottenham, with just two league wins all season, are just two points above the relegation zone in 14th. In a late kickoff Blackburn Rovers twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at Fulham where all the goals came after the break. Danny Murphy slotted home from the penalty spot after 51 minutes but Rovers were level six minutes later when Brett Emerton fired a shot past Anti Niemi at the back post. Diomansy Kamara restored Fulham's lead just past the hour from a Simon Davies cross but the hosts could not hang on, conceding a second equaliser when Stephen Warnock struck from close range. Blackburn, who could have gone seventh with a victory, remain ninth in the table, with Fulham edging up to 12th. Arsenal moved three points clear at the top on Saturday with a 2-0 home defeat of Wigan Athletic while champions Manchester United lost 1-0 at Bolton Wanderers
