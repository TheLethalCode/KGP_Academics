 Kabul, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomb targeting a foreign military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul killed two civilians on Tuesday, a senior police official said. Several people were also wounded by the blast in central Kabul outside a Defence Ministry building close to the British, Canadian and Pakistani embassies. Three white armored Toyota Land Cruisers of the type used by foreign forces and diplomatic staff were damaged by the blast which shattered windows across a wide area. Wreckage burned in a meter-wide crater in the road. Little remained of the attacker's car except the smoldering engine some 10 meters (yards) away. The blackened body of an Afghan civilian lay nearby covered with a prayer rug. Another Afghan, a security guard, was also killed by the explosion, a senior police official said. US military officers at the site said foreign troops suffered minor injuries, but none had been killed. The hardline Islamist Taliban have killed at least 200 civilians in around 140 suicide bombs this year in their campaign to overthrow the pro-Western Afghan government and eject the 50,000 foreign troops from the country. Violence has surged in Afghanistan this year with more clashes, roadside bombs, suicide attacks and casualties as compared to 2006. bd
