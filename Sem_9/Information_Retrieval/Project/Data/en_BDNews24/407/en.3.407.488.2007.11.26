 NEW DELHI, Nov 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik added injury to his disappointment of losing the first test against India on Monday after he twisted his ankle during a game of soccer. "He just got his ankle twisted playing football after the match," the team's media manager Ehsan Malik told Reuters. "He has been taken to the doctor to know the extent of the injury." India won the first test by six wickets on Monday morning, taking the lead in the three-test series. Any serious injury to Malik would add to the woes of Pakistan after fast bowler Umar Gul missed the Delhi test due to back injury. The second test starts in Kolkata on Friday
