<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Nov 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There is increasing concern among Australia's cricketers about their planned tour of Pakistan next year. The Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) said they were worried about security arrangements in Pakistan because of the political upheaval since the introduction of emergency rule. ACA president Darren Lehmann told reporters on Monday the tour should be cancelled, or moved to a neutral venue, if there was any risk to player safety. "If there's any risk at all then I'm presuming the tour might not go ahead," Lehmann said. "But if security say it's fine then we'll be going." Australia are due to tour Pakistan next March but Lehmann said the ACA and Cricket Australia were planning to visit the country in January to determine whether it was safe enough. Lehmann said they would present their findings to the players who would make the final decision. "We put everything on the table for them and then it's a group decision from there," Lehmann said. "Pretty much they're happy to go with the ACA and Cricket Australia what we recommend and that'll be a joint discussion along the way so if we say 'Look we think it's safe to go', they'll go.
