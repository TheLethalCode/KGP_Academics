<TEXT>
 BARGUNA, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Khajur Tola is only six kilometres from Barguna town and yet this village, ravaged by the Nov 15 tropical Cyclone Sidr, is yet to get enough relief. bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib did not find any sign of relief operations Monday morning during a visit to the coastal village. Khajur Tola bears yet another testimony to how the storm twinned with violent tidal surges devastated the region. The tiny village is basically a shoala sandbarunder Gourichonna union. All 220 families of the village faced the brute wrath of the storm. During a walk through the village Monday, it was found that the hungry villagers were angered by a lack of relief. Many waited through Monday morning hoping for something to eat. Disturbed, they expressed their grievances. Still, they waited after assurance that something would reach them by noon. Mohammad Abdul Matin, 50, is one of thema carpenter now homeless. Signs of hunger and despair were writ large on his face. "The navy had given me five kilograms of rice three days ago. Nobody came to me after that," Matin told bdnews24.com. Now Matin has many foes apart from the nature's fury and its leftover. He said he does not stay home at night, if somebody calls it really a home, to dodge the NGO workers who can confront him anytime for unpaid instalments against loans. "I had taken Tk 6,000 from ASA (Association for Social Advancement). I have repaid only 15 instalments. They did not come Tuesday. I thought they wouldn't come next Tuesday. But someone was saying they will come for money again," Matin said. He said he had taken another Tk 10,000 from Islami Bank Bangladesh for rearing goats. He has paid only 28 installments out of 46. "That storm has taken everything from me. I have nothing," Matin said. Another villager, 30-year-old Shahida, was a small village trader before the storm struck the village. "Everything has been washed away. I have nothing," she said, adding that she got only two kilograms of rice three days ago. She said she did not see the chairman of the union in the past 11 days. Upazila nirbahi officer Mohamamd Rabiuzzaman said the villagers gathered in front of his office in the morning for relief. Later his office informed the hungry survivors that they would get five kilograms of rice each at noon. "Assured, they left the place," Rabiuzzman said. bdnews24.com/an
