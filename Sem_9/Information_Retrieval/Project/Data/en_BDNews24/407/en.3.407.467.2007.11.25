<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission sought political parties' help in voter registration with photos for the first time. Concluding the EC-CPB dialogue on electoral reforms Sunday, the Chief Election Commissioner told the 10-member Communist Party of Bangladesh delegation: "Please ask your workers to help the EC now conducting voter registration in Dhaka city. It's a complex job." Meanwhile, the Communist Party of Bangladesh has added its voice to those demanding a bar on known war criminals from taking part in the upcoming elections. War criminals and anti-liberation elements must be barred from participating in the national elections, CPB chairman Manjurul Ahsan Khan said at the meeting. CPB secretary general Mujahidul Islam Selim told reporters after the dialogue: "The constitution says no discrimination can be allowed in the name of religion or caste. But Jama'at-e-Islami has been practicing discrimination in the name of Islam since its inception." "Besides, they lost any eligibility whatsoever to be registered with the EC for the elections due to the black role they played in 1971. Moreover, the draft EC proposal also bars them from all considerations in this regard." Welcoming the CPB delegation, Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said: "The media has been questioning us lately why we didn't call both BNP factions to the EC dialogue." "We're refraining from meeting all the factions of a party deliberately, even if they are ready and eager to take part in the process." bdnews24.
