<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria took four wickets to restrict India to a 45-run first-innings lead on day three of the first test on Saturday. India were bowled out for 276, leaving Vangipurappu Laxman undefeated on 72, as the home team failed to drive home their advantage after dismissing Pakistan for 231. Pakistan openers Salman Butt and Yasir Hameed, both on 13, began confidently to guide the touring side to 26 without loss at lunch. Kaneria ran through the tail, claiming three wickets in 15 deliveries as the last four Indian wickets tumbled for 14 runs, ending the innings halfway through the session. The bowler returned four for 59 with debutant left-arm paceman Sohail Tanvir claiming three for 83, rewarded for producing sharp movement from an awkward action. Laxman took his seventh-wicket partnership with Anil Kumble to 54 runs before Kaneria made the breakthrough, forcing the rival skipper to edge a sharp leg break to Younis Khan at first slip for 24 runs. The 22-year-old Tanvir bowled Harbhajan Singh round his legs for one in the next over before Kaneria removed the last two batsmen Zaheer Khan (9) and Munaf Patel (0) with successive deliveries. Khan smashed Kaneria over long on for six but could only mis-hit the next flighted delivery to be caught by a running Shoaib Akhtar at mid off. Patel fell lbw first ball. Pacemen Shoaib and Tanvir had led Pakistan's fightback by triggering a top-order batting collapse on the second afternoon before Laxman added 115 runs for the sixth wicket with Mahendra Dhoni (57). Laxman, 33, who completed his 30th test fifty, glided Shoaib through the slips for his only four in the morning before running out of partners. He hit eight fours in his 135-ball knock spanning over four hours. The last two tests will be played in Kolkata and Bangalore
