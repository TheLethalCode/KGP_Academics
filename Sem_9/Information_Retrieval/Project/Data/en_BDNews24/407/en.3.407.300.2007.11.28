 CAMP BUCCA, Iraq, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The commander of US prison camps in Iraq said he wants to cut the number of Iraqis in his custody by around two thirds by the end of 2008 as part of a campaign to quell the insurgency. Most of the more than 25,000 detainees held by US forces are Sunni Arabs accused of involvement in violence against the Shi'ite-led government and American troops. Sunni Arab leaders say many are innocent and held without charge. The issue of detainees in both US and Iraqi jails is one of the most sensitive in the country, especially as detentions have spiked during stepped-up military operations this year. Major-General Douglas Stone, head of US detention facilities in Iraq, said on Tuesday he had given a proposal to the US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, to sharply cut the detainee population in US custody. "We want to get on a glide path to get (numbers) down by the end of next year," Stone told Reuters at Camp Bucca in southern Iraq, the US military's largest detention camp in the country. "We are looking at a number that is in the sub-10,000 or 8,000 level for real difficult, challenged guys. The rest of them we think we can work through and get out." The fate of Iraqi detainees has been a flashpoint since US jailors were pictured abusing naked detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. Those pictures came to light in 2004. Critics say only a small proportion of those held are ever prosecuted and convicted. The US military contends those still in custody are there because they pose a security risk. A detainee's case is reviewed every six months. Stone said one issue was that while he was freeing around 45 people a day, between 40 to 60 new detainees had been coming in each day. That reflects a major security crackdown launched in February with the help of 30,000 extra American troops. Stone said he believed the number of detainees in the US military's two facilities -- the other is Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- was around 17,000 when the offensive began. He said he was "very close to a crossover point" where the number being detained equalled the number going out. COMFORT LEVEL "What we want to do is get more progressive and aggressive and take those guys that we've got, that we feel comfortable with ... and start letting them out," Stone said during a tour of Bucca, which sprawls over 400 acres (162 hectares) of desert not far from the border with Kuwait. The camp is surrounded by razor wire-topped fences. Inside, detainees wear yellow prison garb and live in tents or cabins. Since taking over the U.S. military's detention camps in May, Stone said he had overhauled the doctrine dealing with detainees, introducing schooling programmes, job training and religious instruction with moderate imams. Prior to that, little effort had been made to engage what he called the counter-insurgency warfare going on inside the camps. One initiative has been to put detainees considered extreme in separate quarters, to reduce their influence on others. "It's the first time that culturally centric and counter insurgent understood concepts have been employed in detention. Everything we are doing has been brand new," Stone said. He said a detainee's mindset when he was freed was critical. "If they are positive when they leave, you are either level or maybe moderately positive," said Stone, adding he would not free anyone he thought would carry out attacks. "If they are negative, then you have continued to fuel the potential for insurgent activ
