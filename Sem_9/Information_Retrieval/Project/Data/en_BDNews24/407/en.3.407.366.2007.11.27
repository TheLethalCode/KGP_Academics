 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday said the government had no immediate plans to raise oil prices. He said at a discussion meeting in the city that readjustments in domestic oil prices were inevitable but ruled out a hike while the country was facing a crisis. "The government, on the contrary, is thinking about how more subsidies to the sector could benefit farmers," Azizul said at a discussion on 'Price hike of oil in the international market'. The Media Foundation for Trade and Development and the Global Bangla Foundation co-organised the discussion. The adviser said the economy was under pressure because of soaring oil prices in the international market. He said state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation was counting growing losses because of surging global oil prices. The adviser said the country needed alternative fuel to ease the pressure on the economy. Hua Du, the top Asian Development Bank official in Dhaka, said Bangladesh needed to re-price oil for domestic consumption. Otherwise, she said, the economy would face a serious crisis. She, however, said the government could consider an increase in oil subsidies so that poor people benefited. bdnews24
