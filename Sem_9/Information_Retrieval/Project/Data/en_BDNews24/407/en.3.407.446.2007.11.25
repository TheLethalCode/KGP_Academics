 MONGLA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Fishing boats are being thrust into operation in the Sundarbans and other coastal areas to transport desperately needed relief to the communities devastated by Cyclone Sidr. In addition to rice, biscuits and medicines for the survivors, white shrouds and wooden spades are urgently needed to bury the many dead and stave off the spread of diseases. At least 200 bodies were recovered from the Sundarbans' mazelike canal system and coastal belt by Nov 22, although many more fatalities remain a possibility in the notoriously impenetrable terrain. The southeastern region of the world's largest mangrove forest suffered severe damage on the night of Nov 15 although a full assessment of the damage to the World Heritage Site's unique eco-system is yet to be made. "I have ordered the relief boats to carry burial shrouds and spades so we can bury the dead with dignity," said executive magistrate ASM Shahedul Islam. Islam, who has been supervising the relief and rescue operations in the Dublar Char area, added: "I myself have buried about 15 bodies." Islam declined to say why so many fishermen had lost their lives given the weather office had raised great danger signal number 10 for the Mongla port area. "I must submit my report to the government before I can answer questions like that," said Islam. Many locals, however, allege that fishing boat owners were reluctant to allow their workers to seek shelter on the mainland. Another reason is that the five cyclone centres could not accommodate the hundreds of thousands working in the area. Some workers in the shoals say their employers had assured them that there would be no casualties, and that the situation was not that serious. The Dublar Char region consists of up to nine small sand-islands in an area of about 80 square kilometres on the southwestern coast of the Bay of Bengal. In addition to the five cyclone centres, there is a lighthouse operated by the forest department, according to which each cyclone centre can accommodate a maximum of 1,000 people. Local fishermen say employers in the Dublar Char fishing hub, known locally as Bhaddar, mainly operate in the peak season between November and March, and generally hire workers on a contractual basis. The most common arrangement is for the owners of fishing boats and processing areas to pay their workers wages in advance. Any further wages are usually only paid on completion of the contract. Workers are rarely permitted home leave once they start a contract and many report extremely harsh conditions and long hours. As a result, many workers try to flee work or end their contracts, even with the threat of a severe beating hanging over their heads if they are caught. "We have to stay here regardless of the disasters that come. We will never be allowed to go home, even when a cyclone comes. My family still doesn't know I survived the storm," said Helal, who works in the shoal area. Another survivor, Sabuj, started work as a fisherman in the Bay on a contract of Tk 17,000. "I appealed several times to my employer to let me go home. Even when I offered to pay for the fuel, he still refused," said Sabuj, who was still clearly traumatised by the impact of the cyclone. Saber Hossain, who employs over 200 workers in the Dublar Char area, was reluctant to talk. "None of my workers died. I forced many of them to go to cyclone centres," Saber claimed. Islam, during a relief operation on Nov 22, blasted Saber: "Be fair now. Don't continue this practice of slavery any more." Kausar Alam, commanding officer of the Turag, a Bangladesh Navy ship which is supporting the civil administration's relief operations in the Dublar Char area, told bdnews24.com that a lack of awareness on weather signals and the constant fear workers had of losing their possessions discourage many fishermen from seeking safe shelter. "Nevertheless, the death toll could have been minimised if there was an adequate number of cyclone centres in the area," said Alam. Islam agrees. "People living in the char need multipurpose cyclone shelter stations. Their number should also be increased given the number of people who stay here during the fishing and tourism seasons." bdnew
