 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission has distributed 7.37 lakh voter forms in Dhaka city in six days to Monday, a senior election official said. Deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfor Rahman Monday told bdnews24.com that enumerators started collecting information about voters in the city on Nov 20 going door to door and would continue until Nov 30. Photographing and fingerprinting voters will begin on Dec 1. Lutfor said the enumerators had been asked to continue work at night as most of the voters were not available home at daytime, adding that work went on Friday and Saturday. On what if anybody failed to collect voter form during the stipulated time, Lutfor said: "They can be voters by filling out forms at voter registration centres. It is a continuous process. I hope nobody will be left out." bdne
