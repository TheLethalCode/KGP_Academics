<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Representatives of seven BIMSTEC countries met in Dhaka Tuesday to work out strategies for visa exemption facilities to businessmen in the region. This is the third such meeting on immigration matters to determine the policies on providing special visa exemption stamps for the business community. Delegations from BIMSTEC members Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand had earlier met in Kathmandu on the same issue. "We have been trying to reach a consensus on providing visa exemptions for businessmen of BIMSTEC countries. We have to determine the criteria of the recipient, and the nature and duration of the visa exemption facilities," home secretary Md Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com after the meeting. The eighth meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in 2005 in Dhaka had authorised a technical committee to prepare guidelines for such visa exemptions within the region. If the visa exemption is approved, businessmen of the seven member countries will be granted visa exemption stamps in their passports. The main goal of the visa exemption programme is to promote business and tourism among the BIMSTEC countries. "If the technical committee finalises the guidelines, the ministerial meeting of BIMSTEC, scheduled for sometime in February next year in New Delhi, will approve the visa exemption policy," Mujibur Rahman, joint secretary to the home ministry, and the newly elected chair of the technical committee, told bdnews24.com. bdnews
