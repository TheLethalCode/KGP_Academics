 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Former adviser to the caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan has asked the government to secure urgently needed food aid from donors as soon as possible to prevent further loss of life in the wake of cyclone Sidr. In an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com Saturday, Khan, also head of the Regulatory Reforms Commission, said: "We don't posses enough resources to import food. Besides, it takes time to complete the process of importing foodstuffs, including opening letters of credit." "We need a huge amount of food to keep the millions of helpless people alive. The government should therefore seek emergency food aid from donors." "Food is more important than money right now. It would take time to plan how the money is to be spent, whereas food would reach the people quickly," Khan said. Khan said the country was already experiencing a food crisis, which is being further compounded by the extensive damage done to the aman paddy crop. "There would be problems if food was imported through normal channels to meet the challenge. We don't have time for the import process," said the former adviser. "Besides, the price of food in the international market is very high now. I'm not saying we don't need money; rehabilitation in affected areas always needs money, but food is more important now," he added. The former adviser stressed the importance of temporarily postponing the collection of loan repayment to farmers in cyclone affected areas. He also called for new loans to be provided to businessmen while outstanding loans are put on hold. "The government and Bangladesh Bank must strictly monitor the situation so that old loans do not bar people from getting of new ones." "This means farmers who have not repaid old loans will have access to new agricultural loans," said Khan. The former adviser said it was unlikely that the banks would accept a total waiver on loans and interest payments. "Experience says that harms the banks, nevertheless we must emphasis the importance of farmers getting access to loans," he said. Khan said banks would serve their own interests best if they provided businessmen additional loans which would enable them to clear outstanding debts more quickly. "It would be better if the central bank determines a guideline for the process," Khan said. bdnews
