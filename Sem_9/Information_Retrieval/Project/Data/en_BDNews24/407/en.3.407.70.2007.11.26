<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Grameen Bank has halted loan repayment from Sidr-affected clients until June 30, 2008 and said it would extend the grace period if necessary. Bank Managing Director and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus told bdnews24.com Sunday that Grameen Bank had formulated a post-Sidr policy that would include a grace period and new financial products for borrowers affected by the cyclone. Yunus said the government should make short-term and long-term aid plans taking into account cyclone survivors' rehabilitation and employment needs. "In order to recover agricultural losses in affected areas, special measures should be taken." The bank's post cyclone policy declared loans up to the day of the cyclone (Nov 15) interest free. It decided to release emergency house rebuilding loans. The bank's new leasing initiative for affected areas included interest free loans for house rebuilding, easy loans and education loans for diploma courses. The worst affected will be able to borrow a maximum of Tk 10,000 to rebuild their homes. Slightly better off clients may borrow up to Tk 5,000 and the least affected can take Tk 2,500 loans to rebuild their houses. All borrowers will get another Tk 1,000 for a sanitary latrine. Repayment will start six months after getting the loan and loan tenure will vary with each multiple of Tk 1,000 borrowed. The installment amount for the first year has been fixed at Tk 20 and will likely increase from the following year. Loans to replace village phones lost during the cyclone will also be offered. The bank said it had decided to pay SSC registration or equivalent examinations fees to some students in donations. bdnews24.com/a
