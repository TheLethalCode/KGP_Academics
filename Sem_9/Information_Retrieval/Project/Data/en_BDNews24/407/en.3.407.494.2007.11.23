 BERLIN, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juergen Klinsmann would be an ideal manager for England because he would not be afraid to shake things up and knows how to rebuild a humiliated soccer power, Franz Beckenbauer said on Friday. Beckenbauer, captain and coach of German teams that won the World Cup in 1974 and 1990, said he was astonished that a team with such great players as Frank Lampard, Steve Gerrard and David Beckham had done so poorly. "Who can lead the boys with the three lions out of their coma?" Beckenbauer wrote in his Bild newspaper column. "One name comes immediately to mind. Juergen Klinsmann. The England job would be ideal for him and he would be ideal for England." Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's 24-strong executive committee, said England, who failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals, were in a similarly dire situation to Germany when they were eliminated at Euro 2000 in the first round. Klinsmann took charge of Germany after they were again humiliated at Euro 2004 with a first-round exit. He revamped and modernised the German FA (DFB), leading Germany to a surprising third place at the 2006 World Cup. "Juergen is a man with a clear vision and knows how to implement that vision even against resistance," Beckenbauer said. "I could well imagine England getting a fresh start with him. "He'd have three years until the 2010 World Cup to form a new team and he wouldn't have to worry about old baggage. He speaks the language, has a great reputation there thanks to his time at Tottenham and was even footballer of the year.
