 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan under the banner of Brothers Union accorded a farewell reception to outgoing national football coach Syed Nayeemuddin at a city hotel Sunday. "It is common that a footballer or a coach hangs up his boots in a distinctive way, but we can't give them their due honour as some of us suffer from inferiority complex," said Sultan. "It should have been staged in a well organised way at the BFF House, but any way it was not possible because of many reasons and I requested the coach not to feel anything," said the BFF boss, who praised Nayeemuddin for his contribution to Bangladesh football. The BFF in Octoner terminated the five-moth contract with Nayeemuddin two months ahead, citing the deferment of the South Asian Football Championship and the shortage of fund. The Swadhin Bangla Football team's captain Jakaria Pintu, FIFA security officer Salman Al Namsan, former footballers Golam Sarwar Tipu, Badal Roy, Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, Brothers Union general secretary Mijanuddin Ahmed, its manager Amer Khan, Victoria SC general secretary Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, national captain Hasan Al Mamun and national booter Parvez Babu attended the farewell reception, but no BFF official except Sultan was found present. Explaining the reason for terminating the contract, Sultan said that they had no problem spending money after the coach, but they had a great problem providing at least Tk 20 lakh per month for the camp. "All of us are not of the same mentality and I sometime agree with the general opinion despite having difference," Sultan said, "I would like to see Nayeemuddin again in Bangladesh and I would recommend the next committee to bring the Indian coach back." "It is a great occasion for me and I am happy to receive such an honour," said Nayeemuddin adding that he tried to boost the players' mental makeup during his short stint. The Indian coach presented watch to each of his players.
