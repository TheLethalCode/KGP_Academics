 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government has asked donors for five lakh tonnes of food grains instead of cash assistance to feed the cyclone survivors, an adviser said Tuesday. Food and disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury said the administration also suggested that the donors imported the food grains from abroad and did not buy them from the local market already struck by a supply shortage. Tapan said the total shortfall may amount to about 1 million tonnes. The government had 7.35 lakh tonnes of food grains in stock, the adviser said, but the recurrent floods and the cyclone may adversely affect the food security. Procurement from the local market might strain the domestic supply, which was why the government wanted the food assistance to be imported by the donors instead of cash aid, Tapan explained. The donor countries and organisations agreed to the proposal, he told reporters after a meeting with the development partners The UNDP representative, Renata Loch Dessalion, told reporters that the international communities had been alerted to send in food aid as urgent succour for the cyclone victims. The British High Commissioner, Anwar Choudhury, said Britain had assured the government of providing substantial assistance and soon after granted a $10 million dollar aid. The envoy said his government would launch a $100 million project to distribute books among the students and repair educational infrastructure in the cyclone-affected districts. bdne
