<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed Tuesday pledged initiatives to import food grains and step up local production in an attempt to tackle any deficit. The central bank chief also urged banks to forget about making profits this year keeping the social commitment in mind. "The country's economy faces a great challenge due to two floods and Cyclone Sidr. We need a coordinated plan to face the challenge," Salehuddin said at a news briefing after a meeting with representatives of the banking sector. "We fear that the country might face a food shortfall. The central bank will provide foreign currency to import food. It will also join efforts to the boost local production." "The central bank has $5 billion in foreign currency reserve right now with which it will be possible to bear import costs for more than three months," he said in reply to a question. Salehuddin said the central bank would oversee activities to boost agricultural produce and disbursement of agricultural loans on low interest. "The country is facing an economic depression now. The role of banks is very crucial to overcoming the depression. Banks should offer agricultural loans on easy conditions and low interest." "The banking sector must work without the thought of making profit. It must have social commitment. Banks will have to use that commitment to make the country's economy more dynamic," said the governor. If the economy recovered and added depth, he observed, banks would be able to sustain profits next year. Steps were being taking to keep imports normal, Salehuddin said, including encouraging small importers along with the large ones. "We are also taking many steps to keep inflation stable. But it becomes difficult to control inflation due to the weakness in the supply system. The problem has become more acute after the cyclone disrupted the communications system." Inflation reached 10.10 percent in Oct from 9.60 percent in Sept, he added. On fears of a fall in GDP growth, the governor said: "It won't fall as ADB and other donor agencies have predicted. In the last fiscal year GDP was 6.5 percent, this year it might be a little less." "But it won't decline below 6 percent." "The industry and service sectors are running smoothly. So it won't impact on GDP," Salehuddin said. bdnews24.com
