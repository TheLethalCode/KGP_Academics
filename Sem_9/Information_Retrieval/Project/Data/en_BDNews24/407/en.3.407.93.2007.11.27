 Toronto, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Exceeding expectations can drive some employees to do a worse job next time, while others must see changes in their performance to stay on track, according to a recent study. The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, showed that people in the workplace react to success or failure in surprisingly different ways depending on how they assess their own abilities. Those with a "fixed" belief system think their abilities don't change, and they react badly to a change in performance -- even if they are actually doing better. "People are driven to feel that they can predict and control their outcomes. So when their performance turns out to violate their predictions, this can be unnerving -- even if the outcome is, objectively speaking, good news," said Jason Plaks of the University of Toronto, who worked with Kristin Stecher of the University of Washington in Seattle on the study. But those with a "malleable" belief system think of themselves capable of evolving and improving, and they react badly if their performance simply stagnates. If their scores did not improve in two successive tests, the response could be a decline in their performance. "When they stayed stuck in place, it was confusing. It's as if, 'well, what do I do now? I don't have a clear sense of where my abilities stand.' Whereas 'if I did worse, at least I clearly failed and I can adopt a different strategy,'" Plaks said in an interview. The researchers said people with a fixed mind-set might be less ready to handle the successes and failures inherent in fast-moving sectors like information technology or medicine, and they could damage the chance of success there. The study used a questionnaire to assess how 500 subjects viewed their abilities, asking participants to what extent they agreed with statements like, "My intelligence is something that is fixed about me and I cannot change" or "I feel I can change my intelligence a lot." Each individual was then classified as holding a fixed view or a malleable view based on the scores, and took a series of logic tests, with randomly assigned feedback before the final test. Plaks said a malleable belief system is generally more beneficial, but there were times when the opposite might apply. "I think the most effectively functioning person is able to access either belief perspective appropriately and understand that this is a case where I should have a malleable belief and this is a place where I should have a fixed belief," he said.
