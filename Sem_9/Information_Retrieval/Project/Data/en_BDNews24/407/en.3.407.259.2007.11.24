 KIEV, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's worst mining accident, when a methane blast triggered underground fires at a colliery in the east of the country last Sunday, killed 100 miners, officials said on Saturday. "We can officially say that 100 miners died at the Zasyadko mine," Serhiy Storchak, a member of a commission of inquiry into the explosion, told Interfax Ukraine news agency. Thirty-eight miners remained in hospital after the latest in a long series of deadly accidents plaguing the ex-Soviet state's mining industry. Officials had long acknowledged that 11 miners missing several days after the blast had no chance of surviving. They said fires likely to burn for weeks more than 1 km underground had hampered rescue efforts. Zasyadko is viewed as one of Ukraine's most technologically advanced and profitable pits, but Sunday's blast was the fourth major accident there in recent years.
