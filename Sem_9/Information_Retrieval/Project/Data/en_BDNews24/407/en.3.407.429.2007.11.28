<TITLE> Indonesia's vice president upbeat on economy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia can achieve a similar growth rate to Asia's economic powerhouses, China and India, provided it fixes its ailing infrastructure and attracts more foreign investment, Vice President Jusuf Kalla said on Wednesday. Southeast Asia's biggest economy is set to expand 6.3 percent this year, its fastest growth in 11 years, but it still lags far behind China, which is set to expand 11.5 percent this year, and India, which is heading for 9 percent growth in its fiscal year. "We can achieve that" kind of growth rate, Kalla told Reuters in an interview, as Indonesia plans to improve infrastructure such as roads, ports, and transportation, and provide "good regulation for investors." President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was elected in 2004 on the back of promises to tackle corruption, boost growth, and create jobs. Kalla said that the government was tackling impediments to growth such as corruption and investor-unfriendly labour laws. "This is a transition period," said the wealthy businessman who comes from Indonesia's Sulawesi island. Kalla gave an upbeat assessment of the economy, shrugging off the recent weakness in the rupiah currency which has been partly blamed on concerns about the impact of high oil prices on the economy and the high cost of government fuel subsidies. The rupiah fell to 9,422 per dollar on Wednesday, from around 9,100 at the beginning of November. "The central bank will take care of it," he said. "Between 9,300 and 9,500 they usually intervene." Kalla, who expressed confidence the economy could meet a government growth target of 6.8 percent next year, said that the government had no plan to cut or reduce fuel subsidies, which are politically sensitive in Indonesia. Cuts in the level of subsidy have led to riots in the past, and analysts say that with elections slated for 2009, it is unlikely the government will cut subsidies. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday that energy subsidies are estimated to reach 88.2 trillion rupiah this year, far higher than the 55.6 trillion rupiah allocated in the 2007 budget.
