 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday sent Harkatul Jihad chief Mufti Abdul Hannan to a three-day remand for questioning in a murder case after the end of a two-day remand. The court sent Hannan's associate Maulana Abu Taher to a five-day remand in the 2003 Sajjad Hossain Rubel murder case. Metropolitan magistrate Al Mamun ordered the remand after inspector AK Alam Khan of the Criminal Investigation Department appealed for a seven-day remand for Hannan and 10-day remand for Abu Taher. Taher was taken to the court after his 12-day remand in the August 21 grenade attack case ended. Rubel was shot dead on July 16, 2003 at the gate of Dhaka University's Sir AF Rahman Hall. Rubel's mother Tayeba Khan filed a case with Ramna Police Station. On July 13, 2005, a charge sheet was submitted accusing nobody. The case was later handed over to CID following an appeal of the plaintiff. On Nov 1, Hannan gave a confessional statement to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka, saying he and Abu Taher were involved with the grenade attack. bdnews
