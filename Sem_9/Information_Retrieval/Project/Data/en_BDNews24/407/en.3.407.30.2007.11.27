<TITLE> Britain's Brown moves to quell party funding row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged on Tuesday his Labour Party had accepted illegal donations and the opposition Conservatives accused his government of lurching from "complacency into arrogance". The funding fiasco is the latest in a series of mishaps for Brown, following Britain's first bank run in more than a century at Northern Rock and news last week that the government had lost computer discs containing personal details of half the nation. Brown, who took over from Tony Blair in June after 10 years waiting in the wings as finance minister, said Labour would return the donations made by a property developer who channeled 600,000 pounds ($1.24 million) through intermediaries. "The money was not lawfully declared so it will be returned, " Brown told a news conference. "Mistakes have been made, but ac tion will be taken to impose the highest standards." Opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron, buoyed by a strong poll lead, told business leaders: "There is a time in the life of every government when it slips over from complacency into arrogance, and from arrogance into even indifference for the law." While the events of the past months have dented Brown's popularity, he has a healthy majority in parliament, does not have to call the next national election until May 2010 and there is little prospect of an internal party revolt. Brown reflected on successes of the first weeks of his premiership when his popularity ratings ran high; his handling of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, rural flooding and attempted car-bombings. INQUIRY "I think people will look back over these last few months ... and see that these problems were dealt with in a way that was efficient and rapid," he said. Brown promised an internal inquiry on the donations and denied he knew anything about the practice until last Saturday. British electoral laws require those making donations on behalf of others to give details of the source of the money. Labour's latest funding crisis has echoes of Blair's final months in office, which were marred by a police probe into charges political parties had nominated people for seats in parliament's unelected upper house in return for cash or loans. Noone was charged but the sleaze allegations contributed to public and party pressure on Blair that forced him out early. There may still be more political fallout from the latest row as Britain's media scours for evidence of impropriety. Labour's general secretary Peter Watt resigned on Monday after admitting he knew property developer David Abrahams, a millionaire tycoon, had donated to Labour through a number of associates to conceal his identity.
