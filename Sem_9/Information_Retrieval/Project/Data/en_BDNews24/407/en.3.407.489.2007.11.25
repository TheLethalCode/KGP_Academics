<TITLE> Abbas in Washington ahead of Annapolis talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas arrived in Washington on Sunday saying a conference in nearby Annapolis this week would launch negotiations that would finally realise his people's dream of a Palestinian state. Tuesday's meeting in Maryland, where Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will be joined by many Arab ministers, aims to agree a resumption of talks on a final Palestinian peace with Israel, seven years after a summit at Camp David hosted by President George W Bush's predecessor Bill Clinton collapsed. "We consider the Annapolis conference a launching pad for final status negotiations that will lead to the realisation of the Palestinian people's dream of establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital," Abbas aide Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters after the Palestinian leader's arrival. Olmert, due to land in Washington later on Sunday, told reporters on his plane before leaving that he hoped Annapolis would launch serious negotiations on "all the core issues that will result in a solution of two states for two peoples". Israeli police said they stepped up roadblocks and other security measures in Jerusalem to try to avert any violence. Like Clinton in his final year in office, Bush hopes he can clinch a deal before he steps down in January 2009, a feat that could burnish his administration's reputation in the Middle East after years of controversy over the U.S. occupation of Iraq. However, all sides have played down the prospect of any breakthrough at Annapolis or afterward. Abbas, Olmert and Bush all face severe limitations on implementing any agreement over borders and the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jerusalem. LIMITATIONS Abbas has lost control of the Gaza Strip to Iranian-backed Hamas Islamists, Olmert is unpopular with voters, not least due to corruption accusations, and faces opposition to concessions within his own coalition. Bush has barely a year left in power. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have so far failed to agree on a joint document on how to proceed with negotiations. Abu Rdainah said they would meet again in Washington on Sunday. Both sides are expected to reaffirm commitments under the U.S.-backed "road map" to peace, agreed in 2003. Israel has made any deal conditional on Abbas preventing attacks by militants. Palestinians say Israel's occupation of the West Bank undermines their efforts and want Israel to stop Jewish settlement. The mere attendance at talks with Israel of Arab states like Saudi Arabia and, possibly Syria, which have had cold-to-hostile relations with the Jewish state, is likely to be hailed in Israel and Washington as a major achievement at Annapolis. Iran, which the United States has ostracised for developing nuclear technology, has not been invited and said on Sunday the conference would erode Palestinian rights. Hamas said it was shocked at the decision by the Arab League on Friday to attend. "The biggest thing about Annapolis is the fact that most Arab states will be gathering there," Israeli Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit told Israel Radio. "This will enable the process to get started to reach a comprehensive agreement with the Arabs ... in return for a peace deal with the Palestinians." Olmert said on his plane before leaving for Washington that Israel would "view positively" Syria's participation. Damascus says it expects its claim to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to be mentioned at Annapolis -- something Syrian officials have been pressing for if they are to attend. Sheetrit said the Jewish state was "not against" discussing the Golan Heights, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war, but said there would be no "substantive discussion". Syria said on Friday the United States had agreed to put the issue on the agenda. Washington had no immediate comment. Illustrating the depth of resistance to concessions even within Olmert's own cabinet, Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz, a former army chief-of-staff, said Israel could not defend itself if it gave back all the land it occupied in 1967. He also said that Israel should not discuss core issues like dividing Jerusalem until Palestinians met commitments under the road map to dismantle "terror infrastructur
