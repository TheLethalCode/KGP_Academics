 COLOMBO, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have axed middle order batsman Thilan Samaraweera from their 14-man squad for the first test against England. Left-arm seamer Sujeewa de Silva has been recalled as a replacement for Farveez Maharoof, who has been ruled out of the three-match series with an ankle stress fracture. Sri Lanka are expected to go into the first game in Kandy starting on Dec. 1 with three fast bowlers and one spinner. The main dilemma is the replacement for retired opener Marvan Atapattu with the final choice resting between Sanath Jayasuriya, Michael Vandort and Upul Tharanga. Squad: Mahela Jayawardene (capt), Kumar Sangakkara, Sanath Jayasuriya, Upul Tharanga, Michael Vandort, Chamara Silva, Jehan Mubarak, Prasanna Jayawardene, Muttiah Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Fernando, Lasith Malinga, Malinga Bandara, Sujeewa de Silva
