 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three people were killed and nearly 100 were injured in Patuakhali Saturday when a road bridge packed with hundreds of hungry cyclone survivors collapsed into a river, police and witnesses said. The death toll was likely to rise as a further 20 people were missing. The cyclone-battered bridge in Kalapara village in the district gave way under a crowd of people who were hoping for the arrival of vehicles with food and other relief following the country's deadliest cyclone in 16 years. Cyclone Sidr killed around 3,500 people and left thousands missing or injured. Some two million were also displaced. Witnesses said thousands of hungry survivors also thronged river banks and road sides for relief in cyclone-torn coastal areas even though relief operations had quickened. At least 10 people were hurt when police baton-charged a group of angry survivors at a Patuakhali village, police said. Many came from remote areas hoping for food handouts from the government and non-governmental organisations. "We have walked for several kilometres to reach this river bank to get some food because relief operators just distribute to the people on the banks and roadside," said Marzina Begum, who lost her son and husband in the storm. "They don't think there are many survivors in the interior parts," said Mazina. Air force continued relief sorties with its fleet of 13 helicopters and planes. "With such a small fleet of aircraft it is not possible to give adequate relief to thousands of survivors," a relief official said. The amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge is in Bangladesh waters to assist the authorities and another U.S. ship, the USS Essex, was due to arrive soon, a U.S. statement said. Each ship carries about 20 helicopters, which will help in delivering water, food and medical supplies to remote areas in the battered south and southwestern regions, officials said.
