 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian riot police beat opposition activists on Sunday and detained nearly 200 people at protest marches against President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Riot police also detained Boris Nemtsov and Nikita Belykh, leaders of the Union of Right Forces (SPS) party, at the rallies. Both are running in a Dec. 2 parliamentary election. This correspondent saw riot police beating activists with batons and their fists before pushing them into police buses. Later dozens more were detained outside the Winter Palace, the residence of the Tsars, and at another rally in central St Petersburg. "They have forbidden us from discussing Putin," Nemtsov told the crowd. "But we have come here today to ask Mr Putin and the authorities why is there so much corruption in the country?" He was promptly detained by five riot policemen as the crowd chanted "Russia without Putin". About 500 activists made it to the marches but were vastly outnumbered by riot police. The city authorities had not given permission for the march and streets in the centre of the city were blocked by riot police and snow clearing trucks. The "march of the discontented" brings together Putin's opponents into one movement which includes Other Russia, free-market parties such as SPS and Yabloko as well as anarchists and radical socialists.

Activists said 60 people were detained at that march.

Kremlin officials say the opposition marches are aimed at attracting attention in the West and that the activists are a mixed bag of marginal politicians with little public support. Putin, ranked by opinion polls as the most popular politician in Russia, is credited by supporters for cementing political stability and presiding over the longest economic boom for a generation. The former KGB spy has vowed to step down as president next year after his second consecutive four-year term in office. But he has said he will use the United Russia party to preserve influence after he steps down. He is running as the party's top candidate in the December election. "We are ruled by the United Russia gang. They have taken away the elections," said Lyubov Chilipenko at the mar
