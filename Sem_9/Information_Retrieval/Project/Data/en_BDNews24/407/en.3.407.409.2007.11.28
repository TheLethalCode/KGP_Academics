 MANCHESTER, England, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United match-winner Cristiano Ronaldo had no apologies this time as his stunning goal beat former club Sporting and secured top spot in Group F of the Champions League on Tuesday. Ronaldo's injury-time freekick, his fifth goal of the qualifying phase, gave United a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford. The Portugal international had also scored the decisive goal in Lisbon last month but while he was muted in his celebrations in front of his former supporters, there was no hint of regret on this occasion. "This was different. I have a lot of respect for them (Sporting). But they understand. This is my job and Manchester United is my club. It was a fabulous goal and I was pleased with it," Ronaldo told reporters. "It's always important to win but it was particularly important tonight because it meant we topped the group. We didn't play well in the first half but we deserved it in the second half because we created a lot of chances." United had trailed to a first-half goal from Abel and looked in danger of only a second defeat in 33 home European games. But with Ronaldo in outstanding form they dominated the second half and, after substitute Carlos Tevez had equalised, secured a fifth successive win with Ronaldo's 25-yard metre into the top corner. "It was a marvellous strike. He has done it before and he works very hard on that," said United manager Alex Ferguson. "He always wanted to do well against his old club. He owes a lot to Sporting Lisbon. He was brought up there as a young boy. He respects that and has great admiration for the club." United's victory means they will avoid other group winners in the first knockout round of the competition and Ferguson can also rest key players for their final group game against AS Roma, who have also qualified, on Dec. 15, four days before they face Liverpool in the Premier League. "It was important in the sense that we can go to Rome and use all my squad," Ferguson added. "One or two will not even travel. Obviously we have an important game coming up against Liverpool but I will still play a team that can hopefully win the match.
