 SYDNEY, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham lit up the Olympic Stadium with a stunning free kick but failed to inspire his LA Galaxy team mates in a 5-3 friendly loss to Sydney FC on Tuesday. The former England captain brought a crowd of over 80,000 to their feet just before halftime when he curled in a trademark strike from 25 metres but it was a rare moment of joy for Galaxy who struggled in coach Ruud Gullit's first game in charge. The 32-year-old Beckham had earlier suffered an ankle injury and watched helplessly as his team gave away three early goals to hand their hosts a 3-0 lead, striker Alex Brosque scoring twice. Beckham, playing in a deep-lying midfield role, hobbled on in obvious discomfort but he took his chance of glory two minutes before the interval. Galaxy were awarded a free kick in a central position 25 metres from goal and, as he has so many times before, Beckham carefully placed the ball on the turf. He stepped up to whip the ball over the Sydney wall and it fizzed into the top corner of the net beyond the despairing dive of goalkeeper Clint Bolton. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder raised both arms in the air to celebrate before walking slowly back to the centre circle. "It was nice to get the free kick, I practise them a lot and I was obviously happy to score," Beckham told the crowd. "We've enjoyed the game and I've had a great time in Australia." Galaxy pulled another goal back soon after the interval through striker Edson Buddle but Sydney, inspired by Brazilian Juninho, restored their two-goal cushion when Robbie Middleby tapped into an empty net. Beckham was the victim of a couple of strong challenges and he was booked in the 64th minute for retaliating with a late tackle on Middleby before Galaxy defender Kevin Harmse was sent off as tempers flared. Beckham tried to inject urgency with a few ambitious passes and both teams claimed late goals, Sydney defender Iain Fyfe bundling the ball home from close range and U.S. international Landon Donovan completing the scoring in the dying seconds
