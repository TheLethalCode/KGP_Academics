 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The interim administration has unveiled a 38-strong high-profile Better Business Forum to boost the private sector in a move hailed by businesses. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed heads the body styled Bangladesh Better Business Forum (BBBF), designed to maintain institutional relations with the private sector, a notification by the Chief Advisor's Office said Monday. The forum has been rolled out amid reports that low business confidence has put strains on economy over past few months. Representatives from both the government and the private sector are members of the high-profile forum, it said. The adviser to the finance and planning and commerce ministries, AB Mirza Azizul Islam, has been made the forum's executive chairman while the executive chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) will act as member secretary. The forum will deal with issues for maintaining "favourable and suitable relations" between the government and the private sector, the notice said. The necessity of an environment favourable to investment and economic growth has prompted the formation of the body in the wake of current domestic and international trade situations, the notification added. Mir Nasir Hossain, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, welcomed the move. He said it would help regain confidence in the business community. "I am happy with the move since it has come from the top tier of the government. "It will help us to achieve a better economic growth," said Nasir, a member of the forum. bdne
