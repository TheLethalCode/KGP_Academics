 COLOMBO, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England, buoyed up by good news about the injuries of Steve Harmison and James Anderson, completed a comfortable five-wicket victory over a Sri Lanka Cricket President's XI on Tuesday. Fast bowler Steve Harmison was given the all clear after undergoing a scan on his injured back which put him out of action on Sunday. "We're going to monitor him over the next 48 hours," said captain Michael Vaughan whose side play the first test in Kandy from Saturday. "Yesterday he was moving very gingerly but today he was moving more freely so that's a good sign," said Vaughan. Fellow pace bowler Anderson resumed bowling on the third morning after an ankle injury scare on Sunday. England were set a victory target of 246 after bowling out the President's XI for just 81 and chased down the target in 61 overs. Kevin Pietersen finally found some form on tour with a top score of 59 from 86 balls. Alastair Cook scored 58 from 116 balls. "We feel that we have had a good amount of time out in the middle for batting and bowling," Vaughan said. "Everyone's hitting the ball nicely and looking in good form. "We feel we're in good spirits going into the first test.
