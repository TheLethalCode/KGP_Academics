 MELBOURNE, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympic champion Sarah Ulmer announced her retirement on Saturday after battling a nerve injury in her leg that had dogged her for nearly two years. The 31-year-old New Zealander won her country's first Olympic cycling gold when she smashed the world record in the 3,000 metres pursuit final at the 2004 Athens Games. She had also won the world championship title earlier in the year. "I've been toying with retirement for longer than I actually expected," Ulmer told New Zealand's TV3. "It's been a pretty frustrating year from the cycling side of things. I've been in and out of doctors and medical specialist and MRI machines. "The crunch with the actual decision was a trip to a surgeon in Christchurch who didn't give me a greater than 50 percent chance that he could improve me." Ulmer, who switched to the road after her success in Athens, has been battling the injury since before the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne
