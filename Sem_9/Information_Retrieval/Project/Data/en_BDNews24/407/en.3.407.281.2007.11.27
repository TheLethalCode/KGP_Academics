<TITLE> Kosovo fate is for UN to decide, says Serbia </TITLE>

 BADEN, Austria, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The future of Kosovo cannot be decided unilaterally by its Albanian majority and their Western backers but rests with the United Nations alone, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday. "For Serbia only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable," Kostunica said at the end of a second day of last-ditch talks in Austria. "These negotiations have lasted for two years. The way they started is the way they must end -- in the Security Council." There has been no glimmer of compromise between Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians since international mediation began in earnest in 2006. Kosovo is getting ready to declare independence and has the promise of Western recognition. The West says the mediation ends with a report to the United Nations by Dec. 10. But Serbia's ally Russia has already blocked independence in the Security Council and says it will "insist" on further negotiation. "This process will not end on Dec. 10," Kostunica said. "It will end and must end in the Security Council." He said any other way would be "a crime, a sort of crime" that would seriously damage international law and the United Nations. Serbia says its resistance to Kosovo independence is also intended to preserve peace in the fragile Balkans. Kosovo's prime minister-in-waiting Hashim Thaci, a former guerrilla who battled Serb forces in their 1998-99 war, denied any threat to peace, saying fresh conflict was out of the question. "There will be no more war, no more killing, no more crisis in the region. That's our commitment," Thaci said. "There will also be no more delay." Western powers back Kosovo's independence after 8 years under United Nations tutelage and NATO protection as "the only viable" solution to a dispute in which compromise is impossible. But Serbia warns of violent unrest, and has raised the possibility that Serbs whose mini-republic makes up half of Bosnia could demand, in their turn, to secede from that state. "NOTHING SPECTACULAR" "There are only 24 hours left in this process and the positions of both sides are diametrically opposed," said Thaci. Kosovo Albanians, the United States and the European Union say the talks will end when mediators make their report to the UN by Dec 10. Russia, third pillar of the mediating 'troika', says they can carry on provided there is hope of a deal. Serbian President Boris Tadic appealed to Kosovo Albanians to accept an offer of nearly all the rights and symbols of an independent state, short of the republic they are demanding. Serbia was offering Kosovo most rights "and symbols that are normally reserved only for sovereign states", he said, including access to international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Kosovo could have its own flag and its own international sports teams, but Serbia "reserves the right to exclusive representation" in the U.N., the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Serbia would also "maintain the right to associate herself with the province's foreign policy, defence, border control and the protection of Serbian heritage" - all red lines for Kosovo. "Serbia's offer is a recipe for frozen conflict," said Kosovo spokesman Skender Hyseni. "I am afraid nothing spectacular will happen" in the remaining 24 hours.
