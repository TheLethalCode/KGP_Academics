<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aston Villa's Martin O'Neill ruled himself out of the running for the vacant England manager's job on Friday. O'Neill, 55, an early favourite to take over from the sacked Steve McClaren, told a news conference before Saturday's Premier League game at Middlesbrough that he was committed to his club. "I want to do this job and that really should end it (the speculation)," said the former Northern Ireland international, who was interviewed by the FA for the England position last time around. "I am committed here to this job...I actually love the job. "You are talking about a door being shut but it may never have been open in the first place. "This is where I want to do the job and I want to try and do something properly for Aston Villa." McClaren was dismissed on Thursday after England lost 3-2 to Croatia and failed to qualify for the 2008 European championship finals
