<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The newly-formed Khaleda Zia Mukti Parishad will launch a countrywide signature campaign on Dec 1 to garner public support for the release of the detained BNP chief. Akhteruzzaman, convener of the organisation, declared the programme Sunday from a news conference held at the makeshift office in Baridhara to announce the organisation's 14-point manifesto. "No leader has yet come up either equal or an alternative to Khaleda Zia. She has realised the reasons of political failures of the past through her pains and agonies. A new Khaleda Zia will be able to lead the country. She must be freed," the pro-Khaleda leader said. "[The organisation] has no relations with the BNP. We have formed the party to raise support for Khaleda Zia's freedom. All of us have faith in the leadership of secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain," he said. He said his organisation would form a six-phase organisational structure to form public support in favour of the campaign. "The committee will be formed at ward and national level." The organisation would take up a number of programmes to free the former prime minister including discussion with the government, meeting with different professional groups and holding seminars. It would also put pressure on the foreign embassies and state organisations, the press conference said. Akhteruzzaman said: "The GATCO case filed against Khaleda is illegal. The lawyers are facing the matter through legal process. We will collect signatures of people as a symbol of their solidarity and submit them to the government and say 'Free our leader'." He supported the government's initiative to curb corruption. bdnews2
