 Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - A suicide car bomber rammed a bus going to a intelligence building on the outskirts of Islamabad on Saturday, while another struck at an army checkpost outside General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, officials said. "Both were suicide attacks," Army spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad told Dawn News television. The blast outside GHQ killed one soldier and wounded one, but officials said many casualties were feared from the attack on the bus. The Rawalpindi attack targeted the last army picket less than 100 meters (yards) from the main gates of GHQ. The bomber detonated his charge after being stopped by the soldiers on guard duty. The other attack, on the border of the twin cities, targeted a Ministry of Defense bus, Arshad said
