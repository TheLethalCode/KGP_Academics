 New Delhi, Mon Nov 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government will review foreign investment limits in some sectors on Thursday, the trade minister said on Monday, as Asia's third-largest economy aims to remove bottlenecks to sustain high growth. Analysts said the cash-strapped government wants to open up the infrastructure sector such as refining as India requires huge investment, but there would not be a major revamp of the overall policy. The Indian economy has grown at an average 8.6 percent in the past four years and is poised to maintain that pace in the current year to March 2008, but creaky infrastructure may pose a threat to faster expansion in future. "We will go to the cabinet for FDI review on Thursday," Trade Minister Kamal Nath told reporters on Monday, but he offered no details of what was being considered. Local media reported recently that officials may alter restrictions relevant to oil refining, commodity exchanges, and aviation services such as chartering planes and helicopters and ground handling facilities. Last week, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said the country would require $120-130 billion foreign investment in the infrastructure sectors in the next five years. "Infrastructure bottlenecks are hampering economic growth. We don't have the money for such huge investments. These sectors are apolitical and do not hamper employment as is the case with retail," said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist with Institute of Economic Growth. India aims to attract foreign investments of $26 billion in 2007/08, higher than $16 billion a year earlier. Earlier this month, an oil ministry official said the government could allow foreign players to take stakes of up to 49 percent in new projects with state-run oil firms. Currently they are limited to 26 percent. In June, India approved steel baron Lakshmi Mittal's purchase of a 49 percent stake in a new oil refinery of Hindustan Petroleum Corp, which was the largest-ever foreign investment in a tie-up with a state-run refiner, but said this was a one-off to save a troubled project. Other state firms like Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil and Natural Gas Corp also plan new refineries and are seeking foreign tie ups. Apart from the refinery sector, India is also planning to announce a new limit for foreign investment in commodity exchanges. In July, an official at the commodities regulator said the cap could be pegged at 49 percent -- 26 percent foreign direct investment and 23 percent for foreign institutional investo
