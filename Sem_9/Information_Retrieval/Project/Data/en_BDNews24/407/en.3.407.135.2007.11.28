 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday set Dec 2 to hear a remand appeal against former prime minister Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco in an extortion case. The hearing did not take place on Nov 28 because an ailing Coco could not be brought to court. He was undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka set the new hearing date. A remand appeal hearing in a corruption case against Coco's elder brother Tarique Rahman has also been scheduled for Dec 2. Abu Ahmed Jaydan Rabbi, owner of advertisement firm Adcom, filed the Tk 1.2 crore extortion case against Coco and his two brothers-in-law Mostaqim Reza and Mostakin Reza with Gulshan Police Station on May 16. The case was later taken under the cover of emergency powers rules. Investigating officer in the case, Gulshan police chief Abdul Motalib, appealed for a seven-day remand for Coco on Nov 20. Coco was arrested on Sept 3 on charges of having links to the Gatco scam. Soon after his arrest he was sent into custody on a seven-day remand where he fell sick. He was then sent to jail on Sept 5. On Oct 29, a court turned down a remand appeal in the Gatco scam case against Coco. The court asked ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda to interrogate Coco in the Gatco scam case at the jail gate if necessary. bdnews2
