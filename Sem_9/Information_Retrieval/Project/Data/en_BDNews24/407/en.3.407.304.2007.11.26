<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)-- Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday said US warship USS Kearsarge had come to Bangladesh solely for relief operations. The adviser, however, ducked repeated questions on whether the US ship had arrived in Bangladesh at the request of the caretaker government. In a statement on Nov 24, the US embassy said the ship had been dispatched to Sidr-hit areas "in response to a request from the government of Bangladesh to the United States and at the direction of the US Pacific Command". "The US warships with their relief capabilities have come to assist distressed humanity as friends. Their (US warships) presence will only be for the purpose of relief operations," Iftekhar told reporters at the foreign ministry. Kearsarge had started relief operations Nov 24 mainly transporting pure water and medicines to the remote areas in 15 cyclone-hit southern and southwestern districts. "In the international arena there are innumerable examples of such a type of assistance following natural disasters," Iftekhar said. "This type of friendly cooperation is generally acknowledged as normal and positive in the sphere of friendly relations between states," he said. He reminded reporters that the US had conducted "Operation Sea Angel" following a catastrophic cyclone in Bangladesh on April 29, 1991. bdn
