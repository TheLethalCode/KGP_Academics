 DHAKA, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The army chief called for coordination in relief operations Sunday, as many survivors remained without adequate aid nine days after a cyclone ravaged the south. Despite intensified relief operations by the government and local and foreign groups, thousands of survivors hoping for food were crowding river banks and roadsides, witnesses said. "Please coordinate with us, so that we can dispatch your relief goods to the survivors who need it most," General Moeen U Ahmed told local donors Sunday. Cyclone Sidr, which hit on Nov 15, killed more than 3,000 people, left thousands missing or injured, and displaced some two million. The amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge was in Bangladeshi waters to assist the authorities and another ship, the USS Essex, was due to arrive soon, US embassy officials said. Each ship carries about 20 helicopters, which will help in delivering water, food and medical supplies to remote areas in the south and southwestern regions, officials said. A pair of Marine helicopters carried 750 gallons of bottled waters Saturday from the USS Kearsarge to the southern coastal city Barisal, marking the first delivery of aid by the US military. Relief officials said the two ships would start full-fledged relief operations from Monday. "If we can utilise the huge capabilities of the US ships, we can successfully conduct a useful relief operation for the survivors," Moeen said. Many of the survivors came from remote areas hoping for food handouts from the government and non-governmental organisations, which often do not visit remote areas lacking road communication. "Coordination among relief distributors is a problem," Heather Blackwell, Bangladesh representative of British charity Oxfam, told Reuters after visiting some of the worst-hit areas.
