<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks rattled Tuesday on worries of regulatory sanctions following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission could get tough on 'irrational' developments in the market. Markets were down from beginning to end as investors, especially institutional investors, moved to lock in profits in almost every sector. The market lost pace after it marked its highest ever single day rally Monday encouraged by a partial relaxation of credit extension facilities. The SEC on November 25 partially relaxed its previous bar on merchant banks' lending, allowing them to sanction credit at an equity ratio of 1: 0.05. The ratio was 1:1 earlier. "The market appears to be very nervous over regulatory sanctions. It is now reacting to the SEC steps," said Yawer Sayeed who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion at AIMS of Bangladesh. He said: "The market is going through a volatile mood because of different directives within a short span of time." The main DGEN or general index slumped 70.24 points or 2.28 percent to 3001.19. The DSI or all-share price index was down 53.07 points or 2.04 percent to 2543.79. The DSE-20 blue chip index shed 53.36 points or 2.22 percent to end at 2345.38. Turnover stood at Tk 1.84 billion from the trading of 93,85,010 shares, with 24 advancing, 179 declining and 12 holding steady. UCBL emerged the most active share after reports that a Dhaka court had directed it to hold its arrear annual general meetings for the years 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 by December 31. UCBL surged 5.73 percent to Tk 6028.75. But market major Power Grid Company of Bangladesh dipped 4.30 percent to Tk 694.25 on selling pressure. BRAC Bank, the third most active share, finished at Tk 1567.5, down 3.53 percent. Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, observed that the market was downbeat partly because of profit taking. "It could be that the market grew the previous day and investors were encouraged to lock in profits," he said. "But this volatile movement indicates high risk for investors," he said. The recently listed Islami Bank Perpetual Bond declined 2.36 percent to Tk 1710.75. IFIC Bank was down 2.36 percent to Tk 2791.75. But AB Bank ended slightly higher after it said it had formed a joint venture to set up a company to facilitate electronic cash transfers. Uttara Bank gained a bit while market bigwigsLafarge Surma Cement, Islami Bank and Social Investment Bank ended lower. All the indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also ended downbeat with losers beating gainers 101 to 16. One issue held steady. A total of 19,55,934 shares of Tk 331.35 million traded on the bourse.
