<TITLE> Rich should lead carbon emission cuts to avert catastrophe: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Rich nations must take the lead in cutting carbon emissions to prevent catastrophic reversals in health and education gains and poverty reduction for the world's poor, says a major global report launched Tuesday. The UN Human Development Report (HDR) 2007-08 also asked developed countries to provide incentives to developing countries to combat the climate change challenge. The HDR 2007-08 is titled "Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world". The report was prepared by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on the basis of the recently-released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report. It set out a pathway for climate change negotiations next week in Bali, Indonesia, and stressed that a narrow ten-year window of opportunity remained to put it into practice. If that window is missed, temperature rises of above two degrees Celsius could see the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers that provide water and food for over two billion people, the report warned. "The carbon budget of the 21st century -- the amount of carbon that can be absorbed creating an even probability that temperatures will not rise above two degrees -- is being overspent and threatens to run out entirely by 2032," says Kevin Watkins, lead author of the HDR 2007-08. Watkins said: "And the poor -- those with the lightest carbon footprint and the least means to protect themselves -- are the first victims of developed countries' energy-rich lifestyle." The world's richest countries have a historic responsibility to take the lead in balancing the carbon budget by cutting emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050, according to the report. "In addition, they (the rich) should support a new $86 billion global annual investment in substantial international adaptation efforts to protect the world's poor," the report said. Developed countries should also adopt a new mechanism to transfer clean energy technology to developing countries, it added. The report quoting the Bangladesh experience said, every $1 invested in this adaptation initiative protects $2 to 3 in assets that would otherwise be lost during flooding, without mention of the highly damaging implications of flooding for nutrition, health and education that can be avoided. The report argued that with the support of such measures, developing Asian countries -- especially fast growing and industrialising countries like China and India -- should also play their part with total emissions cuts of at least 20 percent by 2050. "The critical challenge for Asia in the face of climate change is to expand access to affordable energy, while at the same time decarbonising growth," says UNDP administrator Kemal Dervi , "International cooperation is vital to unlock win-win scenarios that enhance both the climate security and the energy security that are vital for growth and poverty reduction." The report recommends establishing a Climate Change Mitigation Facility financed by developed countries and designed to provide incentives, including access to clean energy technology, to guide developing countries to a greener development path. "Properly financed technology transfer from rich countries to poor countries has to be the entry price that developed countries pay for their carbon trail," says Watkins. Pathway for Bali 'Fighting climate change' lays out a definitive checklist for all political leaders meeting in Bali in December -- a pathway for a binding and enforceable post- 2012 multilateral agreement that the authors stress will be essential to support the planet and its poorest people against the worst impacts of climate change: 1. Cut emissions from developing countries by 20 percent by 2050 and from developed countries by 30 percent by 2020 and at least 80 percent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. 2. Create a Climate Change Mitigation Facility to finance the incremental low-carbon energy investment in developing countries, to give them both the means to switch to low emission pathways and the incentive to commit to binding international emission cuts. This would need an investment of $25-50 billion annually. 3. Put a proper price on carbon through a combination of carbon taxation and an ambitious global expansion of cap-and-trade schemes. 4. Strengthen regulatory standards by adopting and enforcing tougher efficiency standards on vehicle, building and electrical appliance emissions. 5. Support the development of low carbon energy provision, recognising unexploited potential for an increase in the share of renewable energy used and the need for urgent investment in breakthrough technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). 6. Allocate $86 billion or 0.2 percent of northern countries' combined GDP to adaptation of climate proof infrastructure and build the resilience of the poor to the effects of climate change. 7. Make adaptation part of all plans to reduce poverty and extreme inequality, including poverty reduction strategy papers. 8. Recognize carbon sequestration on forests and land as essential parts of a future global agreement and back international finance transfer plans on deforestation as advocated by Brazil among others. bdnews2
