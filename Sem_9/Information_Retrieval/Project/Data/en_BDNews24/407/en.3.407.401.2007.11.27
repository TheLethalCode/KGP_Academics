 SEOUL, Tue Nov 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's defense minister went to North Korea on Tuesday for a meeting of defense chiefs aimed at easing tensions along one of the world's most heavily armed borders.

This angered his critics, who said blurring the legality of the NLL compromises South Korea's territory and insults the soldiers who died defending it. Dozens of sailors from both Koreas died in naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 over the disputed boundary. The two Koreas have agreed to the regular train service from December. But the North's powerful military, fearful of increased contact with the outside, has blocked previous attempts to run trains at two crossings built by the South. North Korea has a 1.2 million-strong military, most of whom are stationed near the border. The United States has about 28,000 soldiers in South Korea to support the country's 670,000 troo
