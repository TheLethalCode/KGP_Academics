 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  A special court dealing with corruption cases Monday sentenced Firoz Mahmud, former assignment officer to Khaleda Zia, to three years in jail for not submitting his wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission in time. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judges' Court-1 set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises delivered the verdict, which will come into force on the day of his arrest or surrender. Firoz is currently evading arrest in the case filed by ACC deputy director Syed Iqbal Hossain with Tejgaon Police Station on Aug 5. The ACC served the notice in July on a host of suspects, including Firoz, seeking wealth statements and accounts of all assets within seven days. bdnews24.co
