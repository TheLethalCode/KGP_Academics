<TITLE> Prodi sets Italy confidence vote, communists irked </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Tuesday called for a confidence vote on pension and labour market reforms attached to the 2008 budget in an attempt to end coalition bickering over the proposals. If Prodi loses the vote, to be held on Wednesday or Thursday in the Chamber of Deputies, he would be forced to resign, but he has an ample lower house majority so the vote is not expected to pose an immediate threat to his coalition government's survival. One communist party in Prodi's alliance, unhappy at his unwillingness to accept its demands, said the prime minister was pandering to big business and demanded the start of a "new phase" from January, marked by more left-wing policies. "There has been an extremely strong rupture within the coalition," said Communist Refoundation leader Franco Giordano, but he added that his party, the second largest in Prodi's coalition, would toe the line in the confidence vote. He also denied a report that his party would withdraw its members from government posts including Prodi's cabinet. Prodi's 9-party Catholics-to-communist government has bickered endlessly since it was elected in April last year, with divisions spanning foreign, social and economic policies. The main plank of the pension and labour market bill, which was presented in July, is to dilute a pension reform approved by the previous centre-right government which would have raised the minimum retirement age to 60 from 57 from January 2008. Prodi considered that too drastic, and under his own plan the retirement age would be raised by just one year to 58 from January, with further increases envisaged in future years. In 2009, the minimum retirement age would pass to 59 with the added requirement of 36 years of pension contributions. In 2011, the minimum age would reach 60 and rise to 61 in 2013, with no change to the required 36 years of contributions. Communist Refoundation has been pushing Prodi to soften some marginal aspects of the reform package even further, moves which have been fiercely opposed by a centrist coalition party led by former premier Lamberto Dini. Prodi, for the umpteenth time, has been trying to broker a deal among the opposite wings of his coalition by offering what he calls "minimal" concessions to the communists. Among these, he has agreed to stricter limits on temporary contracts than envisaged by his amended reform -- if agreed by trade unions and employers -- and curbs on the activity of private employment agencies. Dini had threatened to vote against the government if any changes were made to the amended reform, which was approved by workers in factory ballots last month. Prodi would win the confidence vote even if Dini's tiny Liberal Democrats group voted against him but his government, already deeply unpopular, would emerge even more weakened. His situation is much more difficult in the Senate, where he has a majority of just two seats and frequently relies on the support of unelected life senators to pass legislation.
