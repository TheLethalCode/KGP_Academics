 BEIJING, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion in an illegal fireworks workshop in central China killed thirteen people on Tuesday, state media reported, just days after police launched a safety crackdown against fireworks manufacturers. The blast in rural Hunan province tore apart a house where villagers were assembling the firecrackers that many Chinese people let off at weddings and other celebrations, Xinhua news agency reported. Six people were injured, the report said. The explosion came two days after five children were killed and one seriously wounded by a blast when playing in an abandoned firecracker factory in the country's north.

Last week, China launched a safety drive among firework makers after a string of explosions killed 40 people since October, state media report
