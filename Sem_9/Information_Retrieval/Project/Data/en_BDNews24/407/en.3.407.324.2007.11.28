<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Khandaker Delwar Hossain has questioned the neutrality of the chief election commissioner over his remark on party registration, which the BNP leader said was 'unnecessary intrusion'. "It is not his job to decide what the constitution of the party would be. His neutrality has come under question," Delwar, nominated secretary general by chairperson Khaleda Zia, said at his NAM flat Wednesday. "BNP as well as the nation apprehends whether the commission will be able to hold a fair election," he said to reporters. Delwar asked CEC ATM Shamsul Huda not to make further remarks on the constitution of the party. Huda during electoral reforms dialogue with Workers Party Tuesday said many political parties including BNP would need to change their constitutions to get registered with the Election Commission. "A number of political parties will have to change their constitutions, otherwise they won't be considered fit for registration." "I've read the party constitution of the BNP. I'm afraid they'll have to change theirs too," the top polls official said. Delwar, a former chief whip, said, "Sitting in a constitutional post he cannot make such comment on the constitution of a political party. This is interference. "His remark gives one the impression that the commission is looking for ways to bar Khaleda Zia's BNP from the election." He said BNP nurtured democracy and even though its constitution mandated the chairperson with absolute power, she made decisions consulting the party forum. "If there is no constitution in the BNP how come the party has gained such popularity? This party has restored parliamentary democracy. But it is not clear to me why some leaders proposed reforms to the party after Jan 11." "Our chairperson said 'the constitution can be reformed in the interest of the party.' But it cannot be done keeping her behind bars. Reforms cannot be carried at the instigation of a certain quarter or imposed from the top." In a reply to a question, Delwar said, "BNP has millions of leaders, activists and supporters and the public will not accept the idea of an election leaving the party out." On the arrival of the US navy ships to help relief efforts for the cyclone victims, he said, "They participated in such relief operations in the past. We hope they will return to their country after completing their job as they have done before." He said BNP was working in the cyclone-hit coastal areas and asked the government to start agricultural rehabilitation programme, write off loans and supply fertiliser. bdne
