 LONDON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks traded mixed in morning trade on Wednesday as the impact of gains in banks was offset by declines in miners, while company results came in mostly ahead of estimates. Banks including Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale rose between 1.5 and 2.0 percent, inspired by overnight gains on Wall Street, while UBS advanced on market talk of stake building by Chinese banks.

By 0920 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was off 0.1 percent at 1,461.1 after falling nearly 1 percent in the last two sessions. The benchmark rose as much as 0.6 percent earlier on Wednesday. The index has lost 8 percent so far this month, placing it on track for its worst monthly fall since Dec. 2002.

Frankfurt's DAX was up 0.2 percent and Paris's CAC-40 fell 0.3 percent. Energy shares tracked a dip in crude oil prices with Total and Royal Dutch Shell both down 1 percent. UK caterer Compass rose 5 percent as it reported a 42 percent rise in annual underlying profit and said it was cutting costs and raising prices to cope with accelerating food price inflation.
