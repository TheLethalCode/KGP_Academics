 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com) Cricketers to be selected for the tour of New Zealand get another round to play in the National Cricket League as new coach Jamie Siddons wants to see his boys in action on the filed. Australian coach Siddons, who took over the Tigers' charge in the last week of October and went back to Australia, is scheduled to return to Dhaka Sunday and witness their performance. "National coach Jamie Siddons is scheduled to watch the cricketers in action during the matches," said a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) press release Saturday. The sixth round four-dayer starts November 27 with league leaders Khulna taking on holders Dhaka at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium, Rajshahi facing Sylhet at Narayaganj Osmani Stadium and Chittagong playing against Barisal at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. "He (Siddons) is supposed to witness the match between Khulna and Dhaka along with the Rajshahi-Sylhet match," BCB cricket operation chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu told bdnews24.com by phone Saturday. "The national camp for the New Zealand tour was scheduled to start on November 27, but the coach wishes to watch the cricketers on the field," Lipu added. The national cricketers will gear up for the New Zealand tour on December 2, said Lipu. However, Bangladesh's one-day squad for the New Zealand tour will be announced on November 26, one day before the sixth round four-dayer gets started. "We are going to announce the ODI squad first as it commences first and the Test squad will be announced later and the selected Test cricketers will join the squad one week before the Test series," chief selector Rafiq-ul-Alam told bdnews24.com. When asked whether there would be any new blood in the ODI squad, Alam said, "Maybe or may not be. You definitely know about whom we are thinking, but we have to think more on whether to bring new blood for the tough tour of New Zealand." The chief selector earlier said that Khulna opener Imrul Kayes and Barisal pacer Sajidul Islam had drawn the selectors' attention. bdn
