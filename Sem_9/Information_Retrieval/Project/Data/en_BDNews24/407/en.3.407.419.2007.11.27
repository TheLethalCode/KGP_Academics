 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The National Narcotics Control Board expressed its 'dissatisfaction' Monday with the Department of Narcotics Control, a government official said. In a meeting held at the home ministry, DNC officials were asked to offer their best service despite their limitations. The board called on DNC officials to be more dynamic, saying that improved performance would result in increased facilities, said the official with knowledge of the meeting, preferring anonymity. Law adviser Mainul Hosein presided over the 10th meeting of the board. The board formed a committee headed by home ministry additional secretary Sheikh Abdur Rashid to resolve the backlog of narcotics cases. Home secretary Abdul Karim said the meeting decided to grant gun licences to DNC officials. The DNC director general is expected to submit a proposal on how many officials will need licences. Karim said the committee would resolve some 36,000 outstanding cases under the narcotics control law and decide on 45,000 alleged convicts. The board decided to allow five-star hotels and over 200 bars to continue to sell alcohol. It also decided to form anti-drug committees at educational institutes to halt addiction and usage rates. Karim said, "We have decided to conduct a survey to ascertain the total number of drug addicts. The ministry will begin this as early as possible." bdnews2
