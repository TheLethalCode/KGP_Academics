 DHAKA, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The European GSP facility for Bangladeshi textile products has been 'misused', prompting Germany to slap 12 percent import duty on Bangladeshi products in case of suspected shipments, said a German embassy official Sunday. "A large number of documents pertaining to the general system of preferences were falsified," said Holger Fraider, economic and press counsellor of the German embassy in Dhaka. "Somebody took advantage of the facilities. Therefore the German finance ministry imposed the 12 percent duty (for suspected shipments)," he said at a press conference on German Textile Machinery Technology symposium. The official said Bangladesh government was expected to send a delegation to the European Union and Germany to resolve the issue. He told bdnews24.com that some positive events took shape in Bangladesh for continuing the preferential facilities for textile products in the European markets. "The EU can withdraw restrictions on the textile products from China sometimes in 2008. Therefore, Bangladesh will have to ensure quality of their textile products to survive in the European markets." Ragner Strauch, director of export marketing of German Textile Machinery Association (VDMA), told the conference that the two-day symposium would be inaugurated by industry adviser Geetera Safiya Choudhury on Nov 26 at Sonargaon Hotel. Strauch said Bangladesh's textile market was expanding fast and there was a huge demand for quality textile machinery from Germany. "Bangladesh was expected by many to become a loser of the termination of the textile quota system in 2005. Quite contrary to these pessimistic forecasts, the textile industry of the country has seen an upward trend since 2006," Strauch said. "Our fantastic 2006 exports to Bangladesh worth nearly 60 million euro are just another proof of Bangladesh's efforts to meet the requirements of the post-quota era," he said. bd
