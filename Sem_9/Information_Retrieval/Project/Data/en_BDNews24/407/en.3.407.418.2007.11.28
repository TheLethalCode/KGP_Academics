The mercurial playmaker has been an outcast at Villarreal since falling out with coach Manuel Pellegrini midway through last season. "I am a simple person and all I want is to play football every Sunday," Riquelme was quoted as saying in Spanish media on Wednesday. "This move is the only chance I have to play at the next World Cup, which is the thing that motivates me most." While he has not played in the Primera Liga in the current campaign he has continued to shine for Argentina in their World Cup qualifiers. Riquelme, former club Boca and Villarreal are set to close a deal that will allow him to move back to Argentina. "People should know that of the three parties I am the one who has made the biggest effort and that I have offered to play a year for free with Boca. "I have told Villarreal they do not have to pay me what they owe me for another year and a half (the outstanding time left on his contract with them)."
