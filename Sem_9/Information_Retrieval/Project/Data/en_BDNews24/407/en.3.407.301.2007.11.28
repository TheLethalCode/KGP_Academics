<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The state-owned oil companies Meghna and Jamuna are set to offload their shares on the stock market by mid-December, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Wednesday. "If floated, the shares of the state-owned companies will add depth to the capital market," Azizul said after chairing a meeting on "Off-loading shares of energy and power ministries" at the finance ministry. The meeting also approved off-loading of 35 percent government-held shares in the IFIC Bank by next month. Meghna Oil Company Ltd and Jamuna Oil Company Ltd are two state-owned oil marketing companies that do petroleum trading and operate depots and filling stations. A third state-owned oil company, Padma, is already in the capital market. Energy ministry officials said shares of Meghna and Jamuna would come to the market through the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh rather than initial public offerings. Wednesday's meeting also recommended the power ministry offload a further 15 percent shares of Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd (Desco) and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) on the stock market. Currently, some 25 percent shares of these two companies are on the capital market. Officials said some companies under the gas sector were also likely to hit the market by March next year to fulfill the longstanding demands of investors. Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman initiated offloading of shares of SOEs. "The process is going on at full speed, as officials of the SOEs have been asked to complete the required steps soon," Azizul, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told reporters The planned offloading of government shares in the state-owned enterprises has been hanging in the balance for quite sometime although the then finance minister had directed the authorities to complete it by Oct 31, 2006. The finance ministry issued a circular on Jan 30 this year outlining the timeframe for floating SOE shares on the capital market by April this year. bdnews24
