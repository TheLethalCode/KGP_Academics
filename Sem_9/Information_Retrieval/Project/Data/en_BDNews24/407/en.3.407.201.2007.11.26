Milan kept delaying his comeback and the club's medical staff later admitted misdiagnosing the strain. He hit a post in Cagliari during a solid display and also won a soft penalty which Kaka missed. "I'm doing things slowly but I'm not too far from my best form. I had two chances where I've been close to scoring a goal," he told Sky television.

He has slimmed down slightly and wants to show Milan he can still be as devastating as he was several years ago. "We'll see how well I do this year then we can see about a new contract," he added. Ronaldo was cup-tied for Milan's Champions League triumph last season following his January move from Real Madrid but hopes to be involved in Wednesday's Group D trip to Benfica where the holders can qualify for the last 16 with a victory.
