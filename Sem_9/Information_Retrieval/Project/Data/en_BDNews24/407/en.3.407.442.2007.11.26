 DHAKA, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Sunday stayed a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) decision to relegate Brothers Union and Indira Road KC to the First Division for two months from the Dhaka Premier Cricket League. A High Court bench comprised of justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and justice M Farid Ahmed passed the order in response to a writ petition filed by Brothers Union, lawyers and club officials said separately. M Zaheer moved the petition for Brothers Union. The BCB last month demoted the two teams in line with by-laws after the clubs failed to turn up for a play-off relegation match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Indira Road KC, Brothers Union and City Club were the three bottom finishers in last season's 12-team Premier Cricket League. They were set to play a relegation league among themselves. But the BCB then led by Mahbub Anam failed to organise the relegation league in time and a new ad-hoc committee asked the trio to play the relegation league in October, three months after the season ended. The clubs defied the play-off decision and sent a legal notice to the BCB, which the apex cricket body ignored.
