 Alip Ghatak bdnews24.com Correspondent BAGERHAT, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Eight days after cyclone Sidr devastated many southern districts, relief is yet to filter down to some of the hardest hit and neediest communities. Mosharraf Hossain from Khalulia Union in Bagerhat, was beaten while waiting for relief, as locals become increasingly frustrated over the apparent administrative inaction. "I went to get relief at my local Union Parishad office. We waited for a long time but nothing came. When I protested a UP member beat me up and broke my hand," said Mosharraf. Mosharraf said he lost everything, including his house, when the cyclone ripped through his community. "My family is spending night after night in the open, without any food. No relief has arrived for us yet. We don't have any money either, so how will I get my broken hand treated," said Mosharraf. Accusations of mismanagement surrounding the relief effort have surfaced in many of the cyclone effected areas. Hundreds of men, women and children crowd the ferry terminal for Khalulia Union waiting for relief, and rumours are now spreading that the union chairmen and members are delaying the process of distribution in some way. Many allegations have been made against Ward-7 member Amir Hossain for misappropriating relief supplies for his family. Amir Hossain denies the allegations: "A total of 3,000 people were affected in my area. I only received 125 cards from the government. That's why people became infuriated. But what can I do?" Morelganj Upazila official Krishnakant Biswas said a new list of affected families was being prepared that would target the people most in need of relief materials. bdnews24.com/
