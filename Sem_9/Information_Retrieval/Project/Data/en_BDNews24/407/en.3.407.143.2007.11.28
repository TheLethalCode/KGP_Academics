<TITLE> Oil dips below $94, dollar and stocks struggle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell below $94 a barrel on Wednesday, pinching Asia's leading resource stocks, while nagging fears that a credit market squeeze will sap global growth weighed on the dollar and the region's exporters. News that top US bank, Citigroup, got a $7.5 billion capital injection from Abu Dhabi's investment arm on Tuesday buoyed US stocks and the dollar, which scored its second-biggest one-day gain this year. European shares were seen tracking Wall Street and edging higher on Wednesday after two days of losses. But the confidence boost proved short-lived for Asian stocks, which gave up early gains against the backdrop of weak US economic data, prompting wary investors to take profits on the dollar's jump and a rare bounce in bank stocks. "The Citigroup (news) is important but it's one small aspect of the bigger picture," said Peter Vann, head of investment research at Constellation Capital Management in Australia. "It's highly likely there is going to be greater losses." Tokyo's Nikkei average finished 0.5 percent down, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was steady at 0600 GMT, having tumbled almost 12 percent from a record high at the start of the month. DOLLAR RETREATS The dollar dipped 0.25 percent to 108.50 yen after Tuesday's 1.5 percent jump, setting exporters such as as Toyota Motor under renewed pressure. The euro slipped below 161 yen and was little changed against the dollar at around $1.4816, still within sight of a record high of about $1.4966 set on Nov. 23. "The market is quite volatile," said Gerrard Katz, head of North Asia foreign exchange trading at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. "There's still general year-end risk aversion and position squaring." US crude eased to as low as $93.72 a barrel, its lowest since Nov. 19, pressured by concerns about global economic growth and prospects the OPEC exporters' cartel will lift output. Gold which serves as an inflation hedge and often moves in step with crude, extended Tuesday's losses and fell below $805 an ounce. MORE TURMOIL? Abu Dhabi's purchase of a 4.9 percent stake in Citigroup lifted financial shares on Tuesday, suggesting battered bank stocks may start looking attractive again, but investors remain wary the credit turmoil is not over yet. Credit Suisse has said it expects a bigger fourth-quarter net loss at Citigroup, citing further deterioration in capital markets, while Wells Fargo & Co, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender, said it will take a $1.4 billion fourth-quarter charge related to losses on home equity loans. Strong hints from two Federal Reserve Bank officials that they would not support an interest rate cut next month even after U.S. consumer confidence hit a two-year low in November were a further drag on the financial sector. Citigroup fell 2.9 percent in Tokyo after its U.S.-listed shares gained 1.5 percent and leading Japanese banks Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho Financial also fell by 1.6 and 1.8 percent respectively. Resource stocks also came under pressure following the fall in commodity prices. Mining giant BHP Billiton slid 1.6 percent, while gold miner Newcrest Mining and energy firm INPEX Holdings both lost more than 4 percent
