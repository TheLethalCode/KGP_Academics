 TOKYO, Wed Nov 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US envoy to talks on ending North Korea's nuclear arms program will visit Pyongyang next week on a trip seen as key to clinching by year's end a deal that leads to the North's removal from a US terrorist blacklist. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill is to meet North Korean counterpart Kim Kye-gwan and possibly other officials in Pyongyang during his December 3-5 visit, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said in Washington.

North Korea closed down its main reactor in July under the February agreement. In exchange for disabling its plutonium production facilities, the impoverished state will receive 1 million tons of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid, while Washington will move towards taking North Korea off a US list of states that sponsor terrorism. "This visit will be crucial for whether North Korea completes disablement and gives a full account of its nuclear programs and the United States expresses by the end of the year its intent to take Pyongyang off the list," said Noriyuki Suzuki, chief analyst at Tokyo's Radiopress, which monitors North Korean media. A round of six-party talks among North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China is expected to take place in Beijing from December 6 to 8, but no official dates have been s
