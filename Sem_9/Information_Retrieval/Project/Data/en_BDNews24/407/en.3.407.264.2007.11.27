 COLOMBO, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran on Tuesday accused the international community of failing his rebel group and said they were partly to blame for Sri Lanka's killing of a top aide in an air force bombing raid. Prabhakaran said he had no hope of a political settlement with the Sri Lankan government, and exhorted the entire Tamil-speaking world to back the rebels' fight for an independent state in the north and east of the island. "This partisan and unjust conduct of the international community has severely undermined the confidence our people had in them," Prabhakaran said in an annual "Heroes' Day" address to commemorate slain rebel fighters. "And it has paved the way for the breakdown of the ceasefire and the peace efforts." "The international community's economic and military aid, its moral and political support, its diplomatic efforts, and its one-sided involvement directly aided this turn of events," Prabhakaran said. He accused Nordic truce monitors of covering their eyes and tying their hands behind their backs, and said the island's main donors, the United States, Norway, Japan and the European Union, of failing in their responsibility. "By only paying lip-service to peace, the international community has contributed to the killing of an extraordinary son of our nation," he added, referring to former political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan, killed in an air raid this month. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are angry at being outlawed as a terrorist group by a host of countries, including by the European Union bloc last year. He accused Norway, the main mediator in peace efforts, of "remaining silent". "The international community has made the entire Tamil world drown in its tears," Prabhakaran said. Prabhakaran called for a mass uprising by Tamils around the globe. But with the Tigers and the government already back at war, the speech lacked the fiery ultimatums of previous years. "To expect a political solution from any of these southern parties is political naivety," he said. "I ask the entire Tamil speaking world to rise up for the liberation of Tamil Eelam." "Those who plan to destroy the Tamil nation will in the end be forced to face their own destruction," he added. The Sri Lankan government has evicted the Tigers from strongholds in the east with a series of military offensives, and has vowed to wipe them out altogether militarily despite calls from the international community to stop and talk peace. Fighting is now focused in the north, where the Tigers control around 15 percent of the island, hemmed in behind a shared "border" that separates their de facto state from the rest of Sri Lanka. There have been near daily land and sea battles, bombings and air raids in recent months, and around 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam since early 2006 alone. That takes the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,000, and analysts say the war is likely to grind on for yea
