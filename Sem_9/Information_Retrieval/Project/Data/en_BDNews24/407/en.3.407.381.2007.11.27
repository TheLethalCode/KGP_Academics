 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government has apprehended that the country might face a food shortfall of about 10 lakh tonnes this year due to floods and cyclone, a government official said Monday. Acting secretary to ministry of food and disaster management, Ayub Miah said: "Though we have sufficient stock we have to remember that the country has faced two floods and a devastating cyclone. The farmers could not harvest crops. So we will have a shortage of food." The ministry had 735,000 tonnes of food grains in stock, compared to 629,000 tonnes last year, according to the acting secretary. Despite this, Ayub said, if foods are not imported now the stock will decrease by March. "It will have a bad impact in the market. That's why the government is giving priority on import." The acting secretary said foreign donor agencies had been asked to import food instead of obtaining it from the domestic market. He said India had already withdrawn its ban on exporting food including rice, and had initially allowed export of 50,000 tonnes of rice to Bangladesh. Bangladesh would further be able to import rice as per its requirement. The Indian authority has asked the Bangladesh government the quantity of rice needed. The government will inform them of the required amount in a day or two. The neighbouring country was also donating 10,000 tonnes of food grains as government relief, the acting secretary said. "The Indian government will send 40,000 tonnes [worth $2 million of rice and 1,000 tonnes of baby food," he added. The death toll due to cyclone-Sidr reached 3,243 Monday afternoon, Ayub said, after 44 bodies were recovered from Barguna alone. bdnews24
