 Bishkek, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyz Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev resigned on Wednesday just weeks before a snap parliamentary election in the volatile Central Asian country. Atambayev, a moderate opposition leader, joined President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's government in March at the height of political turmoil in Kyrgyzstan as a bridge between the president and the country's fierce opposition movement. "The president accepted Atambayev's resignation today," said Nurlanbek Shakiyev, a Bakiyev spokesman. He said Atambayev had received another job offer but did not elaborate. Atambayev spearheaded a wave of mass anti-Bakiyev protests in 2006 calling on the Kyrgyz leader to resign. He later switched sides to help Bakiyev's government but remained loyal to the opposition movement, his supporters say. A total of 12 parties, including the pro-Atambayev Social-Democratic party, have registered for the Dec. 16 parliamentary election, designed to ease tensions after two years of political instability. Atambayev could not be reached for comment on whether he was planning to focus more on his party's activities after his resignation. Bakiyev came to power in 2005 after protests ousted his long-serving predecessor, Askar Akayev. Ever since, a parliament elected under Akayev in a disputed vote has been at the centre of the political instability
