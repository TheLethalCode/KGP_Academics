<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday handed over the latest publication of the Bangladesh Code to chief justice Md Ruhul Amin at the chief justice's office on the Supreme Court premises. The Bangladesh Code has 38 chapters in total. Mainul, speaking to reporters after meeting the chief justice, said he had not discussed a meeting of the justices over tea, much vaunted by the media. "Questions over a judge's honesty or professional integrity should be investigated. The chief justice was very cordial about that," said Mainul. "Many people thought the separation of the judiciary from the executive would result in a lot of litigation. That did not happen." "Case proceedings have become faster now," he added. bdnews24
