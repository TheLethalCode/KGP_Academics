 Shehabuddin Kisslu bdnews24.com Correspondent NEW YORK, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The United Nations Friday announced that it would disburse an additional $6 million to support relief efforts for hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors in Bangladesh, as UN agencies continued rushing aid to the affected population. The new disbursement comes atop $9 million already granted by the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund after the disaster hit on November 15, said the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The UN Children's Fund , meanwhile, reported that a recent mission to the hardest-hit areas in Bangladesh showed that damage was worse than expected. "The cyclone has predisposed thousands of children and women to the increased risk of illness and death due to malnutrition," said Dr Iyorlumun Uhaa, chief of health and nutrition for Unicef Bangladesh. Of the estimated five million people affected, half are children600,000 of them are under the age of five. "The cold weather and vulnerability to cold, hunger, trauma, diarrhoea and other communicable diseases will increase many times over unless urgent life-saving assistance is provided to children and women immediately," Uhaa said. The agency is procuring 100,000 blankets, 60,000 articles of children's clothes, 60,000 family kits, and 60,000 plastic sheets for use in cyclone-stricken areas, and has moved two mobile water treatment plants to hard-hit districts. Unicef is also working with non-governmental organisations to identify separated, unaccompanied and distressed children who are being registered with the local government authorities. "Separated and unaccompanied children are living without care, security and support facilities," said Aissa Sow, Unicef child protection officer. "The children are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. In other cases, it is hard for the affected families that lost everything to adequately care for children." bd
