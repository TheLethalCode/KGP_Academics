 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com MONGLA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  No ordinary man dares to walk 90 kilometres through a dense jungle known to be the home of the Royal Bengal Tigers, some of whom feast on men. That is, until he is left with no choice. Delwar of Banshkhali and his younger siblings Hamid and Siraj did just that, having survived wind blasts with speed of over 250 km per hour when cyclone Sidr had struck. They had hung on to dear life for the first three days following the cyclone on airdropped food, and the next three begging alms from neighbours. On the seventh day, the trio started for Khulna, attempting to trek the path through the Sundarbans mangrove forest, fraught with tigers and crocodiles, from Dublar Char, an isolated strip of islands some 85 km south off Mongla port. From there they planned to go to Banshkhali in Chittagong to their loved ones. "Are you fleeing? Where are you going?" a magistrate's assistant on board a trawler carrying a rescue team with relief materials shouts at them. The trio shakes their heads. "No. We are going to Khulna," Delwar answers. "How will you go there?" "On foot," comes the reply. "Going to Khulna on foot? Get on the trawler," the assistant asks them. Getting anywhere from Dublar Char through deep jungles without any means of transportation was mighty tough, if not impossible. The rivers Pashur and Shibsha are the only means to get to Mongla. Delwar said they had come to Dublar Char by a cargo vessel but started for Mongla without knowing how to get there on foot. On the night the cyclone slammed into the coasts, Delwar and his brothers were at a small shoal near Dublar Char. His two fellows had managed to scamper to a shelter, but Delwar was carried away by a big wave. "All of a sudden, I found a tree. I spent the night on the branch of the tree. I could not get down as tigers were down there. "Many people spent that night on trees to avoid falling prey to the tigers. It was scary. I could not believe I going through this nightmare." Delwar came across a co-worker who had hung on to another tree in the morning and together they buried bodies of five whom he had worked with. Many people like Abul Kalam and Shahidul of Satkhira were searching for their missing relatives. Shahidul and his fellows were on a boat in a small canal on that night. "I think Allah saved me with his own hand," Shahidul says. Shamsher Ali and Abul Hossain of Banshkhali were also on board a trawler that night. Heavy wind and storm surges carried the trawler away from the river. "I would be better off dead than be in this pain after the storm. I had food after three days," Shamsher says. He and his friends were confined to the forests for two days. They came out on the third day, numbed with hunger. "Have you seen mama (tiger)?" one asks Shamsher. "Yes, on the second day," Shamsher replies. "Are you joking with us?" Shamsher thunders, on hearing the question. "It was only 10 to 15 feet away from us," he says. They escaped the storm and the tiger easily but could not escape from the owner of the trawler. Trawler owner Bholanath had lost fishing nets and 12 employees to the storm and was desperate to make up for the losses. He decided to sell the labour of Shamsher and other employees to another trawler owner Bijoy, Shamsher and his friends said. And while Bholanath was asleep, Shamsher's fellow Abul Hossain decided to flee. On Nov 21, relief workers found Shamsher and Abul on a tree. "The owner wants to sell us," one of them says. Bijoy had a contract that Bholanath would pay him Tk 23,000 for five months. But he paid Tk 8,000 in two months and was to pay the rest after five months. Bholanath wanted to sell the services of Shamsher and Abul to Bijoy for these three months. But they do not know if they would get the money at all. They would have to work double shifts if they were sold to another owner. They also spoke of the torture meted out to them by the trawler owner. "Why did you climb up the tree?" someone asks. "I thought I would call a trawler if I saw one," Shamsher says. "What would happen if it would be the trawler of your owner instead of a relief trawler?" "We would flee into the jungle," he said with a smile on his face. All of them are under the care of the navy bdnews24
