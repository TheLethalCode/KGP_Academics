<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bahamas has ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, raising to 141 the number of full member states, the Vienna-based agency that administers the pact said on Tuesday. But the treaty, which prohibits all nuclear explosions, will not enter into force before it is ratified by all 44 states listed in an annex that took part in the 1996 treaty negotiations and have nuclear power or research reactors. Ten of the 44 have signed but not ratified the pact, including Iran, Israel, North Korea, India, Pakistan, China and the United States. The last five are declared nuclear weapons states, while Israel is widely assumed to be one but never confirmed this. Iran denies Western suspicions that it is secretly trying to build nuclear weapons, insisting its uranium enrichment programme is for electricity generation only. States that have ratified the treaty urged laggards at a September review meeting to do the same as quickly as possible to prevent a loss in credibility of the pact.
