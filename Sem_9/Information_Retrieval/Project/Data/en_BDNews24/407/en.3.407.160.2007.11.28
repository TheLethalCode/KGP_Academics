 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday set Dec 3 for hearing on charge framing on the Tk 3 crore extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others in presence of the accused in the dock. Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Azizul Haque said the hearing would be held in the same court but the venue of hearing would be shifted to Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. As the counsel for the accused did not receive the copy of the order for shifting the trial venue to Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, the judge Wednesday started proceedings at the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court at Johnson Road in Old Dhaka and set the new date On Nov 18, the case was transferred from additional chief metropolitan magistrate's court to Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge's court for trial. Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Ltd, filed the case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station. He charged Hasina, sister Sheikh Rehana and cousin and former health minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of taking Tk 2.99 crore in bribes in return for allowing him to build a power plant in Siddhirganj, Naraynganj, during Hasina's regime in 1996-2001. "The trial of the case will start at the special court set up in Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban for safety reasons," chief special public prosecutor (PP) ABM Sharfuddin Ahmed Khan Mukul told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "We haven't received the copy of the gazette given from the solicitor wing of law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry stating that the trial will start at the special court of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. We have informed the judge of the matter," lawyer for the accused Quamrul Islam said Tuesday. Quamrul said they would appear in the metropolitan sessions judge's court as per the previous date. "If the accused are produced before the court in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar we will not be able to participate in the hearing for charge framing. We will not get justice." Advocate Mukul has been appointed chief special public prosecutor (PP) to run the case, said a gazette signed by the deputy solicitor to law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry. Syed Shamim Ahsan Habib, Golam Kibria, Md Borhan Uddin and Md Shohidul Islam Sardar have been appointed special public prosecutors to assist the chief prosecutor. A gazette signed by the assistant secretary of the ministry on Nov 26 asked the sessions judge, five PPs, the incumbent PP of the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court and the plaintiff of the case to take necessary steps. Sheikh Selim on June 20 gave a confessional statement under section 164 at Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Police formally charged Hasina with extortion on July 24 after her arrest on July 16. bdnews2
