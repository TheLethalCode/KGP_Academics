 BUDAPEST, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Hungarian parliamentary committee on Friday rejected the nomination of a former student of a KGB spy academy in Moscow as the country's spy chief, but the government vowed to push ahead with the appointment. Parliament's national security committee rejected Sandor Laborc's nomination by a single vote after a legislator from the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the Socialist-led coalition government, abstained. No reason was given for the decision, but Laborc is known to have spent 6-1/2 years at a KGB academy in Moscow. Jozsef Gyulas, the Free Democrat who abstained, said the party would accept the nomination if it was made by Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, and a top Socialist minister said he would propose Laborc provided nothing came out in his security screening. "If Sandor Laborc passes the type C screening procedure then I will propose him to the prime minister despite the decision of the committee," Gyorgy Szilvasy, the minister in charge of secret services was quoted by news agency MTI as saying. The previous incumbent resigned earlier this year. Laborc, 49, acting director general of the National Security Office, attended Moscow's Felix Dzerzhinsky University in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His nomination has sparked a political storm at home, with the opposition Fidesz party saying Hungary's Socialist government and Gyurcsany are too close to Russia, but Hungary's NATO allies have voiced support. Unlike some ex-communist states that have now joined NATO and the European Union, Hungary has no bar on former communists holding office and there has been no process of lustration of former communist agents.
