 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  A high-powered relief committee headed by communications adviser MA Matin Saturday started work in cyclone-hit areas, a government spokesman said. The committee will coordinate relief efforts out of Barisal, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a meeting of the interim cabinet Saturday. Munaim said the body also included a general officer commanding (GOC) of the army, a divisional commissioner and other government officials. Munaim replied to queries about failures in relief distribution saying: "The reasons could not be known. Today's meeting decided to strengthen relief operations. Fourteen US helicopters have started working in the affected areas. I hope necessary relief materials will reach all areas." The press secretary said the meeting discussed the overall situation in cyclone-affected areas. Getting relief materials to victims, restoring power, building houses, repairing roads, ensuring emergency healthcare and increasing the supply of drinking water were the key items on the agenda, Munaim said. As many as 25,800 VGF cards will be distributed among the affected people from Dec 1. Each card holder is entitled to 15kg of rice a month. The divisional commissioner will take necessary steps if any family needs more rice, Munaim said. The VGF programme will continue through March. "The power supply would be ensured in cyclone-hit areas by Nov 30. It will take a bit longer to restore power to Patharghata, Barguna and Swarankhola, Bagerhat. A powerful generator was sent to the disaster area and three more will soon follow." Munaim said the US navy started work to set up a water purification plant with the ability to supply 10,000 litres of water an hour. Many non-governmental organisations set up tubewells. According to the press secretary, 690 medical teams were at work in the areas. Flying hospitals sent by Pakistan had started work. The government allocated Tk 90 crore for the repair of educational institutions. Each family will be given Tk 10,000 to build a house. The press secretary said the cyclone destroyed crops on 26 lakh hectares. The cabinet Saturday discussed whether microcredit could be managed through local banks for small business in the fisheries sector, but no decision was made. The government looked into whether or not a community radio service could be launched to air weather reports to fishermen. The meeting decided to form a technical committee to repair embankments and cyclone centres. The Economic Relations Division was given the responsibility of maintaining contact with donor countries. bdnews24.c
