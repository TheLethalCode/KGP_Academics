 BADEN, Austria, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia pushed for an extension of talks with Kosovo Albanians in a bid to head off a threatened declaration of independence on a second day of negotiations on the future of the Serbian province. Counting on Western support, Kosovo's 90-percent Albanian majority says it will declare independence from Serbia after a UN-set December deadline, probably in January or February.

Kosovo spokesman Skender Hyseni said Serbia had offered "nothing new" beyond its plan for broad autonomy along the lines of Hong Kong or Finland's Swedish-speaking Aland Islands. Serbia's hardline prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, did not attend the dinner. The Serbs complained Western promises to back a unilateral declaration of independence by the territory gave its Albanian majority no incentive to negotiate in good faith. "I think it is absolutely critical that there is no encouragement of this illegitimate and illegal and very dangerous course of action after Dec 10," Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said late on Monday.
