<TITLE> Govt's relief efforts lack coordination: Ershad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Former president HM Ershad Monday said the government's relief distribution in the cyclone-hit southern region lacked coordination. He demanded that the government imported rice in advance from abroad to make up for the grains lost to cyclone Sidr. Ershad spoke to reporters at his Banani office after his tour of the southern districts of Patuakhali, Barguna and Barisal a day before. He asked the government to deliver relief goods through central storehouses set up in the district headquarters to make sure those in dire need get the supplies. "It will be good if the relief is distributed this way," he said. "Sidr might have devastated 42,000 tonnes of food grains," the former military strongman said. He asked the government to import rice in advance so that the impending food crisis could be tackled. Ershad demanded that the interim administration took up programmes such as introducing village loan and building embankments and cyclone shelter. "It is unfortunate that no shelter centre has been built in the southern areas since 1991. More shelter centres should be built," he said. In reply to a question, he said, "There is no relation between relief disbursement and politics. It would be good if the two leaders (former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina) were released and joined relief activities." Acting Jatiya Party chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud and presidium member Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu were present at the office. bdne
