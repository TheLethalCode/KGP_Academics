 Madrid, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Villarreal missed the chance to go top after only drawing 1-1 with Almeria at El Madrigal. Leaders Real Madrid's 1-1 draw at Real Murcia on Saturday had left the door wide open and Villarreal looked to be on course when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci burst clear to score in the 14th minute. However, Almeria, who had not scored in their previous four matches, levelled through former Real youth team striker Alvaro Negredo early in the second half. Real stay top with 29 points, one ahead of Villarreal and two clear of arch-rivals Barcelona, who beat Recreativo Huelva 3-0 in the Nou Camp on Saturday. ATHLETIC BILBAO 2 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 2 Depor defender Antonio Barragan looped a header over his goalkeeper for an own goal in the 23rd minute and David Lopez made the most of a miscued shot to add a second in the 54th. Depor fought back with Riki's fierce long-range drive from a laid-off freekick in the 63rd and Uruguayan striker Sebastian Taborda got a draw with a header in the 89th minute. ATLETICO MADRID 4 VALLADOLID 3 The game was only three minutes old when Atletico's Portugal midfielder Maniche burst clear to score at the near post but Valladolid levelled in the 40th through striker Victor. Sisi volleyed the visitors ahead in the 49th but two minutes later Argentina forward Maxi Rodriguez fired in the equaliser. In the 54th Joseba Llorente restored Valladolid's lead with a header but again Maxi levelled two minutes later. Atletico lost fullback Juan Valera to a red card in the 72nd but in the last minute Diego Forlan's cross was headed into his own net by Valladolid defender Pedro Lopez. LEVANTE 4 REAL BETIS 3 Betis looked on course for their first away win, storming into a two-goal lead with a volley from Arzu in the ninth minute and a penalty from Edu in the 25th. Levante's Italian Damiano Tommasi pulled one back in the 38th and striker Riga looped in a header in the 41st to level at 2-2. Riga lashed in a spectacular solo effort in the 49th but Argentine striker Mariano Pavone equalised for Betis in the 52nd. Javi Fuego put away a loose ball for a Levante win in the 81st and Betis had defender Juanito sent off two minutes later. OSASUNA 1 ESPANYOL 2 Espanyol winger Valdo set up Angel Martinez to fire the opener in the 30th minute and two minutes later Valdo burst into the area, turned his marker inside-out and scored the second. Osasuna pulled one back with a header from striker Javier Portillo in the 75th but slipped to their third straight defeat. RACING SANTANDER 1 VALENCIA 0 Racing had the edge in a tight game with few chances and it needed an error from Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares to break the deadlock when he misjudged Jorge Lopez's fierce shot in the 70th minute. Valencia's Brazilian midfielder Edu returned to action after almost a year out following knee surgery. VILLARREAL 1 ALMERIA 1 Villarreal took control when Guillermo Franco threaded a ball through for Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci who nutmegged the keeper in the 14th minute. Promoted Almeria ended a four-match goal drought when striker Alvaro Negredo volleyed the equaliser in the 53rd, denying Villarreal the top spot in the Primera Liga. REAL ZARAGOZA 1 GETAFE 1 Getafe midfielder Francisco Sousa pounced on a defensive error to score in the 65th minute, but a lapse in concentration at the other end allowed midfielder Andres D'Alessandro to sneak an equaliser in the 80th. While a distracted Getafe were more concerned with asking the referee to wait as their substitute got into position, D'Alessandro took a quick freekick into the empty net
