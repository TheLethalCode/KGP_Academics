 ISLAMABAD, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani troops, backed by helicopter gunships and artillery, have begun a ground offensive against pro-Taliban militants in a troubled northwestern valley, killing at least 30 of them, the military said on Sunday. More than 300 people have been killed since October in clashes between troops and militants loyal to a radical Islamist cleric, Maulana Fazlullah, in the scenic Swat valley of North West Frontier Province.

Militants infiltrated from strongholds in the tribal region of North and South Waziristan on the Afghan border to support Fazlullah in recent weeks, while the country's focus was on Islamabad and President Pervez Musharraf's emergency rule.
