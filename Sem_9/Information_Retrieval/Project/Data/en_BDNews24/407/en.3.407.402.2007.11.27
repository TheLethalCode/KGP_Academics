 COLOMBO, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirteen civilians were killed by a Sri Lankan military mine in rebel-held Killinochchi on Tuesday, the Tamil Tigers said, while the government said the air force bombed a rebel radio station. The military denied the attack on civilians in rebel-held Kilinochchi but said the air force hit the radio station there. The respective claims came as fighting has intensified between government forces and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels. The Tigers said the air raids killed five radio station staffers and four others, including a 14-year-old girl. "Thirteen civilians including 11 school children were killed by a Sri Lanka army deep penetration unit claymore attack in Iyankilam in (the) west of Kilinochchi," Selvy Navaruban, Tiger spokeswoman on humanitarian issues and human rights, told Reuters by phone earlier in the day. The rebels said the civilians were participating in the Tigers "Heroes' Week" celebrations when the military unit exploded the claymore fragmentation mine. The rebels often use such mines against government forces. The military said it bombed the rebel radio station in the north hours before the annual policy statement by rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, delivered to conclude "Heroes' Week". "Air Force fighter jets bombed a LTTE Radio Station in Thiruvaiaru, Kilinochchi this evening, Pilots have confirmed that the target was successfully engaged and destroyed," a spokesman at the media centre for national security said. Separately the military denied it had ground units operating in the rebel-held area where the Tigers said a mine explosion had killed civilians. "How can we go to Kilinochchi. It's not possible," said military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, adding it was either a rebel mine or set off by some other group. He did not elaborate. There was no independent confirmation. Military analysts say both sides exaggerate enemy losses and play down their own. The Tigers say they are fighting for an independent state for minority ethnic Tamils in the north and east. Now the fighting is concentrated in the north after the military evicted Tamil Tiger rebels earlier this year from jungle terrain they controlled in the east. Around 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the LTTE since early 2006. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the war erupted in 19
