 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The third largest African operator Celtel has stepped up its move to expand the world's lone borderless mobile phone services across the continent. Its "One Network" now connects over 400 million people in 12 African countries and together their landmass is more than twice the size of the European Union. Celtel had stunned the world by scrapping the roaming fees across its networks in the Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in September 2006. The Economist magazine had commented, "Celtel has, in effect, created a unified market of the kind that regulators can only dream about in Europe." Overwhelming popularity of this innovative package has prompted the Celtel's management to abolish roaming fees in its remaining markets of Burkina Faso, Chad, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria and Sudan. It means all Celtel customersboth prepaid and post-paidcan now move freely across the 12 nations. They can make calls and send SMS at local rates and receive incoming calls free of charge. "They can top-up their prepaid phones with locally-bought airtime cards which can easily be bought at more than 500,000 points of sale," Celtel announced Thursday. "The One Network service is simple to use and is automatically activated upon crossing into any one of the other countries, with no prior registration required or sign up free charged." Celtel's parent company Zain Group's CEO Saad Al Barrak said: "The innovation behind and the expansion of the world's first borderless mobile phone network is a reflection of our dedication to the African continent and its people." "We have revolutionised telecommunications in Africa and we intend to roll out this service to more of our operations on the African continent and in the Middle East," said the $28 billion conglomerate's head. The extension of One Network is crucial to Celtel's strategy of ensuring that their customers in Africa are connected through one borderless network, an initiative that remains unique in the world. Celtel began mobile phone operations in 1998. Since then it has deployed networks in 15 African countries that cover more than a third of the continent's population. It has more than 24 million customersthird in Africa behind MTN and Vodacom. bdn
