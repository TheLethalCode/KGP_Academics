Many failed to save their belongings. The deputy police commissioner for Tejgaon, Mahbubur Rahman, told bdnews24.com that the dead were pulled from the debris after the fire was tamed at about 9:30pm. A journalist counted eight charred bodies on the scene. The dead could not be immediately identified. The fire started in a shanty and spread to other slum dwellings near Sadek Khan Petrol Pump, police sub-inspector Ismail Hossain said.

Most of the dwellers are workers. bd
