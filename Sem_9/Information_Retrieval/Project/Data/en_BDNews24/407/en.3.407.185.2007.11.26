<TITLE> 2007 most critical year for Bangladesh: Hua Du </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Asian Development Bank's country director has said Bangladesh is going through the most critical and challenging year in its 36-year existence. "Really, the country is heading towards difficulties following the floods and the devastating cyclones," Hua Du told reporters Monday at the launch of Quarterly Economic Update on Bangladesh. "I'm here for about five and a half years and I'm linked to this country since its independence," said Du in the bank's Dhaka office, "but I have never sensed such difficulties the country is going to face this year." She said the floods and cyclones caused extensive damages to the agriculture sector by affecting crops, livestock, poultry and aquaculture. The quarterly report recast the country's GDP growth below 6 percent in the current fiscal year (2007-08), compared to 6.5 percent in the previous fiscal year because of natural calamities and a slowdown in export. Tackling soaring inflation and the food shortage would make the challenge more difficult for the government, she said. Replying to a query, she said release of business leaders detained on graft charges would have a positive impact in regaining business confidence. The Sept 2007 edition of quarterly economic update says the country's overall economic performance will slow down because of adverse impact of floods and cyclone. Agriculture sector suffered serious damage due to two consecutive floods and deadly cyclones, it said. "Production loss because of flooding is estimated at 1.3 million tonnes. The mid-November severe cyclone also damaged 38 percent of aman areas in the coastal districts," the report says. "The losses could be offset by a bumper boro crop production." Growth of industry and services sectors is also declining because of a drop in external demand for exports, erosion in business confidence and vigorous anti-corruption drive. Exports in July-September period of 2007-08 fell by 5.4 percent compared with the same period of the last fiscal year. The report says pressures on fiscal balance are likely to heighten by a rise in spending for the post-cyclone relief operations, expansion of food-assisted safety nets and imports of food grains and fertiliser. "The fiscal deficit of 4.2 percent projected in the budget may exceed this year," Rezaul Karim Khan, head of economics in ADB, Dhaka office, said. The report hailed the government's efforts to boost revenue earnings. "The revenue collection increased by 21.8 percent in July-October of FY 2007-08 over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year." ADB said rising oil and food grain prices had been threatening the balance of payments outlook. But the workers' remittances continue to provide a cushion to the balance, it added. Rise in international commodity prices (oil and non-oil) and shortfall in domestic food grain would continue to threaten the price pressure, it said. b
