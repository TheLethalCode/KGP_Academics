<TITLE> Germany arrests Georgian opposition leader: paper </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German police have arrested exiled Georgian opposition leader Irakly Okruashvili in Berlin, a newspaper reported on Wednesday. The Berliner Zeitung cited Berlin state prosecutors as saying they had an application for his arrest from Georgian authorities and were considering a request to extradite him. No one at the Berlin state prosecutor's office could immediately confirm the report. Okruashvili left Georgia earlier this month under government pressure. He had accused Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili of corruption and plotting the murder of a leading businessman. His accusations, vigorously denied by Saakashvili, led to his arrest in Georgia. He was released on bail after retracting the statements and flew to Germany shortly after.
