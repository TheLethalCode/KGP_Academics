 LONDON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities hit the day's strongest levels in morning trade on Tuesday, recovering from early losses, after an encouraging trading update from Barclays supported banks. Barclays shares jumped 5 percent after the British bank said it is on track to meet analysts' expectations for earnings growth of 4 percent this year, saying diversification had shielded it from recent turbulence in capital markets. "The market should be relieved that there were no further BarCap risks announced and trading elsewhere is in line with expectations," said James Hutson, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, referring to Barclays' investment banking arm. By 0940 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent at 1,469.3, near the day's high of 1,470.1 and recovering from some of Monday's 0.6 percent fall. The index is still down 8 percent so far this month and about 1.0 percent in the red so far this year. Asian equities recovered from lows after Citigroup said it is selling a $7.5 billion stake to the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, giving the largest US bank fresh capital as it wrestles with the subprime mortgage crisis. "It is just a sign that valuation in companies are low but the question of confidence remains," said Eric Mijot, deputy head of equity investments at Societe Generale Asset Management in Paris. Around European markets, London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.2 percent, with banks taking pole position. Paris's CAC-40 was up 0.1 percent and Frankfurt's DAX lost 0.4 percent. Data on Tuesday showed German corporate sentiment unexpectedly rose in November as companies took a more upbeat view of current business conditions than a month earlier. The Munich-based Ifo economic research institute's business climate index, based on a monthly poll of around 7,000 firms, registered 104.2 after 103.9 in October and compared with market estimates for a drop. BANKS ADVANCE Banks recovered from Monday's sharp losses, with Royal Bank of Scotland up 3.9 percent, BNP Paribas gained 3.8 percent while UBS added 3 percent. Some strategists however said risks remained for banks. The DJ Stoxx banking sector index has tumbled 18 percent so far this year, topping losers in the 18 groups in the DJ Stoxx 600 index. "The big risk on financials is that if you just have one bad news, it could be bad for the sector and one good news is not sufficient to be positive on the sector," said Mijot. US equities extended losses after the close of European trading hours. The S&P 500 index tumbled 2.3 percent to end at 1,407.2, hit by worries over the impact of rising mortgage defaults and credit market losses on the economy. US stock index futures traded higher on Tuesday. Technology and telecom shares were weaker in Europe, with Nokia down 2 percent and BT off 0.8 perce
