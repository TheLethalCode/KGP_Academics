<TEXT>
 MORONI, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The African Union has extended sanctions on Comoros' rebel Anjouan island by two months and requested extra soldiers during the latest political crisis in the coup-prone Indian Ocean archipelago. Angry at Anjouan leader Mohamed Bacar's defiance of Comoros' national government and refusal to hold new elections, the pan-African body in October put a travel ban on him and 144 others in the local government, military and election board. The AU also imposed a freezing of funds and other financial assets. It has troops patrolling the waters around Anjouan, as well as ports and airports at the archipelago's other two islands, Grande Comore and Moheli. The AU has told Anjouan to hold fresh elections or face a total air and sea blockade, which would hit the rocky island's roughly 300,000 people. "The council decides to extend the measures ... for an additional period of 60 days," said an AU Peace and Security Council statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It said Anjouan had not taken any of the measures required, and also condemned a counter-move last week by Bacar, who issued a list of 60 people forbidden from entering or leaving Anjouan. They included Comoros' federal President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, a former imam who hails from Anjouan. The AU statement also "encourages troop-contributing countries to deploy extra troops" to Comoros. Believed to have several hundred soldiers there already, the AU did not specify by what number it wanted to increase the contingent. WILLING TO NEGOTIATE On Tuesday, Bacar, a French-trained former gendarme, repeated his wish to negotiate while insisting he would only hold elections if Comoros' two other islands did the same. "When we're talking about elections just in Anjouan because 'King Sambi' wishes it, then I say no," he told Reuters. In June, he declared victory in a poll for the presidency of Anjouan island that went ahead despite an order from the federal government to delay it. The dispute has brought new instability to the archipelago of about 700,000 people, which has seen some 19 successful or attempted coups since independence from France in 1975. Lying off east Africa, the three islands retain some autonomy through local leaderships under the terms of a 2001 peace deal, but also share a rotating national president. First settled by Arab seafarers 1,000 years ago, and later a haven for pirates pillaging ships in the Indian Ocean, the Comoros were annexed by France in 19
