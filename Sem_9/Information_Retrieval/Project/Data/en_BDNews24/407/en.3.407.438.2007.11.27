<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Tuesday said US warship Kearsarge would not remain in Bangladesh longer than necessary. But the adviser would not define how long it would be necessary. "They (US warships) will not stay a day more than necessary," Chowdhury told journalists following a meeting with foreign diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The adviser briefed diplomats about relief and rehabilitation operations in the meeting. "The adviser has said 500 thousand tons of rice would be necessary by March," British High Commissioner in Dhaka Anwar Choudhury told journalists after the meeting. He expressed satisfaction over the government's relief operations. "Given the size of the disaster, experts say this is a good response from the government," the British envoy said. He said British assistance would not be distributed through government channels. "We will distribute assistance through different channels. We have distributed assistance through the UNDP and we have NGOs channels," Choudhury said. Iftekhar told journalists that he asked diplomats to distribute relief materials only through the government. bdnew
