 CARACAS, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he expects to win Sunday's constitutional reform referendum on scrapping term limits by 10 percentage points, but said his opponents will cry fraud and promote violence if they lose. The Venezuelan leader faces the toughest vote of his career, with recent polls showing at best a technical tie on Dec. 2 for the leftist former soldier who has cruised to ballot box victories about once a year since his first 1998 election.
