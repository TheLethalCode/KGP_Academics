 LONDON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares erased early gains to follow Asian markets lower on Wednesday as a Wall Street bounce failed to wipe out concerns about the health of the banking sector hit by the credit crisis. This week's news that Citigroup received a $7.5 billion capital injection from Abu Dhabi's investment arm buoyed banking stocks and calmed investor nerves as the sector wrestles with the fallout from the US subprime mortgage crisis. Investors are not without worries, however, and price action has been choppy due to constant speculation about possible further writedowns by banks and persistent stress in the money market because banks are hoarding cash as a contingency against any more credit-related losses.

Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 4 basis points, while emerging stocks were down a quarter percent. The dollar hit a one-week high of $1.4724 per euro. UBS's equity flow indicator showed a strong decrease in selling momentum of U.S. stocks last week, while the euro zone suffered the strongest outflow since May this year. "A sustained shift in favour of dollar-denominated assets would certainly assuage dollar-negative sentiment. Also, given that consumer spending is not deteriorating more markedly, there is some risk of a near-term squeeze of short-dollar positions," the bank said in a note to clients. The December Bund future was down 10 ticks. US light crude fell to $94.25 a barrel before a crucial OPEC meeting next week. Gold slipped to $798.85 an oun
