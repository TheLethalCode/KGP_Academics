 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday stayed the wealth statement notice served by the Anticorruption Commission on former prime minister Khaleda Zia. It also issued a rule nisi to the ACC chairman, home secretary and an ACC deputy director to explain within eight weeks why the notice should not be declared illegal. An HC bench of justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Zubayer Ahmed Chowdhury delivered the order following a writ petition filed by Khaleda's lawyers Thursday. The detained former prime minister's lawyers filed a writ petition with the HC on Nov 22 challenging the ACC letter to Khaleda. The graft watchdog served notice on Khaleda on July 18 setting her an initial seven-day deadline, but she finally turned in her wealth statement on August 6 as the deadline was extended. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 in a graft case, filed by the ACC, along with her son Arafat Rahman Coco. Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury told reporters that the commission would go to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court to move against the HC stay order. "We will keep the matter within the frame of law. We will not let our activities defy laws by any means. Possible legal steps will be discussed in the meeting of the commission Monday," Chowdhury said. bdnews24.com
