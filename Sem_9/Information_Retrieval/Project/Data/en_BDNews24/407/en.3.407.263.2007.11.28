 (Adds details, background, quotes) Johannesburg, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale, seen as a possible ANC presidential candidate, said on Wednesday Jacob Zuma was likely to win the contest to lead the ruling party. He also denied in a radio interview media reports that he had offered to fund Zuma's campaign. "The way I see it, Jacob Zuma may come out the winner," he told SAfm. "When you look at the numbers, when you look at the trend, that's why we talk about indications, the trend is that Jacob Zuma is likely to win this presidency." Sexwale did not rule himself out of the campaign but acknowledged that Zuma was significantly ahead. "I will consider whether I want to make myself available," he said, adding it was not too late to compete. ANC Deputy President Zuma is leading incumbent party and national President Thabo Mbeki ahead of an African National Congress conference next month that will choose new leaders. In voting this weekend, Zuma won nominations from five of nine provinces, as well as support from the ANC Youth League and the Women's League, dealing a major blow to Mbeki's hopes to win a third term as party leader. Traditionally the ANC president would also become the national president in elections scheduled for 2009 because of the party's grip on South African politics. But this year's race pits Zuma against Mbeki, who cannot by law run for re-election as national president. Analysts say Mbeki is fighting to stay on as party leader to remain a force in politics and have a hand in selecting his successor. Sexwale, a former politician turned businessman, is seen as a possible compromise candidate in a race that has plunged the ANC into some of the deepest divisions in its history. Zuma was fired by Mbeki as national deputy president in 2005 after being linked to allegations of corruption, and may still be recharged. He has strong backing from the country's trade unions and communist party, raising concerns among investors that he will divert away from Mbeki's market friendly economic policies. But Sexwale said he had confidence in Zuma's ability to lead the country. "I have no doubt about his leadership, I never questioned that. He was the deputy president of the country," Sexwale said
