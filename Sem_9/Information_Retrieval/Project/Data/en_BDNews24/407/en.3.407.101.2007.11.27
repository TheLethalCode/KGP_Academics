 BAGERHAT, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday asked people to distribute relief in coordination with the administration. "Those who want to deliver relief will have to discuss with the local administration to fix which areas need relief," the caretaker boss said to reporters at Barisal airport lounge. He briefed the media after visiting the cyclone-battered areas of Sharankhola, Mothbaria and Kathalia and distributing relief. He said some political parties had joined relief efforts and all of them should come forward to tackle the disaster. "The army, navy and air force and private administration are rendering relentless service collaboratively. They will pursue their job to the end." "The people of the affected areas need food, cloths, water and health service. We are distributing them adequately." Referring to the government's steps he said, "We have reinforced relief activities. In some areas we have started rehabilitations." On the decision taken on the meeting of the council of advisers, Fakhruddin said, "The government will provide the affected fishermen, livestock farm owners and small businessmen loan on easy conditions." The government's microcredit lending wing Palli Karma Sohayak Foundation will distribute Tk 130 crore in loan to fisheries, livestock and agriculture in the distressed areas. The Chief Adviser's Relief Fund has already disbursed Tk 28 crore for building houses, he said and has allocated another Tk 20 crore considering the extent of losses. Some 26 lakh affected card holders will receive VGF (vulnerable group feeding) facilities from Dec 1 and it will continue for four months. TR and food-for-work programmes will be sustained as well. The chief adviser said the steps to repair infrastructure in the cyclone-hit areas would help to create employment. On waiver of agricultural loan in the stricken areas, he said, "The related banks have been asked and they will consider the matter." The NGOs working in those areas have also asked to halt their loan recovery activities, Fakhruddin told reporters. bdnews
