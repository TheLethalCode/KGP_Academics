<TITLE> Public opinion rife over relief efforts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Public opinion of relief operations was strained Monday, 11 days after cyclone Sidr slammed the coast. US participation in the relief effort, in the form of amphibious attack shipseach armed with over 20 helicoptershad earlier been questioned by some groups, adding another dimension to testy public opinion. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday fought shy of a direct reply to repeated questions on whether the US ships had arrived in Bangladesh at the request of the caretaker government. US navy ships will stay in Bangladesh as long as necessary for relief operations, a spokesman for the Armed Forces Division said Monday. The USS Tarawa, a United States Navy amphibious assault ship, will join the relief effort in five days, general staff officer-1 (foreign affairs and protocol) lieutenant colonel Shamsur Rahman told reporters in a press briefing. The USS Kearsarge will leave Bangladesh waters with the arrival of Tarawa, but the 25 officials attached with Kearsarge will stay back in Bangladesh, he said. Former president HM Ershad, although full of praise for the government's relief effort, returned from storm-hit areas saying that the emergency relief effort lacked coordination. Weak aid coverage is illustrated by such places as Khajur Tola in Barguna, where food relief to the village's 220 families are an on-again-off-again enterprise. Despite the fact that the cyclone-battered village is just six kilometres form Barguna town, relief operations to it were few and far between. Some beleaguered storm survivors were avoiding their homes at night to evade NGO and bank collectors who were coming at all hours of the day to collect unpaid loan installments. Another survivor said she had not seen the chairman of the union in the past 11 days. bd
