<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Cyclone Sidr has affected about 4.7 million people in worst-hit districts and a further 2.6 million people, most of them the "poorest of the poor", are in need of immediate help, the United Nations said in a report. In the Rapid Initial Assessment Report released Thursday, the UN said the period for immediate relief assistance should be a minimum of two to three months. "Extended relief might be necessary for some of the worst affected areas, however recovery and rehabilitation efforts should start soon after," it said. The report listed three highest priority areas for assistance: food, shelter and cash. "Sanitation and drinking water assistance is also badly needed. Medicines and medical supplies are needed in some areas, but there was general consensus that these needs are relatively lower." The UN said the restoration of communications and electricity supplies were high priorities, while communications were restored in most areas, the same was not true for electricity. "Therefore this continues to be a major concern." "Transportation services are also in need of support, both for land and water transport. This is necessary not only for the resumption of commerce and economic activities, but it also critical for an efficient, effective and timely relief response." The report said damage to livelihoods was large. "In particular, the fisheries and agricultural sectors will need strong support." "The expansion of safety nets for relief, and the early startup of public work schemes to generate employment and much needed household income, are key strategies for early recovery." The UN recommended that early recovery, longer-term recovery, and rehabilitation should incorporate a strong element of sound planning with an emphasis on reducing the risks of future disasters. bdn
