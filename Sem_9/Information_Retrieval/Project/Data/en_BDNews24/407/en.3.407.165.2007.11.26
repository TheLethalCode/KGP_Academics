 Durban, November 25 (bdnews24.com)- AB de Villiers, JP Duminy and Mark Boucher powered South Africa to a thrilling two-wicket win over New Zealand in the first one-day international on Sunday. After New Zealand had totalled 248 for six, South Africa reached their target off the last ball of the match with two wickets to spare. "We expected New Zealand to be very competitive in this format and we expected a good contest against them," South Africa captain Graeme Smith told reporters. "This is a good reality check because to win a tight game is always good." De Villiers scored 87 to marshal the first half of the innings, Duminy took charge of much of the chase with his 46, and Boucher's 35 not out completed the job. New Zealand did themselves no favours by dropping De Villiers on 21, Boucher on five, and Andre Nel, who was 10 not out, on nought in the final over. Jamie How's career best 90, which surpassed his previous best of 66 against West Indies in Wellington in 2005-06, guided New Zealand to their respectable total. How steadied New Zealand in a second-wicket stand of 72 with opener Brendon McCullum (40), which was ended in the 23rd over when off-spinner Johan Botha bowled the New Zealand wicketkeeper. Scott Styris (40) helped How add 75 runs for the third wicket before he skied a delivery from fast bowler Nel to mid-on, where Botha held a steepling catch. Nel, who took 3-46, returned for his second spell to end How's innings in the 48th over when the New Zealander drove hard at a delivery pitched outside his off stump and edged the ball on to his middle stump. RETURN CATCH With his next delivery, Nel bowled Gareth Hopkins leg stump. Medium pacer Kyle Mills, whose captured a career best 5-25, reduced South Africa to 9-2 in the fifth over by bowling Morne van Wyk (0) and having Jacques Kallis (1) caught at first slip by Ross Taylor. Smith (44) and De Villiers stood firm in a stand that reached 91 before Smith top-edged a pull off medium pacer Styris and was caught by Chris Martin on the mid-wicket boundary. De Villiers and Duminy scored steadily together to put on 72 for the fourth wicket, a stand ended in the 39th over when left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori plucked a neat return catch high above his head to remove De Villiers. South Africa's challenge threatened to fizzle out seven overs later when Duminy mistook a catch to substitute fielder Jeetan Patel at midwicket but the gritty Boucher held the lower order together and steered the home side to victory. New Zealand captain Vettori rued the final over from fast bowler Mark Gillespie, which cost 11 runs, and the three dropped catches. "Mark Gillespie is probably one of our best death bowlers, and if we had taken a catch or two it might have made all the difference," Vettori told a news conference. "We should have won the game.
