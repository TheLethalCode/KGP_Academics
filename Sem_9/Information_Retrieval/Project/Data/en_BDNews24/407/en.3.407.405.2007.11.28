Sheikh Belal Uddin, Khulna bureau chief of the Daily Sangram and president of Khulna Metropolitan Journalists' Union, was injured in a bomb blast at Khulna Press Club on Feb 5, 2005. The explosion occurred as Belal was getting on his motorbike in the front yard of Khulna Press Club on his way home. The bomb had been suspended from the handle of the motorbike in a bag. The grievously wounded Belal was admitted to Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka, where he died from his injuries on Feb 11. The verdict sentenced all three convicts to separate life terms and fines on charges of both homicide and breach of the Explosives Act. All sentences are to be executed simultaneously for the three. The court acquitted Dhira and two others, as charges brought against them could not be substantiated. Reacting to the verdict, Khulna Metropolitan Journalists' Association president Md Anisuzzaman and general secretary HM Alauddin told bdnews24.com that they were not satisfied with the judgment. Khulna Sadar Police sub-inspector Aminul Islam filed the case on the night of the blast under the Explosives Act. On Feb 11, murder charges were included in the case.
