 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh has voiced support for Sri Lanka's diplomatic efforts to hold a special Commonwealth meeting on terrorism next year. "Bangladesh supports the Sri Lankan initiative to host a Commonwealth special ministerial meeting in Colombo focused on 'terrorism' sometime next year, possibly in March," Foreign Adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told his Sri Lankan counterpart Rohitha Bogollagama Thursday. The two spoke at a sideline meeting of the ongoing Commonwealth heads of government summit in the Ugandan capital Kampala, according to the Bangladesh foreign ministry. The Sri Lanka initiative to hold the special meeting comes as the country continues to be crushed by a civil war waged by the minority Tamil rebels since 1984. The Tamil secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is branded as a terrorist organisation by 32 countries including the USA, the European Union, India and Malaysia
