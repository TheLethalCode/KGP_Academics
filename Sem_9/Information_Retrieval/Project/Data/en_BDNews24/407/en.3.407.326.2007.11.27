 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The government fears a food shortfall of about 10 lakh tonnes this year due to the floods and cyclone, a government official said Monday. "Though we have sufficient stock we have to remember that the country has faced two floods and a devastating cyclone. The farmers could not harvest crops. So we will have food shortage," acting secretary to ministry of food and disaster management Ayub Miah said. "We have 7, 35, 000 tonnes of food grains in stock. The amount was 6,29,000 tonnes in the last year," he said. The secretary said the foreign donor agencies had been asked to import food instead of collecting them from the domestic market. "If foods are not imported now, the stock will decrease in March. It will have a bad impact on the market. That's why the government is giving priority on import." Ayub said India had already withdrawn its ban on exporting food including rice and announced to initially export 50, 000 tonnes of rice to Bangladesh. Bangladesh would be able to import rice it needed and inform Indian authorities of the quantity in a couple of days, the acing secretary added. India was also donating 10,000 tonnes of food grains in relief, he said. "The Indian government will send 40,000 tonnes of rice worth 2 million dollar and 1,000 tonnes of baby food," he added. The death toll from cyclone Sidr until Monday afternoon reached 3,243 after the recovery of 44 bodies in Barguna and the number of missing was 880, Ayub said. bdnews24.co
