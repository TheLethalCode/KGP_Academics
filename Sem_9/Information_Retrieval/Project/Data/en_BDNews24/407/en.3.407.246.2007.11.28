 VATICAN CITY, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Governments must do more to help young immigrants and refugees assimilate in host countries and protect them from sexual exploitation and human trafficking, Pope Benedict said on Wednesday. For their part, immigrants must obey laws and never resort to violence, Benedict said in a message for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of Migrants and Refugees, which will fall on Jan. 13. The Pope issued his message as rich countries around the world, from the United States to Europe, are engaged in heated debates about immigration and its effect on everything ranging from national culture, to education, to crime. In the two-page message, the Pope said the vast globalisation process had created many problems. Young immigrants, including children, too easily fell victim to the worst form of exploitation, he said. "These boys and girls often end up on the street abandoned to themselves and prey to unscrupulous exploiters who often transform them into the object of physical, moral and sexual violence," he said. "While it is true that much is being done for them, even greater commitment is still needed to help them by creating suitable hospitality and formative structures." According to the United Nations UNHCR refugee agency, there are nearly 33 million asylum seekers, refugees and others whose situation is of concern to the UNHCR. The Pope said concern for the problems of immigrants seeking a better life should not detract attention from the plight of the millions of victims of forced migration, especially children. "It is impossible to remain silent before the distressing images of the great refugee camps present in different parts of the world," he said. "How can we not think that these little beings have come into the world with the same legitimate expectations of happiness as the others?" For their part, the Pope said, immigrants must "scrupulously and seriously" fulfil their duties to host countries. "Be respectful of the laws and never let yourselves be carried away by hatred and violence," he said. Earlier this month, Italy and Romania were mired in a bitter diplomatic rift over Rome's decision to deport dangerous foreigners, most of them Romanian immigrants involved in a spate of crimes in the Italian capital.
