 NOUAKCHOTT, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixty illegal African migrants have escaped custody in Mauritania, where they were being held after their boat was stopped from reaching Spain's Canary Islands, a Red Cross official said on Wednesday. The men were among 125 migrants captured by the Mauritanian navy on Monday off the coast. The remaining 65 have already been repatriated to Mali and Senegal, the official said. "The illegal migrants were intercepted on Monday in Moroccan waters," Mohamed Ould Hamada, the Red Cross representative at the port city of Nouadhibou, told Reuters. "During their transfer to the beach, around 60 were able to escape." Migrant boats from Senegal, Gambia and Guinea travel northwards along the Mauritanian coast before turning west towards the Canary Islands. Illegal migrants, desperate for a better life in Europe, pay thousands of dollars each for a place in one of the overcrowded, rickety boats which attempt the perilous voyage. Hundreds of impoverished West Africans perish each year in the arduous journey. At the start of this month, at least 47 migrants died in the same waters off Nouadhibou as they tried to reach the Canary Islands.
