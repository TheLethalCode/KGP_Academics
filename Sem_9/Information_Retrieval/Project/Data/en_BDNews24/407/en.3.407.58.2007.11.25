<TEXT>
 VATICAN CITY, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict on Sunday led a solemn ceremony in which he bestowed 23 new cardinals with their rings of office and urged them to work for peace. The Pope presided over the ceremony in St Peter's Basilica a day after he elevated the prelates from around the world to the elite rank in the 1.1 billion-member Roman Catholic Church. As each of the cardinals knelt before him, Benedict slid the ring of office on their finger and, speaking in Latin, told them it should always be a symbol of their love for the Church. Earlier, in his sermon in front of the central altar of the flower-bedecked basilica, he asked them to work and pray for peace and unity. "Prayer for peace and unity constitutes your first and principal mission ...," he said. The new cardinals come from Italy, Iraq, Ireland, Germany, the United States, Spain, India, Argentina, Kenya, Mexico, Poland, Senegal, Brazil and France. When he elevated them to the new rank on Saturday, he appealed for an end to the war in Iraq and decried the plight of the country's Christian minority. One of the new cardinals is Emmanuel III Delly, the Baghdad-based Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans are Iraq's biggest Christian group and the Chaldean rite is one of the most ancient of the Catholic Church. Eighteen of the new cardinals are under 80 and eligible under Church rules to enter a secret conclave to elect a new pope after Benedict's death. The other five, including Delly, are over 80 and were given the honour for symbolic reasons or to thank them for long service to the Church. Cardinals are the Pope's closest aides. They lead major dioceses around the world, head Vatican departments and advise him on matters affecting everything from faith to finances. The new "electors" include Archbishop John Patrick Foley, a former Vatican official from the United States, Daniel N DiNardo, Archbishop of Galveston-Houston, and Archbishop Paul Joseph Cordes, a German based in the Vatican. Archbishops Andre Vingt-Trois of Paris, Oswald Gracias of Bombay, Francisco Robles Ortega of Monterrey, Mexico, John Njue of Nairobi and Sean Baptist Brady -- Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland -- are also electors. Church law sets a ceiling of 120 on the number of "cardinal electors". The total number of cardinals, including those over 80, is now 2
