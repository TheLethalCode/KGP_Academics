<TEXT>
 Dhaka, November 25 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein said Sunday that the caretaker government is considering making loans easily available to fishermen and farmers in the cyclone-ravaged south. After a meeting with senior journalists from the media in his office, the adviser said: "A great disaster has hit the country. The media must be careful, and ensure accurate information reaches the right group of professional people." Mainul said foreign friendly nations and the US Navy had come forward to help Bangladesh even before their assistance had been called for. "People in the south do not know when they will receive their next packet of relief. This uncertainty will be taken care of as soon as possible," said Mainul. "The people must believe that the government will always stand beside those affected by such tragedies," he added. The adviser said he was mainly organising relief distribution through deputy commissioners and local UNOs. "The government also welcomes all who would like to help those affected by the cyclone, however, that assistance must reach the needy through a coordinated system, or there will be anarchy," he said. bdnew
