 GAZA, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Palestinians joined an anti-Annapolis rally in Hamas-run Gaza on Tuesday, chanting `Death to Israel, death to America' and calling President Mahmoud Abbas a traitor for attending the peace talks. Speaking at the protest in Gaza City, leaders of the Islamist group which seized the enclave from Abbas's forces in June said the president had no right to make concessions to Israel at the US-sponsored conference near Washington. "Let them go to a thousand conferences, we say in the name of the Palestinian people that we did not authorise anyone to sign any agreement that harms our rights," Mahmoud al-Zahar, a Hamas leader, told a cheering crowd. "Anyone who does so will be judged by history as a traitor." Waving Palestinian flags as well as the green Hamas banner and black flag of the Islamic Jihad faction, protesters shouted "Abbas is a traitor" and "We will not recognise Israel". Journalists estimated that up to 100,000 people took to the streets. Hamas put the number closer to 250,000 -- similar to the turnout at a rally called by Abbas's secular Fatah faction earlier this month for the anniversary of Yasser Arafat's death. Abbas hopes the Annapolis conference will launch formal negotiations to create a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while Hamas and Islamic Jihad claim a right to all the land that is now Israel. "There will be no concessions over one inch of Palestine. We will defend this land by our flesh and we will water it by our blood," Islamic Jihad leader Mohammed al-Hindi told the rally. Security forces in Ramallah, Abbas's West Bank stronghold, dispersed crowds after scuffles at a protest there. In Lebanon, several hundred Palestinians protested at the Ain al-Hilweh camp, home to 70,000 refugees, chanting "Overthrow the Arab traitors," in reference to Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Syria which are attending the conference. Hamas's seizure of Gaza prompted Abbas to sack a Hamas-led government and accelerate peace talks with Israel. Hamas, which is shunned by the West for refusing to renounce violence, was not invited to Tuesday's conference in Annapolis. Israel views Gaza as an "enemy entity" and launches regular raids into the territory to curb rocket attacks. Hamas and Palestinian medics said Israeli troops killed two Palestinian militants and a civilian in Gaza on Tuesd
