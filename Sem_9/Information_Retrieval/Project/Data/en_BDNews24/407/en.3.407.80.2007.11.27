 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Shahriar Nafees hammered a century against Chittagong Tuesday, a day after he was axed from the national team, on the first day of the sixth round four-dayer of the National Cricket League. Barisal were 239 for seven at stumps against the hosts at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Farhad Hossain and Anisur Rahman also smacked centuries as Rajshahi were 256 for five against Sylhet at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Fifties from Nazmus Sadat, Mustafizur Rahman and Tushar Imran helped Khulna put on 239 for seven against Dhaka at the close of the first day at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. Barisal vs Chittagong It was a one-man show for Barisal as captain-cum-opener Nafees stuck to one end while other batsmen fell cheaply. Nafees hammered 108 while Raisul Islam (40) was the second highest scorer after Hannan Sarkar (10), Imran Ahmed (12) and Rakibul Hasan (24) Arafat Salahuddin (9), Shaheen (1) and Talha Jubair (7) returned cheaply. Chittagong pace duo of Tareq Aziz (3/77) and Kamrul Islam (3/83) dented the Barisal batting. Rajshahi vs Sylhet Rajshahi struggled after opting to bat first, losing openers Jahirul Islam (2) and Juaned Siddique (8) to a superb spell by medium pacer Tapash Kumar Baishya. Farhad and Anisur, however, rescued Rajshahi to 221 for three from a precarious 16 for two, putting on 205 before Farhad was run out. Farhad scored a patient 106 off 252 balls featuring 12 fours while Anisur retired hurt on 102 off 209 balls, hitting as many fours. Khulna vs Dhaka Openers Nazmus Sadat and Imrul Kayes gave Khulna a decent start putting on 64 runs before Imrul holed out to Mehrab Hossain Junior off Mohammad Ashraful for 13. Sadat pairing with Mostafizur added 49 runs for the second wicket before edging one behind the wicket, but by then he made a 133-ball 61. Mostafizur (62) and Tushar Imran (54) steadied the Khulna innings before they slipped to 237 for seven from 213 for four as occasional leg-spinner Ashraful was the pick of the attack with three for 56. b
