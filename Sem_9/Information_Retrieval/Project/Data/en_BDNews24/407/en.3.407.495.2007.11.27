<TITLE> Bureaucracy delaying separation of EC secretariat: CEC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner Tuesday said bureaucratic foot-dragging was delaying the separation of the Election Commission secretariat from the office of the head of government. "The draft legal instrument formulated to separate the EC secretariat has been sent back to us from the principal secretary's office after making changes and suggestions. We didn't like that," ATM Shamsul Huda said during the polls reforms dialogue with the Workers' Party of Bangladesh. "We have sent it back to them (the principal secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office). That's how the finalisation of legislation is getting delayed," said Huda. The Election Commission was currently working under the Chief Adviser's Office; but demands for freeing the top polls office from the controls and supervision of the interim government head's office gathered pace since the emergency government took over in January. At one stage, the Election Commission got the go-ahead from the highest government authorities to draft the required legislation and forwarded a draft to the principal secretary early September. Huda said the draft law provided for the EC secretariat to be under the law ministry even if it was separated. "Because the Election Commission secretariat has to be made accountable. The judiciary is also attached to the law ministry." bdnew
