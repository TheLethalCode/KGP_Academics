 NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan debutant paceman Sohail Tanvir struck twice in successive overs to lead a fightback against India on day two of the first test on Friday. But India recovered from a top order batting slump to reach 228 for six at close, three runs away from Pakistan's first innings total after dismissing them for 231 in the morning. Vangipurappu Laxman (57 not out) and Mahendra Dhoni (57) led India's rally with an 115-run sixth wicket partnership after Tanvir and strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar had reduced them at one stage to 93 for five. Sachin Tendulkar was run out for one and left-arm Tanvir then bowled Saurav Ganguly (8) and Rahul Dravid (38) as India lost four wickets for 22 in 6.2 overs to bring the match alive. Leg spinner Anil Kumble grabbed four wickets for 38 on his test captaincy debut in the morning to bowl out Pakistan after they resumed on their overnight 210 for eight. Misbah-ul Haq struck a valiant 82 before he was freakisly run out nearing his maiden test hundred after his 87-run ninth wicket partnership with Mohammad Sami (28 not out) had rescued Pakistan from 142-8 at tea on day one. Laxman reached his 30th test fifty and had batted for around three hours when play was ended early due to poor light. Kumble was on seven. AKHTAR STRIKES Shoaib Akhtar, playing his first test since January, struck to remove both openers Dinesh Karthik (9) and Wasim Jaffer (32) either side of lunch, which India took at 46 for one. After Jaffer's dismissal, Tendulkar, having faced just one delivery, failed to beat Mohammad Yousuf's throw from square leg when Dravid refused a non-existent second run. The tall Tanvir, a 22-year-old possessing an awkward action and deceptive pace, replaced Akhtar and beat both batsmen with swing and seam movement, Ganguly nicking onto the stumps and Dravid playing inside the line to lose off-stump. Laxman played typically wristy shots with the aggressive Dhoni until leg spinner Danish Kaneria had the 'keeper caught behind after a 93-ball knock studded with eight fours. Misbah-ul Haq was unlucky to miss out on a hundred after Pakistan resumed on their overnight 210-8. He was run out when leaping to avoid being hit by a direct throw from Karthik at point. The 33-year-old, whose previous best in seven tests was only 41, batted for over five hours, hitting six fours and a six from 243 deliveries. The next two tests will be played in Kolkata and Bangalore
