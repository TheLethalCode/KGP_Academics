<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday ordered the government to explain in four weeks why freedom fighters detained in jail on various charges would not get the status of first-class prisoners. The bench of Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Mohammad Farid Ahmed issued a rule on the home secretary, the liberation war affairs secretary, the principal secretary to the chief adviser and the chairman of Muktijoddha Kendriyo Command Council. The order came in the wake of a writ petition filed by Aminul Huq, a freedom fighter. Huq said in the petition that the government in a gazette provisioned for burying a freedom fighter with state honour. The petition argues that it is meaningless to show honour to freedom fighters after death when they are ignored in their lifetime. Fouzia Karim Feroz, counsel for the petitioner, told the court during hearing that a freedom fighter must be respected when he was alive. Many freedom fighters were in jail on various charges and they deserved the status of first-class internees, the court heard. bdnews24.com/
