 RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose name has been mentioned as a possible replacement for sacked England manager Steve McLaren, said on Friday he would stay in his present job until July at least. The fiery Brazilian, who turned down an offer to coach England two years ago in what was seen as a major embarrassment for the English Football Association, said he would see out his contract. Portugal have qualified for the European championship in June. "I have a contract with Portugal, with the federation, until July 2008," Scolari said through his spokesman Acaz Fellegger. "This connection has been maintained on other occasions when I've been sounded out and asked. "So, this connection which I have with the federation will continue to be maintained until 2008." Scolari, who led Brazil to World Cup victory in 2002, oversaw England's elimination in three successive tournaments. His Brazil team beat them 2-1 in the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup and his Portugul side knocked them out at the same stage of the 2004 European Championship and 2006 World Cup, winning both matches on penalties. Scolari, known in his homeland as Felipao (Big Phil), made his remarks following a meeting with Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia. "We had a talk about coaching and various matters associated with sport," he said. "We exchanged some ideas, we talked about Brazil, about Portugal, it was a very nice chat.
