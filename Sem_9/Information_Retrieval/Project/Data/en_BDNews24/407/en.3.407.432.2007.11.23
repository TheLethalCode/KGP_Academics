 NEW DELHI, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian batsman Vangipurappu Laxman quelled doubters with a valuable 57 not out on the second day of the first test against Pakistan on Friday. Laxman put on 115 for the sixth wicket with 'keeper Mahendra Dhoni (57) after strikes by fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and debutant left-armer Sohail Tanvir reduced the innings to 93-5. India were 228 for six at stumps replying to Pakistan's 231. "I always feel I would like to play in a tense situation, whenever the team requires," Laxman, 33, told reporters. "I'm happy Dhoni and I put up a partnership which was important at that stage of the game." Laxman's place in the eleven had come under pressure from the in-form Yuvraj Singh, who hit four fifties in the 3-2 one-day series win over Pakistan, until skipper Anil Kumble backed him and ex-captain Saurav Ganguly in the middle order. Laxman said: "It is good when the captain has faith in you. But it (doubt over selection) is really surprising. I had a very good series in England and averaged over 50 and still people doubt my place." India need to take a good lead on Saturday as batting in the fourth innings will be tough on a pitch playing slow and low. "Tomorrow's morning session will be very crucial," Laxman said. "The pitch is deteriorating." Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria said: "If we set them a good target of around 300 then we can win. "On the last two days, I'll have a vital role," he added. "I've done it in the past and want to do it again.
