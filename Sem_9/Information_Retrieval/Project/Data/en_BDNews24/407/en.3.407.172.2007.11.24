<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Saarc secretary general Lyonpo Chenkyab Dorji Saturday said that member nations would have to address para-tariff and non-tariff barriers as tariff reduction alone would not promote regional trade. "We need to address and eliminate para-tariff and non-tariff barriers as early as possible to boost regional trade," Dorji said while inaugurating a two-day meeting of the Committee on Economic Cooperation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. He said that the second meeting of the sub-group on non-tariff barriers held in Pakistan in August had undertaken an initial detailed listing of non-tariff and para-tariff measures. "It is now for the member states to adhere to implement the actions," Dorji said. Commerce secretaries of the eight-member forum attended the meeting. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed was elected the chairperson of the Saarc-CEC. This is the 13th meeting of the committee. The last meeting of the committee was held in Islamabad in 2004. The Saarc secretary general said the 13th and 14th Saarc meeting laid greater importance on improving intra-regional connectivity to facilitate intra-regional trade. "Transportation and transport connectivity are important, conceptually as also functionally. In this context, an intra-Saarc network of rail, road, aviation and waterways could significantly cut down the existing high levels of transaction costs involved in intra-regional trade," he said. The two-day meeting is to discuss a host of issues including trade cooperation and integration in Saarc, study on potential of trade in services under SAFTA agreement and review of intra-Saarc trade. bd
