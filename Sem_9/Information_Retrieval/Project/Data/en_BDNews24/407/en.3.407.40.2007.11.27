 Sharankhola, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  The moon was not bright enough Sunday night to read the ragged pages of an English grammar book found amid the ruins of a village street in cyclone-ravaged Sharankhola upazila in Bagerhat. Seeing the remains of the book in the gutter Abdus Salam asked his relative, who was offering him a government-issued relief card: "Are they giving books? I don't need this relief card. I need books. My daughter's books have been washed away." Salam said one of his daughters was due to sit her secondary certificate test for the 2007 session. His younger daughter is a ninth-grader at Tafalbari School and College under Southkhali Union one of the worst-hit areas where almost everyone has lost at least one family member to the cyclone. Many of the 30,000 residents of the area, who live on farming and fishing, found their homes, livelihood, and personal belongings washed away by hurricane Sidr on Nov 15. Tidal surges whipped up by Sidr's 250 kph winds also snatched away young learners' textbooks and study materials. The storm laid waste to the area's schools, many of which are made of wood. "My books are missing although I had kept them close to the upper ceiling of our house," said higher secondary school student Fatima, who along with her parents took shelter in the bathroom of their brick-built house. Like Fatima, Parul, an eighth grader, also lost her book. She has now taken shelter in a cloth-made roadside shanty. Parul said she planned to sit the junior scholarship test exam. "My examination schedule is approaching, but I don't know if I'll make it," she said. Firoz Ahmed who teaches mathematics at the Tafalbari School and Collage, said," Who hasn't lost their books! Almost everyone's books have been damaged." Ahmed, referring to school certificate and higher secondary certificate test takers, said "It will be difficult for them to sit the exams if they fail to replace their lost books now." Bagerhat district commissioner Shahidul Islam told bdnews24.com that the government would provide students with books. "We will get books out to examinees immediately," he said. bdne
