 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced former AL lawmaker Md Rafiqul Anwar to 10 years in prison for illegal possession of firearms. Judge Matiar Rahman of Metropolitan Special Tribunal-7 handed down the verdict in the presence of the convict, better known as Sona Rafique. According to case details, joint forces arrested Rafique on April 28 at Sea Queen Hotel in Banani and seized a foreign handgun, two magazines and four rounds of ammunition from him. Gulshan Police Station filed a case against him under the Arms Act the next day. Charges were framed on Sept 26. "Though the accused was shown arrested on April 28, he was actually arrested on April 20 in Chittagong, which has been published in different newspapers and aired by the media," Rafique's lawyer Alim Mia told bdnews24.com. He claimed Rafique's name and the case number were rubbed away in the case files. "Rafique was arrested by the joint forces. But he was not at the room of that hotel that night," said the lawyer. Alim further alleged that the man who was in the hotel that night was a different Rafique. "The Rafique in that room was the late Kafil Uddin's son. My client Rafique's father was Kabir Ahmed." He also said the corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against Rafique was under investigation. bdnews24
