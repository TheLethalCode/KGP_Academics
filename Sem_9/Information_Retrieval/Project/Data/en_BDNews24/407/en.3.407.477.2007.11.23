 DURBAN, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA unveiled the official poster of the 2010 World Cup finals on Friday -- a striking design of the African continent forming a man's profile as he heads a ball. The design was chosen after a nationwide public vote in South Africa. FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Irvin Khoza, the chairman of the World Cup organising committee, unveiled the poster two days before the preliminary-round draw for the finals. Blatter hinted that the face in the poster was of the most famous player in Africa, who did not play in the last World Cup finals, which suggests it is based on Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon, three times African Footballer of the Year. Blatter said in a statement: "It invites the world to join in the celebration of the greatest football event on earth, while highlighting the pride and passion of the African continent and her people. It represents the African dream come true.
