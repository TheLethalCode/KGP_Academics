 New Delhi,Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India romped to a six-wicket win over Pakistan in the first test on Monday, taking the lead in the three-match series.

Shoaib returned figures of four for 58. Ganguly and Tendulkar added 88 runs for the fourth wicket after opener Wasim Jaffer struck a fluent 53 to guide India to 171 for three at stumps on the fourth day. India made 276 all out in reply to Pakistan's first innings 231 and then dismissed them for 247. India leg spinner Anil Kumble completed match figures of seven for 106.
