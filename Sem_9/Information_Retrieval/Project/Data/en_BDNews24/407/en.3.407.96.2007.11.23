 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed Friday asked the government to immediately launch agriculture rehabilitation and house building projects in the cyclone-hit areas. He made the call while distributing relief materials in cyclone-hit Char Omed, Ramaganj, Lord Harding, Farashganj and Kalma areas under Lalmohon in Bhola. "Farmers are worried about how they will manage food in the coming days as the cyclone ravaged crops," he said. Hafiz demanded that VGF and VGD cards were issued among the cyclone survivors. He also asked the government to make an arrangement for interest-free agriculture loan, fertilizer supply and loan on easy terms for fishermen. BNP standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman distributed relief materials in Zia Nagar, Baliapara and Dhandipur in Pirojpur. He asked people not to be scared. "There is nothing to be scared. We are with you," he said. Replying to a question, Mahbubur said the present crisis over leadership in BNP would end soon. bdne
