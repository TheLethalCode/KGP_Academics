<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  FIFA security officer Salman Al Namsan expressed his dissatisfaction over the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS), Bangladesh's lone international football venue. "He (Salman) is disappointed after seeing no progress of the BNS in line with the FIFA guidelines," Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu told reporters quoting him Saturday. "We now feel a lot of anxiety over the BNS as the NSC is yet to start the work at the venue as per guideline," said Malu, who along with National Sports Council (NSC) director Abdur Rahman accompanied Salman during a short visit to the BNS Saturday morning. Salman, a Saudi Arabian architect, arrived in Dhaka Saturday morning and is scheduled to leave Sunday morning. Abdur Rahman, NSC director of development and planning, however, saw nothing to be worried. "Salman seemed very quiet and made no comment after visiting the BNS as we have assured him that the NSC is going forward to complete the work in line with their guidelines," Rahman told bdnews24.com by phone. Rahman also said that Salman said nothing after seeing the collapsed press box that broke down on October 8 sometime after the World Cup prequalifying tie between Bangladesh and Tajikistan. The NSC director said that Salman asked them to send a report to the FIFA on how they want to start the renovation work, and advised them to complete the work by February next. In July last, Salman visited the infrastructure and security condition of the venue and advised the BFF to widen the entrances and remove all shops inside the entrances along with demarcating the playground and goalposts. He also favoured ensuring ventilation and setting up bathrooms, blackboards in all dressing rooms and enhancing luminosity of the floodlights.
