 Annapolis, Maryland, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush opens a high-stakes Israeli-Palestinian peace conference on Tuesday, trying to achieve in his final 14 months in office a goal that has eluded US leaders for decades. Finally embracing a hands-on approach he disdained after his predecessor Bill Clinton failed to broker a deal in the twilight of his presidency, Bush is hosting the most ambitious round of international Middle East diplomacy in seven years. The talks are aimed at jump-starting a long-dormant peace process and negotiations for creating a Palestinian state. But with lingering mistrust and sporadic violence between the two sides, no one expects a swift breakthrough. Hoping to salvage a foreign policy legacy likely to be dominated by the unpopular Iraq war, Bush will address the one-day conference in Annapolis, Maryland, attended by more than 40 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Syria. Like the United States, many participants are driven by the desire to offset the growing regional influence of Iran, an outspoken opponent of peace efforts with the Jewish state. Bush's speech at the US Naval Academy, sandwiched between his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, will be the centerpiece of his most direct role in Middle East peacemaking, something he had mostly shunned since taking office in 2001. "We've come together this week because we share a common goal -- two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security," Bush said at a dinner for participants on the eve of the conference near Washington. "Achieving this goal requires difficult compromises." A senior Palestinian official said Abbas was expected to stress that the international conference represented a unique opportunity for a comprehensive peace, which he hoped could be achieved before Bush leaves office. Joining the talks are Syria, a front-line state formally at war with Israel, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, both of whose presence is considered a diplomatic coup for the Bush administration. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will shepherd the conference. The meeting includes a session on the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967 and which Damascus hopes to regain. "We participate with the understanding that the Golan will be discussed," Syrian diplomat Ahmad Salkini told Reuters. EXPECTATIONS LOW Despite Bush's insistence on a renewed US commitment and a call for stepped-up international support for the peace process, expectations were low for major strides in the three days of meetings that started at the White House on Monday. Bush, Olmert and Abbas all face serious problems at home. Abbas lost control of the Gaza Strip in June to Hamas Islamists, who have opposed the Annapolis talks. Olmert is deeply unpopular with Israeli voters and faces opposition to concessions from right-wing members of his ruling coalition. Bush, politically weakened by the Iraq war, leaves office in January 2009. The campaign to succeed him is in full swing. Underscoring the difficulties, the sides were still haggling on the eve of the conference over a joint document, though officials said they were close to agreement. The document is meant to chart the course for negotiating the toughest "final status" issues of the conflict -- Jerusalem, borders, security and the fate of Palestinian refugees. At Annapolis, the two sides are also expected to recommit to a 2003 "road map" that calls for a freeze of Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank occupied by Israel since a 1967 war as well as a crackdown by Palestinians on their militants. In his address, Abbas was expected to urge an immediate start to follow-up negotiations on these "final-status" issues, and would pledge to work within the "road map" obligations toward security and the rule of law. The Palestinian official said Abbas would urge that Israel cease settlement activities, remove settlement outposts, lift checkpoints and release prisoners. Still, many in the Arab world are suspicious of the Bush administration's intentions. The United States has seen its credibility in the region eroded by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and most Arabs regard Washington as biased in favor of Israel.
