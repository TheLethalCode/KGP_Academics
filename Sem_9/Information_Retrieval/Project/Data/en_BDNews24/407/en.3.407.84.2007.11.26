 Cox's Bazar, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Rescuers have pulled five bodies out of waters in the Bay of Bengal from a boat that sank early Sunday off a southern coast, police and local people said Monday. The boat, possibly overloaded with nearly 100 passengers, capsized near Shahpurir island off Saint Martin's Island in the district. A body was found Sunday amid confusion about the identities of the passengers. Police were cautious in providing details about the ferry accident Sunday but started divulging information Monday. Another four bodies have been found until Monday, said Teknaf police chief Jasim Uddin. Police could not provide identities of the dead. They said the passengers were both Bangladeshis and Myanmar refugees, Rohynga, who live in camps in Cox's Bazar. The refugees had earlier fled to Bangladesh claiming alleged persecutions by Myanmar junta. Police said human traffickers were possibly trying to ferry them out of Bangladeshi waters on the way to Malaysia, a lucrative destination to many Bangladeshis. A possible survivor of the capsized boat was detained in an overnight raid in Shahpurir island, said Jasim. Police were interrogating the man, Abul Hashim, for details about the incident and the possible traffickers, Jasim said. He said they were investigating the matter since it involved illegal trafficking. "We are trying to catch the traffickers and the owner of the boat," he said. The official, quoting Hashim, said about 75 people including many Rohyngas boarded the boat early Sunday to go to Malaysia on assurance by the traffickers. Hashim swam ashore after the boat had sunk. Meanwhile, fisherman Karim Ullah from Sabrong area in Teknaf told bdnews24.com that he saw at least 18 bodies in waters Monday. It could not be verified immediately if his statement was true. Zahedur Rahman, a teacher at Shahpurir island, said he saw about 50 people leaving by four small boats late Saturday for a waiting boat in the Bay. Shapurir island Union Parishad chairman Hamidur Rahman also made similar statement. Cox's Bazar police said coast guards and police arrested about 500 people, including some traffickers, when they tried to sail beyond Bangladesh waters in past three months. A case was filed with Teknaf Police Station against 13 people on charges of killing and cheating, police official Jasim said. One Sabbir Ahmed of Dailpara area has been made the prime suspect, he said. bdnews2
