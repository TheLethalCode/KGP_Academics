<TITLE> Sidr survivors fight for relief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com) - Three cyclone survivors were killed and nearly a hundred were injured in a freak accident in Kalapara in the southern district of Patuakhali when a bridge collapsed under the weight of survivors who had gathered hoping to be given relief. Tragedy continued to stalk Sidr survivors eight days after the killer storm tore through the south leaving nearly 3,500 dead in its wake. The storm survivors had congregated on the bridge hoping they would come by relief supplies, when the storm-battered structure gave way beneath them. Thousands of the 2.5 million people displaced by Sidr had made for road ways and river banks, hoping to up their chances of receiving aid. But the exodus to major arteries of transportation was leading to crowding and occasional outbreaks of violence. Ten people were hurt when police beat angry survivors in another incident in Patuakhali, disgruntled over shortages in relief supplies. Authorities said thousands were still unaccounted for as a US navy amphibious vessel carrying more than 20 helicopters was being prepared to go into operation, improving access to hard-to-reach areas. Another ship carrying 20 rotorcraft was expected to arrive soon. Armed forces personnel said that a base of operations was being readied for the US helicopters that will make the delivery of food, supplies and water easier in inaccessible areas. The US helicopter contingent will augment the 13 Bangladesh Air Force aircraft that are already conducting relief delivery and search and rescue operations. Pakistan contributed mobile hospital units with 89 medical personnel in 6 C-130 cargo aircraft. The latest two C-130s reached Barisal Saturday. Aid to the battered areas remained slow-going, as distribution infrastructure slowly took shape in the storm shattered south. Millions faced disease and death because drinking water was still not reaching disaster victims. Worries about waterborne diseases continued to be a major concern among aid givers. Reports said that rotting bodies in narrow channels and in surface reservoirs compounded sea-water contamination. bd
