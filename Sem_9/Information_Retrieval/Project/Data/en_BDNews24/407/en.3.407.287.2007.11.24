 DHAKA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com) - Pro-Delwar BNP leader Akhteruzzaman Saturday said he had been nominated convener of 'Khaleda Zia Mukti Parishad' (Committee on Khaleda Zia's Freedom). The group will work to get party chief Khaleda Zia out of jail, the retired major told bdnews24.com. The former lawmaker said his colleagues suspected that the government was working to implement a 'Minus Khaleda' state of affairs. He said the group would do everything that the law permitted to get Khaleda out of prison. The organisation will form committees at ward, union, upazila and district levels. Akhteruzzaman said the group would announce a 14-point manifesto at a press conference on Sunday. He said that the group's prime objective was to keep grassroots level party members united on the issue of freeing Khaleda from her incarceration. Akhteruzzaman added that the organisation's activities would come to a close once Khaleda was released. "We will run an 11-point programme to free our leader. We will work to our objective by peacefully means." "The issue of freeing Khaleda Zia was becoming less important than the so-called unification of the party," he said. "Some people want to desert Khaleda; grassroots party members won't accept this. I want the demand to free our leader freedom to have centre stage," he said. Akhteruzzaman alleged that the government was not letting general secretary Khandaker Delwar Hossain, appointed by Khaleda, do his job. "This is discriminatory and unjust." bdnews24.com
