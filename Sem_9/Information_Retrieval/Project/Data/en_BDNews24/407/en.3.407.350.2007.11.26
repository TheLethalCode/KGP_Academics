 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue Monday extended to Dec 2 the deadline to file income tax returns under individual category. It also said people in the cyclone-ravaged coastal areas in the south could file individual income tax returns even after the deadline. NBR chairman Md Abdul Mazid told bdnews24.com by telephone Monday, "We have stretched the deadline since the last day for submitting income tax returns which was November 30 coincides with the weekly holiday (Friday)." "The individual class tax payers can submit income tax returns until 8:00 pm on Dec 2. As Dec 1 is Saturday, the second day of weekly holiday, we have extended the time until Sunday," Mazid added. He said the cyclone victims and other people in the battered south would be able to submit their returns after the deadline but to do that they must apply to the tax commissioners. "They must submit their returns in line with the rescheduled deadline fixed by the tax commissioners," he said. "There will be no extension after that," he said. "Action will be taken against the defaulters." The latest extension is the third in 2007-2008 tax year. Initially, Sept 30 was the deadline but the authorities extended it to Oct 30. Because of a long vacation for Durga Puja and Eid-ul Fitr many failed to submit their returns. Finally it saw another month of extension to Nov 30. Some 22 lakh people have tax identification numbers (TIN) in 2007-2008 tax year, according to the NBR. bdnews24.com/arh/ehb/a
