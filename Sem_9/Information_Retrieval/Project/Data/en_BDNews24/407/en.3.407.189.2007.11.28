 LONDON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest software company Sage Group Plc said on Wednesday its adjusted full-year pretax profit rose 14 percent to 251.3 million pounds ($519.8 million), and it almost doubled its dividend. The Newcastle-based company, which provides accountancy software to 5.5 million mainly small business customers worldwide, said trading in the new year had started well, though margins in North America would be hit by a recent restructuring. Shares in the company, which are down nearly a third in the year to date due to problems at its North America business, were up 5 percent at 204 pence by 0909 GMT, valuing the business at 2.67 billion pounds. "Pretax profit is a touch ahead of our forecasts, (but) a key change is the rebasing of the dividend," Landbanki analyst Kevin Ashton said in a note. The company increased its dividend by 95 percent to 7 pence. Sage launched a restructuring and management shake-up of its North American division earlier this year, and Chief Executive Paul Walker said margins would drop slightly from the 20 percent recorded in the 12 months to end September 2007. But he added that revenue growth in the region, just 4 percent in 2006/07, compared with an overall group figure of 7 percent, would increase to around 5-6 percent. "North America investment will impact margins in 2008, but we will see a modest improvement in organic growth," Walker told reporters. Sage said overall revenues came in 30 percent higher at 1.15 billion pounds, as reported in a trading update last month. DEFENSIVE PLAY Paul Walker said Sage recognised the current uncertainties in the macro-economic situation, particularly in North America, but said the firm was well placed to shield itself against it. "We have defensive qualities. There may be a deferral of buying new systems, but we have not seen it in any material way yet," he said, adding that the bulk of revenues in North America come from existing customers. He added that the group's problems in the region had been "operational" rather than due to competition from rivals such as Microsoft, while the group's exposure to the vulnerable financial services sector was "negligible". Sage made five acquisitions in 2007, and said it would continue to look at targets in the coming year. "It's difficult to be precise. We may make some 'classic' Sage acquisitions around the 20 million pound mark, or we may make a larger, strategic acquisition," Walker sa
