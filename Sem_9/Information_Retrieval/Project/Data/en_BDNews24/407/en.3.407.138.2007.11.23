 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com) - Residents of Phulbari and five other upazilas have vowed that Asia Energy plc under no circumstances would be allowed to extract coal through open pit mining from their land. "People will not accept coal extraction through the open-pit method. Asia Energy must leave the country," Anu Muhammad, a professor of economics, told a meeting at the Jatiya Press Club in the capital Friday. The National Committee on Protection of Oil-Gas and Electricity Resources and Ports, a left-leaning civil society body, organised the discussion meeting on extraction of coal in Phulbari, Dianajpur, by the controversial London-based company. "The government is making a mistake," an organiser of the movement Aminul Islam Bablu told the meeting. "The government must understand how the people of Phulbari are prepared to resist Asia Energy which is operating again in the area." bdnews2
