<TITLE> Ex-academic Swan to become Australia economy chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The return to power of Australia's Labor party on Saturday will propel former academic and cancer survivor Wayne Swan into the key job of Treasurer, putting him in charge of the nation's economic management. Swan, 53, has been a central figure in Labor's election victory, overseeing a conservative economic policy and ensuring incoming Prime Minister Kevin Rudd kept his election promises in check compared with Prime Minister John Howard. The financial markets are unconcerned about Swan taking over from conservative Treasurer Peter Costello, who has run the nation's economy for 11 and a half years. Swan has promised continued tight government spending and budget surpluses, and to maintain the role of nation's central bank to set interest rates to keep inflation in check. But he will face an early challenge, with economists expecting the central bank to life interest rates a sixth time in two years as early as next February in order to contain growing inflationary pressures in a booming economy. Swan grew up in the northern state of Queensland and went to the same country high school as Rudd, although he was two years ahead of Rudd. The two men visited their old school during the campaign, where they were mobbed by the students and where Rudd spoke of captaining the debating team while Swan captained the school's rugby league side. "Wayne was very, very cool. I was very, very not," Rudd said at the time. Swan studied economics and arts and worked as a university politics lecturer before becoming an adviser to the Queensland state Labor government in the late 1980s. He then ran the Queensland branch of the Labor Party and worked as a political adviser, cementing his role as a powerbroker, before he was elected to federal parliament in 1993, the year Labor last won a federal election. He lost his seat at the 1996 election that brought Howard's conservatives to power, but fought back to win the seat at the following election and has held it ever since. But Swan's role as a factional powerbroker has attracted plenty of criticism from his own side of politics over the years. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating dubbed Swan and fellow frontbencher Stephen Smith "the Glimmer Twins" for the way they courted the media and tried to build their influence within the party and parliament. Former Labor leader Mark Latham called Swan and Smith a pair of "roosters", for the way they walked around promoting former party leader Kim Beazley over leadership rivals. In 2001, Swan was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent successful surgery. He is now a strong advocate for men to undergo tests for prostate cancer. He is married with three children.
