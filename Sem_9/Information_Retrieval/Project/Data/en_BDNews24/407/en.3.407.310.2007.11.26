 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com) - A special court in Dhaka Monday sentenced Shahidullah Khan, former additional inspector general of police, to six years in jail for not paying tax, falsifying information and having undeclared assets. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Judge's Court-5, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises, in the verdict also fined the former senior police official Tk 7 lakh. Shahidullah faces another year and three months in jail in case of failure to clear the fine. He was handed down five years in jail and fined Tk 5 lakh , failing to pay which he will have to stay behind bars for another year, for hiding information on illegal wealth. On another charge of providing false information about income and assets, he was awarded one year in prison and fined Tk 2 lakh. He faces another three months in jail if he does not pay the fine. The verdict will take effect from the day of arrest or surrender of the former AIG who is on the run. As both punishments will run concurrently, the convict will have to serve five years in jail. Assistant tax commissioner of National Board of Revenue Nahid Nawshad Mukul filed the case against Shahidullah on Sept13 for hiding wealth information in his income tax returns and dodging tax payment by tampering with tax documents. The case details said he evaded paying Tk 16.54 lakh in taxes during the tax years 200-01 to 2006-07 by hiding information on assets worth Tk 76.53 lakh and providing false information. The same court on Nov 19 sentenced Shahidullah's wife Masuda Shahid to six years in prison for tax-dodge. bdne
