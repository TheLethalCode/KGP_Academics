 NEW DELHI, Wed Nov 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's parliament holds a long-awaited debate on a controversial nuclear deal with the United States on Wednesday, with critics expected to prove the pact does not enjoy majority support. The debate will not lead to a vote on the historic deal, which brought Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's three-and-a-half year coalition to the brink of collapse, nor is it expected to produce a breakthrough. However, amid the high-decibel rhetoric that is anticipated, both the ruling Congress party and its communist allies -- who have rejected the deal -- are expected to signal their political strategies, analysts said.

While the government has opened talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a safeguards pact for the deal, it hopes the parliament debate will give Singh another chance to convince opponents. "Everyone wanted a debate, so the government agreed to a debate," said one of Singh's aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Washington says time is running out on the deal as it still needs the backing of the Nuclear Suppliers Group of nations and has to be approved by the US Congress before campaigning for presidential elections takes over next year. But neither the ruling Congress party nor the communists are expected to make significant departures from their positions during the debate, political analysts said. "Do I expect anything big to happen? No," said Mahesh Rangarajan, an independent analyst. "But will we watch it for the nuances for the coming weeks? Yes, absolutel
