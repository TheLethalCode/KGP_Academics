 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Tuesday many political parties including BNP would need to change their constitutions to get registered with the Election Commission. "A number of political parties will have to change their constitutions, otherwise they won't be considered fit for registration," Huda said during a dialogue with the Workers Party of Bangladesh at his office in presence of reporters. "Parties talk about democracy but practise autocracy by [letting its leaders hold] top party positions for decades," he said. "The parties expel members according to the wish of the top guns, such practice must stop. "I've read the party constitution of the BNP. I'm afraid they'll have to change theirs too." He said the eligibility criteria would certainly prevent relatively novice parties with no links to the people from registering with the EC. He, however, denied allegations that the EC was on an assignment to rein in the political parties in the name of registration. The political parties are to complete registration by end of June in line with an polls roadmap announced by the EC. Tuesday's dialogue with the Workers Party, an ally of the Awami League, was the latest in a series of consultative meetings with political parties since Sept in a bid to bring changes to electoral laws. Rashed Khan Menon, president of the party, led a 10-member delegation to the dialogue where the left-leaning party demanded the commission bars war criminals and anti-liberation forces from contesting the national polls. The tiny party also demanded the commission involves the political parties in the voter registration process. The party advocated that expatriate Bangladeshis be given the chance to become voters. It also asked the commission not to award voting rights to Rohingyas and Biharis. The party said it wanted a halt to the national identity card project since it thought it was time- consuming and delaying the voter enrolment effort. The CEC in the meeting said the commission would like to sit with all political parties together after the current series of parleys ends. Menon however rejected the suggestion saying that they could not sit with the commission alongside Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, who the party says harbours war criminals. "[The Jamaat-e-Islami] is infested with war criminals and anti-liberation elements. The immediate past Election Commission foiled its dialogue process by convening similar dialogues. I don't think others also would be willing to sit at a dialogue with the war criminals," Menon said. "You may say that these political parties had earlier sat together in the national parliament. But the situation has changed over past 2-3 years," he said. About foreign assistance for voter registration, Menon said, "When I see ambassadors of foreign countries with the Election Commission officials at the launch of voter enrolment on television, I feel belittled as a Bangladeshi." As many as 12 political parties have participated in electoral reform talks with the EC that began Sept 12. bdnews24.com/b
