 Tehran, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has built a new missile able to hit targets 2,000 km (1,250 miles) away, the Iranian defense minister said on Tuesday, matching the range of another missile in the Islamic Republic's arsenal, the Shabab-3. Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, whose comments were carried by Fars News Agency, did not say how the new weapon differed from the Shahab-3, which could hit Israel and has previously been viewed as Iran's longest range missile. "The construction of the Ashoura missile, with the range of 2,000 km (1,250 miles), is among the accomplishments of the defense Ministry," the minister told a gathering of the Basij religious militia, which is holding maneuvers this week. He also said a new Iranian-built submarine would be delivered to the navy on Wednesday. The minister did not give further details about either of the two new military items. Although Iran regularly says it has made major advances in its weaponry, Western experts say it rarely gives enough detail to confirm the capabilities. Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayari had said on Saturday his force would take delivery of a new submarine this week ahead of military maneuvers planned for February in the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the strategic Gulf waterway. Western experts say Iranian weaponry, some of it modified equipment bought from China, North Korea or elsewhere, would be no match for US technology but say Iran could still cause havoc in the Gulf, a major international oil shipping route. Iran, embroiled in a row with the West over its nuclear program, has said it would target US interests in the region if it came under attack. The United States has said it wants diplomacy to end the dispute over Iran's nuclear plans, which the West believes are aimed at building atomic bombs. But Washington has not ruled out military action if the diplomatic route fails. Tehran, the world's fourth largest oil producer, insists its atomic plans are aimed at mastering technology needed to generate electricity. Its failure to convince world powers of its peaceful intentions has resulted in two rounds of UN sanctions so far
