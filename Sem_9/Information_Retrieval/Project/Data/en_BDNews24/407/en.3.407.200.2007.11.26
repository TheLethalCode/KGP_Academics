<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Shahriar Nafees was left out when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Monday announced a 15-strong squad for three-match away ODIs against New Zealand next month. Another left-handed opener Junaed Siddique is the surprise inclusion in place of Nafees, who has been passing a lean patch in the ongoing National Cricket League where he has made only 19 runs in four one-day matches. The 21-year-old opener, only Bangladeshi batsman to have scored 1000-run in a calendar year in ODIs, scored just 39 runs in his last two ODIs against Sri Lanka in July. "There is no doubt that Nafees is a talented batsman, but he has failed to prove himself in the ongoing league," said chief selector Rafiq-ul-Alam at a press conference at the BCB management office in Gulshan Monday. "After the India tour of Bangladesh in July, (ace spinner Moahhamad) Rafique has not been in rhythm and he has been kept out," said the former national cricketer. The selection committee also recalled pacer Nazmul Hossain, who played the last one-day international against Sri Lanka in February, 2006. Nazmul has 18 wickets in 17 ODIs. "Junaed and Nazmul have been given room as both players are having excellent runs in the league," said Rafique. The selection committee pinned their hopes on the old guns as the newly-appointed committee also axed Mahmudullah Riad from the squad that played a three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka. Junaed, who played in the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa scoring 71 runs against Pakistan in September, has been among runs in the National Cricket League. He has piled up 275 runs in five one-dayers with one hundred and two fifties. The selection committee that also has former national captains Akram Khan and Naimur Rahman Durjoy also kept nine players, including Nafees and former captains Habibul Bashar and Khaled Mashud, standby. Mohammad Ahsraful and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza have been retained as captain and vice captain until December 2008. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Masrafe Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Javed Omer, Tushar Imran, Abdur Razzak, Saqib Al Hasan, Syed Rasel, Aftab Ahmed, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shahadat Hossain, Zunaed Siddique, Farhad Reza, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Tamim Iqbal and Nazmul Hossain Standby: Rajin Saleh, Shahriar Nafees, Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mashud, Mohammed Rafique, Mahmudullah Riad, Dollar Mahmud, Sajedul Islam and Enamul Haque Junior. b
