 BERLIN, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German police have arrested exiled Georgian opposition leader Irakly Okruashvili following a request from Georgian authorities and he could be extradited, the Berlin state prosecutor said on Wednesday. "He was arrested in a Berlin hotel last night," said a spokesman for the state prosecutor, adding that the courts were looking at a preliminary request for extradition on charges of embezzlement. Okruahsvili, 34, had left Georgia under political pressure earlier this month after sparking mass anti-government demonstrations by accusing President Mikhail Saakashvili of corruption, a charge the Georgian leader rejected.

Germany had received an application for Okruashvili's arrest from Georgia via Interpol, the prosecutor's spokesman said. Berlin authorities will consider the request to extradite the former defence minister and a final decision could take up to about six weeks, he said. "The main thing we have to formally check is whether what Georgia wants him for is a crime in Germany," said the spokesman, adding that formalities were likely to proceed smoothly since it mainly concerned embezzlement. Georgia's deputy general prosecutor Nika Gbaramia confirmed Okruashvili was wanted by Interpol although state agencies in Tbilisi did not confirm or deny his arrest. Opposition parties were not initially aware of the arrest. Okruashvili's accusations against Saakashvili led to his arrest in Georgia. He was released on $6 million bail after retracting the statements and flew to Germany soon afterwards. But in an interview with Reuters earlier this month, Okruashvili stood by his accusations against the president and said he had had only taken them back after the government threatened him and his friends with lengthy prison terms. Saakashvili's crushing of the protests and closure of the country's biggest opposition television channel have tainted his reputation in the West where he was viewed by many as a rare example of a liberal ruler in the former Soviet Uni
