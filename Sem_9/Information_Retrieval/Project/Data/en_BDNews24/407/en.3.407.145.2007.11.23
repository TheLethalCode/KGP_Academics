 Rangamati, November 23 (bdnews24.com)  Buddhist religious festival Kathhin Chibar Daan ended Friday at Rajvana Vihar in Rangamati with Chibar Daan at noon and lamp worship in the evening. The 34th Kathhin Chibar Daan festival started here Thursday. Friday marked the culmination of the festival with the Bhikkhu Sangha breakfasting, worshipping Lord Buddha and giving away Pinda (edible) in the morning. The local hills women started sewing the Chibars (pieces of saffron-coloured fabric to be worn by monks) woven in their traditional looms. Giving the Chibars away and holding religious congregation was conducted around midday, when Guru Shadananda Mahasthabir (Vanabhantey) delivered sermon in presence of thousands of Buddhist devotees assembled from far and wide. Rangamati turned into a town full of festivities on the occasion. Thousands of people from Bandarban and Khagrachhari hill districts attended the festival. Hundreds of boutiques and kiosks selling fabrics, foodstuff and other merchandises cropped up temporarily around the Rajvana Vihar. The law-enforcing agencies put in place special security measures to allow the devotees to participate in the religious festivities without any trouble. About 2,500 years back, Vishakha, Lord Buddha's chief disciple, had introduced Kathhin Chibar daan in favour of the Vikkhu Sangha. Locals say it is only in Chittagong Hill Tracts that this gifting festival is observed in a unique manner. The festival included spinning yarn from raw cotton, weaving fabric using that yarn, dyeing the woven fabric and sewing the same into a dress to be gifted to the distinguished monksall in 24 hours. The hills people believe this festival fosters cordiality, peace and friendship among all nations and communities. For the 2007 festival, 600 pious hills women had been busy through the past 24 hours spinning yarn, making clothing using 110 traditional looms, dyeing, finishing and sewing the Chibars. bdnews24.
