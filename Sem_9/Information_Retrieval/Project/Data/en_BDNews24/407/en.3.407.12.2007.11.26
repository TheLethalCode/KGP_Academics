<TEXT>
 MILAN, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus went second in Serie A on Sunday after a 5-0 demolition of Palermo helped them forget two consecutive draws. Serie A's top scorer David Trezeguet bagged his 11th of the season when he hooked in Nicola Legrottaglie's knock back before Vincenzo Iaquinta scored at the second attempt on 41 minutes. Substitute Alessandro Del Piero scored with a trademark second half freekick and a stoppage time penalty either side of Marco Marchionni's strike as Juve moved above Fiorentina, who could only draw 0-0 at Reggina earlier. Udinese also leapfrogged the Florence club with a 2-0 home win over struggling Siena thanks to goals from lively Italy forwards Fabio Quagliarella and Antonio Di Natale. Defender Felipe was sent off for two yellows on halftime but the increasingly impressive Udinese still won easily. Leaders Inter Milan are three clear after beating Atalanta 2-1 on Saturday when AS Roma in third won 1-0 at Genoa. LEG INJURY The weekend's games were the first in the top flight since Nov. 11 when Lazio fan Gabriele Sandri was killed by a police bullet after scuffles with Juve fans at a service station. Lazio beat Parma 1-0 at home on Sunday with a last-minute strike from Fabio Firmani, who celebrated by hugging a picture of Sandri which had been placed behind the goal as a memorial. Authorities banned fans of six top-flight clubs from travelling to away matches this weekend in a bid to avoid a repetition of the widespread trouble that followed his death. Crowd violence led to Atalanta's home game with Milan being abandoned early two weeks ago, robbing Ronaldo of a possible first appearance in over six months because of a leg injury. The Brazilian made the most of a start at Cagliari though, hitting the post and going close on another occasion as AC Milan came from behind to win 2-1. The European champions fell behind on four minutes when Robert Acquafresca headed in a corner in Nedo Sonetti's first game back in charge of Cagliari after Marco Giampaolo's sacking. Ronaldo won a soft penalty for the visitors just before the break for shirt-pulling but Kaka, who Italian media say will be named European footballer of the year next weekend, had the penalty pushed away by home keeper Marco Fortin. Milan looked set for a fourth league defeat before Cagliari made a hash of clearing Serginho's cross and Alberto Gilardino scored. Andrea Pirlo then sealed victory when he fired in a freekick five minutes from time. Although the ball swerved, it went into the middle of the goal and Fortin will be disappointed
