<TITLE> 18 lakh tonnes of crops lost to natural disasters: economist </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  An eminent economist said Saturday that natural disasters have cost the country at least 18 lakh tonnes in destroyed crops this year alone. Bangladesh Economic Association president Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad made his estimate at a seminar on climate change at the Jatiya Press Club, organised by the NGO Coastal Trust Bangladesh. "The two floods and cyclone Sidr damaged an anticipated 18 lakh tonnes in potential food crops this year," Kholiquzzaman said. Kholiquzzaman stressed the critical role of agricultural rehabilitation programmes to make up for the loss. "It has to be ensured that food reaches disaster affected people. Loans are not enough, affected people have to be provided with houses using grants." The economist said the flooding earlier in the year had badly affected the land as well as houses and the road network which had led to a decline in the productivity of the agricultural sector. "Bangladesh does not have any long-term plans to cope with disaster. We simply rush to the scene when a disaster takes place," Kholiquzzaman added. Coastal Trust Bangladesh researcher Md Shamsuddoha said cyclone Sidr had cost the shrimp sector Tk 250 crore, while the agricultural sector as a whole had incurred losses of Tk 2,500 crore, with other losses amounting to Tk 4,600 crore. "According to a preliminary estimate, it will take 40 years to make up for losses in the Sundarbans caused by Cyclone Sidr," Shamsuddoha said. He said cyclones worldwide claimed 2.5 lakh lives between 1980 and 2000, with 60 percent of the deaths coming from Bangladesh. "Climate change has led to an increase in the erosion of coastal areas. The land is becoming increasingly salty and in coastal areas the number of families based in agriculture is declining," Shamsuddoha said. The researcher highlighted natural disasters from around the world in the last five years to support his theory that their incidence has been accelerating in recent times. "In 2004, a tsunami killed 2.8 lakh people, while China, India, Central America and parts of Europe were highly affected by flooding," he said. "In Niger, 2.4 lakh people were affected by famine. Drought and monga struck Malawi. Cyclone Katrina hit the USA. In 2004, natural disasters caused approximately $123 billion in losses across the world," the researcher said. bdnews
