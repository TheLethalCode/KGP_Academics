<TITLE> Trust Bank gets merchant banking licence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday granted a fully-fledged merchant banking licence to Trust Bank, a top SEC official said. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters that the decision came from a commission meeting. It also decided that merchant banks and foreign portfolio managers would have to transfer shares traded through an omnibus account to clients' individual accounts within two trading cycles, that is, eight days. The move aimed to ensure transparency in trading by merchant banks and had no connection with the current market situation, said Ahmed. The stock market watchdog confiscated refund money of 168 applications for shares of Progressive Life Insurance worth Tk 8.4 lakh because the SEC could not trace the applicants. He said when the company initiated its Initial Public Offering (IPO), the SEC issued specific procedures for applications suspecting that there could be irregularities. "The SEC wanted beneficiaries to collect the bonus warrant from the banks in person. Those 168 applicants could not be identified," he said. The confiscated money was donated to the Investors' Protection Fund, said the official. bdnew
