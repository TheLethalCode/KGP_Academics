 DAMASCUS, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has agreed to put the occupied Golan Heights on the agenda of the Annapolis peace conference, but Syria will decide whether to attend when it receives the schedule, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said on Friday. "The United States has sent confirmation that it will include the Syrian-Israeli track... the Golan... on the Annapolis schedule," the Syrian news agency quoted Moualem as saying. The Syrian government has repeatedly said it would only attend the U.S.-hosted Middle East peace conference on Nov. 27 if the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967, are on the agenda.
