<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com) -- A commerce secretary level meeting Sunday decided to set up a South Asian Regional Standard Organisation in Dhaka to ensure the quality of export products. The new organisation will be set up at the Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute, commonly known as science laboratory. "Standardisation is a big problem for boosting trade in the region," commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed told reporters after a two-day meeting of the Saarc Committee on Economic Cooperation (CEC) in Dhaka. Ahmed said the Saarc members had agreed to set up the organisation to ensure a uniform level of quality and safety across the board. The CEC meeting discussed non-tariff and para-tariff barriers, Safta certificates of origin, reduction of the sensitive list, and trade in services. The Saarc Trade Fair and the exchange of statistics also received attention. Regarding the South Asian Regional Standard Organisation (Sarso) Feroz said: "Bangladesh focused on the issue. We face lot of problems regarding standards." Feroz, who was made the new chairman of the CEC at the meeting, said the much-talked about elimination of non-tariff and para-tariff barriers will be finalised at the third meeting of the sub-group, to be held in Kathmandu in January. "Safta's council of ministers, which is scheduled to meet in the first quarter of next year in India, will take the final decision," he added. The trade secretary said member countries have also agreed to reduce Safta sensitive lists to benefit the least developed countries in the region. India is going to give duty-free access to LDCs, with the exception of products on its sensitive list, Ahmed said. Ahmed said India is currently working out which items would be given duty-free access. The meeting also agreed to raise the number of persons to be exempted from visas to 100 from the previous level of 20. "They will be exempted from visas. The person will be able to tour the region with only a sticker," said commerce secretary. The meeting also discussed the possibility of a common position in negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. bd
