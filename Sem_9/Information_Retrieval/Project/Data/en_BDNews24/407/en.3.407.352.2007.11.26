 DHAKA, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com) National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid Monday said that donations of up to Tk 5 lakh in aid of the cyclone-affected people would be tax-free. At a meeting with eminent citizens, the NBR chairman said: "The government has kept the provision that donations of up to Tk 5 lakh will be kept tax-free to encourage good work." "Earlier donations up to Tk 2.5 lakh were considered tax-free," he added. The NBR chairman said the board had introduced 'help desks' in all the offices of tax commissioners, including at the headquarters in Segunbagicha, from November to advise people on tax-related matters. More steps would be taken later to encourage taxpayers, he said. A TV commercial with popular artists, businessmen and sportsmen has also been made to encourage taxpayers. bdnews
