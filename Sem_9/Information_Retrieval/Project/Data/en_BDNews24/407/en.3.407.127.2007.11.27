 PARIS, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities were down by midday on Tuesday, as falling tech and mining shares eclipsed buoyant banking stocks, which rallied after a an encouraging trading update from Britain's Barclays. News that the Abu Dhabi government's investment arm will take a stake in Citigroup also lent support to recently hammered banking shares. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine slipped 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank cut their target price, saying they expect steel prices to fall and financing costs to rise following the company's acquisition of peer Boehler-Uddeholm. At 1150 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.3 percent at 1,462.78, after falling as low as 1,457.58 earlier in the session. The index, down 1.4 percent on the year, has lost about 8.3 percent so far this month, hit by investors' fears that banks have not yet revealed the full impact of the credit crisis on their books. Miners were also under pressure, retreating along with metal prices, with both Anglo American and Rio Tinto down 1.5 percent. Tech shares also lost ground, easing after a three-session winning streak. Nokia was down 2.5 percent and Infineon dropped 1.9 percent. Barclays rose 3.6 percent after saying it is on track to meet analysts' expectations for earnings growth of 4 percent this year, saying diversification had shielded it from recent turbulence in capital markets.

But banks are not out of the woods yet, warned Emmanuel Morano, head of equity management at La Francaise des Placements, in Paris. "The recovery process for the banks will be long and painful. The gap between the estimates for the losses stemming from the credit crisis and what has been announced by the banks as write-offs remains very wide," he said. "The sector is still facing colossal losses, and we will see more negative surprises. The interbank lending market remains very tight. If the banks can't trust each other, that's because their own books have been hit badly by the crisis and they think their peers might be in an even worse situation." Around European markets, London's FTSE 100 index was down 0.5 percent. Paris's CAC-40 was down 0.4 percent and Frankfurt's DAX lost 0.6 percent. French retailer PPR dropped 2.6 percent after a downgrade by Credit Suisse to "neutral" from "outperform", citing a more cautious short-term stance on luxury. On the macro front, data showed German corporate sentiment unexpectedly rose in November as companies took a more upbeat view of current business conditions than a month earlier. The Munich-based Ifo economic research institute's business climate index, based on a monthly poll of around 7,000 firms, registered 104.2 after 103.9 in October and compared with market estimates for a dr
