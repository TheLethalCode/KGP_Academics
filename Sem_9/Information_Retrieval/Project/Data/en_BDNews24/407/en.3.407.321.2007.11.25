 JAKARTA, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake measuring 6.7 hit off the coast of Indonesia's Sumbawa island, the country's meteorological agency said on Sunday. The quake hit 50 km northwest of Raba in Sumbawa, at a depth of 50 km, the agency said in a text message. An official at the agency said that no reports of casualties had been received so far. Indonesia, which is situated in a belt of intense seismic activity known as the "Pacific Ring of Fire", was hit by a huge earthquake in December 2004, triggering a devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which killed more than 230,000 people in the region, including 170,000 Indonesians.
