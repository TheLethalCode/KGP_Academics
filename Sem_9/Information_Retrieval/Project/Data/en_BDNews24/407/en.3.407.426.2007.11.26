 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday said people would not be left unfed despite the natural calamities that had left aman crops badly damaged. "If necessary, we will buy food grains at higher prices," Azizul told a seminar on "Development of the Northern Region: Problems and Solutions" at the National Press Club. North Bengal Journalists' Forum organised the seminar. Azizul rejected any absolute crop deficit in the country following the floods and cyclone. "If needed, the government will make necessary import and provide food at reduced prices to avert any crisis," the adviser said. Aziz denied that the country was now experiencing economic stagnation. He hoped that a better production of boro crops would make up for the loss. Earlier, the adviser at a workshop on "Changes and Innovations in Food and Agriculture System in Bangladesh: Implications from Pro-poor Growth" emphasised the need for increasing productivity in food cropping to make up for the loss caused by the recent floods and cyclone. Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, Bangladesh Rice Foundation, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee and the International Food Policy Research Institute jointly organised the workshop at BRAC Inn Centre. Responding to a question, the adviser said that the government would strengthen the social safety net to help the affected people. Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud told reporters that there would be a deficit in rice production in the wake of the cyclone. "But what the amount will be must be found out by the government centrally and that amount of food grains must be imported," he said. Bangladesh Rice Foundation chairman M Syeduzzaman presided over the inaugural session of the workshop. bd
