<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/reuters) - UEFA president Michel Platini believes an Englishman should be the new coach of England and that Premier League clubs should have more home-grown talent. Debate about the state of English football has raged since a 3-2 defeat by Croatia last week knocked England out of Euro 2008 and cost coach Steve McClaren his job. The Football Association has said nationality will not be an issue in recruiting a new coach. "England is such a strong country that they have to take an Englishman," Platini was quoted as saying in British newspapers on Tuesday. "It's your national team and an English coach is better. English coaches need to be given more chances. "If I am looking for the manager of England, I would try to find a good English guy who everybody trusts to make a good team. You have good players." Platini said until leading English clubs start to use more English players the national side would be at a disadvantage. "If you do not have so many players what can you do? There are 95 registered Brazilian players in the Champions League, 94 French players and 45 English players," he said. "When you have twice as few players as other countries it is difficult. I like your football, I like the fans and the passion, but I don't like the fact that it is too open (to foreigners). "English football is ultra-liberal and it's not so good for me. Many people are coming into your league. You sell your clubs to foreign people. "It is my philosophy to protect the identity of the clubs and the country. Manchester United against Liverpool should be with players from Manchester and Liverpool, from that region. "In Arsenal now you don't have an English coach, English players, maybe not an English president soon." Platini said UEFA was powerless to intervene but said politicians and the Football Association should push for stronger regulations on foreign players
