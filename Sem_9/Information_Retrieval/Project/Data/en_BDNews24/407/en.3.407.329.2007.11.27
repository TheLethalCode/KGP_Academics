 LONDON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell below $97 a barrel on Tuesday as investors bet that the OPEC exporter group will boost supply for a second time this year at a meeting next week to cool near-record prices. Influential Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi gave nothing away on Tuesday about what action the group will take on Dec. 5, but Indonesia's Oil Minister said he would back an increase of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd). US oil dropped $1.04 to $96.66 a barrel by 1007 GMT. London Brent crude fell by 89 cents to $94.43. "OPEC has been making a lot of noise about an output increase and that's why we see weak numbers today," said Tony Nunan, risk manager for Mitsubishi Corp.

The US dollar recovered on Tuesday from news that Citigroup Inc will sell a stake to the Abu Dhabi government. Prices could rebound on expectations of cold weather in the United States that would draw down heating fuel stocks. The onset of colder weather in the US Northeast, a major consumer of heating oil, has also bolstered prices as traders bet that higher winter demand will strain inventories. US distillates inventories, which include heating oil, are likely to fall by 1.4 million barrels when data for last week is reported on Wednesday. Crude stocks are expected to fall by 800,000 barrels while gasoline was forecast to rise by 1.0 million barrels, a preliminary Reuters survey fou
