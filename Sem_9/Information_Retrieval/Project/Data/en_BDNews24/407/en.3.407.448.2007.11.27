 LISBON, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will attend a European Union-Africa summit in December in Lisbon, triggering a boycott of the meeting by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. "We got the invitation last week and we are going," George Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, told Reuters in Mozambique. Brown told reporters that nothing will be gained from dialogue between Britain and Mugabe and that the Zimbabwean leader must "take full responsibility" for the collapse of his country's economy and society. "We will not be prepared to sit down at the same table as Mugabe," Brown said. The Dec. 8-9 summit in Lisbon will be the first between the two continents in seven years. Previous efforts to meet have foundered over whether Mugabe, accused by the West of widespread human rights violations but who Africa sees as an independence hero, should be invited. Pressed by rising competition from China in Africa, the EU is determined that this year's summit should take place, in part to solidify its position as Africa's largest trading partner. A spokeswoman for the Portuguese EU presidency confirmed Mugabe will attend. In Brussels, an EU source said Portugal would formally notify member states this week that it would waive an EU visa ban to enable Mugabe and his senior aides to travel to Portugal. Under a deal agreed in the EU, no member state was expected to object despite Britain's misgivings, he said. "We've also made it clear that if Zimbabwe became a democracy again, if it had free and fair elections and democracy was restored in that country, then we would be prepared to be part of a major programme of economic and social reconstruction," Brown said. Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, dismissed Britain's objections, saying: "The British fear a handshake. We can't expect timid characters to be where men are." "FOOTNOTE" Only Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek would join Brown in staying away. Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, which had hesitated, have informed the Portuguese presidency that their prime ministers will attend, the EU source added. The EU presidency spokeswoman said the full list of those attending was still not available. The EU source said a plan to send an EU special envoy to study the situation in Zimbabwe would not be carried out until after the summit to avoid any risk of undermining South African President Thabo Mbeki's efforts to broker a deal between Mugabe and opposition parties on holding free elections next year. Portugal has come under fire from human rights activists for the invitation to Mugabe, but African leaders have said they would not attend the Lisbon meeting if Zimbabwe were excluded. Portugal's Foreign Minister Luis Amado, who invited Mugabe, recently said he would prefer him not to come because his presence could distract from the essential point of the summit. "There is no kind of diplomatic embarrassment. We deeply regret that what is being done to innovate and truly transform the relationship between Europe and Africa is being dampened by some obsession by the media around the president of Zimbabwe," Joao Cravinho, Portuguese secretary of state for foreign affairs, told TSF radio in Lisbon. "When the history of the summit in Lisbon is made this issue, which currently attracts a lot of attention, will only be mentioned as a footnote," he added. Western critics accuse Mugabe of ruining Zimbabwe's economy, rigging elections and violently suppressing opposition. Mugabe denies he has wrecked the economy with policies such as seizing white-owned farms for blacks with little experience, and he blames Western pressure for hyperinflation and hunger. The EU agreed earlier this month to send a "clear and tough" message to Mugabe on human rights at the summ
