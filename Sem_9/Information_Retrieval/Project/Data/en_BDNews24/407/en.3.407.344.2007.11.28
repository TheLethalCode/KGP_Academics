<TITLE> EC to re-demarcate some constituencies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A top polls official Wednesday said the Election Commission planned to re-demarcate some constituencies to equalise voter numbers in various constituencies. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters that redrawing voter constituencies would begin in January in areas where voter numbers had become very high. "There are some constitutional obligations to do this," he said. A US expert would arrive in Dhaka on Dec 9 to help the EC with the job, Sakhawat said, adding geographical information systems and information from population surveys will be used for the purpose. The EC will try to avoid administrative hassles by avoiding dividing union councils, the commissioner said. A preliminary electoral roll that will give the EC an idea about voter numbers in constituencies other than Dhaka is expected in January. The previous voter list will also suggest number of voters. The commission will discuss the matter with political parties, Sakhawat said. "We'll take soundings of political personalitiesperhaps in dialogue format," he added. bdnews2
