<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Ricky Ponting stroked 107 not out while Adam Gilchrist smashed a 26-ball half century to guide Australia to a seven-wicket victory in their first one-day match against New Zealand in Adelaide on Friday. Ponting was as at his mercurial best to notch his 24th one-day international ton, while Gilchrist, who cracked six fours and two sixes before being dismissed for 51, took the game away from New Zealand, who made 254 for seven off 50 overs. Ponting also combined with Michael Clarke (48) for a 135-run match-winning partnership after Matthew Hayden (17) and Gilchrist were dismissed in quick succession, though Gilchrist's onslaught had put Australia firmly in control. Clarke was caught by Lou Vincent off Kyle Mills with just 46 runs needed for victory before Ponting and Andrew Symonds (28 not out) saw Australia home with 7.3 overs to spare. "Gilchrist was pretty brutal. He had a go and really took the momentum away from us," said New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor provided the bulk of New Zealand's runs but both fell at crucial times when trying to increase the scoring rate after being bogged down by tight Australian bowling. McCullum, promoted to open the batting, anchored New Zealand's innings with 96 -- his highest one-day score -- but was caught by Nathan Bracken in the deep off left-arm spinner Brad Hogg just when it seemed he would push on to three figures. Taylor, who had been struggling for form, crafted a careful 50, but threw his wicket away when he got a leading edge off Brett Lee and was easily caught by Shaun Tait at wide mid-off. Tait, who had been smashed for 28 runs in his first three overs, finished with 3-59 off 10 overs. The next match in the three-match Chappell-Hadlee series is on Sunday in Sydney
