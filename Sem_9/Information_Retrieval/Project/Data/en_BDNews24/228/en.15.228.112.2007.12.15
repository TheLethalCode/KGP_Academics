 Nusa Dua, Indonesia, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Saturday that it still opposed a compromise plan to launch new talks on a new UN climate treaty despite support from many other nations at Bali climate talks. "We are not prepared to accept this formulation at this time," Paula Dobriansky, heading the U.S. delegation, told the 190-nation meeting to boos from many in the audience. The proposed compromise, breaking a deadlock between rich and poor nations, had been supported by all other previous speakers, including the European Union.
