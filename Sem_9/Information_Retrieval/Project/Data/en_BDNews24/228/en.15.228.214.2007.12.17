 Paris, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Sunday it would pledge more than $550 million in Palestinian aid to bolster nascent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that have been buffeted by Israeli plans to build new homes on occupied land. The US State Department announced the pledge as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flew to Paris for an international donors' conference on Monday. The conference is the financial sequel to a US-sponsored meeting in Annapolis on Nov. 27 that launched the first formal peace talks between the two sides in seven years. The first negotiations on Dec. 12 were marred, however, by Palestinian anger over Israel's decision announced the week after Annapolis to build 300 homes near Jerusalem on land it annexed from the West Bank after it occupied the territory in 1967 -- a move not recognised internationally. Speaking to reporters on the flight to Paris, Rice said Washington had no advance knowledge of Israel's plan to build the homes in the area known to Israelis as Har Homa and Palestinians as Abu Ghneim. She said the dispute showed there was "ever more reason that it's time to get an agreement". The United States has been criticised for not having prevented Israel from announcing the plan and for appearing to react slowly once it did. However, Rice said the US ambassador to Israel sought clarification "virtually immediately". "There is an assumption here that there is not going to be turbulence in this process. There is. I don't care how much you talk to people before ... there will be turbulence," Rice told reporters
