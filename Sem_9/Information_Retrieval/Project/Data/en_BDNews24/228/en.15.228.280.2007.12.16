<TITLE> India's Gujarat votes amid deep religious divide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AHMEDABAD, India, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With a religious divide openly on show, voters in India's Gujarat state cast their ballots on Sunday in an election that will decide the fate of a controversial leader and may influence the timing of national polls. Amid tight security, voters queued up outside election stations in districts which were at the eye of 2002 communal riots and which swept chief minister Narendra Modi and his pro-Hindu message to power in their aftermath. Gujarat, one of India's richest and fastest growing states but also one of its most communally divided, is being closely watched as a barometer of the fortunes of the country's two main parties ahead of national elections. They are due by mid-2009 but could come earlier with the Congress-led ruling coalition in New Delhi wobbling under pressure from key communist allies who oppose a nuclear energy deal with the United States. "Voting is slow but it is a holiday so people will come out at a leisurely pace. We are expecting a good turnout," said Gujarat's chief electoral officer V.K. Babbar as voters trickled into the polling stations. Officials said there had been no reports of violence following an often angry build-up to the vote, but there had been problems with some electronic voting machines. The religious polarisation which affects large parts of Gujarat was plain for all to see. "Modi is our only choice. He is the star of Gujarat," said 35-year-old businessman Mayank Patel as he waited to vote on a chilly winter morning in the state's main city Ahmedabad. "He is the saviour of Hindu religion." A few kilometres away, the mood was very different. "Modi has made us widows and our children are orphans, that's the great work he's done," said Fatima Begum, a Muslim resident of the city's Juhapura area. "I want him to face defeat forever." Muslims make up nine percent of the state's population, and feel they have been neglected and marginalised with the welfare of Hindus the Modi government's only priority. The charismatic Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remain favourites to win the state despite exit polls after the first round of voting in southern districts on Dec 11 which showed he had lost seats to the rival Congress party. Analysts say Modi's Hindu-revivalist, anti-Muslim message still resonates in many of the central and northern regions voting on Sunday, and that could carry him home for a third term in office. A total of 18.7 million people are eligible to vote in 95 constituencies on Sunday, out of 182 in the state. Results are expected on Dec. 23. Modi, who stands accused of encouraging the riots in 2002 in which between 1,200 and 2,500 people were killed, most of them Muslims, is contesting a seat in Ahmedabad and dominates political debate in the state. Television channels showed hundreds of cheering supporters greeting him as he turned out to vo
