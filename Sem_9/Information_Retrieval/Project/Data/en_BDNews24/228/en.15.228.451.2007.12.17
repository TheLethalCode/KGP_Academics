<TITLE> Iraq sees need for foreign troops for 10 years </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Baghdad, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq will need foreign troops to help defend it for another 10 years, but will not accept US bases indefinitely, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said. "Of course we need international support. We have security problems. For 10 years our army will not be able to defend Iraq," Dabbagh told the state-run al-Iraqiya television in an interview broadcast late on Sunday. "I do not think that there is a threat of an invasion of Iraq, or getting involved in a war. (But) to protect Iraqi sovereignty there must be an army to defend Iraq for the next 10 years," he said. "But on the other hand, does Iraq accept the permanent existence of US bases, for instance? Absolutely no. There is no Iraqi who would accept the existence of a foreign army in this country," he said. "America is America and Iraq is Iraq." The United States now has about 155,000 troops in Iraq, formally operating under a UN Security Council mandate enacted after the US-led invasion in 2003. Iraq has asked the Security Council to extend the mandate for what it says will be a final year to the end of 2008, and conditions for US troops to stay on beyond that date are to be negotiated in the next few months. Violence has subsided after the United States dispatched 30,000 additional troops to Iraq this year, and Washington now says it will bring about 20,000 home by mid-2008. Troop levels for the second half of the year are to be decided in March
