 Manikganj, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Muggers Monday killed a bank official in Manikganj while snatching money from him. Manikganj police super Imtiaz Ahmed said the incident occurred at around 10:30 am while Moniruzzaman Khan, 52, director of Rupali Bank, Baira branch, after taking money from Sonali Bank, Manikganj branch, was travelling to his office on a rented motorbike. Four muggers, on two motorbikes, obstructed Khan's bike, snatched the money and shot him, Imtiaz said quoting Biltu, the driver of the rented bike that Khan was riding. Locals rushed him to Singair upazila health complex and later to Manikganj Sadar Hospital, where the duty doctor declared him dead. The police detained Biltu for interrogation. There are four branches of Rupali Bank outside Manikganj district town. As these offices have no vehicles, money is transported by rented vehicles. Abdur Rahim, director of Rupali Bank's Manikganj branch confessed that it was a risky undertaking. "That's why Moniruzzaman had to lose his life," he said. The muggers managed to flee the scene immediately. No arrest has been made yet in connection with the incident. bdnews24.c
