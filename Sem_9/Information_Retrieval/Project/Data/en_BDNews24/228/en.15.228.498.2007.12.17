<TITLE> Asia shares fall on inflation worry; dollar firm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday, led by banks such as Macquarie after surging US inflation and high oil prices fanned concerns the Federal Reserve may be unable to make deeper rate cuts to prevent a possible recession. As market activity began to wind down for the holiday season shares fell across board, with Australia's benchmark stock index down more than 2 percent. Japanese government bonds slipped and the dollar rose to a 2-month high. Since August, global financial markets have been rocked by a US subprime mortgage crisis, which has dried up credit. Central banks around the world have been cutting rates and intervening in money markets to ease some of the worst strains in the financial system. But investors are still extremely nervous. "On top of the consumption and subprime troubles in the United States, yet another headache, worry over inflation, has emerged," said Lee Sun-yeop, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in South Korea. Tokyo's Nikkei was down 0.2 percent by the midsession, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks shed 1.5 percent. The index is about 12 percent below its Nov. 1 record high, but is still up by about a third as the year draws to a close. The gain is roughly the same as MSCI's emerging market index but more than triple the rise for MSCI's main world stock index South Korea's KOSPI index was down 0.8 percent by 0159 GMT. Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Taiwan's benchmark index, and Singapore's Straits Times were each down more than 1 percent. On Wall Street on Friday major indexes shed more than 1 percent each, and posted their worst week since Nov. 11, after a report showed a bigger than expected jump in US consumer prices of 0.8 percent, the sharpest climb in more than two years. Oil prices and agricultural commodities are trading near record highs, as is gold a traditional hedge against inflation. Housing data this week and earnings from three of Wall Street's biggest investment banks and brokerage firms, including Goldman Sachs, will keep investors on the edge of their seats. DOLLAR FIRMS The dollar hit a two-month high against a basket of currencies after the strong US data prompted investors to see less chance of a rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in January. Currency strategists at RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients that the CPI data showed that "the Fed is walking a fine line between upside inflationary risks and a slowing economy." The dollar traded at 113.20 yen near the five-week high of 113.60 yen it hit on Friday. The euro was little changed from late US trade on Friday at $1.4431 In the Japanese bond market March 10-year futures fell 0.20 of a point to 136.26 by 0223 GMT, while the benchmark 10-year JGB yield rose 2.5 basis points to 1.570 percent nearing a one-month high of 1.585 percent struck last week. Oil prices rose for the first time in three days, as a US winter storm spurred fuel use, helping halt a $3 slump caused by fears that the economy of the world's top oil consumer is faltering. US light, sweet crude for January delivery which expires on Tuesday, rose 56 cents to $91.78 a barrel. Spot gold was buoyant, trading at around $797 an ounce, although the stronger dollar would cap gains, traders said. Among commodities, shares in Allegiance Mining rocketed 38 percent after Australian zinc producer Zinifex Ltd launched an all cash bid worth up to A$775 million ($668 million) for the nickel miner
