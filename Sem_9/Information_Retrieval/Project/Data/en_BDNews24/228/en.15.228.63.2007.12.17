<TEXT>
 PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jerome Taylor's hostile bowling earned West Indies a five-wicket win over South Africa in a rain-hit Twenty20 match on Sunday. Fast bowler Taylor took three wickets for six runs against the home side, who floundered to a total of 58 for eight after being put in to bat in a match reduced to 13 overs a side by rain. West Indies replied with 60 for five to win with 3.1 overs to spare. Taylor did all of his damage in the second over. He trapped Morne van Wyk in front for one before bowling JP Duminy without scoring and inducing AB de Villiers, who was also out for nought, to chop the ball on to his stumps. A recovery of sorts was followed by the dismissals of Shaun Pollock and Albie Morkel, who were run out for two and one, and Vernon Philander, leg-before to fast bowler Fidel Edwards for four, as South Africa lurched to 22 for seven. Number nine Johan Botha top-scored with an unbeaten 28. Fast bowler Dale Steyn threatened to bowl the South Africans back into the match when he took four for nine from three overs. But, anchored by Runako Morton's 20 and an unbroken stand of 19 between Shivnarine Chanderpaul (8 not out) and Denesh Ramdin (12 not out) the visitors reached their target in 9.5 overs
