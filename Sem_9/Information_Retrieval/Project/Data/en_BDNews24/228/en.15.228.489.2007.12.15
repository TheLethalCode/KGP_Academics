 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Some residential pockets in Dhaka were in blackout Saturday night, even after electricity authorities promised full restoration of power to the capital and other parts of the country. Sub-divisional engineer Abul Kalam Azad of Dhaka Electric Supply Authority told bdnews24.com at 11:00pm that Dhaka was receiving 700MW in a sign of partial recovery from the blackout. According to the load dispatch centre, the authorities distributed 1689MW of power much across the country late Saturday night, which includes 700MW for Dhaka, in a desperate move to restore the situation to normal. Power initially trickled back to parts of the country after more than four hours of blackout. Bangladesh Power Development Board had earlier said the power situation might come back to normal by 10pm Saturday. Power secretary Faozul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com: "The committee formed to probe power failures in the wake of Cyclone Sidr will investigate today's incident too." The country suffered power failures as the national grid ran into technical glitches at 11:45am, ASM Bazlul Haque, director (public relations) of BPDB, told bdnews24.com. Immediately after the blackout, Haque said: "Repair work is going on. The situation may come back to normal within an hour." The power failures stemmed from technical problems at Ashuganj Power Station, which affected the transmission line. bdnews24.co
