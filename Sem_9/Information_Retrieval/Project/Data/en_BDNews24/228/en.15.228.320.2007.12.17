 ZURICH, Switzerland, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina will end 2007 as the world's best-ranked team, following the publication of the latest FIFA standings for December. With few international matches being played in the past month, the rankings have seen little change since November with the top 20 sides all remaining fixed. Argentina lost just three of their 16 matches played this year with the most painful coming against Brazil in the final of the Copa America. Despite that win, Brazil finished 21 points behind their South American rivals to take second place in the rankings -- which also take into account results from the previous three years. World champions Italy are third, just four points behind Brazil, with a comfortable margin of 149 points separating them from fourth-placed Spain
