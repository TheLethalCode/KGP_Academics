 Jerusalem, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US envoy for Middle East security James Jones will hold talks in Israel on Tuesday for the first time since taking up the post, officials said. The retired Marine general, chosen last month to help develop a regional security plan, will meet Israeli leaders one day after holding talks with top Palestinian officials on the sidelines of a donors' conference in Paris. Jones is expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Defence Minister Ehud Barak and other top officials. "He was appointed ... to deal with what we call regional security concerns," a senior Israeli official said. The official said Jones would focus on "how (Israel), the Palestinians, the Jordanians, the Egyptians work on the general concept that will allow us to develop a regional security plan that will take into consideration the needs of the moderates and will exclude the needs of the extremists.
