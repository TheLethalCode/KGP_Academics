 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  The construction of Mujibnagar Liberation War Memorial Complex is nearing completion, officials said Saturday. The project was taken up to memorialise the place where the government of the newly independent Bangladesh mapped out a constitution and held the first swearing-in ceremony. Liberation war affairs secretary Abul Kasem Mahbubul Alam told bdnews24.com that the construction of the first phase of the project would be completed in June. The entire project will cost around Tk 45.25 crore. A giant map of Bangladesh will be installed in the area for which the cost has been estimated at Tk 17 crore. Some 38 sculptures, dioramas and replicas will also be built at a cost of Tk 8 crore. The remaining fund will be spent on other related units of the project, including the construction of an administrative building. A top official with the liberation war affairs ministry said the Awami League government initiated the project in 1996 and started work in 1998. The cultural affairs ministry was in charge of the project and later shifted it to the liberation war affairs ministry after it was formed in 2002. Mahbubul Alam told bdnews24.com that they would start the second phase of the project after the completion of the first phase in June. The second phase includes a number of activities such as supervision of the monument, recruitment of staffers for maintenance and beautification. bdnews24.com/
