<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's small liberal party SPS nominated a presidential election candidate on Monday who denounced President Vladimir Putin's "corrupt state capitalism" and called for a European Russia built on the rule of law. Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister during the 1990s, has little chance of beating Putin's chosen candidate Dmitry Medvedev in next March's election. Polls show most Russians will back whoever the highly popular president chooses. Nemtsov's Union of Right Forces (SPS) party, which advocates free-market economics and political liberalism, did not win any seats in parliamentary elections this month, scoring less than one percent of votes. Divided by their ambitions, Russian liberals have seen their popularity nosedive during Putin's eight-year rule, which has been marked by an oil-fuelled economic boom and rising incomes. Putin dismisses them as marginals and reminds his countrymen that they presided over Russia's last big economic crisis in 1998. Nemtsov said by running for president he would defy the Kremlin's grip on the media and try to tell Russians what was really happening in their country. "We have a completely different view of the country's development from that of Putin and Medvedev -- they want to lead Russia along the course set by Hugo Chavez," he told journalists in a reference to Venezuela's populist and authoritarian president, who is also presiding over an oil boom. Neither the SPS, nor the other main liberal party, Yabloko, is represented in the new State Duma (lower house of parliament) elected in the Dec. 2 polls. Putin's United Russia party won 64 percent of the votes in the poll which Nemtsov tagged "the most dishonest election in the history of modern Russia". Nikita Belykh earlier asked the SPS congress to approve his resignation as party leader after the defeat in the polls. Belykh told journalists the party had charged Nemtsov with a task of coordinating efforts with other liberal candidates in the election. They include former premier Mikhail Kasyanov and ex-Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, now residing in Britain. Nemtsov said by running in the polls Russian liberals wanted to make their manifesto heard: "They (Putin and Medvedev) aim to build this kind of corrupt state capitalism, with an all mighty bureaucracy, with complete lawlessness in courts." "But we want to see a European Russia, a Russia built on the rule of law, with a powerful middle class," he said. "There must be an alternative ... If I don't run, this will mean people have no glimpse of hop
