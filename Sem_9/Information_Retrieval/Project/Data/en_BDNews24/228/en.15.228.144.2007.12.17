<TITLE> Legal barriers protect defaulters: BB governor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Legal hurdles discourage banks who would otherwise make heavy defaulters pay, giving rise to mounting bad debts, said the central bank chief Monday. "Since realisation of loans from the big defaulters has somehow faltered through a period, the volume of bad debts has been mounting," said Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed. He made the remark to reporters after a meeting at the Bangladesh Bank headquarters with the top management of Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks, recently turned into limited companies. This was his first meeting with the banks since their recent change in status, he said. When banks file lawsuits, the defaulters file writ petitions in response and the cases are halted and hackneyed through years, without being resolved, Salehuddin said. The central bank has approached the law ministry for necessary amendments to the laws, said the top banker. The BB governor hoped that the government response would be positive. Salehuddin said Sonali, Janata and Agrani were now commercial banks owned by the government, whose activities will be overseen by the central bank, just like other commercial banks. bdnews24.
