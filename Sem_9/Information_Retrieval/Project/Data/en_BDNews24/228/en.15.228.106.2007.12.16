<TITLE> Roh is albatross on candidate`s neck </TITLE>

 Gwanju, South Korea, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - His raised thumbs on pumped fists moving in rhythm to dance music, the political heir to two successive liberal South Korean presidents fires up the crowd, but not the voters. With a near-30-point deficit in the polls, even members of his own camp privately admit that Chung Dong-young, candidate for the ruling United New Democratic Party, needs a miracle to win the Dec. 19 presidential election. The former TV newscaster and cabinet minister in charge of ties with the North under outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun is finding little support despite populist calls for more affordable education, slashed petrol taxes and lower health care costs. "I am the candidate who truly understands the difficulties poor people are facing," he tells at a rally in Gwangju, a southwestern city that was the regional base for Roh and his Nobel Peace Prize-winning predecessor, Kim Dae-jung. Polls show voters overwhelmingly agree the economy is the most important election issue, they just don't think Chung is the man to sort it out. The telegenic Chung speaks with passion. His time in front of the camera has honed his delivery and, in parliamentary elections, he has shown his campaign skills by capturing the most number of votes of any MP running. But he has been unable to escape the taint of having served in Roh's unpopular government, derided for failing to revive the economy and for pushing narrow ideological concerns instead of pragmatic solutions to benefit the public. ALBATROSS His time in the much-scorned Roh administration has become his political albatross. "Chung needed to take responsibility for the administration's faults as well as its fruits," said Jeong Chan-soo, a political analyst with MIN Consulting. "But he has not." Instead, his campaign has focused on making corruption charges against front-runner Lee Myung-bak, the former boss of Hyundai Construction. Lee was investigated by prosecutors for securities fraud and cleared in early December. But beating the drum on corruption has done nothing to raise his sub-20-percent rating among voters, who appear to grudgingly accept shady practices among business leaders as long as they bring profits and jobs. "Chung will say anything to get elected. I don't trust him," said Seoul housewife Bae Mi-yeun. Chung has argued for massive economic aid for the North, which he sees as drawing the reclusive and impoverished neighbour closer while opening up economic opportunities at home. "Peace is not only security. It's money," Chung said. Roh's government, however, has been criticised for giving away too much to the North and getting almost nothing in return. Several MPs in Chung's party see this election as lost and are distancing themselves from him ahead of April's parliamentary election. A bad result there could push the ruling UNDP from power, giving conservatives control of both the National Assembly and the presidential Blue House. Even the regionalism once so potent in South Korean politics now works against Chung. Polls show Lee, and his pledge to be the CEO of Korea Inc., is the first conservative candidate to score double-digit support in liberal strongholds in the southwest. The Seoul region, home to half the country's 50 million population, has traditionally split evenly between conservatives and liberals. This time, it is solidly lining up behind Lee, the capital's popular former mayor. Hope is not lost among the Chung faithful, who rush to share handshakes and hugs with the candidate. "The truth will win," reads a black sign held by supporters dressed in the orange colour of the Chung campaign
