 LONDON COLNEY, England, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been handed a major boost after midfielders Cesc Fabregas, Mathieu Flamini and Aleksandr Hleb all resumed training and could be back to face Chelsea on Sunday. Fabregas, who has been key to Arsenal's spell at the top of the table, has been sidelined since sustaining a hamstring injury against Sevilla in the Champions League on Nov. 27. Hleb has also been nursing a hamstring strain suffered against Aston Villa on Dec. 1 while Flamini has been out with a knee injury picked up in the same game. All three players took part in the session at Arsenal's training ground on Friday and could make a timely return in Sunday's much-awaited Premier League game. Chelsea are third in the table, three points behind leaders Arsenal. Wenger is keen to see his side return to winning ways after their first league defeat against Middlesbrough last Sunday and knows the importance of having his key players back. Wenger said: "Fabregas, Flamini and Hleb were back in training and I will make a decision on their fitness on Sunday morning. "I want to leave it as late as possible before making a decision on if they will play. But the signs have looked very positive in training. If Fabregas is fit, he will play." Despite the optimism, the Arsenal manager is well aware of the risks involved in players returning from injury. Wenger said: "It is always a kind of gamble when you bring players back because they could suffer a recurrence of the injury. That is why we have to sit down and make a decision. "We know the importance of this game and playing against direct opposition is very big. But we have shown since the start of the season that we can compete with the top teams.
