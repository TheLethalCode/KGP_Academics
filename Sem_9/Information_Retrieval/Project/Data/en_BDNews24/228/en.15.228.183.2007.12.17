 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Selectors Monday called uncapped left-arm pacer Sajidul Islam to replace injured Syed Rasel for the three ODIs against New Zealand this month. 19-year-old Sajidul, who was on the list of nine standby players for the New Zealand tour, will fly Tuesday to join the Tigers. The team management asked for a replacement for Rasel after he dislocated his left collar bone during fielding in the first warm-up match against Northern Knights in Hamilton Sunday. Rasel was examined by an orthopaedic surgeon in Hamilton Monday and the report is expected by Tuesday morning, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. He will undergo further investigation and treatment before a final assessment on his condition is made. "Sajidul is a bowler identical to Rasel and is in the peak of form in the ongoing National Cricket League. So the selection committee unanimously picked him as the replacement of Rasel," chief selector Rafiq-ul-Alam told bdnews24.com by phone Monday. Alam said they were confident about Sajidul, the leading wicket-taker in the ongoing domestic four-dayer with 33 scalps from seven matches. He has also taken nine wickets in NCL one-dayers. "Yes, I am not experienced at international level, but I will try my best to fill up the absence left by Rasel," Sajidul said after the final day of the four-dayer between Dhaka and Barisal at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Sajidul said he was glad to learn about his inclusion from selector Naimur Rahman in the morning before the match resumed. Bangladesh will play their second warm-up match Tuesday against the Northern Knights and Tushar Imran will sit out the match with a sore left shoulder. Tushar, however, is expected to be fit before the Twenty20 match against the New Zealand XI on Dec 23. Pacer spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza might be rested for the second warm-up match, in which both sides play with 12 players. b
