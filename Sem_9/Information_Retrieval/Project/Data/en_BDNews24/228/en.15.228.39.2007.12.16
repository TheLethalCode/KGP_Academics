 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)- Bangladesh's match-preparation on the tour of New Zealand got off to an inauspicious start when the State Northern Knights eased to a 7-wicket victory with seven and a half overs to spare chasing a target of 223 in the first warm-up at Seddon Park today (Sunday). The day ended on a gloomier note for the tourists when it was learnt that left-arm paceman Syed Rasel had suffered a dislocated left collar bone. In the 32nd over of the Knights' innings Rasel took a tumble while fielding a ball and landed hard on his left shoulder and immediately raised his right hand to signal his distress. He was taken for an x-ray straightaway and reports confirmed the dislocation. The bowler will be examined by an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow morning before further assessment is made on his injury. Under scattered cloud cover Bangladesh were put in by Knights skipper James Marshall. Openers Zunaed Siddique and Tamim Iqbal looked comfortable against the seamers from the beginning and Tamim helped himself to a couple of flicked fours while Siddique cleared the infield whenever the ball was pitched up. The Knights' new ball bowlers Tim Southee and Brent Arnel struggled with line in the beginning but Tamim (12) gifted the home side a breakthrough when he slashed at an away going ball and was caught behind (27/1 in 8.0 overs). Siddique continued to play confidently but saw number three Tushar Imran (8) taken down the leg side with 64 on the board. Captain Mohammad Ashraful then put on 57 with Siddique before he was gone for a fluent 30. The Tigers captain went hard at a Southee delivery and was given out after a prolonged appeal. There were no demons in the wicket and the batsmen faced little difficulty in negotiating the occasional movement and zip. But the tigers lost crucial wickets at the wrong moments. Shakib Al Hasan (6) was unfortunate as his full-blooded sweep stuck in the hands of short mid wicket Bradley Watling and Aftab Ahmed (12) edged to the keeper when he flashed outside off. From 121/2 Bangladesh slumped to 143/5 in 37th over. Siddique reached his half century with a cracking off drive for four and then hit the first six of the Bangladesh innings but when he needed to go on he holed out at mid off having made 73 off 114 balls. Farhad Reza and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza ensured that the Tigers passed 200. Mortaza (25) clouted a six and three fours while Reza made a run-a-ball 27 as Bangladesh finished with 222/8. The Knights were off to a solid start as Mortaza and Rasel were guilty of bowling a touch short. By the time the spinners came in the batsmen were already set. Left-handed opener Nick Horsley pulled and cut his way to 92 and Marshall remained not out on 55 in a convincing win. Ground fielding was good from the Bangladesh team but the bowlers need more adjusting to do in their next warm-up on Tuesday if they want to come back strong. "I was pleased with the way we batted initially. The goal was to not lose wickets and we achieved that. However we lost our way in the middle and we could not have a crack in the last few overs. Also I guess we were a touch slow to start with and probably fell short by 30 runs," said Tigers coach Jamie Siddons. "The target for us is to improve every match and there were some good things today that we want to take into the game on Tuesday and we will try not to repeat the mistakes. In bowling we were too short on occasions and our spinners did not get the turn. Horsely also played brilliantly. He made good balls look bad," added Siddons. Knights coach Andy Moles meanwhile believed the Tigers will come back hard at them in the next match. "The area young side and showed a lot of spirit. It will be foolish to look too much into today's performance from them. Today was more a case of getting used to the conditions for Bangladesh. They will get better as the tour goes on and Tuesday could be a totally different ball game. No one in New Zealand think that they (Bangladesh) will be pushovers on this tour."
