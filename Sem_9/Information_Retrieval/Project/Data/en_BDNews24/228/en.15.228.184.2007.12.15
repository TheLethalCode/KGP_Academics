<TITLE> India and China object to Bali climate draft </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nusa Dua, Indonesia (Reuters) - India and China objected on Saturday to a draft deal at UN talks in Bali to launch negotiations on a global pact by 2009 to fight climate change, saying rich nations should do more to lead the way. After overnight talks lasting beyond a Friday deadline, India told a 190-nation meeting that it wanted changes to a final text to strengthen the role of rich nations in providing clean technology and finance to help fight global warming. "This is a conspiracy," a Chinese delegate said of a draft text presented to delegates on Saturday by the Indonesian hosts of the December 3-4 meeting in Bali. If the dispute is resolved, the draft would launch two years of talks on a sweeping new long-term treaty to involve all nations and succeed the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012. Kyoto sets greenhouse gas caps only for 37 rich nations. Many developing nations are unhappy that the draft text cut out a guideline for rich nations to do more and cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. But China and India, the number two and four emitters of greenhouse gases, want concessions from the rich before committing to join talks that would oblige them to do more to curb their emissions. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Bali on Saturday morning for an unscheduled return to the talks from East Timor. But he put off a planned news conference. Soon after resuming on Saturday morning, the talks were suspended to try to resolve the tangle with Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda meeting developing nations. EU OPPOSES But Dutch Environment Minister Jacqueline Cramer told Reuters the EU, which backed a draft text presented earlier, said the Indian demands were "unacceptable to the EU". Canada, an early objector to parts of the draft, also said it would support the latest text. Tempers, stretched by days of late-night sessions, showed signs of fraying. A Chinese delegate demanded an apology from organizers when a plenary session reconvened when Wirajuda was still meeting with developing nations. But Indonesian Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar, hosting the session, shot back: "Time is running out and technically we have to conclude this session." "I am still optimistic," said German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel. "Everything centers around the question of how much is expected of industrial nations."
