<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)A devastating fire raced through a Begunbari slum in the capital Saturday, leaving 200 shanties in ashes, witnesses said. Sayed Hossain, a Fire Service and Civil Defence officer, told bdnews24.com: "It took us two hours to control the blaze. We don't have any information on casualties." He said that the cause of the fire could not be known immediately. The slum dwellers said that the fire might have originated from a candle or stove, as there was no power supply at the time. Scared slum dwellers started running to safety. Many tried to control the fire themselves. The winter breeze did not let them do so, and the fire spread rapidly from one house to another, the witnesses said. The flames rose high and the people had to flee leaving their valuables behind. Md Ali Bhuyan, owner of one of the slum houses, said: "Mostly workers live here. We had more than 200 rooms in this slum. There were some two-storey houses as well." Mizanur Rahman, deputy director of the Fire Service, was injured on duty and lost his wireless set. The fire fighter fell into a ditch from a bamboo bridge. The slum was made over a ditch on bamboo poles, and most shanties were made of tin and bamboo. bdnews24.c
