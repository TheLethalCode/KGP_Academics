 PARIS, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France kicked off an international donors conference to boost the Palestinian economy on Monday, with delegations expected to offer some $5.6 billion and give political impetus to the renewed Middle East peace talks. The one-day meeting is the financial sequel to the launch last month in Annapolis of the first peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in seven years. "After years of violence, after years of mistrust, Annapolis revived hope," French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at the opening of the conference. "Be generous, be audacious. Peace depends on it and this peace will help all the world," he told delegates from nearly 90 countries and organisations, including US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Middle East envoy Tony Blair. Sarkozy said France would offer $300 million to the Palestinians, while the United States has promised more than $550 million in aid. The European Union executive pledged 440 million euros ($639.4 million) of grant aid to the Palestinians. While the meeting will focus on the Palestinian economy, the visiting envoys are expected also to discuss outstanding contentious issues. As delegates gathered, Palestinian negotiators said Israeli plans to build new homes on occupied land near Jerusalem could cloud the next round of peace talks, due to be held on Dec. 23. "We need a clear-cut Israeli decision concerning this issue," said Palestinian spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah. Sarkozy called for a freeze in the building of settlements and the U.S. Secretary of State said the dispute showed it was vital to reach a full deal and appealed to both sides not to "consider every bump in the road to be a barrier. "There is an assumption here that there is not going to be turbulence in this process. There is. I don't care how much you talk to people before, I don't care how much work you do. There will be turbulence," Rice told reporters as she flew to Paris. POLITICAL DIVISION Donor nations have been poring over a reform programme drawn up by the Palestinian Authority. However, the World Bank said last week such plans would not be enough to revive the economy if Israel did not lift trade and travel restrictions. Israel has so far balked at removing checkpoints scattered across the occupied West Bank, citing security concerns. It has also tightened its military and economic cordon around Gaza since Islamist Hamas seized control in June, although on Sunday it allowed hundreds of Palestinians to leave Gaza to make the annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca. The political division of the Palestinian territory has further complicated the peace process, with the West Bank controlled by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Gaza ruled by Hamas. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urged ordinary Palestinians on Monday to turn their backs on extremism and support Abbas. "We need to show moderate Palestinians that democracy is the only solution to live in peace," he told Europe 1 rad
