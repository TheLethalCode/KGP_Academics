<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid Saturday said his party would not tolerate any leadership imposed from outside. "Bangladesh is ours. We will run this country. We will decide our own leadership. All political leaderships have to understand that the politics that fuel violence will no longer continue," Mujahid said, speaking at a discussion meeting on the eve of Victory Day at the National Press Club. "We won't accept any leadership imposed from outside. We aren't afraid of people's bloodshot eyes." The comments came amid growing calls from a broader spectrum of society for the trial of 'war criminals'. Jamaat is blamed for its controversial roles in the 1971 War of Independence. "To go ahead, we are to pursue honest politics to free the country of the influences of black money and crimes," said the former social welfare minister for the Khaleda administration. The future progress of the country depends on the Islamic way of life because Islam does not give indulgence to any extremism or chaos, he said. The Awami League and its allies had launched vigorous, often violent street protests against the BNP and its coalition partner, Jamaat, before the military-backed changeover in mid-January. "All irrespective of caste and creed have to be tolerant. Others have to take a vow to protect independence and sovereignty of the country." bdnews24.
