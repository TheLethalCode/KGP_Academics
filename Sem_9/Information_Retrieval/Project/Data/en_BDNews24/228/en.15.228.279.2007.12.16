<TITLE> Tigers take on Knights in tour opener Sunday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com) The Tigers open their month-long tour of New Zealand taking on Northern Knights at Seddon Park in Hamilton Sunday in the first of three warm-up one-dayers. The match, scheduled to start at 7am Bangladesh standard time, should give the some idea about how they are shaping up for the three ODI series against the Black Caps. Uncapped Junaed Siddique is expected to open with dashing left-handed Tamim Iqbal. Opener Javed Omar, Mehrab Hossain Junior and pacer Nazmul Hossain have been kept out of the squad after both sides agreed to allow 12 players on each side, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "Often the mistake we batsmen make on seaming wickets is that we get on the back foot too early to length balls and allow the movement," Junaed was quoted by the website as saying. "Watching the ball till the last and not committing to a particular shot is the key, and after batting on these practice pitches I'm feeling a lot better. The bounce is not steep and if you can gauge the pace then it is a nice wicket to bat on," said the left-handed batsman. According to the curator, the pitch is expected to have consistent bounce but not "great pace". The pitches were re-laid at Seddon Park in 2004 with soil imported from South Island after a history of low-scoring fixtures, including that infamous Test against Bangladesh in 2001-02 which ended in two and a half days including rain delays, and questions about its quality. But after the new soil had been put in, results have been more encouraging. The Tigers Saturday extended their nets with all the batsmen getting opportunities to bat while the bowlers bowled long spells to get into the channel of the match conditions. James Marshall will lead the Northern Knights in the absence of regular skipper Daniel Vettori, who is touring Australia to lead the Kiwis in the Chappel-Hadlee Series. The visitors will play their second warm-up against the same rivals on Tuesday and then travel to Auckland on Dec 21 to take on the Auckland Aces in the last warm-up. Bangladesh squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Zunaed Siddique, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Tushar Imran, Saqib Al Hasan, Farhad Reza, Mushfiqur Rahim (wicketkeeper), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain. The Northern Knights squad (Sunday) : James Marshall (captain), Brent Arnel, Graeme Aldridge, S Andrews, Daniel Flynn, Nick Horsley, Peter McGlashan, Bruce Martin, Mark Orchard, G Robinson, Tim Southee and Bradley J Watling. Tuesday's squad: James Marshall (captain), Graeme Aldridge, Ian Butler, Daniel Flynn, Nick Horsley, Peter McGlashan, Bruce Martin, Mark Orchard, Tim Southee, Bradley J Watling, K WilliamsonK Williamson and Joseph Yovich. bdne
