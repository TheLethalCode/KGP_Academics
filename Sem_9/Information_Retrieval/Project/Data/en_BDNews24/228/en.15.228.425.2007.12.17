<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Princess Diana told one of her closest friends just days before she was killed with her lover Dodi al-Fayed that she needed marriage "like a rash on my face," an inquest into their deaths was told on Monday. Lady Annabel Goldsmith, 73, said she would never forget those striking words because it was one of the last things Diana ever said to her before being killed in a high-speed Paris car crash in August 1997.

He says Diana's body was embalmed to cover up evidence she was expecting a baby. The inquest was told that French police investigating the crash never once suggested that their deaths were anything but a tragic accident. Retired Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff Rees, the liaison officer between Paris police probing the deaths and Scotland Yard police headquarters in London, said he kept posing that question every time he met French detectives.
