 COLOMBO, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard was included in a 12-man squad for the third and final test against Sri Lanka starting in Galle on Tuesday. Fast bowler Stuart Broad, who made his debut in the drawn second test, was left out on Monday to accommodate the possible return of Hoggard who missed the second test with a back injury. Hoggard's fitness is still being monitored although England could opt to play two spinners on a pitch set to offer plenty of turn. "It's amazing how much the pitch can change in 24 hours in conditions here - yesterday it was completely green and today it is brown and barren," England captain Michael Vaughan told reporters. Sri Lanka lead the series 1-0 after winning the first test in Kandy by 88 runs. The start of the final test has been pushed back two hours to noon local time (0630 GMT) after an afternoon downpour on Monday. England squad: Michael Vaughan, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Matthew Hoggard, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann, Steve Harmiso
