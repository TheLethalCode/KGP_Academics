<TITLE> Russia plans no forces buildup after CFE freeze </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday it had no plans to stage a major buildup of forces following its decision to freeze its compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. "Russia does not plan any extraordinary expansion of forces that would pose a threat to other states," Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Kislyak as telling a news conference in Moscow. Russia on Wednesday suspended its participation in the CFE, designed to limit weapons levels on either side of the old Iron Curtain, because it believes the Cold War-era pact gives too much scope to an enlarged NATO to beef up its forces. Kislyak added, however, that this step did not mean Russia was suspending its security dialogue with the West. "The introduction of the moratorium is not the end of the story. But the dialogue should be serious," he was quoted by Interfax as saying.
