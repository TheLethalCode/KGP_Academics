 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Power trickled back to parts of the country, including some areas in the capital, after more than four hours of blackout, an official said. According to Bangladesh Power Development Board, the power situation may come back to normal by 10pm Saturday. Power Division secretary Faozul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com: "The committee formed to probe power failures in the wake of Cyclone Sidr will investigate today's incident too." Much of the country suffered power failures as the national grid ran into technical glitches at 11:45am, ASM Bazlul Haque, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told bdnews24.com. Haque had earlier said: "Repair work is going on. The situation may come back to normal within an hour." The power failures stemmed from technical problems at Ashuganj Power Station, which affected the transmission line. bdnews24.co
