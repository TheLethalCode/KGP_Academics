 BUENOS AIRES, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone has signed a one-year contract to coach River Plate starting on Jan. 3, the club announced on Saturday. Simeone replaces Daniel Passarella, who quit last month after River were knocked out of the Copa Sudamericana by modest Arsenal ending their last chance of winning a trophy this year. Simeone, 37, turned to coaching in 2005 after playing 106 games for Argentina and having represented some of Europe's top clubs including Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid. He began his coaching career at Racing Club and led Estudiantes to the national championship in 2006. "This is an enormous challenge," Simeone told a news conference. "I love challenges, but I know that with the players and with people's support we are going to restore River to their rightful place." River have not won a title in the last six domestic championships, considered an eternity for one of the clubs which traditionally dominates the game in Argentina alongside arch-rivals Boca Juniors. River Plate president Jose Maria Aguilar, whose support for former Argentina captain Passarella never flagged despite the club's poor performances, was pleased with the new appointment. "We feel very comfortable having found Simeone as his career takes off," Aguilar told reporters. Simeone said he was looking forward to working with players who were anxious to redeem themselves. "I know what it means to come to River at my young age and I know what I want," said Simeone, whose two sons play for River's junior teams
