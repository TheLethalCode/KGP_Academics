<TITLE> Asia shares bruised by stagflation worry, JGBs up </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares in Asia took another beating on Tuesday, with financial stocks and exporters hardest hit on concerns that a slowing economy in the United States combined with accelerating price rises could lead to stagflation. Investors shunned riskier stocks and sought comfort in government bonds, worried that stagflation, which refers to when prices rise and growth stagnates, would curb spending and drag out the credit crisis. Stagflation was last seen in the 1970s following a massive spike in oil prices. Oil prices edged up towards $91 a barrel on Tuesday, while Japanese government bonds (JGBs) firmed, tracking gains in Treasuries. News that sentiment among US home builders held at a record low for a third consecutive month in December intensified worries about the US housing market slump -- the trigger for the credit crisis -- added to last week's report showing that US consumer prices rose as their sharpest rate in 2 years. Major US indexes fell between 1.3-2.3 percent. Worries that the US slowdown may spread, curbing growth in Asia dented commodity prices. Copper, zinc and aluminium prices fell. "It's looking a bit ugly, and not just in commodities," said Katie Dean, senior economist at ANZ Bank. "This latest round of risk aversion was triggered by the inflation outlook, not just United States' but elsewhere. There are renewed concerns about global growth and the decoupling theory -- that Asia and Australia were insulated to a degree by the slowdown in the United States." Japanese stocks fell for the fifth session in a row. Tokyo's Nikkei, which shed almost 5 percent in the previous 4 trading days, pared earlier losses to end the midsession down 0.8 percent. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks shed 1.2 percent to a three-month low. The index is about 16 percent below its Nov. 1 record high, but is still up by about a quarter as the year draws to a close. Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Taiwan's benchmark index, and Singapore's Straits Times were down between 0.7-1.6 percent. In South Korea the benchmark KOSPI index fell 0.3 percent, with mobile phone maker LG Electronics Inc, hurt by gloom over the US economy, also South Korea's No.2 export market. MINERS FALL Mining stocks were weaker as metals fell, with Rio Tinto down 2 percent and its suitor BHP Billiton off by 1.4 percent by 0154 GMT. The falls, together with another plunge in shares in Centro Properties Group on fears about its subprime exposure, sent the benchmark index to a 4-month low. "The whole market is getting smacked," said Sean Fenton, a fund manager with Jenkins Investment Mangement. "I suspect just the big falls of the past few days have triggered margin calls," he added. A margin call is when brokers demand more cash from investors when the value of their shares bought with borrowed money drops, often forcing the investor to sell shares to cover payments. Investors are awaiting an earnings report from Goldman Sachs due on Tuesday to show how much the financial heavyweight has been hit by the credit crunch. Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns report earnings later this week. The dollar held near a seven-week high against the euro on as the US currency drew support from the view that inflation pressure may limit the extent to which the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates. The dollar was steady at 112.90 yen by 0220 GMT. In the bond market, March 10-year JGB futures rose 0.17 of a point to 136.65 while the benchmark 10-year JGB yield slipped 2 basis points to 1.530 percent Light crude oil added 12 cents to $90.75 a barrel, while gold changed hands at around $792 an ounce
