 Singapore, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are reactions to Saturday's UN-led climate talks agreement in Bali to start negotiations on a new global warming pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. The United States dropped last-minute opposition. UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON: "I am deeply grateful to many member states for their spirit of flexibility and compromise." INDONESIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER HASSAN WIRAJUDA: "Here in Bali we reached a consensus, global consensus for all countries. "No single country was excluded, in a very inclusive processs...we hope it will provide not only a good basis but also the momentum in the coming years." JAMES CONNAUGHTON, CHAIRMAN OF THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY: "There is no question that we have opened a new page and are moving forward together. It is a strong commitment jointly reached by all countries to advance negotiations. "This is not a step taken alone by America, this is a step taken by all the countries that the time had come to open a new chapter." "We now have one of the broadest negotiating agendas ever on climate change....The large emerging economies, which also produce large amounts of greenhouse gases, also have to be part of the solution." INDIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MINISTER KAPIL SIBAL: "We wanted to make sure the two-track process was maintained that there was no dilution of the Kuyoto Protocol. The developed world has appreciated that they had commitments and the developing world has appreciated that it has responsibilities. "If we understand what the roadmap will be, there will be no complications. "The world community realises that unless the U.S. comes on board we cannot achieve our goal." BRITISH ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY HILARY BENN: "This is a stark breakthrough, it's been a rollercoaster." DUTCH ENVIRONMENT MINISTER JACQUELINE CRAMER: "It was a delicate balance and we were able to really build consensus in this room and indeed the United States was willing to give in. "The G77 was willing to give in, everybody was willing to give in. We could not leave here without a Bali roadmap." JOYASHREE ROY, EXPERT ON THE ECONOMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AT JADHAVPUR UNIVERSITY IN KOLKATA, INDIA: "This is very positive news. Unless the leader is taking the lead then the followers will not follow. But this should not just be a gesture, it must involve commitments, if the United States accepts targets then it will force others to do so." "India should make preparations to come up with timelines by when it can make some sort of a commitment -- it may be a commitment for emissions cuts or for mitigation efforts. EVERTON VARGAS, HEAD OF BRAZIL'S DELEGATION: "We are very happy, we think it's a great success." PAULA DOBRIANSKY, U.S. UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL AFFAIRS: "We have our work cut out. Work remains...We joined the consensus...after hearing the comments (from South Africa, Brazil and others) we were assured by their commitment to act."
