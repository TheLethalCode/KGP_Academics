 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Freedom fighters and Indian Army will jointly celebrate the Victory Day in Kolkata, the Indian High Commission said in a press statement Friday. The three-day celebrations started Friday at Fort William, the headquarters of Eastern Command of the Indian Army. Eighteen freedom fighters, led by retired Major Gen (Retd) Imam-Uz-Zaman, left for Kolkata the same day to join the celebration. The freedom fighters include retired Colonel Abu Osman Chowdhury, Ali Zaker, Sara Zaker and Bulbul Mahalanobis. The celebrations include placing of wreaths at the Vijay Smarak (victory memorial) in honour of the Indian troops who died in the War of Independence. The other programmes include a tattoo and military band display, cultural shows and reception. India celebrates Dec 16 every year as a good number of its troops laid down their lives in the war. India trained guerilla forces and provided military and diplomatic help to secure Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan, its archrival. On Dec 16, 1971, the Pakistani occupation forces surrendered to the joint forces, which included the guerilla Mukti Bahini and the Indian Army, in Dhaka. bd
