<TITLE> Malaysia to US: don't meddle in our security law </TITLE>

 KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia has told the United States to remember Guantanamo Bay and not to criticise its own use of the Internal Security Act, a Malaysian law that allows detention without trial, the New Straits Times said on Saturday. Malaysia has detained five ethnic Indians under the ISA for helping to organise a huge anti-government protest last month. Under the Act, they can be held for up to two years on the grounds that their actions had threatened national security. "Our expectation as a government is that these individuals would be provided the full protection under Malaysian law, that they would be given due process, that they would be accorded all the rights accorded to any other citizen, and that this will be done in a speedy and transparent manner," Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak was reported as saying. Najib reacted to comments by US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack on Thursday that Washington hoped that those arrested in Malaysia would enjoy full legal protections and rights, due process, and a speedy and transparent handling of their case. "Can they (the United States) first of all give a fair trial to the detainees in Guantanamo Bay?" he asked. "We'll only respond if they do so." Najib was referring to Washington's detention of foreign captives without charge at its Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a practice which has drawn intense international criticism. Najib said the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) had been given ample advice and warnings since it staged an illegal demonstration on Nov. 25 before the Act was brought into play. "We have always said people must obey the law. Nobody is above the law. So when the ISA was used, it should not have come as a surprise," Najib said in the paper. Hindraf alarmed the government by bringing more than 10,000 ethnic Indians onto the streets of the capital to complain of racial discrimination.
