<TITLE> Musharraf lifts emergency rule, pledges fair poll </TITLE>

 ISLAMABAD, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Pervez Musharraf lifted emergency rule in Pakistan and restored the constitution on Saturday, in a move Western nations hope will stabilise the nuclear-armed state as Islamic militant violence spirals. Musharraf immediately pledged a fair election on Jan. 8. But critics say curbs on the media and a purged judiciary will remain in place and they say he can still engineer an election victory for his parliamentary allies and secure a power base despite his unpopularity. "It's my commitment to the entire nation of Pakistan and to its people and to the world that the elections on Jan. 8 will be on time and will be absolutely fair and transparent," Musharraf said in a televised address shortly after lifting the emergency. Citing militant violence and a meddling judiciary, Musharraf imposed the emergency on Nov. 3, suspended the constitution and purged the Supreme Court to fend off challenges to his re-election, which new hand-picked judges later rubber-stamped. But he faced international condemnation for his actions, with Western countries worried he would only further polarise Pakistan and leave a vacuum that Islamic militants fighting an insurgency near the border with Afghanistan could fill. Two soldiers and three civilians were killed near a Pakistani army camp by a suicide bomber on a bicycle on Saturday, underscoring a growing number of insurgent attacks this year in which hundreds of people have been killed. HOUSE ARREST Some lawyers and judges, including Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who were deposed by Musharraf are still under house arrest. The Pakistani media criticised this week a ban on live broadcasts as an attempt to control election coverage. "We consider the lifting of the state of emergency an important step forward," opposition leader and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto told reporters in the southwestern city of Quetta soon after the end of the emergency was announced. "But more needs to be done for the restoration of democracy." Many ordinary Pakistanis were also sceptical. "This emergency was staged to perpetuate one-man rule," said Akbar Ali, an employee at a car leasing company in the main northwestern city of Peshawar. "There is no guarantee he won't stage this emergency again if he sees his rule in danger." On Saturday, Musharraf took fresh oaths of office from the Supreme Court judges appointed after he imposed the emergency. He also issued a decree protecting him from legal challenges over his actions during the emergency, something previous military rulers in Pakistan have done. Election monitors and many politicians fear Musharraf, despite calls for a fair vote, can rig the polls through a network of district chiefs, bogus votes and by excluding opposition supporters from ballot stations. Critics point out that Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup but stepped down as army chief last month, still lives in his army house. The election is essentially a three-way battle between parties loyal to Musharraf and the parties of two main opposition leaders, former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Bhutto. An opposition-run parliament could move to impeach the general over accusations he acted unconstitutionally in securing a new term as president.
