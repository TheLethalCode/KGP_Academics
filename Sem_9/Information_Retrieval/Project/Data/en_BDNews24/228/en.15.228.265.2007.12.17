<TEXT>
 Bishkek, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's party won every available seat in the next parliament, preliminary results showed on Monday, following a weekend election condemned as rigged by the opposition. The tiny ex-Soviet state, home to both US and Russian military bases, has been volatile since Bakiyev came to power in 2005 when a string of violent protests triggered by a disputed election toppled his long-serving predecessor, Askar Akayev. If confirmed by final results, Bakiyev's Ak Zhol party would dominate the 90-seat chamber in effective one-party rule -- a break from Kyrgyzstan's past as the most liberal state among more authoritarian Central Asian countries. "It'll most likely be a one-party system," said Toktogul Kakchekeyev, an independent political analyst. Ak Zhol won 48 percent of Sunday's vote, the Central Election Commission said on Monday, citing results after 80 percent had been counted. The opposition Ata Meken party was the only other party to pass the nationwide threshold of 5 percent needed to make it into the chamber, with 9.3 percent. But it failed to meet a separate requirement of taking 0.5 percent of the vote in each of Kyrgyzstan's seven regions and two main cities. Bakiyev has been accused at home of backtracking on his pre-election promises to bring more democracy and stability. He says stronger rule will help rebuild the economy, still in tatters after the Soviet collapse and burdened by huge debt. His party says it sees Russia -- where President Vladimir Putin's party controls more than two-thirds of seats in parliament -- as a guiding model. Neighbouring Kazakhstan also has a one-party parliament. "The desire to copy Russia and Kazakhstan is priority number one for the authorities," Kakchekeyev said. RIGGED? The opposition said it had registered cases of forced voting and ballot stuffing, and has threatened to take action if it was blocked from joining the assembly. "We don't accept this election's result," said Kubatbek Baibolov of the Ata Meken party. "The authorities ... are just cynically appointing their own people into parliament. It will lead to trouble. People feel deceived." The previous parliamentary election in 2005, also disputed by the opposition, sparked protests that toppled Akayev and brought Bakiyev to power. But, despite accusations of irregularities, many voters said they voted for Ak Zhol, seeing it as a guarantor for stability following years of political turbulence and street protests. The election monitoring arm of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- an internationally accepted yardstick on the fairness of elections -- is expected to announce its verdict later on Monday. The final official election result is due later this week
