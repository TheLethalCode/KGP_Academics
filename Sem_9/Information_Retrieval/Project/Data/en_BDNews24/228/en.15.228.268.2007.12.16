 DHAKA, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian private airline Jet Airways flies to Dhaka from Sunday, a company official said Saturday. "Dhaka will become the 11th international destination for the airline," K. Datta, executive director of Jet Airways, told a news conference in Dhaka. The airline will operate one daily flight between Dhaka and Kolkata in West Bengal, India and four flights a week between Dhaka and New Delhi, effective from Sunday, Datta said. The new generation Boeing 737-800 aircraft will be deployed for the new routes. The airline currently operates a fleet of 75 aircraft, which includes eight Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft and six Airbus A300-200 aircraft. It also plans to extend its international operations to other cities in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia in phases with the induction of additional wide-body aircraft into its fleet, Datta said.
