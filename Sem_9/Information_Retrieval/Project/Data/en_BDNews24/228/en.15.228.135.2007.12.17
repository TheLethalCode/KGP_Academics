 Tehran, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's president said on Sunday the publication of a US intelligence report saying Iran had halted a nuclear weapons programme in 2003 amounted to a "declaration of surrender" by Washington in its row with Tehran. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also dismissed in an interview with state television the prospect of new UN sanctions against Iran over its refusal to halt sensitive atomic work. "It is too far-fetched," he said when asked whether he expected the UN Security Council to impose fresh sanctions on Iran following two such resolutions since last December. Ahmadinejad, who often rails against the West, told a rally earlier this month that the Dec. 3 publication of the US National Intelligence Estimate was a "victory" for Iran. He said on Sunday: "It was in fact a declaration of surrender ... It was a positive action by the US administration to change their attitude and it was a correct move." Washington is still pushing for more sanctions on Iran despite the US intelligence report, which also said Tehran was continuing to master skills needed to make nuclear weapons. US President George W Bush said Iran was still a danger. An exiled opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), last week said Iran shut down its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 but said restarted it a year later, dispersing equipment to thwart international inspectors. Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful and designed to make electricity. It says it has never had a nuclear weapons programme. "It would be beneficial for both Iran and them (the West) to cooperate with Iran," Ahmadinejad said. "Of course it would be more to their benefit than Iran's." Iran regularly calls for a change in behaviour from the United States, which cut diplomatic ties with Iran in 1980 after radical students seized the US embassy and took diplomats hostage during the 1979 Islamic revolution
