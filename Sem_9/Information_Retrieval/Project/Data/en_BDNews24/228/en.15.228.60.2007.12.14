<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh had their first nets Friday at Seddon Park in Hamilton after reaching New Zealand the day before to play a three one-dayers and two Tests. The Tigers, splitting into two groups, practised, with the first group leaving the hotel by the Waikato River of the Seddon Park at 9:20am (2:20am Bangladesh standard time) while the second followed them an hour and a half later. Most of the players had some difficulty getting decent sleep the night before as getting used to a sleeping routine is the first adjustment for the boys in New Zealand, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Hamilton is seven hours ahead of Dhaka and by the time the eyes start getting sleepy the players all of a sudden realised that it was time to train. The cricketers practised in three separate nets, one with the new Bola bowling machine they have carried to New Zealand, at Seddon Park. Local net bowlers, some of whom may feature in the Northern Districts team, bowled against the visitors, who will play first two practice matches against the Northern District team on Dec 16 and 18. "The practice wickets are good. They are a bit on the slower side but have even bounce," said Aftab Ahmed after his first hit in the nets. Saqib Al Hasan said, "I pulled a lot of deliveries today (Friday) and it felt pretty good because the timing was there and balls were hitting the right areas of the bat. If the centre wickets are similar in character then we should not have too many problems adjusting." The left-arm spinner, Saqib, also bowled in the nets and found a bit of turn. The pacers too enjoyed their natural speed when balls pitched on a length. There was also fielding drill and after lunch the day's programme rounded off with a gym session. The weather in Hamilton has been warm lately, unlike the southern parts of the country and the skies are expected to stay clear over the weekend, meaning the first warm-up game on Sunday is not under any threat from elements. The squad for the first practice match is expected to be named after Saturday's nets session at Seddon Park. b
