The visitors took the lead in the 29th minute when France striker David Trezeguet deflected in his 12th goal of the season after a goalmouth scramble. Lazio levelled in the 36th when Tommaso Rocchi found Massimo Mutarelli in the area and the midfielder volleyed the ball across the face of goal for Macedonia striker Goran Pandev to head in. Juve captain Del Piero, making his first start in four league games, then latched on to a long pass and drilled the ball into the far corner three minutes after the break. The Rome side pressed forward in search of the equaliser but were caught on the counter-attack in the 70th as Del Piero scored a goal similar to his first. Pandev pulled one back for Lazio in stoppage time. Juventus have 32 points from 16 games and share second place with AS Roma, who visit Torino on Sunday. Leaders Inter Milan, who have 37 points, travel to Cagliari on Sunday. CATANIA WIN Earlier on Saturday, Catania beat high-fliers Udinese 2-0 at home thanks to two Giuseppe Mascara goals.
