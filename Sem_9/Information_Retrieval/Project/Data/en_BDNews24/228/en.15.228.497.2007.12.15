 NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Saturday dropped opposition to a compromise deal at UN talks in Bali meant to launch negotiations on a global climate pact after appeals from several nations. "We will go forward and join consensus," Paula Dobriansky, heading the US delegation, told the 190-nation meeting to cheers from many in the audience, minutes after triggering boos by saying Washington was still opposed. The turnaround seemed to clear the way for an agreement to start two years of talks on a new climate deal to succeed the Kyoto Protocol and bind outsiders led by the United States, China and India more closely into fighting climate change. No other speakers opposed the compromise deal after an appeal by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for delegates to overcome splits. "I am disappointed at the lack of progress," he said. "Your work is not yet over...everybody should be able to make compromises. You have in your hands the ability to deliver to the peoples of the world a successul outcome."
