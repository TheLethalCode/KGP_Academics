<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate unexpectedly held steady in November as a sharp rise in petrol prices was offset by continued downward pressure from utility bills, data showed on Tuesday. Sterling fell as traders who had expected inflation to rise bet the Bank of England would have more leeway to cut interest rates should the economy weaken sharply. The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 0.3 percent last month, leaving the annual rate unchanged at 2.1 percent. Analysts had forecast a rise to 2.2 percent, pulling away from the Bank's two percent target. Policymakers have a difficult balancing act as the recent rise in oil prices means inflation looks set to remain above target for several months even as the economy slows. "The Monetary Policy Committee has no immediate cause for concern but its focus will be on the expected spike in inflation next year on the back on wholesale energy prices," said David Page at Investec. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 5.5 percent earlier this month and markets are pricing in at least three more quarter-point cuts over the coming year as the economy slows. Bank Governor Mervyn King is due to give evidence to parliament later on Tuesday on financial market issues. The biggest upward impact came from road fuel prices with average petrol prices rising by 3.5 pence per litre over the month compared with a modest fall last year. The annual rate of inflation for fuels and lubricants was the highest in more than two years. However, there was a downward impact from utility bills as gas and electricity prices continued to come down after huge increases last year. The annual rate of inflation for electricity and gas was the lowest since records began in January 1997 at -5.6 percent. Still, utility bills are unlikely to exert a downward influence for long. Oil prices have soared close to $100 a barrel in recent weeks and several energy companies, including British Gas and npower, have recently increased tariffs on their tracker products. Core inflation, which excludes energy and other volatile items, fell to 1.4 percent, its lowest in a year. However, the retail price index -- on which many wage deals are based -- rose unexpectedly to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. RPIx, the measure which excludes mortgage payments, also rose unexpectedly to 3.2 percent from 3.1 perce
