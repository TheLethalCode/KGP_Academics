 Canberra, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A swimmer has been attacked by a shark at Australia's Bondi beach, popular with tourists from around the world, for the first time in 70 years. Scott Wright, 34, was swimming at the south end of the beach on Friday evening when a small shark bit his arm, leaving him with deep gouges, local newspapers reported on Sunday. Wright, a tourist from the southern island state of Tasmania, made his way ashore before passing out in a cliff cave that he was living in temporarily while in Sydney. Wright was found by his girlfriend on Saturday morning. "The shark attacked me, grabbed hold of my arm and wouldn't let go. So I ended up punching him in the nose and trying to fight him off," he told local television. "I thought I was a goner. I thought I was gonna die." Lifeguards at the beach, popular with revellers over Christmas and New Year holidays, said while sharks were often seen in deeper waters offshore, they rarely made it through protective net barriers to threaten swimmers. "He went swimming in the dark, which we strongly discourage," lifeguard Ryan Clark told the Sun-Herald newspaper
