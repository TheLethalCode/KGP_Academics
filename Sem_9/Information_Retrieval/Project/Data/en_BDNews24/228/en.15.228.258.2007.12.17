 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Rezina Naser, daughter-in-law of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, was freed from Dhaka Central Jail on bail Monday, a top prisons official said. The wife of Saifur's son Naser Rahman turned herself in to the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court in Dhaka and was sent to jail on Dec 12. "She (Rezina) was released after we received bail documents from the High Court," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com by phone. The High Court bench of justices Syed Md Mudassir Dastagir and Abdul Hafiz granted Rezina bail in a graft case filed by ACC deputy director Moniruzzaman Khan. She surrendered to court after the trial court issued an arrest order in the case. According to case details, the couple allegedly concealed wealth of Tk 2.63 crore in their asset statement submitted to the Anticorruption Commission. The commission also accused them of earning wealth of Tk 6.23 crore from undeclared sources. A Sylhet court sentenced Naser to nine years in jail on Sept 18 in another case involving Tk 2 crore in extorted money. Naser was arrested on Feb 3. bd
