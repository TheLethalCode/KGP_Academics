 Bishkek, Dec 16 (BDNEWS24.COM/Reuters) - Kyrgyz voters went to the polls on Sunday in a snap parliamentary election expected to hand President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's party an overwhelming victory though it has been criticised as undemocratic by the opposition. Home to a US and a Russian military airbase, Kyrgyzstan has been unstable since 2005 when protests ousted veteran leader Askar Akayev and brought Bakiyev to power. The outgoing parliament, elected in a disputed vote in 2005 and packed with Akayev-era deputies, has been the main source of political tension. Bakiyev dissolved the unruly chamber in October and promised to hold a free and fair vote this time. But the opposition has accused Bakiyev of orchestrating a campaign to silence them and abusing power in favour of his Ak Zhol party in the run-up to the vote. "It is a deja vu situation: everything is just like in 2005," said Almazbek Atambayev, head of the opposition Social Democratic party, referring to the 2005 unrest. Kubatbek Baibolov, leader of opposition party Ata-Meken, added: "Massive electoral fraud is being planned." A handful of early voters lined up at polling stations to cast ballots as voting kicked off at 8:00 a.m. (0200 GMT). Voting booths will stay open until 8:00 p.m. (1400 GMT). The tiny nation of 5 million has 2.7 million registered voters. Wary after years of unrest, some voters said they were ready for stronger presidential rule for the sake of stability. "People trust them (Ak Zhol) so I trust them too," Aibek, a man in his 20s who sells goods at a market in the capital, said after casting his vote. "They can bring some stability." OSCE WATCHING Bakiyev was elected in a 2005 vote praised by Western monitors. But a constitutional referendum in October, which extended his presidential authority, was criticised by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. More than 250 observers from the OSCE's election monitoring arm are scattered across the nation to monitor the vote. Potential unrest in Kyrgyzstan is a worry to Russia and the West as it might spill over into other Central Asian regions. Bakiyev says a less unruly parliament would help the government press ahead with stalled economic reforms in an impoverished country burdened by huge external debt. The opposition says Bakiyev might overstep the mark and block its entry into the assembly altogether. "It seems the plan is to have one team in parliament that would vote unanimously," said Atambayev, once the driving force of anti-Bakiyev protests. Some voters said they were tired of political infighting in Bakiyev's camp. Talai, an aikido instructor in his 50s, said he planned to vote for the more radical opposition Ata Meken party. "They are honest folk," he said. "They don't switch sides for no reason.
