<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation cannot be an effective forum unless India and Pakistan are able to sort out their basic problems, said MJ Akbar, editor-in-chief of The Asian Age of India Monday. The editor however added a hopeful tone, saying: "It's [Saarc] going forward. Things are progressing." Akbar was addressing participants at a discussion titled "Meaning of Minority in Politics" organised by the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute at its office in Gulshan. BEI president Farooq Sobhan chaired the discussion, which was also attended by politicians, academics and former bureaucrats. Akbar said Saarc is an extension of the commonsense of the South-Asian nations, but now economic activities have become the driving force for boosting further ties among these nations. "From now and onward, the economy will drive these nations," Akbar said. He said all the South Asian countries are independent, but their economic independence is still an essential requirement. "The arrival of so many economic horizons has brought opportunities for the Saarc countries," said the Indian journalist. In his keynote paper, MJ Akbar began with a question, "Why the Bengali Indian Bhodrolok (gentleman) never accepted the Bengali Muslim?" For the Indians, minority is a function of empowerment. India was partitioned thricein 1905, 1947 and 1971, he said. In 1872 after the first census, 48 percent people of Bengal were Muslim and identity started playing a role in politics, Abkar said. "Bangladesh was created on the basis of a modern idealanguage." The socio-history of Bengal affects the politics of the subcontinent, he added. bd
