<TITLE> South Korea president front-runner denies graft link </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The conservative candidate widely expected to be South Korea's new president denied on Tuesday fresh allegations of involvement in a financial scandal that threatens to haunt him into office if he wins. Two days before the presidential election, parliament voted on Monday to set up an independent probe into accusations Lee Myung-bak was directly involved with a firm suspected of swindling investors out of millions of dollars. "I've got nothing to hide," the former Seoul mayor told a news conference. "The result of the independent counsel probe will not change anything ... There is only one truth." The scandal appeared to have been put to rest when earlier this month prosecutors said they had not found any evidence to incriminate Lee. But at the weekend, political rivals aired a video which they said showed he had lied about his role in the BBK investment company at the centre of the allegations. Already sounding like a president-elect, Lee said the fuss was no more than the usual political mudslinging, which he would stamp out once he took office. "When I become president ... I will make sure there will be no grounds for negative campaigning to take place." Even his chief election rival, liberal Chung Dong-young who has been trailing by some 30 points in opinion polls, all but admitted his chances in Wednesday's vote were slim, pinning his hopes of winning on what he said would be a miracle. Chung has been hamstrung by his political links to the outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun who has fared poorly in opinion polls through much of his five-year term, widely viewed as having failed to give a lift to the once fast-growing Korean economy. It is that desire among voters to see more jobs and fatter wallets that Lee has capitalised on with his campaign promise to run the country like the CEO he used to be at one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates, promising fast growth and an end to excessive regulations. With nicknames like "bulldozer Lee" for his reputation of getting things done and "the economy president", he has maintained a huge lead throughout the campaign and analysts say the latest splash of headlines questioning his ethics are unlikely to do more than trim his margin of victory. Some said the latest furore could be more aimed at April's parliamentary elections when the liberals face an uphill struggle to hang on to control of the National Assembly as voters appear to be shifting in favour of conservative politics after 10 years of liberal presidents. That ploy, said executive director of policy research at MIN Consulting Jeong Chan-soo, could be a risk for the Chung camp. "If Lee turns out to be cleared of all charges again, the ... (liberals) will no longer have anything to go with in the April elections." Though Lee looks set to become the first president-elect to face a criminal investigation, its results are unlikely to be completed until after a Feb. 25 inauguration. That means he would be immune from prosecution during his single, five-year term though his political opponents would almost certainly seek to impeach him, which would be difficult if Lee's party also wins control of parliament. But analysts said if he is found to have been involved, Lee's authority as president would certainly be hurt. "The moral deficiency issue will undermine his leadership," said Lee Nae-young, political science professor at Korea University. Added Lee Jin-woo, currency research head at N.A.C.F. Futures Co: "If he is found guilty or of being involved in something wrong, it will of course increase uncertainty about the Korean financial markets and society.
