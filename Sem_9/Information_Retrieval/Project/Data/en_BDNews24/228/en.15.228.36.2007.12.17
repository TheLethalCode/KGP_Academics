 TOKYO, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda apologised on Monday for his ruling party's handling of a public pensions crisis, after seeing his support ratings tumble in polls. Fukuda offered the apology after the health minister admitted last week that the government might never be able to sort out some of the 50 million public pension accounts found earlier to have been mishandled by officials.

The LDP pledged in the flyer to sort out the pensions muddle by the end of March. "I must apologise," Fukuda was quoted as telling reporters. Public outrage over the bungled pension records was a big factor in the ruling camp's huge loss in the July poll. Fukuda himself provoked public anger over the pension crisis last week, when he said that the ruling party did not make a campaign pledge to clean up the mess so quickly. "I don't think it was such a big deal which we could call a 'public promise'," he told reporters last week. Recent national surveys of voters by domestic media showed public support for Fukuda's cabinet slipping mover than 10 percentage points from a month ago. According to a poll released by the Nikkei business daily on Monday, the approval rating for the cabinet dropped 12 percentage points from last month to 43 percent.

Japanese prosecutors last month arrested a former Vice Defence Minister over suspicions he had taken bribes from a defence contract
