 HAMILTON, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rich, North Atlantic island of Bermuda votes in an election on Tuesday as the ruling party pushes for a third term in office against an opposition that says it has failed to tackle the nation's challenges. The ruling Progressive Labour Party wound up its campaign with a noisy rally in the capital Hamilton late on Monday at which Prime Minister Ewart Brown urged the party to get "every living soul" out to the country's 36 constituencies to vote. "In spite of their (the opposition's) efforts to demonize me and my wife and my friends and my colleagues I am not the monster that they say I am and you know that," Brown told a crowd of over 1,000 cheering supporters decked out in green party T-shirts that bore the logo "PLP gets my vote". He won wild applause as he introduced the soul duo "Ashford and Simpson," flown in to perform their 1980s hit "Solid." Solid as the Rock is a party slogan. Polls open at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Britain's oldest and most populous remaining colony, which has a population of around 66,000. The ruling party hopes to increase it's 22-14 majority. Analysts say the election is in part a referendum on Brown's performance since he took office last October as well as a test of the popularity of his party's plan to deal with health care for the elderly and the status of the country's long-term foreign residents. The island enjoys a per capita income that is one of the highest in the world based upon a booming reinsurance industry and tourism as well as near zero unemployment and low crime. But the opposition United Bermuda Party accuses Brown of corruption and says his party has failed since it took power in 1998 to create more affordable housing in a nation of high population density where rents are some of the most expensive in the world. TOUGH FIGHT Opposition leader Michael Dunkley, who faces a tough fight against former Prime Minister Jennifer Smith in his constituency, said he was campaigning door-to-door late on Monday. "If we are going to be successful taking over from the governing party we need to win more seats and I'm not afraid of trying to break the back of the governing party so I took the challenge," he said of his decision to fight the Devonshire East seat. The 36 constituencies of Bermuda are so small, at around 1,100 voters each, that every vote weighs heavily and many sitting members of parliament defend razor-thin majorities. "I am here to represent all people unlike the current government who want to divide and conquer," Dunkley said in a telephone interview, adding that the main election issues were education, housing and crime. The opposition accuses the government of double-talk over its vow that the election will not kickstart the process of seeking independence from Britain. Dunkley said his party would not seek independence until a clear majority of Bermudians voted for it in a separate referendum. Independence is potentially divisive in a country that is 65 percent black, but where whites, who make up 35 percent of the population, dominated business and politics before a new constitution in 1968 allowed internal self-government. Memories of race riots 30 years ago remain fresh and in the last election the ruling party used its status as the main vehicle for black voters to attempt to scare voters away from the opposition, analysts sa
