 BRUSSELS, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Belgian labour union members marched on Saturday against the failure of Belgium's politicians to form a government and tackle rising fuel and food prices. The linguistically divided country, home to the European Union and NATO, has been without a new government since the elections six months ago as efforts to form a coalition failed. The deadlock has sparked speculation that the 177-year-old state could split into Dutch- and French-speaking regions, a step the labour unions say would tip Belgium's social security system into chaos and create inequalities. "People are fed up with the discussions between the political parties. This is a very serious warning to the parties to take care of the people," Bernard Noel, national secretary of the liberal union CGSLB, told Reuters. "If they don't listen today, I am afraid of a backlash against politicians and things could get tougher in coming weeks," Noel said, adding that strikes were an option. Brussels police said 18,000 people took part in the crosstown march between two of the capital's main stations. A strike by train drivers made it difficult for more to attend. The CGSLB, CSC and FGTB unions organised the demonstration. All three want Belgium to remain unified with a new government to reverse a drop in people's spending power. Expensive oil and food has lifted inflation in the 13-nation euro zone, which includes Belgium, to its highest level in six and a half years. "Potato prices have gone up by 30 percent in a short time. The politicians knew compromise was necessary and people feel they should stop their silly games," Noel said. Belgian newspaper Le Soir reported on Saturday a study by French consultancy Capgemini which said electricity prices in Belgium rose 11 percent between 2006 and 2007 despite electricity markets in Wallonia and Brussels being opened up to competition from January this year. Union leaders were also meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt who has been asked by King Albert to help set up an interim government and draft reforms that would devolve more powers to the regions. But CSC General Secretary Claude Rolin said politicians should stop focusing on institutional issues and deal with people's everyday problems. Daniel Ducarme, a senior member of the MR liberal party, told newspapers on Saturday that Belgium as a federal state was at an end and its French speaking parts should unite though keeping its flag and king. "I will fight in favour of a system of association with France," Ducarme was quoted a saying.
