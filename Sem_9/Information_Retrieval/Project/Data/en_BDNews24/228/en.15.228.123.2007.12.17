 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission will file a case against former BNP minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury on charges of concealing information about his wealth, an official said Monday. In a news briefing, ACC director general Colonel Hanif Iqbal said the graft watchdog would file the charges against Altaf, a former air force chief. "Altaf Hossain Chowdhury in his statement to the ACC suppressed information about Tk 59 lakh in wealth," Iqbal said. "The commission's investigation also reveals that he (Altaf) owns about Tk 2.56 crore in illegal wealth," he said. The commission had earlier filed a case against Altaf and his wife for their alleged corruption in the Bangladesh Air Force. Altaf is behind bars, pending trial, after he was arrested on May 29. Qazi Aminul Huq, former mayor of Khulna City Corporation, and Mohammad Hasan, ex-deputy commissioner of Chittagong, will face similar charges from the commission, Iqbal said. He said Aminul Huq concealed information about his wealth of about Tk 53 lakh and earned about Tk 74 lakh in illegal wealth. Mohammad Hasan in his statement to the commission also suppressed wealth of about Tk 5 lakh and he allegedly earned wealth of another Tk 5 lakh through unclear means, the official said. Aminul Huq, who currently belongs to the Awami League, is on the run. He was involved with the Jatiya Party when he was the city mayor. Replying to a query, the ACC official said: "The commission is collecting information about some organisations. Investigations would be launched after collecting the details." He would not disclose the names of the organisations for the "sake of investigation". bdnews24.co
