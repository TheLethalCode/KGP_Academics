 Tokyo, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan and China are unlikely to resolve a long-running dispute over natural resources in the East China Sea during an expected visit to China by Japan's prime minister next week, Kyodo news agency quoted the trade minister as saying on Tuesday. News reports have said Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda is likely to visit China from Dec. 27-30 in what would be his first visit to the Asian neighbour. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have warmed in the past year after a long chill during the leadership of former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who repeatedly visited a shrine seen by many in Asia as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Still, ties remain frayed by a number of issues, including a row over where the dividing line between their exclusive economic zones should lie. "The possibility is very small," Trade Minister Akira Amari was quoted as telling reporters when asked if the dispute over the development of natural gas in the East China Sea would be resolved during Fukuda's visit. China is piping gas from an area close to what Japan sees as its own economic zone, sparking fears in Tokyo that Beijing could be siphoning resources from geological structures that stretch into the Japanese zone. Eleven rounds of official-level talks have failed to yield a solution to the dispute, even though Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed in April that officials should come up with a concrete plan by the autumn. Japan's top government spokesman reiterated that there had been no concrete progress to date but the row would not affect Fukuda's visit. "Of course (progress) is desirable, but I don't think it's a definite prerequisite for the (prime minister's) visit to China, in that he can't go unless progress has been made," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference
