<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Sunday asked his party adherents to respond to any political "call" in early 2008. "We are concerned about the future plan of those who want to compare the Awami League with the BNP using a single set of scales," Ashraful told a programme on Victory Day at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in Dhaka. "There will be a call for solving these issues in January. We will have to fight for our views," he said. "The sequence of events after 1/11 will not lead the country to any resolution of the existing problems." "We were hopeful when the interim government rode to power. The following events were frustrating," he said The acting general secretary went on to say certain parties are comparing Khaleda Zia's ill governance with the good governance of Sheikh Hasina. "I would rather say to the administration that if we try to measure everyone in one set of scales, they would break," Ashraful said. bdnews24.c
