 ROME, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Italian doctor accused of supplying doping products to athletes has been banned from any future involvement in sport, the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) said on Monday. Carlo Santuccione had already served a five-year ban but is now suspended for life, CONI said on its Web site (www.coni.it), adding that the full reasons for the decision would be released at a later date. Santuccione, whose son is a promising cyclist, was the focus of an Italian police investigation into doping in sport which began in 2004. Danilo Di Luca, this year's Giro d'Italia winner, was given a three-month ban in October for his involvement with Santuccione although the cyclist has always denied doping and is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). A sporting judge also ruled in October that former pole vault world champion Giuseppe Gibilisco must serve a two-year ban for links to Santuccione despite winning an earlier appeal. Gibilisco, who won gold at the 2003 worlds in Paris and bronze at the Athens Olympics a year later, said he too would take his case to CAS
