 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England won the toss and elected to bowl in the third and final test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. England omitted off spinner Graeme Swann from the 12-man squad announced on the eve of the game, opting instead for a three-man pace attack. Swing bowler Matthew Hoggard returned after a back injury that forced him out of the drawn second test in Colombo. Sri Lanka, who lead the series 1-0, also opted for a three-man pace attack, replacing the injured Dilhara Fernando with test-debutant left-armer Chanaka Welagedera. Middle order batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan was recalled, replacing Jehan Mubarak. The start was delayed until noon local time (0630 GMT) after a monsoon downpour on Monday evening. The first session will run from 1200-1330, the second from 1410 to 1555 and the third from 1615 to 1800. bdnews24.com/lq/1310hrs Michael Vaughan (captain), Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Matthew Hoggard, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Ryan Sidebottom, Steve Harmison Sri Lanka: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara, Michael Vandort, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Lasith Malinga, Chanaka Welage
