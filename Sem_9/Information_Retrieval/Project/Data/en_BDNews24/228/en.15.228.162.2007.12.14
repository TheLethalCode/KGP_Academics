<TITLE> Ukraine assembly to vote again on Tymoshenko as PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's parliament agreed on Friday to hold a second vote on Yulia Tymoshenko's bid to be restored as prime minister early next week after she just failed to win approval from the chamber. Tymoshenko's coalition of her bloc and President Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party hold a tiny majority in the 450-member chamber after a September election.

Tymoshenko and Yushchenko have had an uneasy relationship since she stood by his side during the 2004 "Orange Revolution" street protests against a fraudulent presidential election in which Yanukovich was initially declared the winner. Yushchenko won a rerun and immediately appointed Tymoshenko as his prime minister, but her blunt rhetoric split "orange" allies, soured relations with Moscow and worried investors. He sacked her seven months later. The two "orange" parties failed to form a post-election coalition government last year after defections from their ranks allowing Yanukovich to become prime minis
