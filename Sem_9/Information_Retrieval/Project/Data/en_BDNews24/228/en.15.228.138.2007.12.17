 Boston, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A snowstorm that blanketed parts of the Midwestern United States barreled into New England on Sunday, bringing snow, freezing rain and high winds that grounded flights and made driving treacherous. Roads were slick with snow and ice, and local airports reported hundreds of flights canceled across New England. Upstate New York received as much as a foot (30 cm) of snow, while the storm spared New York City, leaving only a coating of icy slush. Thousands of people were without power in New Jersey, Long Island and parts of Connecticut. In New England, about 8 inches (20 cm) of snow fell around Boston, though the precipitation changed to rain across coastal areas by afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. It dropped more than 10 inches (25 cm) across parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Forecasters said high winds would continue through the evening and parts of northern New England could receive as much as 14 inches of snow. They warned that with sub-freezing temperatures expected overnight, much of the rain that fell on the region late in the day would turn to ice. The wintry blast came a week after a Midwest ice storm was blamed for 13 deaths and cut power to hundreds of thousands. O'Hare International Airport, Chicago's largest, was hit with nearly 200 cancellations on Sunday due to winter weather, after just over 200 stricken flights on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the Chicago airport system said. In New England, the weekend storm did not bring the disruption of Thursday's snowfall, which dumped about 10 inches (25 cm) of snow across the region as millions of commuters were trying to head home. FLIGHT DELAYS AND CANCELLATIONS All three major New York airports remained open, but reported significant flight delays. Hundreds of cancellations left passengers scrambling to find alternate means of reaching their destinations. Boston's Logan International Airport halted all flights briefly to allow officials to plow its runways and airlines canceled about 300 flights, said airport spokeswoman Lisa Langone. By afternoon, the runway was operating two of its three runways, she said. The Boston area typically gets about 7.8 inches (19.8 cm) of snow through the entire month of December. "At this point, fortunately, because there's been such limited travel out there -- folks are listening -- there really haven't been any major accidents of significance," said Peter Judge, state emergency services spokesman. Fans who turned out to see the New England Patriots win their 14th consecutive football game of the season, over the New York Jets faced biting rain and had to clear snow from their seats in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The Patriots' bid to be the first team in 35 years to go unbeaten in the regular season has whipped up fans' frenzy
