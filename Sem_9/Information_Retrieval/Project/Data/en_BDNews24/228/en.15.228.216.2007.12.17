 LONDON, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian and European stocks tumbled on Monday while the dollar hit two-month peaks as last week's strong US inflation data reduced expectations the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates aggressively. In a sign that rising food and agricultural prices may push up inflation globally, US wheat futures surged more than 3 percent and surpassed $10 a bushel for the first time. Inflation concerns generally weigh on equities as they erode corporate profits. They are also nagging the world's central banks as they wrestle with persistent tensions in money markets which are showing only modest signs of easing after policymakers announced a plan last week to inject liquidity, starting Monday. Markets are now pricing in around a 78 percent chance of a January Fed cut in benchmark interest rates to 4 percent, which would follow three easing moves since the credit crisis broke in August. Earlier this month, markets fully priced in a cut. "There were high inflation numbers... there is likely to be more bad housing and consumer sentiment later this week, indicating that the risk of stagflation is rising," said Niels From, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. The developments in money markets are key in a week when investors receive more evidence of how the financial sector is coping with the U.S. subprime mortgage fallout from major U.S. banks' quarterly earnings. "Market are on tenterhooks to see if the global central banks can start to alleviate at least part of the pain (in money markets)," said Jeremy Stretch, strategist at Rabobank. "It's the unwillingness to lend that's the real stickiness here. So it's all very well injecting the money into the system, but if it just gets stuffed under the mattress in the banks, that's not necessarily going to alleviate the problem." The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 1.6 percent, tracking lower Asia, which fell even more deeply by 3.6 percent at one point before trimming losses. U.S. stock futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street later. MSCI main world equity index was down 1.2 percent, dipping below 400 for the first time in three weeks. The bellwether Chicago Board of Trade March wheat contract rose by the 30 cent per bushel trading limit to $10.09-1/2, having shot up nearly 100 percent since January. MIXED SIGNALS Closely-watched interbank lending rates in London showed the premium on one-month funds -- the period the top central banks are mainly targeting in their coordinated moves -- fell for the dollar, euro and sterling. However, in the euro zone, three-month euro rates rose for the first time since the central bank announcement last Wednesday. "(Central bank actions) will ultimately have significant positive implications for financial markets and the economy," Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. "However, these central bank moves won't change the direction of the credit cycle or the real economy; they will only help to avoid worse outcomes. Thus, we still think the U.S. is headed for a mild recession." The dollar had risen to the two-month high against a basket of six major currencies while it rose to a 1-1/2 month high of $1.4332 per euro. Emerging sovereign spreads widened 3 basis points while emerging stocks fell 2.4 percent. The March Bund future was up 15 ticks. US light crude fell half a percent, weighed by a stronger dollar. Gold fell to $788.70 an oun
