<TITLE> Australia urged to take stronger line with China </TITLE>

 Canberra, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a fluent Mandarin speaker, should use his close knowledge of China to take a stronger line with Beijing on human rights, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday. The international watchdog has written to Rudd asking him to raise human rights concerns with China's leadership, including freedom of speech and religion restrictions, media and internet censorship, and forced evictions for next year's Olympics. "As a fluent Mandarin speaker with a longstanding interest in human rights in China, you surely understand the severity of the current situation there," HRW Executive Director Kenneth Roth said his letter to Rudd, a former diplomat to Beijing. Roth said the previous conservative government headed by John Howard had put the booming trade relationship with China, which is Australia's biggest export market, ahead of human rights and Rudd's centre-left Labor government could reverse that. "Under your leadership, we expect Australia to play a major role in raising human rights concerns with China's senior leadership in Beijing," Roth said. Political analysts have predicted Rudd, 50, may play a bridging role between China and other countries as the only Western leader in the world to speak Mandarin. While opposition leader, Rudd demonstrated his skills during an official welcome for Chinese President Hu Jintao in Sydney in September, telling him of family ties to China. Rudd's daughter is married to a Chinese Australian, and his eldest son studied at a university in China. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao this month phoned Rudd to congratulate him on his decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and make climate change a top government priority. But Rudd has promised to be hard-headed on Chinese relations and in April described human rights as of "critical importance", along with a commitment by Beijing to "maintenance of a regional and global rules-based order". HRW said Rudd should also re-think Australia's military links with Indonesia's feared Kopassus special forces under a security pact signed last year, given the unit's notorious history of human rights abuses in East Timor, ruled by Indonesia for decades before voting for independence in in 1999. "The new government is flexing its muscles on the environment and it should do the same on human rights, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where Australia plays a crucial role," said Elaine Pearson, deputy director of HRW's Asia Division
