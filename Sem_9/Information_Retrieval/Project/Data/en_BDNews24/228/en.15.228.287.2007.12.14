 BAGHDAD, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The second meeting of a US- Iranian committee set up to find ways to quell Iraq's violence has been postponed because of a scheduling conflict, US and Iraqi officials said on Friday. US, Iranian and Iraqi officials had been due to meet in Baghdad next Tuesday and are now trying to find a date later this month that suits everyone. "A scheduling conflict has necessitated in moving the talks, which we had anticipated to be next week," said a spokesman for the US embassy in Baghdad, Philip Reeker. Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Labeed Abawi said he expected the Iraqi-hosted talks to take place within the next few days. Washington accuses Iran of arming, funding and training Shi'ite militias in Iraq, a charge Tehran denies. US officials, however, have softened their rhetoric towards Iran in recent weeks, saying Tehran appears to have cut back its supply of explosively formed penetrators, a particularly deadly type of roadside bomb, to the militias.
