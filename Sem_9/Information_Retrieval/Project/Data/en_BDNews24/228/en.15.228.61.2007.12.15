 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Better Business Forum Saturday decided to set up five working committees to coordinate efforts of the public and private sectors to boost business and investment. The decision came from BBBF's first meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, chaired by the forum's chief Fakhruddin Ahmed. The meeting asked Board of Investment executive chairman Kamal Uddin Ahmed, also member secretary of the forum, to send in a list of private sector representatives by Dec 31. Kamal Uddin will confer with business leaders before he draws up the list. The working committees will deal with finance and business, infrastructure, government policy, business operations and skilled workforce development. BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, a member of the forum, told bdnews24.com that business representatives had urged the chief adviser to take fast-track steps to keep the prices of daily essential commodities in check. In an announcement on Nov 26, the government formed the 38-member high-profile public-private forum. "We have to set up more working committees in future if necessary," National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com by phone, after attending the meeting. In a statement, the Press Information Department said finance and commerce adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, executive chairman of the forum, and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed also attended the meeting. bdn
