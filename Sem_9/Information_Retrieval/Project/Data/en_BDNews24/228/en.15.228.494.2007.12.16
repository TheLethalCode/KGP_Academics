 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  Many political parties Sunday boycotted Victory Day celebrations at the Bangabhaban protesting the invitation of Jamaat-e-Islami, which played controversial roles in the 1971 War of Independence. The Awami League, Jatiya Party, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Liberal Democratic Party and their allies did not attend the programme hosted by president Iajuddin Ahmed. Also, the sector commanders of the 1971 war boycotted the state reception. But most leaders of the BNP that formed an alliance with Jamaat during the Khaleda administration joined the programme. At a discussion meeting on Victory Day, Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed said: "We can't join a programme with Jamaat as its leaders are war criminals." Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "It's a state programme. That's why we went there. There was no reason to mix things up." On the demand for trial of 'war criminals', he said: "I definitely want the trial of war criminals." "But we have to find out why the war criminals were not tried and why the Awami League also skipped the issue during its rule," Hafizuddin said. Former president HM Ershad, also chairman of the Jatiya Party, told bdnews24.com: "I should have joined the programme as former president, but I can't go there as Jatiya Party chairman." The former military dictator chorused with other political leaders on their demand for trial of war criminals. "I think they should be tried." Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon told bdnews24.com that his party had urged the government earlier not to invite anti-liberation blocs and war criminals to the presidential Victory Day reception. "The boycott was not a collective decision of allied parties. It was a similar decision by all," he said. Mujahidul Islam Selim, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, said they were interested to attend state programmes such as this. "But the programmes in the past were tarnished by inviting war criminals and anti-liberation elements," he told bdnews24.com by phone. Selim criticised the Awami League and BNP for attending such programmes with anti-liberation elements in the past. bdnew
