 Paris, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A ferry sailing from France to Algeria with 1,400 people on board was turned around after a bomb alert on Saturday and passengers were evacuated on return to Marseille, police said. A police spokesman said the alert was triggered by an anonymous phone call to the Algerian consulate in Lyon warning of a "car packed with explosives". The ferry, the "Tarik", arrived back in the French port of Marseille shortly after 1700 GMT on Saturday accompanied by a fire boat and was met by a fleet of ambulances. Al Qaeda's North African wing claimed responsibility for twin car bombs on Tuesday that killed more than 30 people at UN offices and a court building in Algiers, saying it had targeted "the slaves of America and France". The attacks, the deadliest assault in Algiers in years, followed a string of similar bombings after Islamist rebels in the country adopted the al Qaeda name at the start of the year
