 PARIS, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixty-eight nations met on Monday to offer billions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians and to support renewed peace talks clouded by Israeli plans to expand a Jewish settlement near Jerusalem. French President Nicholas Sarkozy urged the donors to be generous at the one-day conference, the financial sequel to last month's Annapolis meeting that launched the first peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in seven years. The Palestinians are seeking $5.6 billion over three years at the aid meeting. The United States will pledge nearly one tenth of this, or $555 million, and the European Union executive offered $640 million of grant aid. Sarkozy said France would give $300 million. "After years of violence, after years of mistrust, Annapolis revived hope," he said. "Let us be generous. Let us be audacious. Peace depends on it." The money is designed to revive the moribund Palestinian economy, strengthen President Mahmoud Abbas in a power struggle with Hamas Islamists and underpin his peace talks with Israel. Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert agreed at the Nov. 27 Annapolis meeting to begin peace negotiations and to try to reach a deal on a Palestinian state by the end of 2008. Those talks, which formally resumed on Dec. 12, have been complicated by Israel's announcement of plans to build about 300 new homes near Jerusalem. "If we want to launch serious talks to end the conflict as we and the world have decided to do, then how can a key party pursue settlement activity and expansion?" Abbas told the conference. "I expect, in fact, I demand from my neighbours, the Israelis, to give a clear and unequivocal response." Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni did not directly address Abbas's question but she reiterated Israel's desire for peace and its intent to live up to the 2003 U.S.-backed "road map" peace plan that demands it freeze settlement activity. "Despite the difficulties, we are ready to do so and are committed to meet our road map obligations, including in relation to settlement activity," Livni said. SKEPTICISM Many analysts doubt the peace effort will go far because of divisions among the Palestinians and Olmert's weak position. Hamas Islamists, who oppose the fresh peace talks, seized control of the Gaza Strip in June, leaving Abbas and his Fatah faction in control of the West Bank. Olmert has a fragile governing coalition that depends on small political parties that oppose many of the compromises on territory, Jerusalem and security needed for a peace deal. Sarkozy called for a freeze on settlement activity and for Israel to ease checkpoints to help the Palestinian economy. "It (the economy) cannot develop without a radical change in the situation on the ground," he said. The conference gathered representatives of more than 90 countries and organisations, including U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Middle East envoy and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Donor nations have been poring over a reform programme drawn up by the Palestinian Authority. The World Bank said last week such plans would not be enough to revive the economy if Israel did not lift trade and travel restrictions. Israel has so far balked at removing checkpoints scattered across the occupied West Bank, citing security concerns. It has also tightened its military and economic cordon around Ga
