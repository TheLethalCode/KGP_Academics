 LONDON, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City came from behind to beat Bolton Wanderers 4-2 on Saturday to keep their 100 percent home record and go fourth in the Premier League while the big guns enjoyed a day off. The four leading contenders are in action on Sunday, with champions Manchester United playing Liverpool at Anfield before leaders Arsenal host third-placed Chelsea. Arsenal have 37 points from 16 games to United's 36, with Chelsea on 34 and City on 33. Portsmouth could have gone fourth but fell to seventh after losing 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur at Fratton Park. They remain on 30 points, behind Liverpool and Everton -- who won 2-0 at West Ham United -- on goal difference. "We got well beaten today," said Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp of his side's first home league defeat of the season and Tottenham's first away win. "I thought Tottenham were the better team today, we just never got started," Redknapp told Sky Sports television. City, the only club in the top flight to have won all nine of their home league games this season, went ahead through Rolando Bianchi's seventh minute tap-in. El Hadji Diouf equalised with a left-footed shot in the 31st and Kevin Nolan made it 2-1 to Bolton five minutes before halftime. A Lubomir Michalik own-goal put Sven-Goran Eriksson's side back into the game three minutes after the break and Darius Vassell slotted in a third in the 77th before Kelvin Etuhu grabbed the fourth in stoppage time. "I think we deserved to win," said Eriksson. "We spoke a little bit at halftime and credit to the players, they came out and were different in the second half and showed they really wanted to win." ROLLER-COASTER MATCH Struggling Wigan Athletic were the day's top scorers, beating 10-man Blackburn Rovers 5-3 at the JJB Stadium after squandering an early 3-0 lead. A hat-trick by Roque Santa Cruz pulled Blackburn level but their victory chances took a knock when Brett Emerton was sent off in the 57th minute. Wigan, who had England striker Emile Heskey carried off injured after 38 minutes, went back in front when Marcus Bent grabbed his second goal of the game in the 66th before claiming his own hat-trick in the 81st. "We've got three points, we're back in the mix again. It was a big, important win," said new manager Steve Bruce. Yakubu Aiyegbeni hit his eighth goal in seven matches and Andy Johnson also struck to help Everton defeat West Ham for the second time in three days after their midweek League Cup victory. Sunderland moved out of the relegation zone, overtaking Fulham who lost 1-0 to Newcastle United, after a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa at the Stadium of Light but manager Roy Keane was furious with referee Steve Bennett for disallowing Danny Collins's injury-time header. "It was such a bad call," said Keane. "He was waiting all day to give a few decisions against us and he got his big one completely wrong." Derby County's misery at the bottom of the table continued with a 1-0 defeat at home to Middlesbrough while Birmingham City drew 1-1 with Reading
