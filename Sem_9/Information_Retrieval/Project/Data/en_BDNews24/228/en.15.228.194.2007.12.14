<TEXT>
 Dhaka Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  A draft coal policy has been finalised without resolving the royalty issue. The issue has been left to a high-powered committee styled Coal Sector Development Committee that would fix royalty after review over time. The draft does not suggest export of the fossil fuel but recommends sale of coke if unused in the country from the produced coal. It also recommends controlled foreign investment, experimental open-pit mining and formation of "Coal Bangladesh", a government holding company, for the extraction. The expert committee met Friday at the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources Corporation office at Karwan Bazar. Committee president Prof Abdul Matin Patwari chaired the meeting. Prof Patwari later told journalists that the draft policy upheld national interests. Foreign investors would be allowed as supporting companies under government control, he added. On experimental open-pit coal extraction, he said the issue would be taken care of on the basis of the opinions of the local people and the civil society. On the draft policy not addressing the question of royalty, he said in the past royalty had been fixed at different rates at different times. This needed to be evaluated as per the need of the time. A standing committee would be there with the main committee in the coal sector to fix the royalty, he added. Prof Patwari said that coal was limited. "We have stopped export. There is no scope for export now. It will be acceptable to all. A target has been proposed for coal extraction and power production for three years. He said that the draft of the coal policy would be submitted whenever the government wanted. bdnews24
