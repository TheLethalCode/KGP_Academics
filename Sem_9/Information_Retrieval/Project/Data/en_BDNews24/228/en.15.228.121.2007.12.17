 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)The nation marked its 36th Victory Day anniversary Sunday, with people celebrating Bangladesh's freedom and honouring the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the 1971 War of Independence. Tens of thousands of people congregated at the National Memorial in Savar to pay their homage to the martyrs amid tight security. A 7,000-strong security arrangement was put in place in the capital and at the Savar monument. The day came amid renewed calls by socio-political platforms for trying the war criminals who opposed the independence struggle and took part in the brutal genocide during the bloody nine-month Liberation War of 1971. The families of seven war heroes with the highest gallantry award demanded trial of 'war criminals' in fresh calls on Victory Day, joining voice with sociopolitical forums that are mounting pressure on the caretaker government to put 'war criminals' on trial. Freedom fighters, including sector commanders in the war, at a Victory Day gathering in the city Sunday asked the government to hold special war crime tribunals. They said the previous governments had reneged on their promises to try 'war criminals' for political and personal interests. Frequent calls for war crimespast and presenthave been ignored. The campaigners point to Jamaat-e-Islami for its controversial role during the war. Both the opposing factions of the BNPwho had joined hands with Jamaat to form an election alliance that rode to power in 2001made calls Sunday for 1971 'war criminals' to be tried. They were divided, however, over whether the caretaker administration or an elected government should do the job. "The war criminals should be tried. This is the duty of the government, but not the caretaker government," said Nazrul Islam Khan, a leader in the Khandaker Delwar Hossain-faction of the BNP. However, Hafizuddin Ahmed, the secretary general posted by the BNP standing committee, said: "I want the war criminals to be tried. The incumbent government will have to do the job." Former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan also called on the caretaker government to put the 'war criminals' on trial. These statements constituted the first demand of the BNP for such trials since the Liberation War 36 years ago. The Awami League that was in power prior to the BNP-led coalition's second-term, avoided the thorny issue during Sheikh Hasina's term as prime minister. AL presidium member Abdul Razzak had Friday said it was a "wrong" decision not to have tried 'war criminals' immediately after the War of Independence. The same day acting AL president Zillur Rahman said his party would try the 'war criminals' if it came back to power in future. At the National Memorial Sunday morning, the mother of war hero Bir Shreshtha Munshi Abdur Rauf said: "We want nothing else. We only want the collaborators and war criminals to be tried. This is the only demand to the state." "I have gained millions of sons though I lost mine. I have gained a country, which is the greatest achievement," said Mokidunnesa. Mili Rahman, wife of Bir Shreshtha Matiur Rahman, also speaking at the Savar monument, said: "My husband sacrificed his life for the country. I am proud of him. We want the trial of those who had slaughtered people during the liberation war." On her expectations on Victory Day she said: "I want the implementation of the spirit of the liberation war." The day's events began at the Savar National Memorial with a 31-gun salute at dawn. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, after laying wreaths, gave separate statements to the nation asking people to stand united for a better Bangladesh. Freedom fighters and the families of the Bir Shreshthas placed flowers at the monument, and at 7:10am, the memorial opened to the long queues of people waiting since early morning. Jahangirnagar University and Savar upazila delegates paid respects, followed by AL and BNP leaders. Next came the Jatiya Party, the Communist Party of Bangladesh and the Workers Party. Dhaka University, various cultural and social organisations also paid their homage to the martyrs. The red-and-green flag flew atop government and private buildings in Dhaka and elsewhere during the public holiday. On Dec 16, 1971, lieutenant general AAK Niazi, commander of the Pakistani occupation forces, officially surrendered to the joint Muktibahini and Indian forces led by lieutenant general Jagjit Singh Aurora at the Suhrawardy Uddyan in Dhaka. bdnews24.com/
