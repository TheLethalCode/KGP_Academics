 BEIJING, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Main roads and highways now reach more than 90 percent of China's 1.3 billion people and have brought enormous economic benefits well worth the estimated 900 billion yuan ($122 billion) cost, officials said on Tuesday. By 2010, every village in China's remote and poor west, home to restless minority groups, would be reachable on a sealed road, said Dong Xuebo, head of the Communications Ministry's general planning departments. These routes -- which stretch from the Russian and Mongolian borders down to Tibet and the fringes of Southeast Asia -- were also important for national defence, unity and stability, even if some, such as in the west of the country, were only sparsely used, he added. "The main strategic reason for building trunk roads in the west is for socio-economic development, despite the few people," he told a news conference. "Building roads in the west gives far more economic benefit than those in the east, according to the latest World Bank report. "But they are also extremely strategically important, and guarantee national unity, stability and security," Dong said. "It's not simply about satisfying traffic demands." China has embarked upon a breakneck programme of road building since it started opening to the outside world three decades ago and embarking on reforms which have made it the world's fourth largest economy and an export powerhouse. It took a decade to build China's first 10,000 km (6,215 miles) of highways, and it now has 53,000 km, the second highest level in the world, said Dai Dongchang, the ministry's road department director. "Many countries and international organisations have seen this success with a mixture of envy and admiration," he said. Efforts are currently being concentrated on 800 kms of roads being built in difficult environments in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, added Weng Mengyong, Vice Minister of Communications. The government would look at ways of reducing and "perfecting" the toll system many highways operate, Meng said, which dissuades many Chinese against using the new road network. ($1=7.378 Yu
