 ALGIERS, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, inspecting the rubble of UN offices hit by a car bombing in Algiers last week, said on Tuesday he was "very shocked" by an attack that killed 17 UN staff. "Terrorism is never justified," Ban, on a one-day visit, said of the Dec. 11 bombings claimed by al Qaeda's north Africa wing. "It must be condemned in the name of humanity and the international community. I was very shocked," he said of the attack, one of twin attacks the same day which killed at least 37 people in Algiers. The attacks were the second big bombing this year in the capital of the OPEC member country, seeking to rebuild after an undeclared civil in the 1990s war which killed up to 200,000. "I would like to express my sincere condolences to the government and people of Algeria and the families of the victims and to UN colleagues." Witnesses said Ban was driven in a heavily guarded convoy of vehicles to the city's Hydra district where he inspected crumpled blocks of masonry at the site of the ruined offices of the UN's refugee agency and the UN Development Programme. Reporters were not permitted to accompany Ban to the site. The second suicide car bombing on Dec. 11 damaged the Constitutional Court building in Ben Aknoun district. Al Qaeda's North African wing claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings, saying it had targeted what it called "the slaves of America and France". Ban also met President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, saying Algeria and the world body had decided to work together closely to fight terrorism. Ban said the two men also discussed climate change, illegal migration and the question of Western Sahara. The United Nations has identified the dead UN employees as 14 Algerians and one victim each from Denmark, Senegal and the Philippines. Ban said at the time that the bombs were "a despicable strike against individuals serving humanity's highest ideals under the UN banner" and "an attack on all of us". UN Development Programme Administrator Kemal Dervis said during a visit to Algiers last week that the United Nations was boosting security at its offices around the world after Tuesday's attacks, but he said this would need more funding.
