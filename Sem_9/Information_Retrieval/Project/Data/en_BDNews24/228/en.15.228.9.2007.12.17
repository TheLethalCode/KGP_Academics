 BERNE, Switzerland, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan and Brazil playmaker Kaka is expected to add individual honours to his latest club achievement when he flies directly from the Club World Cup to FIFA's World Player of the Year gala. Kaka inspired Milan to a 4-2 win over South America's top side Boca Juniors in Japan on Sunday, helping Milan earn the right to call themselves the best club side on the planet. The 25-year-old Brazilian is now widely tipped to be confirmed as the world's top player when FIFA unveils the results of its annual poll of national team coaches and captains at a ceremony in Zurich's opera house. Kaka faces competition from Manchester United's Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona's Argentine striker Lionel Messi, but is a clear favourite after already picking up a clutch of top awards this year. Earlier this month he was named winner of France Football magazine's prestigious Ballon d'Or award and was selected as World Player of the Year by British magazine World Soccer. Kaka helped AC Milan win last season's Champions League final and looks set to become the first player to win both the Champions League and the FIFA World Player award in the same calendar year
