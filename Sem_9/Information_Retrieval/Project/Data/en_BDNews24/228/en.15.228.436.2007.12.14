<TITLE> Sceptic on Turkey to chair EU "wise people" group </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union leaders on Friday named former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a past critic of Turkey's EU membership bid, to head a "reflection group" to study the long-term future of the 27-nation bloc. The panel was the brainchild of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, a vehement opponent of Turkish accession, who called in August for the EU to create a group of "wise people" to consider Europe's final borders. The mandate has since been changed to look at the future of the region in 2020-2030, focusing mostly on the economic challenges of globalisation. Sarkozy said on Friday the group would study the issue of EU borders, not specifically Turkey. But Sarkozy appeared to have scored a point by stealth with the choice of Gonzalez, a socialist who governed Spain from 1982 to 1996. Spanish newspapers quoted the ex-premier in May 2004 as telling a Universal Forum of Cultures in Barcelona there were limits to the enlargement of Europe, which should "stop at the borders of Turkey" because of social and cultural differences. Asked about those comments, Gonzalez's spokesman Joaquin Tagar told Reuters in Madrid on Friday: "He was just expressing a theoretical opinion, not taking a definite position on the matter. He was just pointing out the difference between European and Turkish culture." Pressed to say what Gonzalez's position on Turkey's candidacy was now, he said: "What he has been saying in recent times is that if the European Union has a commitment to Turkey, it should honour it." WHERE DOES EUROPE END? The reflection group, which will number no more than nine people, is mandated to look at "the stability and prosperity of the Union and of the wider region," touching on the sensitive issue of EU enlargement. The formulation deliberately left open whether Turkey would be part of the Union or the wider region in 2020-2030. "We cannot talk about the European project without raising the question of its territory," a French diplomat said. The panel will also look at issues such as energy, climate change and justice matters. It is due to report its findings to EU leaders in June 2010. Former Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga and Jorma Ollila, the chairman of mobile phone giant Nokia , were named as the two vice-chairs of the panel. Some politicians were critical of the choice of a leader from the 1980s to study the EU's future. "If you ever wanted to see Jurassic Park in reality, then this appointment (of Gonzalez) is just that," said Graham Watson, leader of the Liberal Democrat political group in the European Parliament. "It's not about age, but all three of the panel so far represent old Europe." But Spain voiced delight at the choice of Gonzalez, who has been canvassed for top European jobs but never received one. "It's a very happy day for the Spanish people, for Spain, and for Europe," Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos told reporters.
