<TITLE> Zuma, controversial but popular </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacob Zuma is a charismatic but controversial figure who has dodged one South African political minefield after another to become a frontrunner in the race to lead the ruling African National Congress party. If chosen as new ANC leader this month, Zuma is almost certain to become the country's next president in 2009. An arms corruption case has come back to haunt Zuma in the final stretch of the bruising contest, and he could once again be charged for bribery and fraud. But the earthy and approachable politician, the ANC's deputy president, has time and again proved resilient in the spotlight. Many were stunned when Zuma admitted during a rape trial that he had unprotected sex with his HIV-positive accuser and said he took a shower afterward to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. He was acquitted. Zuma has successfully portrayed himself as a man of the people, enjoying wide support from powerful unions and the ANC rank-and-file, who see him as a leader who can help millions of poor South Africans still living in grim townships. Along with Nelson Mandela, Zuma was imprisoned on Robben Island for conspiring to overthrow white rule, spending 10 years in jail before going into exile in neighbouring states. A former member of ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe military wing, Zuma rose to become head of intelligence, a post that gave him leverage with allies and opponents alike. Hailing from KwaZulu-Natal province, Zuma has earned respect as a peacemaker at home, mediating between the ANC and the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party in the early 1990s to head off a possible civil war. As an ethnic Zulu, his position in the ANC strikes a tribal balance in an organisation perceived to be dominated by leaders from the Xhosa tribe of Mandela and President Thabo Mbeki. The 65-year-old often follows traditional ways, shedding his suit for Zulu regalia -- a shield and cow hide -- when he retreats to his rural village. His association with left-leaning and increasingly vocal trade unions have raised concerns in the business community. But Zuma has been busy meeting investors in a new charm offensive designed to reassure them that he will not steer away from policies that have delivered an economic boom
