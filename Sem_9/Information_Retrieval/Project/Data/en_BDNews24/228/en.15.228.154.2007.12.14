<TITLE> Polish veto on EU-Russia talks may stay until poll </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland and Lithuania are likely to keep a veto on the launch of new partnership talks between the European Union and Moscow until Russia's presidential election in March, a senior diplomatic source said on Friday. Poland's previous right-wing government blocked the launch of negotiations for a new pact that would cover areas such as energy, human rights and trade after Moscow slapped a ban on imports of Polish meat and other foods two years ago. Lithuania, sandwiched between Poland and Russia, joined the opposition after Russia cut off oil supplies to a major Lithuanian oil refinery. "Both countries have agreed to wait and see what happens after the elections in Russia," the senior diplomat familiar with talks between Warsaw and Vilnius told Reuters at an EU summit in Brussels. Asked whether Vilnius would maintain its veto if Warsaw lifted its objection, Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus told Reuters: "If Poland decides it is the best for them (to lift the veto), that they can live with this, we will be supportive." He gave no further details. Russia promised this week to lift a ban on imports of meat from Poland, raising hopes for an end to the row that has soured relations with the European Union. Poland's new, centre-right Prime Minister Donald Tusk has vowed to mend ties with Russia since taking over the government last month following parliamentary polls in which his party beat the grouping of his Euro-sceptic predecessor Jaroslaw Kaczynski. But Polish diplomats say Russia should also lift its ban on other Polish imports, such as some vegetables, before Warsaw's opposition is lifted. Lithuania also wants to press Russia to reopen the stretch of the Druzhba pipeline that had brought oil to Lithuania, although diplomats say Moscow is unlikely to relent. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft blamed a leak for the shutdown of the pipeline in 2006. Lithuania has said the closure was politically motivated by the sale of its Mazeikiu refinery to Poland's PKN Orlen rather than to a Russian bidder. "Oil delivery is not only a Lithuanian, but a Polish issue as well," a Lithuanian diplomat told Reuters, explaining why his country counted on Polish support in relations with Russia. Russia has banned Polish foods imports, citing poor quality controls, but Poland called the move politically motivated. Russia vehemently opposes the proposed construction of a U.S. missile defence shield on Polish soil, while Poland has objected to plans by Russia and Germany to lay a gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
