 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi, Sylhet and Dhaka Friday made decent starts against Chittagong, Khulna and Barisal on the first day of the eight-round four-dayer of the National Cricket League. Pacers M Shahazada (4/36) and Saiful Islam (3/70) shared seven wickets as Rajshahi restricted visitors Chittagong to 198 all out at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Rajshahi were also in tatters at 24 for two at the close of Day 1. Golam Mabud and Golam Rahman each smashed half-centuries as Sylhet ended up the first day with 228 for six at stumps against joint league leaders Khulna at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. Hosts Dhaka were 215 for six at stumps against Barisal at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Rajshahi vs Chittagong After being asked to bat first, Chittagong tottered at 29 for four with top four batsmen of Gazi Salahuddin (0), Masumuddoula (10), Mahbubul Karim (13) and Nazimuddin (13) returning to the dressing room. However, Dhiman Gosh and skipper Ehsanul Haq denied further damage to take their side to 145 for five before being separated. Dhiman struck a fine 50 while Ehsan contributed 66. After the departure of both Dhiman and Ehsanul, soon Chittagong collapsed to a paltry 198 in the first innings. Chittagong's new ball pair of Tareq Aziz (1/14) and Kamrul Islam (1/9) also struck early to reduce Rajshahi to 24 for two with Farhad Hossain (2) and Shakil (3) resuming the second day Saturday. Khulna vs Sylhet After choosing to bat first, Sylhet fell in trouble as openers Imtiaz Hossain (15), Kuntal (19) and skipper Rajin Saleh (2) walked off cheaply, leaving the side in danger. But, middle orders Alok Kapali (36) and Golam Mabud (53) and Golam Rahman (78 not out) rescued their side despite some tight bowling from Khulna's Aslam Khan (2/47), Robiul Islam (2/51) and Murad Khan (2/54). Dhaka vs Barisal After being invited to bat first, Dhaka openers Al Shahriar (19) and Uttam Kumar (19) gave a fine start before middle order Mehrab Hossain Opee and Nadif Chowdhury contributed 33 and 39 respectively. Mosharraf Hossain Rubel (35) and Mohammad Sharif (30) will look at a big total when they resume the second day Saturday.
