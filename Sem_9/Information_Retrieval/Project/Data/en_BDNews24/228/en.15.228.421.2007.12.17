 Bishkek, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's political party won all of the seats in parliament, preliminary results showed on Monday, after a weekend election the opposition has condemned as fraudulent. The result, if confirmed by final figures, would allow Bakiyev's party to dominate the chamber in effective one party rule -- a break from the country's role as a liberal state among more authoritarian Central Asian countries. Bakiyev's Ak Zhol party won 48 percent of Sunday's vote, the Central Election Commission said, citing results after 80 percent of votes had been counted, and only one other grouping cleared the 5 percent hurdle to make it into parliament. But the opposition Ata Meken party, which took 9.3 percent of the votes throughout the nation, had so far failed to meet a separate requirement of gaining 0.5 percent of that same figure in each of Kyrgyzstan's seven regions and two main cities. Final results were due later in the day. The election has drawn complaints of widespread fraud from the opposition which says it had registered cases of voter intimidation, forced voting and ballot stuffing. The former Soviet state of 5 million people, home to both US and Russian military bases, has been volatile since Bakiyev took power in 2005 when a disputed election sparked protests that ousted veteran leader Askar Akayev. Bakiyev has been accused at home of backtracking on his pre-election promises to bring more democracy and stability. Both opposition parties believe he abused power in favour of his Ak Zhol party in the run up to the election. "From the very beginning the election campaign has been marked by major violations," said Omurbek Tekebayev, head of the opposition Ata Meken party. But, despite accusations of irregularities, many voters said they voted for Ak Zhol, seeing it as a guarantor for stability following years of political turbulence and street protests. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) election monitoring group's verdict -- an internationally accepted yardstick on the fairness of elections -- is due later on Monday
