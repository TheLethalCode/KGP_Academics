 WASHINGTON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - North Korea told the United States that it would live up to its obligations under a deal to abandon its nuclear arms programs and expected Washington to keep its end of the bargain, a US official said on Friday. The official, who spoke to reporters on condition that he not be named, paraphrased the North Korean response to a letter from US President George W. Bush as: "we'll live up to our side and hope you'll live up to your side." Separately, Bush publicly exhorted Pyongyang to keep its promise to provide a full accounting of its nuclear programs by the end of the year. "I got his attention with a letter and he can get my attention by fully disclosing his program including any plutonium he may have processed," Bush told reporters, referring to a letter he sent North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on Dec. 5 making the same point. "As well he can get our attention by fully disclosing his proliferation activities." North Korea, which conducted a nuclear test in 2006, has agreed to provide a "complete and correct" declaration of its nuclear programs by the end of the year, although there is considerable uncertainty among analysts and diplomats whether it will meet the deadline. If Pyongyang gives a full accounting, the Bush administration is expected to drop it from the US state sponsors of terrorism list, which imposes economic and other sanctions on the secretive, communist state.
