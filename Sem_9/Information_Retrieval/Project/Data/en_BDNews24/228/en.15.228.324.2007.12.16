<TITLE> Bolivian regions shun Morales with autonomy drive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 La Paz, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Bolivians marched for and against President Evo Morales on Saturday in dueling rallies, exposing the deep divisions that threaten to bring fresh political turmoil to South America's poorest country. As four opposition-led regions unveiled plans for greater independence from the central government, thousands of Morales supporters banging drums paraded through La Paz to celebrate a new constitution that has polarized the country. "This is a historic day ... the people will never again be marginalized," Morales told crowds outside the presidential palace after the president of the constitutional assembly submitted a copy of the new charter. Morales accused his foes of seeking to split the nation. "We're not going to let anyone divide Bolivia," he said. Led by the economic hub of Santa Cruz, the four provinces oppose the new constitution and made separate declarations of autonomy to extend the power of their regional governments. In Santa Cruz, hunger strikers called off their days-old protest against the constitution and headed to a city park for a mass rally to celebrate the declaration of autonomy -- a move the government branded as illegal and unconstitutional. A similar event was staged in natural gas-rich Tarija, and others were planned in the Amazon provinces of Beni and Pando. "We're going to celebrate the birth of the autonomous regions," said Roberto Gutierrez, a pro-autonomy leader in Santa Cruz. The constitutional reform has deepened long-standing divisions between the more affluent east and the highlands, where the indigenous population strongly supports Morales, the country's first leader of Indian descent. Leaders of the four lowland regions, home to Bolivia's natural gas fields, have called the new constitution an illegal power grab since it was passed by Morales supporters during an opposition boycott. "In no way do we accept that the text that's being submitted represents the Bolivian people, because not all Bolivians have taken part in its drafting," said opposition deputy Lourdes Millares. Tensions rose ahead of Saturday's declarations of autonomy. Morales, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, has ruled out declaring martial law but government officials have said he could use force if any attempt is made to divide the country. It was unclear whether the autonomy declarations would be ratified in provincial referendums. The new national constitution, which lets presidents seek two consecutive terms and increases the state's role in the economy, must still pass two referendums to take force. Morales says the constitutional rewrite will empower the poor, Indian majority after five centuries of domination by a European-descended elite
