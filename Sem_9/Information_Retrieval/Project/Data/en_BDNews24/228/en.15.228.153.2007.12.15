<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday demanded trial of 'war criminals'. "The government must move to try the war criminals. An individual cannot do it," he said at a discussion meeting on the eve of Victory Day at Elegance Community Centre in Gulshan. Bhuiyan's remark makes the first public demand for the trial of 'war criminals' from the BNP, which was allied with Jamaat-e-Islami during the Khaleda administration. Jamaat is blamed for its controversial roles in the 1971 War of Independence. "The war criminals killed many intellectuals. Nobody took action against them even after there were strong allegations against them." The 'war criminals' have so far been exempted from punishment, Bhuiyan said. "The government must take the responsibility of trying them in line with people's demand." "We have noticed that the role of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman is being downgraded these days. I hope those who deserve recognition must be recognised." The acting BNP secretary general, retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed, condemned the killings of intellectuals by the 'war criminals'. bd
