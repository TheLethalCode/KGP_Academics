 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)The European Commission has granted 1.5 million euros (Tk 15 crore) for rehabilitation of 10,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, the EC said in a Web posting. The refugees do not receive help from the Bangladesh government or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as they are not registered by the UN agency as refugees. The registered refugees get accommodation, food and health facilities from the UNHCR. "The assistance will focus on the relocation of refugees to a suitable place and the provision of humanitarian aid including shelter, water, health, and nutrition," the EC said in a statement on its website. "In the region of Teknaf, around 10,000 undocumented Rohingya refugees need to be relocated in order to empty overcrowded camps where living conditions are appalling." The UNHCR did not register the 10,000 people who came to Bangladesh in phases from across the border fearing government repression back home. The Rohingya refugees, the Muslim minority from the Myanmar's state of northern Rakhain, came to Bangladesh in 1992 as the military junta started repression on them. In line with an agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, more than 1.5 lakh documented refugees went back to their homeland. More than 30,000 documented refugees, refusing to go back to Myanmar, are living in Bangladesh under the care and supervision of the UNHCR. bdn
