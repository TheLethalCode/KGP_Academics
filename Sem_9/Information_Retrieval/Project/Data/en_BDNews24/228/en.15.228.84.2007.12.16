 Basra, Iraq, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain will transfer responsibility for security in Basra province to Iraqi forces on Sunday, effectively marking the end of nearly five years of British control of the southern part of Iraq. The handover of Iraq's main oil export hub -- the last of four provinces controlled by Britain since 2003 -- will be the biggest test yet of the Baghdad government's ability to maintain security without troops from the United States or its main ally. With Iraq's second-largest city, only major port and nearly all its oil exports, Basra is far more populous, wealthier and more strategically located than any of the other eight of Iraq's 18 provinces previously placed under formal Iraqi control. It has also often been more violent, although Iraqi forces say their 30,000 troops and police in the area can keep peace. "(This) marks an important milestone in Iraqis taking responsibility for their own destiny," Lieutenant-General Bill Rollo, the top British general in Iraq, told Reuters in Baghdad. Many Basrawis expressed optimism. "Today we are happy security will be handed over from the occupying British forces to Iraqi forces. You can see this happiness on the faces of everyone. It feels like a heavy burden his been lifted off our chests," said teacher Adel Jassem. The mainly Shia southern province has largely escaped the sectarian warfare that has killed tens of thousands of people in central and northern Iraq. But Basra has been the scene of bloody turf wars between rival Shia factions, criminals and smugglers. Basra's police accuse militants of imposing strict Islamic codes, killing women for so-called "honour crimes". Yet Iraq's second-largest city is also a lively place, with restaurants open late and little of the barricaded neighbourhood siege mentality that permeates the capital Baghdad. The factions agreed to a truce this month and killings are down. But a triple car bomb attack which killed about 40 people in neighbouring Maysan province last week served as a reminder of the potential for violence in areas vacated by the British. SCALED DOWN A scaled-down British force will remain in southern Iraq confined to a single base at Basra's airport, with a small training mission and a rapid reaction team on stand-by. Britain now has 4,500 troops in Iraq, less than a 10th of the force that then-prime minister Tony Blair dispatched to help topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. Blair's successor Gordon Brown has said the force will shrink to just 2,500 by mid-2008. Basra province exports more than 1.5 million barrels of oil per day, providing nearly all Iraq's government funds. Some oil is also sold outside official channels by smugglers, many believed to have links to the region's squabbling militias. Power is split among three main factions. Loyalists of cleric Moqtada al-Sadr have wide influence on the streets, the rival Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council has clout in the security forces and the smaller Fadhila party controls the governorate. British forces began handing over the southern provinces last year, but suffered ever-deadlier attacks as they withdrew. Of the 134 British service members killed by enemy action in Iraq, more than 30 died in a four-month period from April-July this year after Blair announced plans to withdraw from Basra. In May, generals had to call off plans to dispatch Prince Harry, a tank officer, to serve in Iraq because it became too unsafe to send the man third in line to the throne. Attacks on the British largely stopped in September after 500 British troops withdrew from a palace in the centre of Basra and relocated to the airport outside the city
