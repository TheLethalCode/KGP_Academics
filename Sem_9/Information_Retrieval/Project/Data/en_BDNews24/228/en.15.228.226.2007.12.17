 BEIRUT, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rival Lebanese leaders tried to salvage a parliamentary session on Monday The pro- and anti- Syrian groups agreed in principle early this month to elect General Michel Suleiman as a replacement to Emile Lahoud, whose term expired on Nov. 23. which is due to elect the army chief as president, a move that could defuse Lebanon's worst political crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. But differences over the make up of a new government and means to amend the constitution, which prevents a senior public servant from running for office, have led to successive delays. Political sources said the opposing camps might have found a loophole that would avoid the need to amend the constitution, but it was unclear if other obstacles had been cleared to ensure that the vote, already delayed eight times, could go ahead. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is also an opposition leader, was holding talks in the chamber with MPs from both sides, following previous contacts through intermediaries. Several lawmakers who went to the parliament building in central Beirut were optimistic a vote could occur on Monday. "What happened in terms of deliberations, international support and a Lebanese wish could lead to this result today. God willing, we will have an election today," MP Robert Ghanem, a one-time presidential hopeful, said in parliament. But Hezbollah MP Hussein Haj Hassan sounded a more cautious note. "If there is no political consensus ... then definitely there will be no quorum for today's session," he said. Electing Suleiman as president would take the heat out of a 13-month-old political crisis that has paralysed state institutions and led to fears of civil strife. Tensions have also worsened after the assassination last week of Brigadier General Francois al-Hajj, who was tipped to become the next army commander after Suleiman becomes president. "FOREIGN INTERFERENCE" The Western-backed ruling coalition and the Hezbollah-led opposition have to reach a deal to secure a two-thirds quorum for a vote at the parliament in downtown Beirut, guarded by troops backed by armoured vehicles and police with sniffer dogs. The opposition is determined to prevent the ruling coalition, which has a slim parliamentary majority, from electing one of its own candidates. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday outside powers, particularly Syria, should not meddle in the presidential election. "It (vote) needs to take place without intimidation. It needs to take place without foreign interference," she told reporters en route to Paris for a Palestinian donors conference. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, whose country has been leading efforts to resolve the crisis, said on Sunday he doubted Suleiman would be voted in as president on Monday. Suleiman, 59, was appointed army chief in 1998 when Syria still dominated Lebanon. He is on good terms with Hezbollah, a powerful military-political group backed by Syria and Ir
