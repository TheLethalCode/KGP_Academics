<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism will ask for Tk 200 crore in the next budget to improve the tourism sector as part of a regional initiative in South Asia, an adviser said Monday. Tourism adviser MA Matin said he hoped the finance ministry would allocate Tk 100 crore to his ministry for the current fiscal year. Speaking to reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat, he said the plan is part of a coordinated project taken by the South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation for the development of tourism in the region. Bangladesh lacks adequate facilities in attracting tourists despite its vast diversity in the nature and lifestyle. The country has the world's longest sea beach, the world's largest mangrove forest and a hilly region. Tourism sector insiders say Bangladesh can earn a huge amount of foreign currencies from the sector like India and Nepal. International tourists, who travel to neighbouring India and Nepal, could easily make a brief stopover in Bangladesh if they get enough confidence to visit the delta nation, they say. Matin said Monday's meeting also discussed a number of development activities in various tourist spots and an airport in Mongla. The government would make a decision on the airport soon, he said without providing further details. The tourism ministry will look into how it could develop the tourism-related infrastructure, he said. The meeting also proposed to ensure easy visas to the people of the region, he said. "Despite a huge potential of the sector we can't provide tourists with sufficient facilities," Matin said. "The infrastructure of air travel in the country is very poor. The road and railway infrastructure has the same fate. There is no sports facility for tourists in Cox's Bazar. But such facilities are important to help flourish the sector," he said. He expressed dissatisfaction over the high charges of hotels in the country. "The charges of hotels are as high as in developed countries. Why would the tourists stay there?," he said. Matin said private sector entrepreneurs could take the lead since the government is not capable of managing all arrangements alone. bdnew
