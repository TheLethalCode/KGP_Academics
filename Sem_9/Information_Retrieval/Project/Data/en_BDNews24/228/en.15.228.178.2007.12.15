 HANOI, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 18 workers were feared killed in a landslide on Saturday at a stone mine near the construction site of a hydro power plant in central Vietnam, state media reported. The landslide happened at about 0300 GMT in Tuong Duong district, Nghe An province, burying the workers, their trucks and drilling equipment under rock and clay, the e-newspaper Dan Tri (www.dantri.com.vn) reported. Officials said explosives were used at the mine on Friday to help remove the stones from the mountain. The stones are used for the construction of the Ban Ve power plant project. Rescue workers said it could take weeks to remove the rocks to get to the bodies, state media reported. Vietnam state television said no bodies had been found so far.
