 HERAT, Afghanistan, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A German man has gone missing in northwest Afghanistan and may have been kidnapped, the local police chief said on Monday. Taliban insurgents have kidnapped dozens of foreigners in Afghanistan this year, but criminal bands have also abducted a number of Afghans and foreigners in an attempt to gain ransom. The provincial police chief of Herat province said the man, named Adbulrahman, a German convert to Islam married to an Afghan woman, was missing, but he was unable to say whether he had been kidnapped. "I cannot confirm he has been abducted, he might have had some family problems," he told Reuters. But a member of the Herat provincial council said the man had been kidnapped. "A German man named Adbulrahman who has been working in a clinic in the Golran district of Herat province was abducted yesterday by an unknown group," said council member Humayoun Azimi. Golran district is in the far northwest of Afghanistan, close to the borders with Iran and Turkmenistan. Germany said it was investigating suggestions that a German national has been kidnapped in Afghanistan, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said on Monday.

Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported "armed forces" had seized a 42-year-old German man, Harald Kleber, with his wife and child in Herat province. The paper did not say what its sources were. Both the Sueddeutsche and public television channel ZDF said the man in question, a carpenter, had worked for German aid agency Gruenhelme (Green Helmets) and had lived in Afghanistan for some time. Taliban insurgents seized two Germans southwest of Kabul in July, killing one of them and setting the other free after nearly three months. The insurgents shot dead two of 23 South Koreans they kidnapped around the same time, but freed the rest after a ransom was paid about a month later.
