 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Pacer Shubasis Roy on Monday took five wickets to help Bangladesh Under-19 team clinch the five one-day series against Sri Lanka with the final match to expire. Sri Lanka conceded a 49-run defeat in the fourth match, as the visitors folded to 118 in 36.5 overs at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Bangladesh earlier could manage a paltry total of 167 all out in 48 overs. With the latest win the hosts secured the series at 3-1. Despite a decent start, Sri Lanka collapsed in the face of fierce spell by Roy, who ripped through the top and middle orders by taking five wickets for 24 in 10 overs. Opener Dilshan scored the highest 40 while Lokuge collected 26 runs and Nanith Perera 17. Nasir Hossain, Suhrawardi Shuvo, Dollar Mahmud took one wicket each. Bangladesh earlier chose to bat first but quickly faced troubles as the team scored only nine for two before the third wicket stand of Mahmudul Hasan (41) and Nasir Hossain (46) pushed the side to 103. Bangladesh slipped to 115 for seven as Kavikara (3/22) and Rajapaksha (2/27) halted the brief momentum sending back both Mahmudul and Nasir to the dressing room. However, Marshal Ayub remained unbeaten on 42 to help the homeside score 167 all out. The fifth match takes place on Wednesday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. b
