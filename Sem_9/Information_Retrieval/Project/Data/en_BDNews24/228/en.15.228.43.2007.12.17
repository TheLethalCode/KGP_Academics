 KATHMANDU, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An ethnic Madhesi group that organised bloody protests in Nepal's southern plains this year said on Monday it would launch a fresh campaign to press for regional autonomy. Dozens were killed in protests by the Madhesi People's Rights Forum, which says it represents the Madhesis, an ethnic group that dominates the plains, called the Terai, that are home to nearly half of the Himalayan nation's 26 million people.

The group plans a series of protest rallies in the Terai starting on Dec. 26.

More than a dozen ethnic and armed rebel groups are active in the Terai, where local human rights groups say more than 200 people were killed in violent protests, clashes or in local disputes since a peace deal with the Maoist former rebels was signed last year.
