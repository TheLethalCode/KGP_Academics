<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) Members of the elite crime buster Rapid Action Battalion exchanged gunfire early Monday with suspected criminals in the capital, leaving a suspect dead and three others wounded, an official said. RAB-2 deputy commander Major Masud Karim said that the gunfight broke out in eastern Dhaka's Maddhya Badda after they raided a mess on information. Major Masud said one of the captured suspects had initially admitted that the members belonged to a little-known Islamic group, Allahr Dal (Party of Allah). But the official immediately phoned bdnews24.com and asked to review his previous version, saying that the captured suspect was now telling them that they were not members of that group. Details could not be confirmed immediately. Major Masud said the suspects opened fire at them as soon as they raided the mess at 2:00 am. The security officials retaliated and one Rab official, Forhad, was wounded. The officials captured one suspect Al Beruni Sabuj as he tried to flee the scene, Major Masud said. Later, they arrested another wounded suspect near Gulshan Lake. The suspect covered in blood opened fire at the security personnel during the arrest. The officials returned bullets, and the man died instantly. His identity could not be known immediately. The third suspect fled the scene, the official said. The RAB members seized one locally-made gun, one revolver and two pistols. bdnews24.com/l
