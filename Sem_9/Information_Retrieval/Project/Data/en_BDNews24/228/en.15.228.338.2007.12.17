<TITLE> Donors meet in Paris to back Middle East peace bid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 60 countries meet in Paris on Monday to underwrite renewed Middle East peace talks with pledges of aid for the Palestinian government, locked in a power struggle with Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. The one-day meeting is the financial sequel to the launch last month in the United States of the first peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians in seven years. The talks are aimed at achieving an agreement on Palestinian statehood next year. "This gathering of the entire world targets economic and political support," Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters after meeting French President Nicolas Sarkozy late on Sunday. Abbas is hoping to secure $5.6 billion in aid over three years for his budget and for economic development in both the West Bank and in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The United States on Sunday promised more than $550 million. While the meeting, dubbed the "International donors' conference for the Palestinian state", will focus on plans to boost the Palestinian economy, envoys from dozens of countries are expected also to discuss outstanding contentious issues. As delegates gathered, Palestinian negotiators said Israeli plans to build new homes on occupied land near Jerusalem could cloud the next round of peace talks, due to be held on December 23. "We need a clear-cut Israeli decision concerning this issue," said Palestinian spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the dispute was "ever more reason that it's time to get an agreement" and appealed to both sides not to "consider every bump in the road to be a barrier". "There is an assumption here that there is not going to be turbulence in this process. There is. I don't care how much you talk to people before, I don't care how much work you do. There will be turbulence," Rice told reporters as she flew to Paris. Donor nations have been poring over a reform programme drawn up by the Palestinian Authority. However, the World Bank said last week such plans would not be enough to revive the economy if Israel did not lift trade and travel restrictions. Israel has so far balked at removing checkpoints scattered across the occupied West Bank, citing security concerns. It has also tightened its military and economic cordon around Gaza since Hamas seized control, although on Sunday it allowed hundreds of Palestinians to leave Gaza to make the annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca
