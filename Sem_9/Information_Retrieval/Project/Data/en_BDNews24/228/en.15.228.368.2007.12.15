 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi Saturday collapsed spectacularly to lose their grip over Chittagong while Khulna and Dhaka dominated Sylhet and Barisal on the second day of the National Cricket League four-dayer. Joint league leaders Rajshahi, having resumed the day on 24 for two, collapsed at 118 all out, giving Chittagong a 88-run lead in the first innings at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Visitors Chittagong made 113 for three at stumps in the second innings to widen their over-all lead to 193 at the close of Day 2. Hosts Khulna, also enjoying the lead in the four-dayer point table, responded well to score 193 for one at stumps in the first innings after restricting Sylhet to 300 at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Ace spinner Mohammad Rafique took three wickets as Dhaka, finishing the day at 262 all out in the first innings, reduced Barisal to 152 for seven at the close of the second day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Rajshahi vs Chittagong Pacer duo Mohammad Younus (4/22) and Tareq Aziz (3/53) ripped through the top and middle orders of Rajshahi, who never seemed to recover from the initial damage after resuming the day on 24 for two. Rajshahi skipper Khaled Mashud tried to defy the opposition with 25 after overnight batsmen Farhad Hossain (11) and Shakil (21) fell immediately after resuming the second day. Chittagong openers Gazi Salahuddin (49) and Masumuddowla (28) provided the visitors a decent start before the port city outfit lost three wickets in quick succession. Nazimuddin (19) and Faisal Hossain Dickens (13) remained unbeaten when the bails were drawn. Khulna vs Sylhet Opener Imrul Kayes was on way to his second four-dayer ton with unbeaten 87 as Khulna were in a strong place against Sylhet to make 193 for one, still trailing by 107 runs in the first innings. Imrul will resume the second day with Mostafizur Rahman, who remains unbeaten on 38. Opener Nazmus Sadat struck a fine 47 runs. Earlier, spinner Murad Khan (4/79) and pacers Aslam Khan (3/57) and Robiul Islam (3/60) wrapped Sylhet's tail. Golam Rahman fell on 85 after he resumed on overnight 72. Dhaka vs Barisal Openers Shahriar Nafees (48) and Nasiruddin Farque (61) gave Barisal an excellent start, but Imran Hossain (0), Raqibul Hasan (11), Rashedul Islam (3), Kamrul Islam (0) and Arafat Salahuddin (2) failed to keep the momentum in the face of superb Dhaka bowling. Rafique was the peak of the attack with three for 45 while Mahmudullah Riad (1/14), Mosharraf Hossain Rubel (1/21), Mahbubul Alam (1/32) and Mohammad Sharif (1/33) took one wicket each. Earlier, Dhaka added 47 runs to their overnight total of 215 for six as Sharif converted his overnight 30 to 57. bdn
