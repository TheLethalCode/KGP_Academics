 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com) The nation observed its 36th Victory Day anniversary Sunday with people solemnly remembering the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in a war against the Pakistani army and their local collaborators. The day came amid renewed calls by various socio-political platforms for trying the war criminals, who opposed the independence struggle and took part in the brutal genocide during the nine-month bloody war in 1971. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed made separate statements to the nation asking people to stand united for a better Bangladesh. The day began with a 31-gun salute at dawn, and the president was the first to place a wreath followed by the chief adviser at the National Memorial in Savar. Tens of thousands of people congregated at the monument to pay their homage to the martyrs amid tight security. A 7,000-strong security arrangement was put in place in the capital and at the Savar monument. Liberation war affairs adviser MA Matin received the president and the chief adviser at the National Memorial in the morning. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and chief justice Md Ruhul Amin also attended the ceremony. Freedom fighters and the families of the Beersreshthhos placed flowers at the monument. At 7:10am, the memorial opened to the long queues of people waiting there since early morning. Jahangirnagar University and Savar upazila delegates paid respects and the Awami League and the BNP leaders followed suit. Next came the Jatiya Party, the Communist Party of Bangladesh and the Workers Party. Dhaka University, various cultural and social organisations also paid their homage to the martyrs. After laying wreaths at the Savar memorial, the AL leaders offered flowers at the portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in the morning. Similarly, both groups of the BNP leaders and workers visited the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave. MA Matin inaugurated a children's rally at the national stadium in the morning. On Dec 16, 1971, lieutenant general AAK Niazi, commander of the Pakistani occupation forces officially surrendered to the joint forces led by lieutenant general Jagjit Singh Aurora at the Suhrawardy Uddyan in Dhaka. Sunday is a public holiday. The red-and-green flag flew atop government and private buildings in Dhaka and elsewhere. bdnew
