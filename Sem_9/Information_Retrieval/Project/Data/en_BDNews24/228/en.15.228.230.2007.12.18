 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) Rescue teams of the Fire Service and Civil Defence Monday pulled five more bodies from the Rangs Bhaban rubble, raising the death toll to 10, rescuers said. Relatives identified the five as Farid Miah, 26, Md Ziru Mollah, 25, Kaizer Mollah, 26, Mamun Sikder, 35, and Mohammad Daud Munshi, 25. All came from Madhukhali upazila in Faridpur. In a statement, Rajuk, the city developer, blamed the collapse of the floors on flawed construction of the building. ASM Imdadud Dastagir, magistrate for Rajuk, told bdnews24.com, "Workers found two bodies buried beneath the debris at 8:30pm Monday." Rescuers of the Fire Service and Civil Defence cut the mangled iron rods of a collapsed concrete wall open and retrieved the bodies. The bodies were sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue. Parts of the 22-storey building came crashing down on the night of Dec 8. According to officials, the disaster happened when a group of demolition workers was resting inside the building before starting the night shift. bdnews24.c
