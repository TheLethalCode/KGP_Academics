<TITLE> Fugitive Nigerian ex-governor turns himself in </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ABUJA, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Nigerian former state governor has turned himself in to police after more than a year on the run, vowing to defend himself in court against allegations of corruption, local newspapers reported on Saturday. Ayo Fayose of southwestern Ekiti state gave himself up to the anti-corruption Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Lagos on Friday and will be formally charged on Monday, the newspapers said citing EFCC sources. He would be the seventh ex-governor to be charged with corruption since President Umaru Yar'Adua and a new crop of state governors took office on May 29 after elections in April. "I am here to officially present myself to the EFCC so that I will have the opportunity to defend myself of all the allegations against me," Fayose was quoted as saying. Nigeria's 36 state governors have discretionary powers over millions of dollars of public funds and immunity from prosecution while in office. The EFCC charged five of the outgoing governors with corruption within weeks of their terms ending on May 29, raising hope that the new president was serious about cracking down on graft in one of the world's most tainted countries. A sixth, James Ibori of oil-producing Delta state, was charged on Thursday with embezzling over $85 million and trying to bribe police $15 million to stop investigating him. The arrest and prosecution of Ibori, who has had assets worth $35 million frozen in Britain, is politically significant because he was one of the main financiers of Yar'Adua's election campaign. However, civil society activists say the justice minister and certain members of the security forces have been slowing down anti-corruption efforts including the EFCC's attempt to prosecute Ibori. The justice minister denies this. Campaigners also say the five trials that were launched against ex-governors in June have hardly progressed, signalling a lack of political commitment to seeing the cases through to sentencing. The five are out on bail. Fayose went into hiding in Oct. 2006 after the Ekiti state house of assembly impeached him over alleged corruption. Then President Olusegun Obasanjo declared a six-month state of emergency in Ekiti because of tensions connected to the impeachment, which Obasanjo said was unconstitutional. Ekiti got a new governor after the April elections although his victory is being contested in an electoral tribunal by rival candidates who allege widespread violence and fraud -- a pattern all over Nigeria. Yar'Adua's victory in the presidential poll is also being challenged in court over alleged vote-rigging.
