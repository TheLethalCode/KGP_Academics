<TITLE> China to consider Hong Kong push for democracy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Tue Dec 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's parliament will decide next week whether to allow greater democracy in Hong Kong, but no one in the liberal camp is expecting a surprise Christmas present from the Communist rulers in Beijing. Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang urged China this month to allow greater democracy in the former British colony in a report that said the majority of people in Hong Kong wanted direct elections by 2012. But the report was criticized by the pro-democracy camp for its lack of a timetable and for suggesting a delay until 2017 as a more pragmatic option. "We do not agree with the conclusions and suggestions made in the report," Hong Kong's pro-democracy legislators wrote in an open letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao on Tuesday. "...we hope to meet and exchange views with officials before the Chinese parliament makes a decision, to reflect Hong Kong residents' wish for direct elections in 2012." Since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, how and when Hong Kong might be allowed full democracy has dominated local politics, driving a wedge between the pro-democracy and pro-establishment camps. Hong Kong's mini-constitution promises direct elections as the "ultimate aim" but is vague on a date, giving Beijing scope to dictate the pace. Tsang's report will be considered by the Standing Committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), in a meeting next week, Xinhua news agency report
