 Caracas, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Monday the United States was trying to divide Latin America with accusations his government smuggled $800,000 to influence Argentina's recent election campaign. Chavez, a vocal opponent of the United States, denied that three Venezuelan businessmen arrested in Miami last week in connection with the case were agents for the Venezuelan government, as charged by Washington.

Chavez, who frequently calls for an end to US political and economic dominance in the world, also blamed Washington for recent unrest against the indigenous-controlled government of Bolivia and said the instability could spread. "Now the empire is trying to generate a civil war in Bolivia," he said. "If they want to make one of us explode, several will explo
