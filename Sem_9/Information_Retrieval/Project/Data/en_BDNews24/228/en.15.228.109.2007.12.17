 Manila, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines' largest Islamic separatist group will not return to peace talks, unless Manila honours a previous pledge to create a Muslim homeland in the south, the rebels' chief negotiator said on Monday. Negotiations to formalise an agreement on ancestral domain were shelved over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur after the government said a deal would need the approval of Congress, something earlier drafts did not require. The row was the latest in a long line of setbacks to peace in the south of the largely Catholic country, where Muslim rebels have been fighting for decades for some measure of independence in a conflict that has killed over 120,000 people. "We were shocked to find so many new elements in the draft shown to us," Mohaqher Iqbal, the chief negotiator for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) told Reuters by phone from Kuala Lumpur. "There will be no more talks unless the government show us a draft that reflects what our two sides had already agreed upon in the three years of negotiations on the ancestral domain issue." The MILF fears if any deal is sent to Congress it will be watered down, which is what happened to a 1996 peace agreement with rival rebel group the Moro National Liberation Front. The MILF and the government have been talking on and off for a decade about a self-governed territory for Muslims but analysts have cast doubt on Manila's willingness to relinquish full control over one of the most resource-rich parts of the country. Negotiations with the MILF were stalled for about a year over the issue of boundaries until a breakthrough was announced in November and hopes were raised for a deal on ancestral domain in January. "The ball is entirely in the government's hands," Iqbal said. "If they will stick to the consensus points we had agreed in the past three years, we'll sit down with them any time." SENSITIVE ISSUES Jesus Dureza, the president's adviser on the peace process, said a mutually acceptable deal could still be reached next year but he signalled that the government would not budge on the need for congressional approval. "We don't want to deceive the MILF that everything is okay because we're dealing with very sensitive issues and we can't negotiate with them outside the constitutional framework.". "We fully understand the position of the MILF, but we wanted some of our positions to be clarified by our political leaders and lawmakers because we don't want an agreement that could not be implemented on the ground," Dureza said. Political analysts said government needed to show more flexibility but even if it papered over its differences with the MILF an eventual deal would still likely founder. "My real concern is whether that agreement could ever be implemented because they could have two different ways of interpreting it," said Benedicto Bacano, of Notre Dame University in the southern city of Cotabato
