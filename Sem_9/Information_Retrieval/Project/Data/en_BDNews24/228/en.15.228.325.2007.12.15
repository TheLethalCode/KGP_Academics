 Zeeshan Haider ISLAMABAD, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf lifted emergency rule on Saturday in a move Western nations hope will stabilise the nuclear-armed state as Islamic militant violence spirals. Musharraf will address the nation on TV and radio on Saturday night. But critics say curbs on the media and judiciary mean that he can still manipulate a Jan. 8 general election win for his allies and secure a power base despite his unpopularity. "Yes, the emergency has been lifted," said a government official who declined to be identified. Citing spiraling militant violence, Musharraf imposed the emergency on Nov. 3, suspended the constitution and purged the Supreme Court to fend off challenges to his re-election, which new hand-picked judges have since rubber-stamped. Two soldiers and three civilians were killed near a Pakistani army camp by a suicide bomber on a bicycle on Saturday, underscoring a growing number of insurgent attacks this year in which hundreds of people have been killed. Facing international condemnation, including from his ally the United States, Musharraf had said he would restore the constitution. But some lawyers and judges, including Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who were deposed by Musharraf are still under house arrest. The Pakistani media criticised this week a ban on live broadcasts as an attempt to control election coverage. The end of the emergency may not change that. "This emergency was staged to perpetuate one-man rule," said Akbar Ali, an employee at a car leasing company in the main northwestern city of Peshawar. "He has got it done and it's now useless if emergency rule stays or is removed. There is no guarantee he won't stage this emergency again if he sees his rule in danger." Election monitors and many politicians fear Musharraf, despite calls for a fair vote, can rig the polls through a network of district chiefs, bogus votes and by excluding opposition supporters from ballot stations. STILL PULLING THE STRINGS? Critics point out that Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup but stepped down as army chief last month, still lives in his army house. The election is essentially a three-way battle between parties loyal to Musharraf and the parties of two main opposition leaders, former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto. An opposition-run parliament could move to impeach the general over accusations he acted unconstitutionally in securing a new term as president. With political rallies banned, parties have been holding what they call smaller "meetings" to get round the regulations. The opposition hopes that bigger rallies would be allowed as the campaign gets into gear after the weekend. The Pakistani constitution provides for prosecution for suspending the constitution, but critics say Musharraf, like previous military rulers, could exempt himself from prosecution while revoking the emergency. "When the emergency is lifted, the devil may be in the details," said Nasim Zehra, a political analyst.
