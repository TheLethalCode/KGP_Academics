 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  A conference Monday called on the government and NGOs not to force indigenous communities out of their homes in the name of promoting globalisation or conserving the environment. Pushing indigenous communities out of traditional habitats in the name of globalisation destroy the ecosystem, speakers told the inaugural ceremony of the two-day conference on "Indigenous communities and Bangladesh environment". Bangladesh Poribesh Andolan and Bangladesh Environment Network are co-organising the conference at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in the city. No forests will survive when the communities living there traditionally will be ousted, the speakers argued. Chaired by Professor Abdullah Abu Sayeed, the inaugural session was also addressed by Professor Mozaffar Ahmad, BEN coordinator Nazrul Islam and BAPA leader Mohidul Islam. "No development intervention should be threatening the life and livelihood of the indigenous people. The government and the NGOs should take coordinated measures to protect the indigenous communities. No one must make them homeless for the sake of globalisation," Prof Mozaffar said. "The governments of South Africa and Australia are begging the world's pardon today for having destroyed the original inhabitants of those lands. We must be careful about not repeating such blunders in Bangladesh." Prof Sayeed said: "The then Pakistan government had ousted lakhs of indigenous people in the 1950s from the most fertile valleys in Chittagong Hill Tracts for constructing Kaptai Hydroelectricity Project. We should refrain from committing such anti-human mistakes." "Through assisting the indigenous people in retaining and upholding their rights, we can protect and conserve the environment, nature and natural biodiversity. We must protect the people living in the forests or hills if we want to protect the forests or the hills," he said. Members of the indigenous communities from all over Bangladesh have joined the two-day event. A good number of stalls are displaying ethnic arts and crafts samples and books and magazines at the venue. bdnew
