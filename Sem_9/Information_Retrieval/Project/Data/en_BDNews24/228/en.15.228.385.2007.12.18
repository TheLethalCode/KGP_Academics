 SINGAPORE, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares in Asia pared losses on Tuesday as steadying oil prices and a firmer dollar calmed fears that rising inflation, coupled with a slowing economy in the United States, may lead to 1970s-style stagflation. But while severely beaten-down sectors such as banks made a recovery, stock investors remained extremely nervous and markets in Tokyo, Sydney and Taiwan ended still in the red. European markets are expected to fall at the open, with financial bookmakers in London calling Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 down between 0.2-0.4 percent. Investors sought the relative safety of Japanese government bonds and Treasuries, worried that stagflation, which refers to when prices rise and growth stagnates, would curb spending and drag out the credit crisis. Stagflation was last seen in the 1970s following a massive spike in oil prices and some analysts saw its return as unlikely. "The surge in U.S. inflation has been triggered by high oil and commodity prices, but as oil prices are edging down this month and the dollar is rebounding, so inflation could stabilise. Fears of stagflation might have been exaggerated," said Kim Joon-kie, an analyst at SK Securities. However, news that sentiment among U.S. home builders held at a record low for a third consecutive month in December kept worries about the U.S. housing market slump to the fore. Investors will watch earnings from Goldman Sachs due later, although expectations are high for the U.S. investment banking giant to report another strong quarter, even as rivals face write-downs and other problems from the subprime mortgage crisis. Steadier oil prices which were flat at $90.78 a barrel, helped some stock markets, notably Korea's KOSPI stage a turnaround. NIKKEI DIPS Japanese stocks fell for the fifth session in a row. Tokyo's Nikkei, which shed almost 5 percent in the previous 4 trading days, pared earlier losses to end down 0.3 percent. Banks, such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, recovered from persistent selling, helping steady the market. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks climbed from an earlier three-month low but was still down 0.1 percent by 0651 GMT. The index is about 15 percent below its Nov. 1 record high, but is still up by more than a quarter as the year draws to a close. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Singapore's Straits Times both nudged into the black. Australia's benchmark ended down 0.4 percent -- again off earlier lows -- although Investment banks Macquarie Group Ltd and Babcock & Brown Ltd fell as doubts lingered about their ability to do deals in the current uncertain equity and debt market conditions. "We have probably got another two to three months of uncertainty before credit markets in the U.S. start to stabilise," said Jamie Spiteri, senior dealer with Shaw Stockbroking. Centro Properties Group, besieged by refinancing troubles, tumbled 41 percent, adding to Monday's 76 percent slide. The dollar closed in on a seven-week high against the euro as the US currency drew support from the view that inflation pressure may limit the extent to which the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates. The dollar was at 113.01 yen and at $1.4408 against the euro. In the bond market, March 10-year JGB futures were up 0.17 of a point to 136.65 while the benchmark 10-year JGB yield slipped 2 basis points to 1.530 percent Treasuries were steady in Asia tra
