<TEXT>
 NAPLES, Italy, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mafia boss considered one of Italy's 30 most dangerous fugitives has been arrested in Naples, police said on Saturday. Edoardo Contini, 52, who had been on the run for seven years, was arrested late on Friday in a villa on the outskirts of the southern Italian city, home to the Camorra crime syndicate. "Edoardo Contini was perhaps the most dangerous boss in Naples," Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said in a statement, adding that police had been on his trail for more than a year. The arrest followed a series of high-profile sweeps against the Sicilian Mafia, including last month's arrest of "boss of bosses" Salvatore Lo Piccolo after nearly a quarter of a century on the run.
