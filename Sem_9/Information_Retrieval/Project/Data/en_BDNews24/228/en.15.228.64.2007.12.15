<TEXT>
 NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made an 11th hour appeal on Saturday for a 190-nation conference in Bali to end a deadlock over a plan to launch talks on a new UN treaty. "I am disappointed at the lack of progress," Ban told delegates after making an unscheduled return from a visit to East Timor as the Dec. 3-14 talks ran a day over time. "Your work is not yet over ... everybody should be able to make compromises," he said of a dispute over developing nations' demands that the rich should do more to help the poor cope with climate change. If the dispute is resolved, the meeting would launch two years of talks on a sweeping new worldwide treaty to succeed the UN's Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012 and link in outsiders including the United States and all developing nations. "You have in your hands the ability to deliver to the peoples of the world a successul outcome," he said. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono also made an appeal to delegates. "Without an effective road map we may never reach our destination as we envision it," he said. "The worst thing we can do is for this project to crumble because we can't find the right wording," he said. "The world is watching anxiously and I beg you not to let them down."
