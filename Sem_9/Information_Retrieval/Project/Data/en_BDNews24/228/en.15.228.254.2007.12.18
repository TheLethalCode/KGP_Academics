 GAZA, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel killed 13 Palestinian militants in air strikes in the Gaza Strip that marked its most deadly military response in months to frequent rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory. Islamic Jihad, the group behind many of the rocket launchings that have been disrupting life in southern Israel, said four of its members were killed on Tuesday as they walked out of a mosque in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. Hours earlier, air strikes killed seven Islamic Jihad militants, including a senior Gaza commander, prompting the group to threaten suicide bombings inside the Jewish state. Israel has not been hit by a suicide bombing in 11 months, a respite that helped pave the way for renewed peace efforts with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who opposes such attacks. In Paris, where he attended an international donors meeting that followed last month's Annapolis peace conference, Abbas called on Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. He described the building work as "an obstacle that hampers negotiations". Israeli Vice Premier Haim Ramon, speaking on Army Radio, said construction was largely limited to settlement blocs Israel intended to keep in any peace deal with the Palestinians. Commenting on the Israeli air strikes, Ramon said: "I can tell you that targeted killings in the West Bank have led to a drastic drop in terror attacks ... and in the Gaza Strip it certainly reduces the number of rockets fired into Israel." Israel uses the term "targeted killings" to describe attacks on top Palestinian militants. In the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, an air strike on a Hamas security position killed two members of the group, Hamas officials said. The Israeli military said the attack was in response to mortar bombs fired earlier at southern Israel. It said five rockets were also launched by Gaza militants. No one was hurt on the Israeli side. At a funeral for the Islamic Jihad fighters, gunmen fired in the air, accidentally severing a high-voltage power line, which fell on the crowd, killing one of the mourners and wounding seven others, medical officials said. SENIOR COMMANDER Palestinian officials said Majed al-Harazeen, one of the Islamic Jihad dead, was the most senior militant commander to be killed by Israel in the Gaza Strip in more than a year. "We remind the criminal Zionist enemy that assassinations had never succeeded in deterring our fighters from pursuing Jihad and resistance," said Sheikh Abdallah al-Shami, a top political leader of Islamic Jihad. Broadcasting on a radio frequency used by Gaza militants, an Islamic Jihad official ordered fighters to turn off their mobile phones and remove their batteries to foil Israeli electronic tracking and to stay out of vehicles. Rocket strikes from the Gaza Strip rarely cause injuries or deaths but residents of Israeli border towns have been pressing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to order a ground offensive. Israeli officials have cautioned that a massive military push back into the Gaza Strip, which Israeli troops and settlers quit in 2005, could result in heavy Israeli and Palestinian casualties. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Olmert, said more than 2,000 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip in recent mont
