<TITLE> BFF chief tenders his resignation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh football boss SA Sultan tendered his resignation to FIFA on Dec 15 after weeks of mental psychological war with the sports adviser. A copy of the resignation letter was also sent to army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, who heads the National Sports Council (NSC). In the letter, which is available to bdnews24.com, Sultan cited that his decision came because of "unavoidable circumstances" and "personal reasons". Officials of the Bangladesh Football Federation could not say anything about the letter. It could not be confirmed if the resignation had been accepted. Meanwhile, many believe that Sultan's action came following a letter, recently obtained and disclosed by bdnews24.com, to Moeen where the BFF boss said that the sports adviser had made some "unexpected" and "unwanted" comments on the federation. On Dec 6, during the announcement of the national sports awardees, adviser Tapan Chowhdury expressed his dissatisfaction over the activities of the federation. The adviser's remark prompted Sultan to raise the question the next day if the adviser had any right to comment on the federation. A battle of word surfaced between them, and it went on for several days. Later on Dec 9 Sultan lodged the complaint against the adviser with the NSC chairman. "He (Tapan) had made similar remarks in the past to tarnish the image of the federation but we did not say anything to show respect to him. Damaging the image of the federation is not even good for his ministry," the letter reads. On Dec 13, Sultan wrote a letter to FIFA president Joseph S Blatter, seeking a permission to hold the BFF election on the basis of the constitution unveiled in 2003. The letter stated that FIFA recommendation of forming the District and Divisional Football Associations (DFAs) had created a big misunderstanding between the government and the federation. The district and divisional football association leaders could not fully accept the DFAs' statues while many ex-footballers also protested against the way such associations have been formed, according to the letter. It, however, warned that such associations would face legal complicacy in the future unless the statues were amended. "I had a discussion with all concerned including the government, clubs, districts, ex-national footballers, journalists. If you (the FIFA president) kindly consider the above proposal I can hold the election within next 40 days." Otherwise, Sultan said in his letter, he would have no other option but to resign. bdne
