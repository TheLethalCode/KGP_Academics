"Xu subsequently withdrew 175,000 yuan ($24,000) in 171 transactions while Guo withdrew 18,000 yuan," the Beijing News reported. Guo was jailed for a year after turning himself in while Xu remained on the run for a year before being apprehended and sentenced to life for theft. The sentence has sparked an outcry from local media. "Sentenced to life for unexpectedly discovering an ATM's malfunction and enticed into committing a crime is too harsh," the Beijing News said in an editorial.

Xu has appealed against his sentence. ($1=7.378 Yuan
