 LONDON, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter extended their lead at the top of Serie A to seven points after a 2-0 win at bottom side Cagliari on Sunday while their main rivals faltered. Arsenal and Manchester United drew clear in the Premier League after 1-0 victories over title challengers Chelsea and Liverpool. Real Madrid kept their noses in front in Spain after a comfortable 2-0 win over Osasuna helped the champions maintain a four-point lead over Barcelona. ENGLAND Arsenal returned to the top of the Premier League after captain William Gallas headed the winner against his old club in a 1-0 victory in the London derby. Arsenal also had two goals disallowed in the closing stages, while Chelsea were left to rue a glaring miss by England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. Victory moved Arsenal on to 40 points, one clear of champions Manchester United, who had earlier beaten Liverpool by the same scoreline at Anfield in the first game of the day's big double-bill. United's Argentine forward Carlos Tevez decided the northwest derby with a close-range strike, dealing a hammer blow to Liverpool's title hopes. They are now 10 points behind Arsenal in fifth place. Chelsea's defeat has cast them six points adrift of Arsene Wenger's side in third place, just a point ahead of Sven-Goran Eriksson's remarkable Manchester City side, who trounced struggling Bolton Wanderers 4-2 on Saturday. SPAIN Real Madrid maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Primera Liga with a straightforward 2-0 win over Osasuna at the Bernabeu on Sunday. Dutch duo Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wesley Sneijder scored goals in each half as Real kept one eye fixed on next weekend's top-of-the-table clash with arch-rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o was back to his combative best for second-placed Barcelona on Saturday, as he scored twice in a 3-0 away victory against free-falling Valencia. Atletico Madrid were held to a goalless draw at Recreativo Huelva on Sunday but stayed third on 31 points, the same as fourth-placed Villarreal who beat Getafe 3-1 away with a double from Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci. Espanyol kept pace in fifth on 30 points after seeing off bottom club Levante 1-0 at home on Saturday. ITALY Injury-hit Inter Milan went seven points clear at the top of Serie A after Julio Cruz and David Suazo secured a 2-0 win at bottom side Cagliari. The unbeaten defending champions took advantage of second-placed AS Roma drawing 0-0 at Torino, who should have beaten their more illustrious visitors. Roma are one point above third-placed Juventus, who won 3-2 at Lazio on Saturday thanks to Alessandro Del Piero's second-half brace. GERMANY Bayern Munich did just enough to take the honorary title of winter champions but with half the season gone, and a six-week break to look forward to, they now lead Werder Bremen only on goal difference. Bayern could manage no better than a goalless draw at Hertha Berlin on Saturday, while Werder were winning 5-2 at home to Bayer Leverkusen. Two of the Werder goals came from Ivan Klasnic, the first time the Croatia striker had found the net since undergoing two kidney transplant operations earlier in the year. Hamburg SV missed the chance to make up ground on Bayern when they were held to a 1-1 draw away to Karlsruhe, while champions VfB Stuttgart dropped further off the pace with a 2-0 defeat at Arminia Bielefeld. With 17 matches played, Bayern and Werder have 36 points, followed by Hamburg on 32 and Leverkusen on 30. The Bundesliga resumes on Feb 1. NETHERLANDS Gerald Sibon and Brazilian debutant Paulo Henrique hit doubles to inspire Heerenveen to a 5-1 win at NAC Breda to close in on the top three, who were not in action this weekend because of a police strike. The matches between league leaders Ajax Amsterdam and PSV Eindhoven and third-placed Feyenoord and AZ Alkmaar were postponed due to fears of public safety. Heerenveen are fourth, level on 29 points with third-placed Feyenoord and two points behind Ajax. Roda JC Kerkrade, beaten 3-2 at home by Sparta Rotterdam, and Twente Enschede, held 1-1 by VVV Venlo, dropped valuable points. FRANCE Nancy failed to put the pressure on champions Olympique Lyon when they were held to a goalless draw at Racing Strasbourg in Ligue 1 on Sunday. Nancy, who have not won in their last four league outings, have 34 points from 18 matches and will host Lyon, who drew 0-0 with Nice on Saturday, next weekend before the league enters its winter break, returning on Jan 12. Also on Sunday, Olympique Marseille conceded a 2-2 draw at Girondins Bordeaux after squandering a 2-0 lead. Bordeaux remain third in the standings on 30 points with Marseille in 14th place eight points behind. Paris St Germain, still looking for their first home win in Ligue 1 this season, were back into the danger zone after slumping to a 2-1 defeat against Toulouse at the Parc des Princes
