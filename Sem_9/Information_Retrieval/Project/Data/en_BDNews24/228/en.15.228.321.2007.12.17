 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)The US government has increased fees for immigrant and non-immigrant visa applications, effective from Jan 1, the US embassy in Dhaka said in a statement Monday. Applicants applying for non-immigrant visas have to pay $131, up from $100, according to the statement. The fees for immigration visas have been reset at $355, which is an increase of $20. Applicants paying $100 before Jan 1 will be processed without additional charge if they are supposed to appear for a visa interview before Jan 31, the statement said. But applicants who paid $100 in application fees before Jan 1, but are not scheduled to appear for a visa interview before Jan 31, will be required to pay the additional $31 before the interview. Some immigrant visa applicants including DV candidates will be required to pay the additional $20. There is no change in the fee collection procedures. bdn
