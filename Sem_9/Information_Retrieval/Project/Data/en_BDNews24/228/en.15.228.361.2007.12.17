<TITLE> South Africa`s ANC prepares to decide Mbeki`s fate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Polokwane, South Africa, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The African National Congress (ANC) holds a hotly contested election on Monday that could clear the way for the controversial Jacob Zuma to assume South Africa's presidency. Zuma, a populist with support from trade unions and rank-and-file members of the ruling party, is widely expected to seize the party presidency from incumbent Thabo Mbeki when some 4,000 delegates cast ballots at a party congress. Mbeki, who took over the ANC from Nelson Mandela in 1997 and the state presidency two years later, has waged a desperate last-minute bid to convince ANC members to give him a third term as their leader. Although he must step down as South African president in 2009, Mbeki wants to retain control of the party to ensure that he can govern comfortably during his remaining years in office as well as help choose and groom his successor. The winner will inherit the reins of a party that has ruled Africa's largest economy virtually unopposed since the end of apartheid in 1994 -- but one that is also badly divided by the leadership battle. The two candidates, both 65-year-old veterans of the ANC's anti-apartheid struggle who spent years in exile, have squared off in a bitter feud that has spawned charges of smear tactics, vote-buying and efforts to rig the election. Mbeki's camp has argued that Zuma is unfit for the country's top job due to his brushes with the law -- the charismatic Zulu politician was acquitted in 2006 of raping an HIV-positive woman, and police are investigating allegations that he accepted bribes in an arms deal. He denies any wrongdoing. Mbeki's supporters have also stoked fears that Zuma could tilt the country sharply to the left, an accusation that has been denied by Zuma and his supporters. "I am saying to the world that a Zuma presidency, if it comes, should not cause any jitters for investors," tycoon Tokyo Sexwale, who was once seen as a compromise leadership candidate but now backs Zuma, said on Sunday. Zuma was the country's deputy president until he was fired by Mbeki in 2005 because of the corruption investigation. His backers have accused senior government officials of using state institutions to smear their hero and deny him the presidency. Mbeki, favoured by business and middle-class South Africans, tried to rekindle doubts about Zuma's personal credentials on Sunday when he urged ANC delegates not to allow their party to be corrupted or bought. He did not name Zuma specifically in his keynote address at the congress in Polokwane, 350 km north of Johannesburg, but there was no doubt who he had in mind. Hundreds of Zuma backers jeered, while Mbeki supporters cheered. The Zuma camp is brimming with confidence, aware that the challenger went into the congress with nearly twice as many party branch nominations as Mbeki. Zuma has also been endorsed by the ANC's women's and youth leagues, as well as the powerful Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), which is in a formal governing alliance with the ANC. Key members of the South African Communist Party, also in the governing coalition, have thrown their support behind Zuma out of a belief that he will reverse Mbeki's centrist policies and move the country to the left. Although Mbeki has been praised for spurring economic growth, critics say that his government has neglected the poor
