"This means a tourist can get a visa either for Thailand or Cambodia and can visit the two nations," Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong said after signing the agreement with visiting Thai counterpart Nitya Pibulsonggram. The deal was the first of a hoped for series also involving Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, he said. "We want to see the five countries become one tourist destination," Hor Namhong said.
