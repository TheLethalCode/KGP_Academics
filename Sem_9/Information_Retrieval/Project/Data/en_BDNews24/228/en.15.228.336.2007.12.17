 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka and Chittagong Monday romped to their third win while Khulna drew for the sixth time in the National Cricket League. Dhaka handed a massive 217-run defeat to Barisal at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium while Chittagong defeated Rajshahi by 21 runs in the eighth round four-dayers at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Khulna with first-innings lead drew against Sylhet at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Khulna shrugged joint leaders Rajshahi off to consolidate their lead with 92 points, eight clear of second-placed Rajshahi, who earned only four points from the match. Chittagong raised their points tally to 77 points while holders Dhaka stayed on fourth position, one point behind the port city outfit. Barisal and Sylhet have 59 and 52 points respectively. Dhaka vs Barisal Chasing an improbable 364 to win on the final day, Barisal lost steam to be all out for 146. Spinner Masharraf Hossain Rubel and pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin wrecked up the top and middle orders sharing eight wickets. Only Raqibul Hasan (46), Sajidul Islam (26 not out) and Nasiruddin Faruque crossed into the double figures in the face of some accurate bowling of Rubel and Robin.
