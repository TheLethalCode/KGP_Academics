 COLOMBO, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene hailed his players on Saturday for what he described as a "perfect game" after winning the first test against India by an innings and 239 runs. Four Sri Lanka batsmen scored centuries as they piled up 600 for six, spinners Muttiah Muralitharan (11-110) and Ajantha Mendis (8-132) shared 19 wickets and the fielding was superb. "The guys did brilliantly," Jayawardene told reporters after Sri Lanka's biggest test win on home soil. "Everything went to plan and I guess it was a perfect game for us. "We batted well to put them under pressure when they batted and then we bowled and fielded exceptionally," he added. "Once we enforced the follow-on we knew we had to be patient because the pitch wasn't doing too much. "We were lucky to get a couple of early wickets and after that Murali bowled brilliantly and Ajantha kept the pressure going at the other end. Special credit should go to Murali and Ajantha for how they bowled on what was a good batting track." Jayawardene gave the new umpire referral system the thumbs up. "If it wasn't used in this test we'd probably have had four bad decisions go against," he said. "The decisions for both Sachin Tendulkar (caught at slip) and Rahul Dravid (caught short leg) were tough ones for the on-field umpire. "I am all for this new system because if mistakes are made you can get them corrected." LACKLUSTRE PERFORMANCE India captain Anil Kumble lamented his team's lacklustre performance and admitted they had been outplayed. "We didn't really bat well in both innings but we need to work on all three departments," Kumble said. "It was not just one department that didn't support us. "It was important that we really bowled well and held whatever chances came our way but that didn't happen. We let them off the hook when they were 57-2 and it was one of those games where nothing went right for us." Kumble brushed off suggestions that the team was underprepared after a solitary practice game. "I don't think we were underprepared -- it was just that we were not good enough," he said. Kumble now wants to focus on improving in the second test in Galle starting on Thursday. "We need to obviously look at tackling both Murali and Mendis differently in the next game and try to be a bit more positive," he said. "We are a group that has done really well in the past and it's now a matter of getting together and ensuring and we put up a good show. We done that in the past and I am really confident that this group will be able to put up a better show in Galle.
