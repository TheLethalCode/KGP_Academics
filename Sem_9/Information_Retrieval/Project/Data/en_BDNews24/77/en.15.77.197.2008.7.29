"We ventilated the girl for two days. But eventually she passed away because of a chest problem," Pant told Reuters. Pant said Ganga had been the weaker of the two since the surgery but Jamuna was doing well.

Twins fused at the head are rare, occuring once in every two million live births. Successful separation is even rarer.
