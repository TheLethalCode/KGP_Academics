<TEXT>
 Dhaka/Washington, July 26 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina discussed Bangladesh's political situation with US assistant secretary of state Richard A Boucher at a meeting in Washington Friday, her aide said. There is no alternative to a democratically elected government for running the country, Boucher was quoted as telling the meeting at the US Department of State by Hasina's special assistant Hasan Mahmud. The meeting was also attended by US ambassador to Bangladesh James F Moriarty, other US officials, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy and her another aide Niaz Ahmed. Dr Mahmud who also attended the meeting told bdnews24.com that the meeting had broadly focused on the political situation in Bangladesh. The Awami League president underlined the need for immediate elections and said: "If the government holds local government elections prior to national polls, people's doubt about the election will deepen." "The caretaker government's main responsibility is to transfer power to an elected government by holding a free, fair and acceptable election," Hasina was quoted as saying. According to Dr Mahmud, the AL chief endorsed the current anti-graft drive carried out by the caretaker government. "But the Awami League will not support controls over politics in the name of curbing corruption," Hasina was quoted as telling the meeting. Referring to Hasina, Dr Mahmud said the Awami League would continue the anticorruption drive and press ahead with institutional reforms initiated by the caretaker government if the party returned to power. Boucher, US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, said, according to Dr Mahmud, his country desired to see the return of a democratic government in Bangladesh through a free, peaceful and transparent election by December. At the meeting with Boucher, Hasina alleged that she and her party had been the twin targets of all terrorist activities in Bangladesh. "The Awami League was strict in curbing terrorism and will remain so in future." Hasina hoped that the US would continue its assistance in protecting human rights and establishing equal rights for all across the world. bdnews
