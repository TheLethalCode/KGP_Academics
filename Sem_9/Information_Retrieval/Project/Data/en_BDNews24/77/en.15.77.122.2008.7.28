 COLOMBO, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have called up uncapped paceman Dammika Prasad as an additional bowling option for the second test against India in Galle starting on Thursday. The 25-year-old played three one-day internationals in 2006 before suffering a series of injuries but has since impressed with the A team and recently against the Indians, claiming 4-58 in a warm-up game. Prasad, however, is unlikely to play with Sri Lanka expected to retain the same side that won the first test by an innings and 239 runs. Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Michael Vandort, Malinda Warnapura, Kumar Sangakkara, Thilan Samaraweera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekera, Chamara Silva, Thilan Thushara, Chamara Kapugedera, Dammika Prasa
