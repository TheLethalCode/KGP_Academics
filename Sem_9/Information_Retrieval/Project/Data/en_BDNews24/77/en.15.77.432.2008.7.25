 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)Political leaders have voiced a mixed reaction to the move to amend the Representation of the People Order 1972 instead of scrapping it. Leaders of Awami League and Worker's Party supported the move, while a BNP leader voiced continued concern Friday. The government had proposed replacing the order with a new ordinance in the face of opposition from political parties, but the Election Commission asked the government not to go ahead with the move on Thursday. Awami League presidium member, Motia Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Friday: "What the government was proposing at first was unjust. The government has amended its mistake." "The government was acting according to their whim. But, they must act accepting reality." BNP joint secretary general, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy told bdnews24.com: "An unelected government does not have any jurisdiction to amend such laws." "They must be done through parliament." "The Election Commission should refrain from meddling in these affairs further and concentrate on holding parliamentary elections first of all." "We still do not support amendment to the RPO 1972 in such a way in absence of parliament." Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon welcomed the government decision. He told bdnews24.com: "No law passed by the parliament can be scrapped through an ordinance." "At best it can be amended. We are happy that the government is amending the Representation of the People Order 1972." bdnews24.
