 BROWNSVILLE, Texas, Wed Jul 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Dolly moved inland after tearing into the South Texas coast on Wednesday with 95 mph (150 kph) winds, pouring torrential rain on the US-Mexico border area and threatening floods. Dolly, the second hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, dropped up to 12 inches of rain in the first few hours after coming ashore at the barrier island of South Padre Island, where it ripped off roofs, bent palm trees in half and left thousands of residents without power. "You've got your horizontal rain and things are flying everywhere," said Kevin Hoffman, 52, who rode out the storm in his boarded-up home in nearby Port Isabel. "All you hear is things snapping and hitting." South of Port Isabel in the border town of Brownsville, the storm knocked down power lines, uprooted trees and dumped rain on flat-lying marshland, raising concerns about potential flooding. "The main hazard from this storm is probably going to be inland flooding," said John Nielsen-Gammon, official climatologist for the state and a professor at Texas A&M University. The storm's leading edge hit South Padre Island as a Category 2 hurricane, the second level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 kmh) but quickly fell back to Category 1, the National Hurricane Center said. It was expected to weaken to a tropical storm later Wednesday evening, the Miami-based center said. Flooding was expected to be widespread across South Texas and northeastern Mexico, it said. The storm missed most offshore drilling rigs and production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico
