 KARACHI, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) cannot force teams to play in the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September, chief executive Haroon Lorgat said on Friday. "All we can do is make them (the players) confident about the measures taken in regard to safety and security and on that basis hope they participate," Lorgat said in a statement. "That is the reason we are putting together a task team inviting all the main stakeholders, including FICA (international players' association), so the process is inclusive." The ICC's executive board confirmed on Thursday that the eight-nation tournament would be held in Pakistan despite security concerns raised by Australia, New Zealand, England and South Africa. Despite Thursday's announcement player representatives have continued to warn cricketers against travelling to Pakistan for the Sept. 11-28 event. Lorgat said the ICC, cricket's governing body, would not comment on possible action if teams did not appear in the tournament. "We won't speculate on teams not taking part or any action if that did occur," he said. "There was no indication that would happen during the telephone conference of ICC directors on Thursday." The Champions Trophy has been mired in uncertainty for several weeks over safety concerns following a spate of suicide bombings in Pakistan. Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi are the intended match venue
