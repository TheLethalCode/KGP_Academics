 GALLE, Sri Lanka, July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's batsmen have been warned to expect a "spinner's pitch" for the second test in Galle starting on Thursday as they aim to recover from their humiliating innings and 239-run first test loss to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's new 'spin twins', Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis, created huge problems for the Indian batsmen in the series opener, claiming 19 wickets between them. Galle ground manager Jayanda Warnaweera, a former Sri Lanka spinner, said he has prepared a surface that will suit the pair. "Sri Lanka have got spinners and this (pitch) will therefore be a spinner's pitch," Warnaweera told reporters. "Although it should help the seamers on the first day, it will start spinning a lot by day three," he added. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene noted, however, that only four of the 24 fallen wickets in the venue's last test -- December's draw with England -- were taken by spinners. "We'll have to see how it shapes up this week as with some rain around there might also be help for the quicker bowlers," Jayawardene said. "Whatever surface it is we'll need to play good cricket and right now we are focused on carrying on where we left off in Colombo. "We played some great cricket there but this is a new game and we can't afford to be complacent against a strong team like India." ADDITIONAL OPTION Sri Lanka have called up uncapped pace bowler Dammika Prasad as an additional bowling option for the test. Local media reported that Chaminda Vaas may be rested, but with the quick bowlers being used so sparingly in the first test, the hosts are unlikely to make any changes. India are also set to remain unchanged unless the pitch does indeed turn out to be very dry and spin-friendly. If so, left-armer Pragyan Ojha could be considered as a third spinner with Saurav Ganguly opening the bowling. The tourists's greatest test will be how their batsmen come to grips with Muralitharan and Mendis, two unorthodox slow bowlers. Opener Gautam Gambhir insists they remain positive. "We had a bad test but now we are positive and want to come back hard against the Sri Lankans," Gambhir said. "Yes, they have a quality spin attack but we also have guys who can play spin well." Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Michael Vandort, Malinda Warnapura, Kumar Sangakkara, Thilan Samaraweera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekera, Chamara Silva, Thilan Thushara, Chamara Kapugedera, Dammika Prasad India squad: Anil Kumble (captain), Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Dinesh Karthik, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, RP Singh, Rohit Sharma, Parthiv Patel, Pragyan Ojha, Munaf Pate
