 MADRID, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona could reverse their decision to sell striker Samuel Eto'o due to the positive attitude shown by the Cameroon international in pre-season training, club president Joan Laporta said on Monday. "Eto'o is showing total commitment and that part of his character is something we all like to see. He has had a very positive attitude during the pre-season," Laporta told a news conference. "At one time we did think the most convenient thing was to change things in order to renew the team, especially in terms of the most important players, but I understand that nothing in this world is set in stone. "I don't think the issue with Samuel is irreversible or definitive and we need to look at things carefully. His recovery both in mental and physical terms will influence the club's final decision." Barca's new coach Pep Guardiola said that both Eto'o and Ronaldinho did not feature in his plans when he took charge after the sacking of Frank Rijkaard at the end of last season. Ronaldinho has since been sold to AC Milan, while the club has brought in Martin Caceres, Gerard Pique and Daniel Alves to bolster their defence and Aleksandr Hleb and Seydou Keita to strengthen the midfield. Laporta praised Guardiola's work with the new-look squad who have returned from a successful pre-season tour of Scotland. "What Guardiola has done is bring some order to things and that is important," said Laporta. "He has done won the respect of the players with his actions.
