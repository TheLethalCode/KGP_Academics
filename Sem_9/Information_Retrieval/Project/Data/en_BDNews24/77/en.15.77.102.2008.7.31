 Beijing, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The international media should have been told they would not have completely free access to the internet before they arrived to report the Beijing Olympics, IOC press chief Kevan Gosper told Reuters on Thursday. As the row over censorship continued to rumble, Gosper said that both he and the international media had been taken by surprise that some sensitive websites had been blocked despite many assurances from Beijing organizers that they would be able to work normally during the Games, which start on August 8. Gosper said: "It's clear that I have been providing, on behalf of the IOC, incomplete information." Gosper said he had never been told that some IOC officials had held discussions with local organizers BOCOG that some websites not directly connected to the Games could be blocked. "Had I and the international media been informed earlier of this understanding that certain websites would be inaccessible, we would not now find ourselves in the position where they, as well as myself, have been taken by surprise," he said. COUNTLESS MEETINGS Gosper told Reuters he was surprised that he had never heard the IOC had discussed the matter privately with BOCOG as, in his position as chairman of the IOC's press commission and vice-chairman of the Beijing co-ordination commission, he had been involved in countless meetings about press operations for the Games. BOCOG spokesman Sun Weide told a news conference on Wednesday that censorship would not prevent journalists reporting the Games though he acknowledged there would be no access to some websites, such as those of the Falun Gong, which he described as "an evil fake religion which has been banned by the Chinese government". BOCOG consistently assured journalists attending press briefings ahead of the Games that they would have normal access to the internet.
