 New Delhi, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said on Thursday it was hopeful that world trade talks would resume after marathon discussions to seal the long-running Doha development round ended this week without agreement. "I am hopeful that the process will restart again. India stands ready whenever the process resumes," Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath told a news conference after his return from the talks in Geneva. Talks on a new global trade pact collapsed on Tuesday as the United States and India refused to compromise over a proposal to help poor farmers in the developing world deal with floods of imports.
