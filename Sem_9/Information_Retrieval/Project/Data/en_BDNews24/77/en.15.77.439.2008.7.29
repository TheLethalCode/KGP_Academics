 AHMEDABAD, India, Tue Jul 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police found ten unexploded bombs in the western Indian city of Surat, one of the world's biggest diamond-polishing centers, on Tuesday, three days after a series of bombs in the same state killed 45 people. "We have defused seven bombs and (are) working on three more," senior police official H.P. Singh told Reuters. He said the bombs were all found in one of Surat city's most crowded neighborhoods, but gave no details about the nature of the explosives or who could have placed them. A series of 16 bombs ripped through the nearby city of Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat on Saturday, a day after bombs killed one woman in the IT hub of Bangalore. A group called the "Indian Mujahideen" said it carried out the Ahmedabad attack, writing in an e-mail sent five minutes before the first blast that it was in revenge for a 2002 massacre in Gujarat of around 2,500 people, mainly Muslims, by Hindu mobs. On Sunday, two unexploded car bombs were also found by police in Surat
