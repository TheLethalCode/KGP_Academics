 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Police held Jatrabari Krira Chakra to a 3-3 draw in the Citycell Federation Cup qualifying round Wednesday at Shaheed Barkat Stadium in Gazipur. In the day's other match, Bangladesh Army handed a 2-0 defeat to Bangladesh Customs Krira Parisad at Army Stadium in Banani. Bangladesh Army, who lost 2-1 to Sunrise Sporting Club in their Group C opener, went ahead just one minute before the break with Ahsanur Rahman giving the armymen a lead. Ahsanur then sealed the match in the 59th minute, but the armymen will have to wait for the results of the Sunrise-Customs match on whether they would go through for the 16-team finals. Both Sunrise and Army secured three points each, but Sunrise have a match in hands. Away at Gazipur, Bangladesh Police, who unfortunately went one goal down against BKSP in Group B encounter, dominated the match and took a 2-0 lead against Jatrabari, but they eventually failed to keep the momentum to share point with the senior division team. Jatrabari, who beat Diganta Prasari 2-0 in the qualifying opener, raised their point tally to four from two outings while Police collected three, playing two matches. Biswa Barua gave Police a lead in the very fourth minute while Kabirul Islam doubled the lead in the 32nd minute. After going two goals down, Jatrabiar bounced back in the match with Tapash pulling one goal back in the 38th minute to end the first half 2-1. Yamin levelled the Jatrabari margin in the 69th minute before Shariful made it 3-2 for the Old Dhaka outfit. It seemed that Police, despite playing better, were going down again, Monirul Hasan rescued Police striking a goal one minute from time to force Jatrabari to share point. Jatrabari and BKSP jointly topped the Group A point table with four points each playing two matches. They will square off on Aug 2. Police opened their account with one point playing two matches.
