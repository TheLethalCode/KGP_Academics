 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet Sunday approved an ordinance with scope to form an Insurance Regulatory Authority for a three-year term, a government spokesman said. The Insurance Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2008 has been approved at a meeting of the cabinet at the Chief Adviser's Office, chaired by interim leader Fakhruddin Ahmed. Under the new ordinance, the term "general insurance" will be changed to non-life insurance, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting. "The term 'life insurance' remains the same." The cabinet also approved Insurance Ordinance 2008 and Insurance Corporation's (Amendment) Ordinance 2008. The Insurance Regulatory Authority will be tasked with supervising the activities of both life and 'non-life' insurers. The regulator will consist of five members, Munaim said. A life insurer will have to pay Tk 1.5 crore in security deposits and a non-life insurer will have to pay Tk 2.5 crore. Overall development of the insurance industry including protection of subscribers' interest and raising funds will be the responsibilities of the regulator. In line with the new ordinance, the post of Chief Controller of Insurance will cease to exist and the Authority will control the insurance sector. bdn
