 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia has claimed that a graft case filed by the ACC, involving the Zia Orphanage Trust, is a bid to taint the image of her family, a lawyer said Wednesday. Khaleda made the remark to deputy assistant director of the Anticorruption Commission Harun Ur Rashid, who quizzed her Wednesday at the special jail regarding the case, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon said. The ACC official questioned the former prime minister for one and half hours from 6.15pm, at the special jail set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises. Three of Kahleda's lawyers were presentBarrister Mahbubuddin, barrister Nawshad Jamir and advocate Shimul Biswas. Mahbubuddin later told reporters that Khaleda asked the ACC if there were any documents containing her signature relating to the allegations in the case. The BNP chief challenged Harun Ur Rashid to show her any evidence that she gave clearance to illegally withdraw money from the Trust's accounts, Mahbubuddin said. "How have I been implicated in the case when you have no evidence of my involvement?" her lawyer quoted Khaleda as asking the ACC official. The ACC deputy assistant director had also earlier interrogated Khaleda's elder son Tarique Rahman, also implicated in the case, from 4.30pm to 5.45pm at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Mahbubuddin raised questions during the interrogation about Tarique's alleged involvement in the case. "Tarique Rahman was arrested on March 7 last year and the money was withdrawn from the account on March 28 of the same year. How can he be involved in the incident?" Mahbubuddin asked. Advocate Shimul Biswas also said that there was no evidence that Khaleda and Tarique were involved in the allegations. He told reporters that the ACC official had assured them that he would inform higher authorities about the questions. The ACC filed the case on July 3against seven people, including Khaleda and Tarique, on charges of embezzling Tk 2.10 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust. Other accused in the case are former MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Syed Ahmed, Gias Uddin Ahmed, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Maminur Rahman. bdne
