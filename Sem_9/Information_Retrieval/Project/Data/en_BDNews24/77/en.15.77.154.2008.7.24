<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia was not taken to court for a second day in the Gatco case hearing Thursday, which was held despite a High Court stay order on the case proceedings. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin's special court, on Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex, set July 5 for the next hearing in the graft case as the court has yet to receive a copy of a stay order by the High Court. The HC on July 15 stayed the proceedings of the case filed against Khaleda Zia, son Arafat Rahman Coco and others for two months. Though the detained BNP chairperson was not produced in court Thursday, 13 other detained accused in the case appeared before the special court. Two other accused in the case, Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and BNP leader MK Anwar, who have both been released on bail by the HC were also present in the court. Lawyer for Khaleda's younger son Coco, who is now in Bangkok for medical treatment, was present in the court on his behalf. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against Khaleda, Coco and 11 others on Sept 2 last year, on charges of awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and Coco as accused in the GATCO case on Sept 3 last year. The commission later pressed charges against a total of 25 people, on May 13 this year. bdnew
