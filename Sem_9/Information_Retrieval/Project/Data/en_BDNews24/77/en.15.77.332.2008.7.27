 SALZBURG, Austria, Sun Jul 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The arrest of Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic showed Belgrade's willingness to recognize its international obligations, and more arrests could follow, the Serbian prime minister said on Sunday. Karadzic, twice indicted by the UN court in The Hague for orchestrating genocide during the 1992-95 Bosnia war, was arrested on Monday after more than a decade on the run.

Karadzic's military commander Ratko Mladic and other fugitives are still at large. Brussels welcomed Karadzic's arrest, saying it was a sign Belgrade was serious about its EU bid, though some states want to see other fugitives wanted for crimes during the Yugoslav wars arrested for Serbia to prove it deserves to join the bloc. Cvetkovic said Serbia was not expecting a reward for the arrest, though it hoped for improved trading conditions.

The EU signed a long-delayed Stabilization and Association (SAA) pact with Serbia in April but vowed not to ratify it or unlock its trade benefits until all 27 member states agreed that Belgrade was in full compliance with the UN tribunal. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged the bloc on Tuesday to grant Serbia improved trading conditions, laid out in the interim agreement -- the trade-related part of the SAA
