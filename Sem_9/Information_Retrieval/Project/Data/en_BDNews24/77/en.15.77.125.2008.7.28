<TITLE> Turkish court deliberates AK Party closure case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ankara,July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's Constitutional Court began deliberating on Monday on whether to close the ruling AK Party on charges of seeking to introduce Islamic rule in the predominantly Muslim, but officially secular state. On Sunday, just hours before the case was to begin, bombs killed 16 people and wounded 150 in an Istanbul street of cafes and shops. No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the deadliest attacks in Istanbul since 2003. "In a critical period, terror targets civilians," said a headline in Sabah newspaper. Turkey's politicians, the European Union and foreign investors are anxiously awaiting a verdict in the AK Party case which has drawn Turkey into a period of political uncertainty, hurting financial markets and slowing its reform process. The lira weakened in early trade ahead of the court session, which began at 9:35 a.m. (0635 GMT) according to state-run Anatolian news agency. Closure of the party would almost certainly lead to an early election, possibly in November, and deal a further blow to Turkey's hopes of joining the EU. It has also deepened divisions between the Islamist-rooted government and an elite of military, judicial and academic officials who regard themselves as the custodians of the NATO member's secular system. "We can see the closure case ... as the final legal measure that can be taken by the establishment against political Islam's anti-secular activities," said Kadri Gursel, a columnist in the liberal Milliyet daily. The court agreed in March to take up the case seeking to close the party and ban Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, President Abdullah Gul and 69 major AK Party officials from party membership for five years. The party rejects the charges. Most analysts, who expect a verdict by early August, still think party closure is the most likely scenario, despite growing speculation that it could escape a ban. Turkey's battered stock market has rebounded this month on the prospect it will avoid closure. The court could dismiss the case, impose a fine, or ban the party and some of its leaders. In order to close the party, seven of the 11 judges must vote in favor of such a move. MISTAKES ACKNOWLEDGED In Sunday's second installment of an interview with Hurriyet newspaper, Erdogan rejected suggestions that he would adopt a more dictatorial style if the AK Party survives closure. "God willing there will be a beneficial verdict for our country. What I can say is that it is impossible for me to ever behave with hate or enmity towards my people," Erdogan said. He acknowledged for the first time in the interview that the party made mistakes which contributed to the current crisis. The divisions grew in January when the government moved to lift a ban on university students wearing Islamic headscarves. The Constitutional Court annulled that reform in June. If the court bans the party, the government will dissolve and the remaining AK Party deputies will become independent MPs who will be allowed to form a new party or join an existing one. Commentators say the most likely scenario would then be an early parliamentary election, possibly as soon as November. Shutting such a popular party, which won almost half the vote in a parliamentary election a year ago, would be politically difficult and harm Turkey's EU accession process. Erdogan would likely seek to regain the office of prime minister as an independent candidate in an election - a potential source of fresh tension between the two camps
