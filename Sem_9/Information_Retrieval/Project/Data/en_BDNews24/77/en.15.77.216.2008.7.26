 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  The expansion of international trade faces the risk of financial fraud, the International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh president said Saturday. "As the international trade is growing, all parties involved in the trade are also getting exposed to the risk of international trade finance fraud," ICCB chief Mahbubur Rahman said in his speech to the launch of a daylong workshop at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "Commercial crime is growing faster than international trade. Frauds are more complex and involve larger sums than ever before," he said. Some 95 participants from banks, insurers, multinational companies and law firms attended the workshop on "International fraud prevention, control and remedies". A similar workshop has been slated for Sunday in Chittagong. In most fraud cases, Rahman pointed out, the banks in one way or another became the losers because fraud damaged the relations between the bank and customers or the correspondent banks in the letters of credit chain. "It is our view that it is in the bank's own interest to ensure that they know precisely what activities their clients are asking them to finance," he said. "One way to do this is to make independent checks into the transactions  to authenticate the bills of lading and other documents presented under the documentary credit system." "It is only through these independent checks that the banks can be sure that they are financing what their clients are declaring to them." The ICCB president recommended that the banks get the bills of lading checked, as done by the ICC International Maritime Bureau for its banking members. "Bangladesh has been growing fast in international trade. Both import and export are increasing at a substantial rate," Rahman said. The more the market of import-export was expanding the more the risk of unknown events including fraud was increasing, the ICCB president said. The ICCB chief suggested that the parties involved in trade be aware of rules and regulations and fraudulent practices common in international trade. bd
