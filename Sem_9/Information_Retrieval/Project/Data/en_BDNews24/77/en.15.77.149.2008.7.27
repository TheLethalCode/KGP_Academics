 SOUTHAMPTON, England, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kent and Middlesex reached Saturday's Twenty20 Cup final to keep alive their hopes of picking up a first prize of 2.5 million pounds ($4.96 million) in the inaugural Champions League later this year. Kent (173-7) defeated Essex (159-8) by 14 runs in the first semi-final before Middlesex (141-2) beat a Durham (138-6) side containing South Africa's Shaun Pollock and Shivnarine Chanderpaul of West Indies by eight wickets in the day's second match. The winners will meet in the final under lights at Hampshire's Rose Bowl ground later on Saturday. Interest is heightened in the tournament this year because of the new eight-team Champions League to be staged in India or the Middle East in September or October featuring the Twenty20 finalists from India, Australia, South Africa and England. American billionaire Allen Stanford also said on Friday that England's Twenty20 Cup winners would be invited to play against his All-Star XI, the England national team and Trinidad & Tobago in another lucrative tournament in Antigua in October
