 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 713 madrasahs face losing their entitlement under the government's Monthly Payment Order scheme as well as being stripped of their academic status, after performing poorly in the Dakhil exams this year, the Madrasah Education Board chief said Wednesday. Professor Md Yousuf, chairman of the madrasah board, told bdnews24.com that those institutions having fewer than five students who passed the SSC equivalent Dakhil exams this year would face the penalty. He said the board had sent a list of those institutions to the education ministry last week for a final decision. There were 673 madrasahs in the country with less than five students passing this year's Dakhil exams, while 40 madrasahs had no students passing. Yousuf said these institutions would be excluded from the MPO scheme or stripped of academic recognition. The order may be withdrawn later if the madrasahs could perform better in future, he added. A senior official of the education ministry told bdnews24.com that similar action would be taken against secondary schools and technical institutions with less than five students passing the Secondary School Certificate examinations. The ministry was also making a list of such schools, he said. A total of 91 secondary institutions, including the 40 madrasahs, showed no students passing SSC or equivalent exams in 2008. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had earlier vowed to take action against these institutions. bdnews
