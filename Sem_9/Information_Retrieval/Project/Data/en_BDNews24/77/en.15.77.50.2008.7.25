<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) - Around 70,000 people die of tuberculosis each year, or one person every ten minutes, the National Anti-Tuberculosis Association of Bangladesh (NATAB) said Friday. Around 300,000 contract TB in the country annually, or one person every two minutes, NATAB said in a press briefing at Dhaka Reporters Unity, organised ahead of the association's national conference Saturday. NATAB project director Dr Probhat Chandra Barua said the populations of 22 countries are most affected by the disease. "The position of Bangladesh is sixth." Barua told the meeting that though there is proper treatment and a sure cure of tuberculosis it is still identified as a deadly disease. "Though mass awareness has been built among the population in Bangladesh, control of the disease is being hampered due to lack of long term treatment plans and congenial social behaviour." Barua said people of all ages were at risk of contracting the disease. "Tuberculosis germs may enter the lungs of healthy people through normal respiration and multiply." "Of those affected, 85 percent are attacked by tuberculosis of the lungs. Others contract tuberculosis of the bone, lymphs, reproductive organs or nervous system," said the doctor. NATAB senior vice president Mozaffar Hossain Paltu, secretary general Dr Sakhawat Hossain and project coordinator Sagufta Sultana also spoke, stressing social awareness and responsibility for controlling the disease. bdnew
