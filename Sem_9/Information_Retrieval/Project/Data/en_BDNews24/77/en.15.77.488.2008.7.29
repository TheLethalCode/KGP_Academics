 london, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Amy Winehouse has been taken to hospital, her spokesman said on Monday. "Amy Winehouse suffered a reaction to medication at home this evening and was taken to hospital," he said in a statement. "Doctors have advised that she will be kept under observation overnight and is likely to be released tomorrow." When asked about the incident, a spokeswoman for the London ambulance service said: "We did take the patient to hospital ... at about 8:40 p.m. (1940 GMT)" after being called to an address in north London. The 24-year-old pop star, whose battle against drug addiction has overshadowed her recording successes, has a home in Camden, north London. She took the music world by storm in February when she landed five Grammy awards in one night, but last month the performer of hits including "Rehab" and "You Know I'm No Good" was rushed to hospital after she fainted at home. Shortly afterwards, her father said in an interview that she was suffering from lung condition emphysema and had been warned by doctors that she would die if she continued smoking drugs. Her representatives played down the severity of the diagnosis, although a spokesman has confirmed that Winehouse had a "touch of" emphysema. As well as battling addiction, Winehouse had the added setback recently of seeing her husband Blake Fielder-Civil jailed after pleading guilty to beating up a pub landlord in 2006 and conspiring to cover up the crime. Fielder-Civil, who married Winehouse in Miami last year, has served around nine months in prison, and is expected to spend another four-and-a-half months behind bars. Winehouse referred to Fielder-Civil during several recent stage performances.
