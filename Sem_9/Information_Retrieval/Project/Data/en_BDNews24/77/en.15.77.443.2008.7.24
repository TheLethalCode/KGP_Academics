 GENEVA, Jul 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Urgent talks to salvage a global trade deal made "some progress" in the early hours of Thursday, ministers said, but officials warned the mood was dark behind closed doors at the World Trade Organisation. The ministers from Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States attempted to address major stumbling blocks that have long dogged the WTO's Doha negotiations, launched in 2001. "Collectively we think it's worth continuing to make an effort because there was some progress. There are difficulties too," Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim told reporters. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said "a little progress" was made. Ministers were due to meet again on Thursday afternoon. "Some issues are nearer solution. Other issues are clearer and better understood. But there is some way to go before the gaps are bridged," European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said as the talks ended shortly before 3:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday). An official close to the talks said the atmosphere was "somber" as rich and poor countries remained at odds over steps needed to break the deadlock. In another sign of the heightened tensions, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned the United States and the EU they were risking a failure of the round, a contrast to more positive comments he has made recently
