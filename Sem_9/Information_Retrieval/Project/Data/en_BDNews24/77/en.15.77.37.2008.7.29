 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza Monday complained of an acute pain in his left knee that had already experienced a number of surgeries during the training session at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. After the complaint, the team management Tuesday sent Mashrafee to the Apollo Hospital for an MRI Test, which suggested there was no reason to be worried. Team manager Shafiqul Haque Heera told bdnews24.com, "There is nothing to be worried as his injury is a minor one." "We hope he will be able to bowl within five to six days," said Heera. The players, who were available in practice, played a 25-over warm up game at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Tuesday. Heera said that the cricketers would continue practicing despite the postponement of four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Canada, which was scheduled for Aug 14-17 in Toronto. Bangladesh will play three one-day internationals against Australia in Darwin from August 31 to September 6.
