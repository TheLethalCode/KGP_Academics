<TITLE> Asia stocks fall, haunted by growth fears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG Jul 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Friday, halting a four-day rally, after weak US housing and jobs data and volatility in the financial sector once again reminded investors of the fragile state of the global economy. Oil edged up from a seven-week low to around $125.50 a barrel, though the view that US energy demand is deteriorating is keeping a lid on prices. The dollar held below Thursday's one-month peak against the yen, while Japanese government bond prices rose as concerns about the global economy resurfaced. Reports overnight fuelled fears Britain, the euro zone, Japan and the United States are sliding toward recession. German business sentiment this month suffered its biggest decline since the 2001 attacks in New York and Washington, while existing U.S. home sales were at the lowest in a decade. "With the continuing deceleration in the global economic backdrop, export-dependent Asian economies in general are poised for weaker growth," said Thomas Lam, senior Treasury economist with United Overseas Bank in Singapore. "The negative spillover from the major economies on Asian growth tends to occur with a lag," Lam said, adding that weak U.S. growth late last year is being felt in Asia now. Japan's Nikkei share average fell 1.65 percent after finishing on Thursday at the highest since June 26. Canon Inc was the second-biggest drag on the index, with its shares down 3.4 percent after the company on Thursday posted a 12 percent fall in quarterly profit. Shares in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan dropped 2 percent after hitting the highest level in more than three weeks the previous day, an MSCI index shows. It is down 20 percent this year. South Korea's KOSPI slid 1.5 percent, led by shares of Samsung Electronics after the world's largest memory chip maker posted a lower-than-expected rise in second-quarter profit. An executive with the company said a third-quarter recovery was unlikely. Australia's benchmark index fell 3 percent as National Australia Bank Ltd shares dropped more than 12 percent, which if maintained to the close would be their biggest single-day decline since September 2001. The firm booked A$830 million ($798 million) in additional losses as a result of exposure to bad U.S. loans. LONG WAY TO FALL As the MSCI Asia ex-Japan benchmark index looks likely to post its best week since March, some investors might be asking whether markets have bottomed. At the very least, have valuations fallen enough to make stocks look relatively attractive? Not quite, said Garry Evans, strategist at HSBC in Hong Kong. Valuations in Asia are running at 2.1 times trailing book value, far above the 1.2 times reached in the last three major periods of market volatility in 1998, 2001 and 2003. Using the usual price-to-expected earnings ratios to measure relative value, shows that Asian stocks are quite cheap. They have slid to 11.7 times 12-month forward earnings from 17 times in the last year. But Evans said consensus earnings forecasts for 2009 could come down sharply in a matter of months. "We think it unlikely, though, the bear market is over. Investors have not yet capitulated," he said in a note. "In the worst case, there could still be a long way to fall." Institutional investors, who usually move large amounts of money with longer time frames, apparently agreed. They did not take part in this week's global equity rally and actually pulled back their accumulation of European stocks over the last month to the slowest since January, according to State Street Global Markets, which tracks about $15.3 trillion in assets held in custody by the bank. In addition, large investors have been selling the US and European energy sectors as well as emerging market equities and moving into sovereign bonds, State Street data showed. "This mini-rally looks as though it is built on unsafe foundations. State Street Global Markets flow measures suggest that institutional investors are staying on the sidelines," the firm said in a weekly note. Japanese government bond prices rose on a drop in the Nikkei and an overnight surge in US Treasury debt prices. Japan's benchmark 10-year yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, fell 8.5 basis points to 1.570 percent, down more than 10 basis points from Thursday's high and near a three-month low of 1.530 percent hit last week. The dollar slipped against the yen to 107.20 yen after hitting a one-month high a day earlier. The euro was at $1.5666, down about 4 cents from a record high above $1.60 SET last week
