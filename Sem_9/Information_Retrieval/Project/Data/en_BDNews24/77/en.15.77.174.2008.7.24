 UNITED NATIONS, Jul 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The African Union said on Wednesday it was incapable of stabilizing the situation in Somalia and urged the United Nations take over peacekeeping operations in the lawless Horn of Africa country. "Despite all sacrifices of its leaders and elements, AMISOM is unable to fulfill its mandate because its strength is obviously grossly incommensurate to the scope of real challenges on the ground," AU Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamamra told the UN Security Council. "The mission faces severe lack of funding and logistic support," he said. AMISOM, the AU peacekeeping force in Somalia, has authorized the deployment of 8,000 troops but has only 2,600 on the ground at present, he said. The sole suppliers of AMISOM peacekeepers are Uganda and Burundi, though Nigeria and others have offered troops. Lamamra said it was "crucial to beef up the mission to reach its authorized strength," adding that the AU had launched a drive to get more countries to contribute troops to AMISOM. Lamamra and others urged the council to authorize the United Nations to take over from the AU the task of stabilizing Somalia. "We are asking the Security Council to deploy a UN force, a force funded by the UN, a force under a UN mandate," the Foreign Minister of Somalia's interim government, Ali Ahmed Jama, told the council during a meeting on Somalia
