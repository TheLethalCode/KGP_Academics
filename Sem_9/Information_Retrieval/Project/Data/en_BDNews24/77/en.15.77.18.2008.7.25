 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)Disaster and humanitarian agencies in South Asia have called on SAARC member states to widen their focus to climate change and disaster risk during the upcoming Colombo summit, said the National Disaster Management Coordination Committee (NDMCC) of Sri Lanka on Friday. They made the call at a regional conference on 'Strengthening Understanding and Cooperation on Disaster Management for a Disaster Free South Asia' held in Colombo, ahead of the 15th SAARC Summit set for Jul 27-Aug 3. Deputy secretary to the ministry of food and disaster management M Munir Chowdhury, professor of Dhaka University Mahbuba Nasreen and ActionAid Bangladesh representative Sayeda Asifa Ashrafi attended the conference from Bangladesh. Representatives from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Maldives working on disaster management also participated in the conference. Participants and conference organisersNDMCC in collaboration with ActionAid, Christian Aid, Oxfam America, Practical Action and Sri Lankan Red Crossrecommended that the issues be explicitly acknowledged and reflected in all actions of the eight-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. They urged member countries to include disaster risk cuts in the SAARC Development Fund. The regional conference, held on July 15-16, also suggested that development policies and interventions - within and between neighbouring states - financed by bilateral and multilateral donors must be assessed to ensure that these are not increasing the risk of disasters. Speakers called upon SAARC heads of state to urgently address a 10-point recommendation, which emerged from national and regional consultations involving participants from government agencies, United Nations agencies, academic institutions and civil society. SAARC must also allocate sufficient and predictable resources to ensure the implementation of the SAARC Comprehensive Framework on Disaster Management 2006-2015, and effective functioning of all the regional institutions, they said. They suggested functional regional information mechanisms to share weather related information across member states and investment in multi-hazard early warning systems to link communities. Participants pointed out that disasters erode development gains and pose a serious threat to ongoing development initiatives by member states. South Asia is facing increased frequency of high magnitude disasters, exacerbating poverty levels, with far reaching consequences on the region as a whole that undermines SAARC's commitment to alleviate poverty and sustainable development, they said. bd
