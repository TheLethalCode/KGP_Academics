<TITLE> Clinton unlikely as Obama running mate: US teacher </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)--Hillary Clinton will never run for US Vice President as Barack Obama's running mate because of some tricky issues, says a US teacher, now visiting Bangladesh. Tim Kaine, the governor of Virginia, is most likely to be Obama's running mate, said Eric M Uslaner, a professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland on Wednesday. Uslaner is now in Bangladesh to lecture on the US presidential elections 2008. "No. Hillary Clinton will not be Obama's running mate because of some reasons," Uslaner told bdnews24.com in reply to a question during a discussion with four journalists at the American Club in Gulshan. He said that one of the jobs of the spouses of US vice presidents was to throw parties to dignitaries. "Will Bill, husband of Hilary and a former President, do that?" The US teacher said Bill Clinton was working to eradicate diseases from the world and face climate change through the William J Clinton Foundation. "Another reason for Hillary's reluctance to be Obama's running mate was that if Obama lost to John McCain with a good campaign, Hilary would have the chance to be the next Democratic candidate in 2012," he said. The professor also criticised Bill Clinton saying that the level of ethics during Clinton's time was not high. Uslaner said McCain would not have a landslide victory over Obama. "If there were any landslide, it would be in favour of Obama," he categorically said. Obama had mustered huge support of the younger people across the US. The professor said the participation of the young Americans in the primaries increased 300 percent to 1000 percent in some cases. "Without the support of the black Americans, no Democratic candidate can be US President," said Uslaner. bdn
