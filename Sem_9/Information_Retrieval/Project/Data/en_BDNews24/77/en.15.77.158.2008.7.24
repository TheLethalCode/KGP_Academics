<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  A cabinet committee Thursday recommended the use of a quotation system in line with public procurement regulations to import food grains on an emergency basis, the finance adviser said. "We have asked the authorities to use the quotation system instead of inviting bids for food procurement," AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs. "It takes 42 days to procure food through bidding and 28 days more in case of re-tender, which is time-consuming," he said. "But procurement through the quotation system will take only 10 days." The meeting also discussed other issues, including privatisation of three companies, which were shut down earlier. The companies such as Khulna Paper Mill, North Bengal Paper Mill and Chittagong Chemical Complex are now under the Privatisation Commission. "The privatisation of the factories had been on hold for long," he said. bdnew
