 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Sunday people of Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal divisions should be encouraged more to go for overseas employment to cut poverty in the regions. Poverty levels in Dhaka, Sylhet and Chittagong came down, helped by overseas employment, Fakhruddin said during a presentation on labour exports in his office. Abdul Matin Chowdhury, secretary to expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry, briefed the chief adviser on the latest labour exports and its prospects. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury also attended the briefing. "Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed stressed that this sector is linked to poverty alleviation as has been demonstrated in the cases of Sylhet, Chittagong, and Dhaka," the foreign ministry said in a statement. "He (Dr Fakhruddin) emphasised that priority attention should be given to increasing manpower export from Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal divisions, in particular from the monga-affected areas," it said. The secretary informed that this year the target for labour export would be 9 lakh which would exceed last year's record number of 832,000 people. Abdul Matin Chowdhury said his and other ministries were engaged in the upgradation of skill through 38 technical training centres as per demands of the labour-receiving countries. The technical centres will train 49,000 people, a record compared to last year's 26,000. "The remittance earned through this sector last year was over $6.6 billion, which was a record," Iftekhar said in the statement. "This was more than 7 percent of gross domestic product, 5 times the overseas aid, and 10 times the foreign direct investment," he said. This year the amount was expected to exceed $9 billion, the adviser said. bdn
