 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Former national cricketer Istiaq Ahmed Tuesday resigned from the ad-hoc committee of the Bangladesh Cricket Board citing heavy involvements in his professional arena. Ahmed is the second man to resign from the 11-man BCB ad-hoc committee after retired Col MA Latif, who left a month ago on personal grounds. "I can't mange enough time for the board as I should mange and I felt the board was being affected for my business. So I resigned," said Ahmed, who is executive vice president of the National Credit and Commerce Bank, Banani branch. Ahmed had been working as vice chairman of both the media and the game development committees. He was also a member of the BCB constitution review committee. The National Sports Council early this month appointed former national cricketer Shakil Kashem and organsier Ghulam Mohammad Alomgir in place of MA Latif and detained Salim Bhuiyan.
