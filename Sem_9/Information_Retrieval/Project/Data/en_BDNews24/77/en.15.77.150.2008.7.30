<TITLE> Fidel Castro still a force, two years out of power </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HAVANA, Wed Jul 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The era of Fidel Castro appeared to be ending July 30, 2006, when the ailing leader handed over power to his brother Raul Castro. But two years later, he remains a force to be reckoned with in Cuba and to some degree on the international scene. Although he no longer rules the Caribbean island as he did for almost 50 years, the 81-year-old still has his brother's ear and is using a newfound career as a newspaper columnist to make his views known. Diplomatic cocktail gossip in Havana centers on whether he is using his clout to hold back economic reforms favored by his brother and keep Cuba true to his vision of socialism, but the Castros say there is no disagreement between them. What is certain is that Fidel Castro has staged a remarkable comeback after apparently being near death following emergency intestinal surgery for an undisclosed ailment in July 2006. He handed power provisionally to his brother and has not been seen in public since, appearing only in occasional videos on state-run television. In the earliest videos aired months after his surgery, Cubans were shocked to see how frail and gaunt Castro was. In February, he officially resigned as president, allowing the National Assembly to formally elect Raul, 77, as his successor. But instead of fading away, as many expected, Fidel Castro re-emerged. In June, after five months out of the public eye, a more robust Castro was shown in videos meeting with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Chinese official He Guoqiang. An avalanche of his columns followed on everything from the Cuban Olympic baseball team to North and South Korea. People who have met with him say his health has improved and his mind is clear. He wrote in one column of a five-hour meeting with old friend, Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who afterward told Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that Castro spoke "of many topics, with great profundity and lucidity." SPECULATION Castro's comeback has been accompanied by speculation -- not all of it favorable -- about his role in the government. Raul Castro began his presidency with a flurry of reforms that included allowing Cubans to buy cell phones and computers and use previously off-limits tourist facilities, the lifting of wage limits to encourage greater productivity and the decentralizing of agriculture management. Agriculture reforms continued with the granting of additional land to private farmers and cooperatives, but a broader opening of the state-run economy that many expected has not occurred. "I don't think Fidel likes the idea of it," said one Western diplomat in Havana. Others think his role is exaggerated. "Fidel is not very much in the way, in my view," said Julia Sweig at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "Maybe slowing things down a bit, but in his absence would be other constraints and conditions acting as a damper on more rapid reforms." Castro tends to describe his role in limited terms. In his meeting with He from China, he was quoted by state-run media as saying: "What do I do? I help in gathering news and data and doing analysis about the most important international problems, which I furnish to the leadership of the (Communist) Party and the state." As the last major Cold War figure, Castro still has a global audience, said Dan Erikson at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank in Washington. "Fidel remains Cuba's most prominent international voice, even though his tools of communication are now contained to the written word," he said. How many in Cuba are still listening to the older Castro is uncertain, but 19-year-old medical student Maybel, who asked not to be fully identified, said she prefers Raul Castro because he talks less and is more straightforward. "There are less speeches and Raul says bread is bread and wine is wine," she said. But "we miss Fidel's style.
