 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad declared on Friday that his party was still with the AL-led 'grand alliance', which had never been dissolved. Speaking at Zia International Airport on his return from the UK, he also for a second time trashed the story that he had private talks with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina who was in London at the same time. Political parties who had at one time formed the so-called 'grand alliance', alongside the pre-existing AL-led 14-party alliance, have been in some confusion since about its continued existence. "I was always with the grand alliance and I am still with it," Ershad told reporters. "The alliance has not been dissolved." Ershad also asserted: "I did not have any meeting with Sheikh Hasina in London. It is nothing but rumour." BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar had earlier alleged that Ershad and Hasina had met in London, terming it the 'London conspiracy'. The JP chief went to London on July 17 to see the newborn baby of his adopted daughter Zebin. bdnews24.
