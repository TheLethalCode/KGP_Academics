<TEXT>
 Natore, July 25 (bdnews24.com) Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed said Friday the country cannot be saved without Khaleda Zia and her 'enlightened' Jamaati followers. "There are many pir-masayeks (Islamic scholars) in the four party alliance led by Khaleda. Without them there will be no peace in the country," said Mojaheed, speaking at a Jamaat rally at Natore District Council auditorium. Demanding Khaleda's immediate release, he said aiming his comment at the government: "You need not be afraid. When Khaleda Zia comes out she will not take revenge on you. She does not like the politics of vengeance." Alleging that the government was splitting parties in the name of reform the Jamaat leader said: "What do you know of reform. Learn reform from Jamaat-e-Islami. The democracy and accountability practised inside Jamaat is a lesson for all." Calling on officials of the Anticorruption Commission, Mojaheed said: "You have arrested a 'saint-like' man Motiur Rahman Nizami. Don't you feel ashamed? Nizami did not commit corruption involving one taka in life. He served the country after becoming minister." "The ACC was born only a few days back. You need not teach Jamaat how to check corruption and ensure accountability. ACC's age is like that of Jamaat's grandson." "Jamaat has internal accountability and democracy from long ago," he repeated. Warning against handing over primary education to the private sector, he said: "Through this step the government become got involved with the foreign conspiracy of destroying basic education in the country." Jamaat's Natore district ameer Prof Yunus Ali presided over the gathering. Party executive council president Mir Kashem Ali was also present. bdnews24.co
