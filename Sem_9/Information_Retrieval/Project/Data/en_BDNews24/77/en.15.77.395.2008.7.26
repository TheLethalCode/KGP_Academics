<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spinners Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis bowled Sri Lanka to an innings and 239-run victory in the first test against India on Saturday. It was India's worst defeat against Sri Lanka, who registered their biggest test win on home soil. Muralitharan and Mendis destroyed the tourists on a dry spinning pitch, bowling them out for 223 in the morning and then 138 in just 45 overs in the second innings after Sri Lanka forced the follow-on with India trailing by 377 runs. Muralitharan snared five for 84 from 29 overs in the first innings and then claimed a further six for 26 from 13 overs in the second innings. Mendis, an unorthodox finger spinner, claimed four for 72 from 27.5 overs in the first innings and another four for 60 in the second innings to finish with eight for 132 on his test debut. In the morning, the only resistance to Sri Lanka's spinners came from VVS Laxman, who batted patiently for his 56 off 118 deliveries and was the only Indian to pass 50 in the game. With the tourists on 159-6 overnight, Mendis struck early in the morning when Anil Kumble was trapped lbw for one. Muralitharan claimed his fifth wicket of the innings as Harbhajan Singh (9) edged on to his pad and was caught at short leg. Zaheer Khan (5) was pinned lbw with a quick delivery from Mendis. FINAL WICKET Last man Ishant Sharma (13 not out) helped Laxman add 35 for the final wicket but Mendis quickly wrapped up the innings after being reintroduced into the attack. In the second innings, Muralitharan needed just four balls to strike as Virender Sehwag (13) padded away a delivery from around the wicket. The initial appeal was turned down but Sri Lanka successfully challenged the decision, with third umpire Rudi Koertzen adjudging the ball had pitched in line with the stumps. Laxman was promoted up the order after his first innings fifty, but was trapped lbw for 21 soon after lunch. Sri Lanka won their second umpire review when Sachin Tendulkar (12) was given out caught at leg slip as he gloved an attempted sweep. India's problems quickly increased when Gautam Gambhir, who had battled hard for his 43, was brilliantly stumped by Prasanna Jayawardene. Saurav Ganguly (four) lasted just minutes before edging Muralitharan to a second slip. Then, in the final over before tea, Rahul Dravid (10) was given out caught at bat-pad off Mendis after a third successful umpire referral by Sri Lanka, television replays clearly indicating an inside edge. India's demise continued after the break as Dinesh Karthik (0) edged Muralitharan to slip and Anil Kumble (12) was bowled. Mendis finished the match with two wickets in an over, bowling Khan (3) and Singh (15). The second test at Galle starts on Thursday
