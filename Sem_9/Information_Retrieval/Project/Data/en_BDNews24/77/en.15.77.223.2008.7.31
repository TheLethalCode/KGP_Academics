<TEXT>
 GALLE, Sri Lanka, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Virender Sehwag's 15th test century steered India to 214 for four at the close of the first day of the second test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. The visitors made a flying start as they reached lunch on 151 for nought but Sri Lanka fought back well late in the day after rain had washed out the afternoon session. Spinner Ajantha Mendis and seamer Chaminda Vaas claimed two wickets apiece as India lost four for 11 at one stage. Sehwag finished unbeaten on 128 with VVS Laxman 13 not out. Sehwag's explosive innings, spanning 122 deliveries and including 19 fours and two sixes, was ably supported by 56 from Gautam Gambhir. The pair put on 167 for the first wicket after India won the toss. The new-ball bowlers, particularly Nuwan Kulasekara, frequently beat the bat but were unable to capitalise fully on the early moisture in the pitch. WIDE BALL Sri Lanka dropped Gambhir on 13 when he slashed at a wide ball and the dive of wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene distracted Kumar Sangakkara at first slip. Even when the home side turned to spin pair Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan, who shared 19 wickets in the first test, Sehwag continued to attack. He did however survive a fright before lunch when an edge flew past Mahela Jayawardene at first slip. The rain came at the right time for Sri Lanka, stalling India's progress for three and a half hours. When play resumed India were left with a tricky one hour session and Sri Lanka took advantage. Mendis pinned Gambhir lbw and had Rahul Dravid brilliantly caught for two at bat-pad by Malinda Warnapura. Vaas trapped Sachin Tendulkar lbw for five with an inswinger before Saurav Ganguly went for a duck when he edged Vaas low to Prasanna Jayawardene. Sri Lanka are 1-0 up in the three-match serie
