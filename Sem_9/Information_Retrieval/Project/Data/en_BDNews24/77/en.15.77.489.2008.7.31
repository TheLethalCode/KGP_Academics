Flintoff trapped Neil McKenzie lbw for 72 before Jacques Kallis (48 not out) and Ashwell Prince (24 not out) took the visitors close to England's first innings total of 231. Conditions were humid, overcast and good for bowling but the hosts offered too many boundary balls, with several going through the vacant slips. Flintoff became the 10th player to claim 200 test wickets and score 3,000 test runs, following the likes of Ian Botham, Garfield Sobers, Kapil Dev and Imran Khan. McKenzie had been dropped low to his right on 57 by second slip Paul Collingwood.

Nightwatchman Paul Harris (19), who shared a second-wicket stand of 77 with McKenzie, fell before lunch to a catch at third slip by Alastair Cook off the bowling of Ryan Sidebottom.
