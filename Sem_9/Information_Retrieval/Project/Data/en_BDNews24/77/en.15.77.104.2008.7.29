 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain expressed surprise on Tuesday at remarks of the communications adviser that the government was communicating with the party to bring it to dialogue. "The chairperson is currently behind bars. I am the secretary general of the party. No discussion was held between me and the government. the secretary general of the divided party told reporters at his NAM Flat residence. "Who were the government talking with?" "I don't know whether the government is holding discussions with the BNP faction that it formed," Delwar added humorously. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader was asked Monday about the government's initiative to bring BNP to dialogue. He said: "We are communicating with the BNP. The procedure has advanced also. We hope the dialogue session will take place soon." Expressing grievances Tuesday over the government's attitude over the release of Khaleda Zia, and sending her son Tarique Rahman abroad, he said: "The government is repeatedly saying that it is considering the release of the chairperson. We don't know when the process will come to an end. The demand has turned to a mass demand now." Delwar reiterated demands for holding parliamentary elections prior to all polls to overcome "the current crises". "It should ensure the participation of all political parties, including our party chief Khaleda Zia." "An elected government can resolve all problems," he said. "The government does not have the right to hold any other elections before the parliamentary elections in line with the constitution. The people want parliamentary elections." "But a conspiracy is going on to hold a stage-managed election from the behind the scenes. People will not accept this in any way," Delwar added. The BNP leader also alleged that the BNP office was closed illegally. He asked the government to reopen the party's Naya Paltan office. bdnew
