 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The Saudi Arabian government has deported 118 illegal immigrants from Bangladesh back home, an immigration official said Wednesday. "The 118 Bangladeshis returned by a Yemen Airlines flight Wednesday morning," immigration officer at Zia International Airport Rokonuzzaman told bdnews24.com. "They didn't have legal passports. Therefore, the Saudis have deported them back home," he said. According to one Saudi figure, about 1.8 million Bangladeshis live and work legally in Saudi Arabia. But newspapers here and in Saudi Arabia have long been publishing reports on illegal immigrants living and working in the desert kingdom. The reports have prompted the Saudi police to conduct raids, arrest illegal immigrants and detain them in jail and repatriation centres for their onward despatch home. bdnews24.com/k
