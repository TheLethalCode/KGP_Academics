 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  The UK will send observers to watch the four city corporation and nine municipal elections slated for August, the top British envoy has said. Stephen Evans, the UK High Commissioner in Dhaka, made the pledge to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed during a courtesy meeting on Sunday, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters. When the envoy asked whether the local elections would be held under the state of emergency, the chief adviser said the government was relaxing the state of emergency in phases. "The emergency would be relaxed wherever needed," Munaim quoted the CA as saying. A European delegation to monitor the local elections in August at the request of the Election Commission will include the UK observers, Munaim said. He added that Evans was all praises for the government completing the voter list with photographs in such short time. The UK High Commissioner also asked the chief adviser if the national elections would be held under the state of emergency. Fakhruddin said the emergency was being relaxed in phases in areas where the city corporation and municipal elections were to be held. "We are reviewing the matter. The state of emergency will be relaxed wherever it is necessary," the interim government head was quoted as telling the envoy. The chief adviser told the UK High Commissioner, "We have taken some reform measures in hand. It will strengthen the base of democracy in Bangladesh." Highlighting the government action to face the twin floods and cyclone Sidr last year, Fakhruddin said: "We have shown success in combating disaster in the short term. We need assistance to face the mid and long-term disaster caused by climate change." Evans assured Bangladesh of 50 million in assistance to combat losses caused by climatic change. Fakhruddin said Bangladesh was working to achieve the millennium development goals and that it will become a middle-income county in 15 years. He said the government was checking terrorism but everything was being done within the purview of law. "We are following the democratic heritage of the UK. After Japan the UK is the biggest donor state to Bangladesh. On the other hand the people of Bangladesh have been contributing in the UK economy and society," Fakhruddin said.
