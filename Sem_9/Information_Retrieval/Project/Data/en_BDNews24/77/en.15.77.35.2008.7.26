 LONDON, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United will sign Argentine Carlos Tevez for a British transfer record fee of 32 million pounds ($63.52 million), according to newspaper reports on Saturday. The 24-year-old forward, who joined United on an initial two-year loan deal from West Ham United a year ago, is expected to sign a permanent deal shortly. According to reports, United will pay the fee to Media Sports Investment (MSI), the company that owns the Argentina international's registration. United's chief executive David Gill, speaking in South Africa where the team are on tour, was quoted by newspapers as saying: "We have spoken to Carlos and see him as part of our long-term squad. "We have been pleased with his first season. He is a good age, a great player and well liked within the team. We know what we have to do and what we have to pay." Tevez scored 19 goals in 39 appearances for United as they won the Premier League and Champions League last season. The estimated 32-million pound fee for his signature would eclipse the 30.8 million pounds Chelsea spent to buy Andriy Shevchenko from AC Milan in July 2006. Tevez arrived at Old Trafford last year in a move from West Ham complicated by the fact that Iranian businessman Kai Joorabchian's MSI owned his registration
