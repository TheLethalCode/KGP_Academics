The new website address replaces the previous address (www.ukinbangladesh.org). The website contains essential information for those applying for or sponsoring visas for the UK and promises to help those seeking consular assistance and people looking for advice about UK-Bangladesh trade and investment opportunities. The website will carry news, features and announcements about the activities of the local British High Commission and its partner UK organisations such as the DFID and the British Council, the statement says. "The new web platform will also make information more accessible and user-friendly, thereby helping us achieve our aim of providing the best possible services to our visa, commercial and consular customers," the statement quoted British high commissioner Stephen Evans as saying. bdn
