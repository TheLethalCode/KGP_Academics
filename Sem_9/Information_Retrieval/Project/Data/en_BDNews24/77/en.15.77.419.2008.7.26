 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  A retired army officer has sued a grandson of the late speaker Humayun Rashid Choudhury and the son of a former IGP for an alleged attempt on the life of his son, police said Saturday. Nuher Latif Shami, son of retired lieutenant colonel Abdul Latif Khan and fashion designer Rina Latif, was admitted to hospital after he was "seriously injured" in assaults by the accused. Sub-inspector Jahangir Alam Mondol told bdnews24.com that Latif Khan had filed the case against four people with Gulshan Police Station. The late speaker's 30-year-old grandson Mishel Karim Khan, son of Iftekhar Karim Khan and Nasrin Karim, was one of the accused. The other accused are Shamsul Huda, son of former inspector general of police Ashraful Huda, Ehsan Abdullah, son of businessman Md Abdullah and Md Shahrier, who could not be identified with further details. Police made no immediate arrest. In case details, Latif Khan said the accused forced their way into his Baridhara home Friday, overpowering guards, when he and his son were asleep. The accused allegedly called Shami downstairs and beat him at will in a bid to "murder" him, according to the case. The attackers also beat the guards on resistance, Latif Khan alleged in the case. Shami was rushed to Apollo Hospitals in Bashundhara. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Latif Khan could not explain the reason for the assaults, but said: "I don't see any reason. They are not his friends but I think my son knows them." Mondol, the investigation officer of the case, refused to comment on the progress of the probe. bdnews
