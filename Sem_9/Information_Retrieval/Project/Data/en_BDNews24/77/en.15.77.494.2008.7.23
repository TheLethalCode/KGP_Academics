<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Wednesday that the caretaker government's refusal to lift the state of emergency was 'ill-motivated'. "No elections can take place amid the state of emergency," Delwar said at his NAM flat home. "The government must have an ill motive as it is not withdrawing the emergency despite the constant demand of political parties," told members of Zia Parishad who had just concluded a token hunger strike. "If the government had any good motive it would have withdrawn the emergency to create a congenial atmosphere for elections," the secretary general of the divided party said. Zia Parishad, a BNP front organisation, observed the strike from 10am to 2pm to press home a number of demands including the release of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, sending Tarique Rahman abroad for better medical treatment and lifting the state of emergency. Delwar reiterated the demand for holding parliamentary elections prior to any other polls. "Hold the national elections lifting the state of emergency," he said. The BNP leader also criticised the caretaker government's interest in a transit deal with the Indian government. "This unelected government does not have right to make any international treaty." "An elected government will decide whether it will make a treaty on the matter," Delwar said. bdnew
