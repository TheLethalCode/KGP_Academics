 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Steps will be taken if any wrongdoing is uncovered involving an allocation of government land in the name of the president's wife, an adviser said Wednesday after reports of irregularities in the allocation appeared in a national daily. Questioned by reporters after a meeting at the shipping ministry, law and land adviser AF Hassan Ariff: "I am not well aware of the matter. I will look into it." Asked whether the allocation would be cancelled, the adviser said:"We will take necessary steps if any irregularities are found there." A national daily reported Wednesday that a portion of Ramchandra canal, located in the capital's Mohammadpur area and shown as khas land, was allocated in the name of Anwara Begum, wife of president Iajudddin Ahmed, to establish a school. The report said that president Iajuddin Ahmed, two days after taking over as the chief adviser to the caretaker government in 2006, allocated the water body in the name of his wife who is president of British Columbia School. Earlier an application was submitted for the allotment in 2004 and the president's office sent a letter to the land ministry to take necessary arrangements in this regard. But the then prime minister Khaleda Zia cancelled the application. bdnew
