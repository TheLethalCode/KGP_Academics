 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a discussion asked the government Thursday to raise the number and salary of community school teachers. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, speaking at the meeting organised by the Community Primary Teachers Association, said the salaries of community school teachers should be raised on humanitarian grounds. Bangladesh Economic Association secretary Abul Barakat said the standard of primary education was gradually falling. "Primary education is the basic learning right of every human being," he said. Competitive pay must be offered to attract talented people to the profession, he stressed, calling on the government to double the present salary. "Progress will not be possible if talented people cannot be brought into primary education," he said, suggesting also that the number of community teachers should be twice what it was at present. Association president Md Habibul Ahsan Bablu pointed out there were some 9,819 teachers, employed in 3,778 community primary schools, who were paid only Tk 1,200 per month. "That means a teacher's daily pay is 40 taka," Bablu said, adding that the government's 20 percent dearness allowance for community school teachers still brings their daily income to only Tk 48. He asked the meeting whether it was possible to survive on the salary of a teacher. The association president placed five demands in the meeting, held at Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium. "If the demands are not met by July 31 teachers have vowed that they will not attend classes from August," he said. bdnews
