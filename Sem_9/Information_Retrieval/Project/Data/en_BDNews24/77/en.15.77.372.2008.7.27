 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshis may not require visas prior to visiting Malaysia in future as Kuala Lumpur has recently dropped Bangladesh from its 'blacklist', said foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Sunday. The citizens of Bangladesh irrespective of their status or profession could get visas on arrival at Malaysian airports. The Bangladesh mission in Kuala Lumpur has informed the expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry that Malaysia prepared a list of 27 countries, the citizens of which must need visas before leaving for Malaysia. Bangladesh is not on the list, meaning Bangladeshis will not require prior visas to visit Malaysia, the Bangladesh High Commission in Malaysia said. "It has been learnt that henceforth Bangladeshis can obtain on-arrival visas in Malaysia," Iftekhar, also in charge of the expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry, said in a statement Sunday. "The Malaysian authorities have reportedly drawn up a list of 27 countries, whose citizens will be required to obtain visas prior to their departure for Malaysia". "Bangladesh has been excluded from this list, whereas it includes many SAARC, Commonwealth, and African countries," the adviser said. Iftekhar also said all must be "careful so as not to be seen to misuse this unique gesture by the friendly Malaysian government". According to a government estimate until June 30, 3.01 lakh Bangladeshis, mainly migrant workers, have been living in Malaysia since 1978. If the migrant workers from Bangladesh are exempted from the visa requirement, it will reduce labour exploitation by the recruiting agencies, many believe. The recruiting agencies and their collaborators in Malaysia sell visas to the poor and illiterate Bangladeshis and exploit them financially. Malaysia in 2006 banned the intake of workers from Bangladesh. On October 22, 2006, the Malaysian government withdrew the ban, only to slap it again on December 31, 2008. In line with a previous clearance, 80,000 Bangladeshis can still go to Malaysia for work. In 2007, expatriate Bangladeshis sent $19.61 million in remittances through official channels. bdn
