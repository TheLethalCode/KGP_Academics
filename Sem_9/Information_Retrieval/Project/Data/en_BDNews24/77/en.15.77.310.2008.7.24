 NEW DELHI, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to keep September's Champions Trophy in Pakistan despite security concerns, it said on Thursday. "The ICC board's teleconference on the location of this year's Champions Trophy has concluded. The decision is that the event remains in Pakistan," said an ICC news release. The decision was taken after Australia, England and New Zealand led calls for a switch over player safety after bomb attacks in Pakistan over the past several months. "The ICC has decided to appoint a special task force which will visit Pakistan and ensure all the security requirements and recommendations made by the ICC security consultants are implemented for the tournament," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf told a news conference. The eight-team tournament will be held from Sept. 11-28 with Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi scheduled to stage games. SECURITY CONCERNS The ICC called the teleconference after a deadlock last Sunday when its security consultants briefed representatives of the participating boards, the international players' association (FICA) and the official broadcasters. Although the ICC security experts were satisfied with the PCB's arrangements at this month's Asia Cup final in Karachi, they said concerns were raised at the briefing over the threat potential beyond the security plans. Pakistan has been hit by a series of suicide bombings this year and Australia postponed their planned tour of the country in March because of fears over the safety of their players. While the situation had eased since February's general election, eight people were killed in an attack in the capital Islamabad on the night of the Asia Cup final. But Ashraf said India had strongly backed Pakistan and in the end it was a consensus decision to keep the event there. "I am really thankful to the Indian cricket board for extending us a lot of support in convincing everyone that the tournament should be held in Pakistan," added Ashraf. "We are confident of hosting a successful event and we will make sure we have the best security arrangements for the event, which would be monitored by the special task force." Ashraf said he was grateful to all the ICC members for understanding Pakistan's position and cooperating with the PC
