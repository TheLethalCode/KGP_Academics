<TITLE> Obama in Berlin for big outdoor speech </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN Thu Jul 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, on a foreign tour he hopes will boost his election chances, on Thursday gives an outdoor speech in Berlin on transatlantic ties that is likely to draw thousands. Obama, who arrived on Thursday morning, will give the evening speech, which the German press is comparing to former President John F. Kennedy's 1963 "Ich bin ein Berliner" address, at the "Victory Column" in Berlin's central Tiergarten park. Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he was due to meet, opposed his campaign's initial plan to hold the speech at the Brandenburg Gate, a historic landmark she says is more appropriate for presidents rather than presidential hopefuls. The address is the only public speech of a week-long foreign tour that is taking place against the backdrop of a fiercely fought US election campaign. "Hopefully (the speech) will be viewed as a substantive articulation of the relationship I'd like to see between the United States and Europe," Obama told reporters in Israel before leaving for Germany. "I'm hoping to communicate across the Atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it." Relations between the United States and Germany reached a post-war low under Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder, who strongly opposed the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. But the conservative Merkel, who grew up behind the Wall in the communist East, has worked hard to repair ties and emerged as one of President George W Bush's closest allies in Europe
