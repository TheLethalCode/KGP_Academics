 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  An early strike from Mejbabur Rahman Manik helped Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan record a long-goal win over the Bangladesh Police in the qualifying match of the Citycell Federation Cup Sunday. Manik at the top of the box took a powerful shot that found the upper net of the far post in the very fifth minute in front of almost empty Army Stadium in Banani.

One minute later, the referee awarded Police a penalty shot when opponent defender Mustafijur Rahman brought Wasim down in the danger zone, but Mofizur Rahman sent the ball over the crossbar to disappoint the Police men.
