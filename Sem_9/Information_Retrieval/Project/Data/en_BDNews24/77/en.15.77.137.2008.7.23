 HOUSTON, Wed Jul 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Dolly strengthened on Wednesday as it churned toward southern Texas, and was expected to lash low-lying areas on the US-Mexico border with torrential rains when it comes ashore around mid-day. Dolly, the second hurricane of 2008 Atlantic storm season, gathered strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, with sustained winds reaching nearly 85 miles per hour (140 km per hour). Dolly is currently a Category 1 hurricane - the weakest on the rating scale - but could strengthen to Category 2 with winds over 96 mph (154 kph) before it hits land, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The NHC has issued a hurricane warning for the southern Texas coast as far north as Corpus Christi. At 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT), Dolly was about 55 miles east of the border town of Brownsville, Texas, where it was due to come ashore by mid-day. The storm was moving at about 8 mph (13 kph). The storm's predicted landfall and strength were unlikely to jeopardize sensitive offshore drilling rigs and production platforms in the U.S. and Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. crude oil prices hit 6-month lows on Tuesday and fell further on Wednesday to below $126 a barrel. The NHC has said Dolly could dump 15 inches of rain on South Texas and northeastern Mexico in coming days. Officials in low-lying South Texas counties worried that torrential rains could overcome levees holding back the Rio Grande River and cause flooding. In Cameron County near the Mexico border, officials expect up to 20 inches of rain. "That's going to do a number on our county," said Johnny Cavazos, the county's emergency management coordinator. Levees holding back the Rio Grande could be breached if Dolly drives a surge of water from the river's mouth inland, Cavazos said. The levees held under similar conditions during Hurricane Beulah in 1967, but they have "seriously deteriorated" since then, he said. The United States has largely escaped the past two Atlantic hurricane seasons, with just one hurricane -- Humberto in November 2007 -- making landfall on its coasts. But it was pummeled in 2004 and 2005, when a series of powerful hurricanes, including the catastrophic Katrina, ravaged Florida and the U.S. Gulf Coast. AHEAD OF SCHEDULE The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season is already a month ahead of schedule. On average, the fourth tropical storm of the six-month season does not occur until August 29. Dolly, this year's fourth, formed on July 20. "I definitely think that the activity we have seen so far this year is a harbinger of things to come," said Jeff Masters, co-founder of meteorological Web site The Weatherunderground. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry put 1,200 National Guard troops on alert and issued a disaster declaration for 14 low-lying counties in the southern part of the state, although no mandatory evacuations were ordered. Some 250 buses stood by in the inland city of San Antonio to evacuate coastal residents if needed. In the Mexican city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, authorities evacuated 23,000 people and urged residents to seek temporary shelter
