<TITLE> Navy chief backs 'non-lethal weapons' in conflict, peace-keeping </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  The concept of using non-lethal weapons is increasingly gaining popularity in both military forces and civil law enforcing agencies, navy chief vice admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizami said Thursday. He was attending the closing ceremony of a three-day long 'Non-lethal weapons executive seminar', jointly organised by the Bangladesh Navy and US Marine Corps Pacific Force, held at Radisson Garden Hotel Thursday, the Inter Service Public Relations department said in a statement. The aim of the seminar was to promote the use of non-lethal weapons to minimise loss of lives and damage to infrastructure as well as seeking new ways to handle unrest to prevent or stop human rights violation during any peace keeping operation. "Human casualties resulting from military operations are not generally acceptable to society," the navy chief said. Non-lethal weapons will be the best choice in combating conflict in the near future, he added. Twelve other Pacific regional countries also took part in the seminar, to improve the ability of their armed forces and other security enforcing agencies to conduct humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and peace keeping missions. .bd
