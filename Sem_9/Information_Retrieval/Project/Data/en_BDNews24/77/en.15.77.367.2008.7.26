 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Jatrabari Krira Chakra thrashed 10-man Diganta Prasari of Rajshahi 2-0 in the inaugural qualifier of the Citycell Federation Cup Saturday. Shariful Islam and Sohel Rana struck one goal apiece in the 66th and 80th minutes respectively after Diganta were reduced to 10 men two minutes into the second half. It was the first competitive match on the fine-looking pitch at Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) since the inaugural B. League concluded on August 1 last year, and the first Federation Cup match after the last edition meet was held in 2005. However, the BNS hosted a few exhibitions matches in between those times. "I am overall satisfied considering the enthusiasm among the spectators, players and organisers and the ball rolled into field after a long gap," said BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi, who declared the 11-team qualifying round open. Murshedi hoped the football fans would turn up in the stadium when the final round having giants Mohammedan, Abahani, Brothers got underway and that they would take extra initiative to take the spectators to the big bowl. Diganta, the lone team outside the capital in the qualifying round, initially showed some sign of putting up a challenge against the senior division team, Jatrabari, with creating a good opportunity in the very seventh minute. But, it saw an Adnaian Koraishi header just go over the crossbar to frustrate the Rajshahi players before their striker Alam was denied by Jatrabiar goalkeeper Babul Vaskar just before the breather. However, Jatrabari's Yasin came close to giving his side a lead, but his left-footer went outside kissing Diganta's crossbar in the 39th minute. Diganta were reduced to 10 men soon after the lemon break as referee Azad Rahman gave the marching order to defender Jahangir Alam for his rough tackle two minutes into the second half. With one player less, it was not possible for Diganta to defend themselves and Jatrabari got the dividend through some effective attacks. Shariful shrugging off defender Manyem Joaddar inside the box placed the ball to the far post to give Jatrabari a 66-minute lead, and four minutes later, the little striker was denied by Vaskar, who saved it at the cost of corner. After having squandered four chances on either sides of the break, Sohel sealed the match in the 80th minute with slotting the ball home from a handshaking distance after Shariful's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Vaskar.
