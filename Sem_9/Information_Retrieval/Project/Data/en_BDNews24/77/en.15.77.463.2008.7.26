 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman has said the government does not have any achievement other than putting people behind bars. "The government failed to prove successful in any sector. It does not have any success other than arresting people," Zillur said Saturday in a meeting of Bangladesh Awami Ainjibi Parishad at the Supreme Court Bar auditorium. Criticising the soaring prices of commodities, the AL leader said: "This is the highest commodity price I have ever seen in my life." "It seems it's a country without government." "The situation is not so bad that it requires a state of emergency for Bangladesh," Zillur said. The AL leader said his party would not let any election take place prior to national polls amid the state of emergency. Other parties including BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Communist Party of Bangladesh echoed the AL, Zillur said. The acting AL chief repeated his demand for withdrawal of the state of emergency and an immediate schedule of national elections. He asked people to vote for AL candidates in the upcoming city corporation and municipality polls. bdnews
