 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Gazipur will host seven qualifying matches of the Citycell Federation Cup with Bangladesh Army taking on Sunrise Sporting Club in the venue opener on July 28. The qualifying opener will be held at Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) on July 26 while Bangladesh Army Stadium in Dhaka will host the rest of six qualifying matches, according to a fixture released by the tournament committee Wednesday. "We have decided to take the qualifying matches outside Dhaka in a bid to keep the pitch of the BNS fit for the final round," said Fazlur Rahman Babul, chairman of the bylaws, fixture, accreditation and draw committee of the Federation Cup. "We had a plan to take a few matches of the Federation Cup to Narsinghdi, but the venue has been shifted to Gazipur following the unavailability of Narsingdhi Stadium," Five teams from the qualifying round will join 11 clubs of the B. League in the finals. Babul told reporters that a draw for the 16-team finals would be held on August 5 and the finals might get underway from August 8 or 9 , depending on whether the federation would like to halt the finals before the end of the Beijing Olympic. Though the venues in Dhaka will remain open to spectators, football lovers have to buy tickets to watch the matches in Gazipur, said Babul.
