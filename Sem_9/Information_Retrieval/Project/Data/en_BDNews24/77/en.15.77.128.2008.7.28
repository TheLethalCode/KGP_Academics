<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) Sunrise Sporting Club handed a 2-1 defeat to Bangladesh Army while Bangladesh Navy held Dhaka Wanderers Club to a goalless draw in the qualifying matches of the Citycell Federation Cup Monday. Liton and Iman Babu scored for the senior division runners-up Sunrise while Delwar netted the lone goal for Bangladesh Army at the Shaheed Barkat Stadium in Gazipur. Approximately 7,000 spectators turned up in the stadium, but the inaugural match at Gazipur venue hardly impressed the local football fans, who mostly supported the Sunrise SC. The armymen were physically ahead, compared with the Sunrise players, but they failed to capitalise on the advantage and the first half ended in a goalless draw. After the lemon break, Liton gave Sunrise a lead in the 59th minute as he did not mistake to send a Raju's cross to the net with a fine grounder while Iman Babu doubled the lead in the 74th minute converting a penalty shot. Referee Azad Rahman awarded the penalty shot to Sunrise when the Army goalkeeper fouled Iman dangerously inside the box in one-on-one situation. Iman converted the penalty. Delwar headed a corner kick home in the 78th minute, but it could not salvage Bangladesh Army from defeat in their Group C opener. At Army Stadium in Banani, Bangladesh Navy and Dhaka Wanderers Club shared points after playing a goalless draw in Group B opener. bdnew
