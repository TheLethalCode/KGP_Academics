 BEIJING, Thu Jul 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ranks of Chinese paramilitary police swore to prevent terrorist attacks or `political incidents' disrupting the Beijing Olympics in a show of force at the Games' main stadium, a state newspaper reported on Thursday. The People's Armed Police (PAP) is a key force China has deployed to maintain control during the next month's Games, and at a rally on Wednesday its troops were reminded that the country's Communist Party leaders regard security threats as a paramount concern. PAP commander Yu Linxiang told the troops to "fight well in the offensive battle for Olympic security", the People's Armed Police News reported. With China's efforts to show itself as a friendly, stable power under an intense international gaze during the Games, Meng Jianzhu, the Minister of Public Security and also a senior PAP officer, said the troops should be prepared to respond to "complex situations" in a "transparent environment". He told the troops they must "resolutely prevent major incidents of violence and terrorism, resolutely prevent major political incidents affecting state security and social stability, and resolutely prevent large-scale mass incidents." "Mass incidents" is an official Chinese euphemism for riots, demonstrations and protests. The PAP newspaper showed rows of saluting troops in front of the Bird's Nest stadium, where the Olympics will open on Aug 8. The fiery warnings were made on the same day that other officials said three parks around Beijing would be designated sites for any approved protests during the Games. Overseas groups critical of Chinese policy on Tibet, Darfur and other issues have sought to use the Games to pressure China. But wary authorities virtually never grant approval for protests. Security has long been a concern at Olympic Games since 11 Israelis died in Munich in 1972 after Palestinian gunmen took them hostage and German authorities botched a rescue attempt. The PAP paper said Beijing was the target of many conspiracies. "Western anti-China forces are striving for opportunities to disrupt the Games," stated an editorial in the paper. "International terrorist forces are itching to strike with terror attacks against the Beijing Games, and hostile domestic forces' disruption and sabotage activities against the Games are steadily unfolding." Chinese officials have said their main Games security worries focused on separatist militants seeking an independent Uighur homeland in the country's far west Xinjiang region and campaigners for an independent Tibet. Human rights critics say China has grossly exaggerated the security threats from Uighurs and Tibetans to justify harsh control in those regions
