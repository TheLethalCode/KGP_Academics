 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) - Some 84 people have been afflicted with the dengue virus in the first 27 days of July, Dhaka City Corporation chief executive officer Md Alauddin said Monday. Of them, 54 got admitted to hospital. The number of the affected people reached 106 this year. "There have not been fatalities this year," Alauddin said at a discussion on dengue and public awareness, held at the DCC auditorium. Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka presided over the discussion, which focused on how to raise public awareness to prevent attacks of dengue. Novelist Imdadul Haq Milon who also attended the discussion underscored the broadcast of documentary films on TV channels to raise public awareness. Dr Zafarullah Chowdhury of Ganosasthya Kendro said: "Dengue is caused by lack of cleanliness. So, there should be punishment to those who keep garbage inside their houses." The Dhaka mayor said: "We have achieved some success in controlling dengue compared to previous years. No one died of dengue last year. Still there are mosquitoes in Dhaka city, but dengue is not so rampant." According to the DCC, 6104 were affected by dengue in 2002 in the city and 58 of them died. In 2007, 605 people were affected, with no fatalities. Khoka urged the government to take up a coordinated central programme to check mosquitoes and said the DCC lacked adequate manpower. "It has 7,500 workers for cleanliness against a requirement for 20,000, and 250 vehicles against the need of 800," he added. bdnew
