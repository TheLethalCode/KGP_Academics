 HONG KONG,July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways said mid-air damage suffered by a Boeing 747-400 aircraft with 363 passengers on board involved an air-conditioning vent but there was no danger. The plane was on a flight on Tuesday from New York to Hong Kong via the western Canadian city of Vancouver. "After landing (in Vancouver), it was found that one of the air-conditioning access panels had detached from the aircraft," the company said in a statement. "There was also some minor damage to other parts of the fuselage. "The fiberglass skin panel is a secondary structure which has nothing to do with structural integrity. The event had no impact on the operation of the aircraft." A Qantas Airways Ltd Boeing 747-400 was forced to make an emergency landing last week in the Philippines after it suffered a hole in its fuselage during a flight from Hong Kong to Australia
