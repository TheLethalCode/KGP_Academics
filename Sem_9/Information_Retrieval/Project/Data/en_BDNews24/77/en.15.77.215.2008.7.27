 PHNOM PENH, Sun Jul 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The ruling Cambodian People's Party said it had won Sunday's election as expected, with nearly two-thirds of seats in the 123 member parliament, party spokesman Khieu Kanharith told Reuters. Yim Sovann, an MP from the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, said preliminary results suggested the SRP had taken 40 seats. Full results are not expected until Monday evening. Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) seized on the dispute about the Preah Vihear ruins, which sit on a jungle-clad escarpment separating the two Southeast Asian countries. However, the dispatching of troops to the border by Hun Sen, a one-eyed, 57-year-old ex-Khmer Rouge guerrilla and prime minister of the past 23 years, has made his victory much more certain. As well as Hun Sen's argument that he has brought peace and stability after decades of Cold War upheaval and the ravages of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the CPP has presided over an economy that has enjoyed five years of near double-digit growth. Another sign of the improving lot of the country's 14 million people is a fall in the level of political violence, although human rights groups say four CPP and two SRP activists, including a journalist, were murdered in the month before polling. Voting passed off without major incident, but the SRP said tens of thousands of people in Phnom Penh, where its support is strongest, had found their names had been left off voter lists. TEMPLE TALKS The CPP is so confident of victory it has scheduled talks over Preah Vihear with Thailand's foreign minister in the tourist town of Siem Reap, home to Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat temple complex, on Monday. The meeting is not expected to make major headway in resolving the dispute, which is mainly over 1.8 square miles of scrubland near the temple. The ruins themselves are claimed by both countries but were awarded to Cambodia in 1962 by the International Court of Justice, a ruling that has rankled in Thailand ever since. Analysts say Thai domestic politics are mainly to blame for the row, which flared up after Cambodia's successful bid to have the ruins listed as a World Heritage site. Bangkok's initial support for the heritage listing was seized on by anti-government groups in their long-running attempt to unseat the government of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej. His foreign minister was forced to resign over the issue. There have been no major incidents so far, but both sides have sent troops and artillery to dig in near the temple and nearby Thai border villages are braced for conflict
