 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)--The UK has reset the minimum age requirement for obtaining marriage visas to prevent forced marriages involving British nationals. According to the new visa guidelines, men and women must be at least 21 years of age instead of the previous 18 years to get marriage visas. The UK Home Office announced the new guidelines Wednesday and the British High Commission in Dhaka has confirmed the news Thursday. The UK government reset the age requirement as it found that 30 percent of the cases dealt with by the UK government's Forced Marriage Unit involved victims aged between 18 and 21. "Forced marriage leads to victims suffering years of physical and mental abuse andin extreme casesunlawful imprisonment and rape." "It has no place in our society," said UK home secretary Jacqui Smith, who visited Bangladesh in April, in a statement issued by the British High Commission. "That is why we are raising the age limit for visas, checking anyone entering into a marriage does so of their own free will, and demanding that those coming to the UK learn English," she said. As per the new guidelines, the boys and girls coming to the UK make an agreement with their potential partners on learning English before they come to Britain. Again, the British nationals will also be required to register "intention to marry overseas" before leaving the UK, the new guidelines say. The Forced Marriage Unit of the British government handles approximately 5,000 enquiries and 400 cases a year concerning young British nationals at risk of being forced into marriage overseas, the high commission says. In 2007, the Forced Marriage Unit dealt with 215 cases of overseas forced marriage, according to the high commission. bdn
