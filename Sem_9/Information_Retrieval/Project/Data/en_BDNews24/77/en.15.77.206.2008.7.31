 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Kader fell ill Thursday during a court hearing of a bribery case, his lawyer said. The former state minister was taken to the Special Judge's Court-10 from the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital around 10am, Kader's lawyer Kazi Mohammad Nazibullah Hiru told bdnews24.com. Hiru said his client lost consciousness after he began vomiting in court and was laid down on the floor. Kader was sent back to BSMMU Hospital on the order of the judge, the lawyer said. Judge Md Sirajul Islam set Aug 4 for the next hearing as judge AKM Arifur Rahman of the Special Court-10 was not present on Thursday. AL legal affairs secretary, advocate Sahara Khatun told bdnews24.com that Kader, who had been sick for a long time, was being "dragged to court everyday". "It is very unfortunate," Sahara said. "He told me that his right side was becoming paralysed, but he had not been given any treatment for the past one week," she added. Sahara requested authorities to make proper arrangements for the AL leader. Kader has been carrying 41 pieces of shrapnel in his body since the August 21, 2004, grenade attack on an Awami League rally, Hiru said. "Apart from that he recently underwent surgery." Kader's mother applied to the chief adviser on July 2 to free her son on parole for proper medical treatment, but no step had been taken yet, the lawyer said. bdnew
