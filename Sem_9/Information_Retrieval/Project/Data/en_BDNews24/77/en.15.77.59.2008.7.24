<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has asked the government to amend the Representation of People Order 1972 instead of abolishing it, election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said Thursday. The election commissioner said his office had recommended that the provisions on electoral reforms in the Representation of People Ordinance 2008 be included in the RPO 1972. "Political parties want the RPO 1972 to be amended, not to be abolished," Sohul told reporters after an Election Commission meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda led the EC team to the meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The cabinet on July 13 approved in principle the Representation of People Ordinance 2008 to abolish the RPO 1972 which was strongly opposed by political parties. Sohul said the government had already sent necessary instructions to the law ministry which would take 10 days to complete the task. The EC asked the CA to take quick steps to help accomplish many important tasks such as registration of political parties. The EC started election-reform work in February last year and held formal talks with civil society members and political parties. The Representation of People Ordinance 2008 was designed in line with the reform talks. Asked if they discussed any plan to relax the state of emergency with the CA, Sohul said the EC apprised the CA of its preparation to hold local government and national polls. He said the polls to Dhaka City Corporation would be held in October. bdnews
