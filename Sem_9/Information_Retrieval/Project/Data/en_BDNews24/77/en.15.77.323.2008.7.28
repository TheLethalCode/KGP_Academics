 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday granted bail to the former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, BNP standing committee member M Shamsul Islam, Awami League leader engineer Mosharraf Hossain, former Chhatradal president and BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu and late BNP veteran Akbar Hossain's son Ismail Hossain Simon. Of the above, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam and Ismail Hossain Simon were each granted two months' bail in Gatco graft case. The court also ordered that the case proceedings against them be halted for the same period. The court at the same time ruled the government to explain why the case should not be scrapped. A two-member HC bench comprising justices Sharifuddin Chakladar and Md Imdadul Haque gave the bail order considering the three writ appeals submitted by Mannan Bhuiyan, Shamsul Islam and Simon. The same two-member HC bench granted two months' bail to former Awami League leader and minister engineer Mosharraf Hossain in two other graft cases filed on charges of acquiring illegal assets and plot allotment anomalies. Two other accused in the Gatco caseMotiur Rahman Nizami, Amir, Jama'at-e-Islami and BNP stalwart MK Anwar have already won bail in the case. A total 24 people were made accused in the case. After the HC ruling, barrister Fahimul Haque, lawyer of Mannan Bhuiyan and M Shamsul Islam told reporters that his clients might as well be freed as there were no other cases against them. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on May 18 ordered the two former ministers to jail after they had turned themselves in. Joint forces arrested former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco with ties to the case. Coco is currently on bail, seeking better medical treatment in Bangkok. Gatco Case: The ACC filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 people alleging that Gatco's contract to run the container depot at Chittagong Port was illegal. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. The case record shows that a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor for the container depots at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur railway station. The accused awarded the tender to Gatco although the company failed to meet all the tender conditions. It is also alleged that the government incurred more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses because of the Gatco deal. bdne
