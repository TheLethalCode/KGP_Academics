<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Tue Jul 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, said she sees herself as akin to former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in an interview with a US magazine released on Monday. The former supermodel-turned-pop singer said she welcomes comparisons to Onassis, who is remembered for the stylish elegance she brought to the White House in the early 1960s during the presidency of her husband, John F. Kennedy. "She was so young and modern, and of course unconsciously I would project myself more like Jackie Kennedy than, for instance, Madame de Gaulle, who would be much more like the classical French woman behind her husband," Bruni said in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine. Bruni, 40, married French President Nicolas Sarkozy in February amid a flood of publicity after a whirlwind three-month romance that started one month after Sarkozy, 53, divorced his second wife, Cecilia. "My mistake is that I fell madly in love and did not take the measure of how enormous this was going to be," Bruni said. Bruni also said Sarkozy does not mind pictures of her in the nude that were taken during her modeling days. "I never realized how many nude pictures I did before I met Nicolas," she said. Bruni, an Italian-born naturalized French citizen, also opened up about her past relationships with British rockers Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton. "It's not that I had a lot of lovers," she said. "It's that I never hide them." Bruni released her third album on July 11, her first release as France's first lady, which shot to the top of the charts in its first full week on sale. The interview in the September issue of the magazine hits newsstands in New York and Los Angeles on July 30 and around the United States on August 5
