 Geneva, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India still hopes make-or-break talks at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to salvage a global trade pact will make progress even though it disagreed with last week's compromise, Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said on Monday. "I'm still hoping we will see some movement. I'm still optimistic," Nath told reporters after a meeting of ministers from seven key WTO players. Nath said he had been hoping for progress on issues such as farm subsidies and the special safeguard mechanism -- a measure to help developing countries ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products.
