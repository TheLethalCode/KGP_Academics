 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu Monday urged the government to hold national and local government elections simultaneously or the local polls a few days after the national elections. "People will not accept local elections ahead of the national polls," Amu said speaking as special guest at the seventh founding anniversary of Textile Engineers Association at the Diploma Engineers Institute auditorium. In his speech, acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman promised to uplift Textile College to a full-fledged university if his party went to power. Amu warned that the upazila electionsif held before the national electionwould destabilise the country. The AL leader urged the government not to hold upazila elections in October.

There must be no election under the state of emergency." "People don't want upazila elections to take place before national elections." bdnews
