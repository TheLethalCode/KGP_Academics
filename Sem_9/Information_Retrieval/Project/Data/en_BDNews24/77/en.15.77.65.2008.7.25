<TITLE> Confusion reigns over 'grand alliance' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman said AL is thinking of forming an alliance with Jatiya Party ahead of polls, but expressed dissent with JP chief HM Ershad on Friday by saying the AL-led 'grand alliance' did not exist anymore. Ershad had declared earlier Friday that his party was still with the 'grand alliance', which had never been dissolved. Political parties, who had at one time formed the so-called 'grand alliance', outside the pre-existing 14-party alliance, have since been in some confusion about its continued existence. "I was always with the grand alliance and I am still with it," Ershad told reporters. "The alliance has not been dissolved." Zillur Rahman, however, told bdnews24.com when asked about Ershad's statement: "There is nothing called the grand alliance. It has no existence." "But we are thinking of forming an alliance with Jatiya Party to take part in the upcoming elections together," the AL leader said. bdnews2
