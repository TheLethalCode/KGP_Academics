 WELLINGTON, Jul 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A group of New Zealand students has come up with a novel way of protesting against a visit by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, offering a cash reward for her `arrest' over US actions in Iraq. The Auckland University Students' Association has offered NZ$5,000 ($3,700) for any student making a citizen's arrest of Rice during her 36-hour stay that starts later on Friday. "It's primarily symbolic, but it's a protest against her actions as secretary of state in Iraq and the authorization of the torture of suspected terrorist detainees," said the student body's president, David Do. Police said the stunt was disturbing, and warned no-one would be allowed to disrupt the visit. "We are obliged to ensure the safety and security of the visiting guest and we will not shirk from that task," said District Commander Superintendent Brett England in a statement. Rice will meet New Zealand political leaders on her way back to the United States after attending this week's Asean Regional Forum in Singapor
