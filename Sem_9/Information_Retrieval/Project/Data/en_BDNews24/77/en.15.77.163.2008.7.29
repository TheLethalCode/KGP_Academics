 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  The finals of the Citycell Federation Cup will start in the first week of August at Bangabandhu National Stadium, said a Bangladesh Football Federation official Tuesday. "We are considering starting the final round of the Federation Cup on August 6 and a draw for the teams on Aug 3," said BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi after the B. League meeting at the BFF House. "We had a plan to take the finals after the completion of the Beijing Olympic, but we have changed our mind as the late beginning could hamper the start of the B. League," said Murshedi, who is also chairman of the B. League committee. The former footballer also said that BFF president Kazi Salahuddin would declare the finals open with a mini inaugural programme taking place on the day. Murshedi also hinted that there was a chance to defer the B. League, which is originally scheduled for the last week of August. Five teams from the 11-team qualifying round will join 11 B. League teams in the 16-team finals of the Citycell Federation Cup, and 16 teams, split into four groups, will play the round-robin league basis matches. Later, the top team from each of four groups vie for the semifinals.
