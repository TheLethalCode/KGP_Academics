 LONDON, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea can win the four competitions they will be taking part in next season, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said. Captain John Terry, with Scolari on the Premier League club's tour of Asia, said he had put his dramatic Champions League final penalty miss behind him. "There's no point in dwelling on it any more," Terry said of the failed spot-kick which allowed Manchester United to beat Chelsea in the final in Moscow and deny them their first European Cup. "It's down to me to drive this team forward again and push to get back to where we were," the England defender told British newspapers in Kuala Lumpur. Scolari believes the London club have the players to win the Premier League, two domestic cups and European Champions League. "We are in four competitions this season and I will try to win all four and the players will do the same," Scolari said. "It's very difficult but you know we have the team to do thisChelsea have given to me everything that I want," the Brazilian said before his team were due to play a Malaysian Select XI. "The players have confidence, they reached two finals and the last game of the Premier League last season (with the chance of the championship).
