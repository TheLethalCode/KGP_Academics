 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday sentenced Awami League presidium member Kazi Jafrullah to two years for failing to submit a wealth statement on time to the Anticorruption Commission. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Judge's Court-5, on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex, handed down the sentence, to be effective from the day of Jafrullah's arrest or surrender. The ACC filed the case on March 19 with Gulshan Police Station for non-submission of wealth accounts after receiving a notice from the graft watchdog. Jafrullah was arrested under the emergency powers rules on April 23. The AL leader has been fugitive in the case since he was awarded bail by the High Court the same day. bdnew
