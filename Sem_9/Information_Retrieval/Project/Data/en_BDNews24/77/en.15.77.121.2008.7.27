<TITLE> No more debate over Khaleda: Hossain Zillur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  Education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Sunday he would rather not debate such issues as former prime minister Khaleda Zia's freedom. Asked what conditions the government may impose on Khaleda in exchange for her release, as BNP leader MK Anwar had indicated, the adviser said: "To me, the end results are the most important, not any debate." "We'd like to see some fruitful decisions made through the dialogue by working cohesively." The dialogue process has been suspended after 29 'successful' sessions, Zillur said, adding that the next regional dialogues would be held at Rajshahi and Shahzadpore of Serajganj on July 30, which the chief adviser will attend. The dialogue process will resume after those meetings and their timetables will be publicised, Zillur said. bdnew
