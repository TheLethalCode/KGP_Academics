 THE HAGUE, July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic arrived in the Netherlands on Wednesday to face trial at a U.N. tribunal on charges of genocide for his actions in the 1992-95 Bosnia war. A Reuters television correspondent saw the plane carrying Karadzic land at Rotterdam airport. War crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic left the Serbian capital escorted by masked officials from the Serbian secret service at around 4 am on Wednesday, to board a plane for the Netherlands. The government said the extradition had been approved by the Justice Ministry and the Belgrade district court. The former leader of the Bosnian Serbs faces two charges of genocide for the 43-month siege of Sarajevo and the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. He was arrested last week after 11 years on the run, most recently living under an assumed name as a bearded, long-haired alternative healer. On Tuesday, some 10,000 hardline nationalists, many brought by bus from rural nationalist strongholds, showed their support for him in downtown Belgrade, chanting his name and holding up giant banners with his picture. Clashes broke out when several dozen youths linked to hooligan groups threw flares, stones and garbage cans at riot police. Some 45 people, most of them policemen, were wounded. Karadzic is expected to be held at a detention centre near The Hague and then appear at the tribunal soon afterwards.
