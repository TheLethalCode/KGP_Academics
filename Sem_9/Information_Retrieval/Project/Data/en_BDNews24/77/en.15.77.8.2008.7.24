<TITLE> G7 outlook takes another punch from credit crunch </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The economic outlook for the world's richest nations has taken another punch from a year-long credit crisis which has pummeled financial markets in recent weeks while inflation accelerates, a Reuters poll showed. While US growth fared better in the first half of the year than many people had forecast a few months ago, economists are taking a hatchet to next year's numbers and now predict interest rates will hold steady instead of rising imminently from 2.0 percent. That wait-and-see attitude holds for most rate-setters across the G7, which comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. "Central banks are on an extraordinary tightrope between staving off recession and containing inflation," said Stephen Pope, economist at broker Cantor Fitzgerald in London. The poll of around 250 economists was taken July 16-23, after US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced steps to shore up struggling mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a plan that has calmed stock markets for the time being. The poll also followed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's sobering testimony last week. The poll found US rates are set to remain on hold until end-March 2009 but should end next year one percentage point higher, at 3.0 percent. While growth prospects are falling away sharply for Britain, and dimming in Germany, Italy and Japan, economists are not optimistic either that inflation will soon be tamed in the G7. Economists raised their 2008 US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecasts to a median 1.3 percent, annualized, from 1.1 percent predicted last. But they slashed the 2009 consensus by 0.5 percentage point to 1.8 percent. That was the biggest downgrade to a full-year US GDP figure since the credit crunch began last August and there is now a 60 percent chance of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 50 percent one month ago. Still, the fact that few analysts have forecast two straight quarters of shrinkage in GDP -- the typical definition of recession -- may be grounds for optimism that the US may escape the clutches of the credit crunch sooner than many expect. HOUSING MARKETS MATTER Much will depend on how quickly the US housing market, which has seen average prices fall more than 15 percent from their peak and is in the midst of its worst period since at least the World War Two, will find a bottom. That will help to steer where inflation goes from here. "The lingering drags from housing combined with the slow healing in the financial sector ought to provide at least one source of eventual stability in containing the threat of a runaway inflation," said Citi's chief US economist Robert DiClemente in a note to clients. The outlook for Britain, where housing prices are falling sharply following a boom of the past decade, is crumbling and has many economists making comparisons with two years ago in the United States. The median UK recession probability has risen to 40 percent from 30 percent last month, double the 20 percent likelihood polled at the start of this year. Yet unlike in the US, where the Fed has slashed interest rates by 3.25 percentage points since the outset of the credit crunch a year ago, the Bank of England is hamstrung by inflation running at nearly double its 2.0 percent target rate. Inflation is set to soar even higher in the next few months -- with a few banks saying it will average over 5 percent in the last three months of this year. Interest rates in the euro zone, Japan and Canada look set to stay at current levels until well into 2009. For the UK, economists reckon the next move is down, in the first quarter of next year. They still say the same for the European Central Bank, despite all the hawkish rhetoric from officials and the pre-emptive increase to 4.25 percent a few weeks ago. The poll found a median 30 percent probability of a recession in the 15-member euro area, up from 15 percent. For Japan, economists as a group have delayed yet again an interest rate increase to 0.75 percent until the July-September quarter of next year. With inflation seen peaking soon and a great deal riding on US demand for Japanese exports the conviction behind forecasts of a BOJ rise is thin
