<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) - Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury on Friday demanded that the government hold a referendum to settle whether upazila or parliament elections should be held first. He made the demand at a press briefing in Baridhara, after the meeting of the party's central organising committee Friday afternoon. "Though the upazila is an autonomous body, some parties are opposing elections to it," Badruddoza said. "They have created a controversy over whether the upazila or the parliament elections will be held first." "The government should arrange a referendum for the people to decide the issue." On the press reports regarding allegations of corruption against family members of president Iajuddin Ahmed, the former president said: "If there is any allegation of corruption, it should be investigated." On whether Bikalpadhara would be with the AL-led alliance, he said: "Bikalpadhara is becoming a stronger organisation. We will take decision in this regard when the election approaches." Regarding withdrawal of the state of emergency, Badruddoza said: "If, after holding the four city corporation and nine upazila elections, we feel that there is no need for the state of emergency, we will demand its complete withdrawal." The party's secretary general, retired major Abdul Mannan, and presidium members, Prof Nurul Amin Bepari, retired major general MA Halim and Mahi B Chowdhury, were present among others. bdnews24
