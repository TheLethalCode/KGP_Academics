 NEW DELHI, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A boycott of the September Champions Trophy loomed on Friday, a day after the International Cricket Council (ICC) decided to retain Pakistan as the venue despite safety concerns by many teams. The ICC said the Sept. 11-28 event will not be shifted despite concerns by England, Australia, New Zealand and South African boards, prompting player representatives to warn players against travelling to Pakistan. That raised a serious possibility that some of the teams could pull out or field depleted teams, diluting the event rated as second in importance only to the one-day World Cup. Australia and New Zealand players were advised by their players' associations on Friday not to travel to Pakistan, after the South African players' body expressed dismay at the ICC move. The Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) said concerns remained for the safety of their players and they would recommend not travelling. "The ACA continues to have serious concerns with our players touring Pakistan for the Champions Trophy and we are disappointed with the ICC," ACA chief executive Paul Marsh said in a statement. PLAYER CONSULTATIONS The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said it would discuss the issue with its players before taking any decision. The final squads list for the eight-team event will have to be submitted by mid-August. "Following the board decision taken by the ICC, the ECB will be holding urgent and extensive talks with key stakeholders, especially the players and team England, to establish our position," an ECB spokesman said. "Once these discussions are complete the ECB will then make the appropriate decision." England batsman Kevin Pietersen hoped the board would take any decision and not leave it to the players. "The ECB are coming together I think on the third or fourth of August and the decision will probably be taken out of the players' hands which is great," he told Sky Sports News. Asked how players would respond if they had to take a call, he said: "I really hope not. We'll have to see the outcome of that meeting." An ICC spokesman said it was premature to comment, a day after its executive board's decision. "We obviously want the best available players to take part in the tournament," he told Reuters. "One of the priorities for the special task force being put in place is to ensure a level of comfort for all stakeholders in the arrangements," he said. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said he was also planning talks with their players' union, which warned the players not to travel. The Champions Trophy had been mired in uncertainty for the past several weeks over player safety concerns following a spate of suicide bombings in Pakistan. Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi are the intended match venue
