 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) - SAFF Games gold medalist shooter Sharmin Akhter will carry Bangladesh's national flag in the march past during the gala opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic, scheduled for Aug 8 to 24. The decision was taken Wednesday at the Bangladesh Olympic Association's meeting. "Sharmin has been given the honour considering her previous successes and she is the best among six athletes taking part in the meet," said BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed. Sharmin, who bagged gold, silver and bronze medals from regional extravaganza SAFF Games and finished fourth in Asia Shooting Championship, will compete in 10m air rifles event in the Beijing Olympic. Apart from Sharmin, five more contestants -- swimmers Dolly Akther (50m freestyle), Rubel Rana (100m backstroke), athletes Nazmun Nahar Beauty (100m sprint), Mohammad Abu Abdullah (100m sprint) and shooter Mohammad Imam Hossain (10m air- rifles) -- will represent Bangladesh in the world's most colourful carnival. Chef-de-mission Major General Shakil Ahmed met the Olympic-bound athletes, coaches and officials Wednesday at the BOA office at the National Sports Council and emphasised the need of maintaining discipline during the Games. "Not on the basis of merit, our participation is a symbolic one in the Olympic Games, so everyone has to uphold the country's image and show the sportsmanship spirit in China," Ahmed told the participants. Ahmed also said, "We know we will not grab a gold in the meet, but we will remain disciplined so that no one can raise any question on disciplinary grounds." BOA secretary general Kutubuddin said, "There is nothing to be worried and we should fight in every event we are taking part." He stressing on discipline said, "We won't certainly damage our country's image aboard and we have to be champions in term of discipline." Bangladesh contingent, split into three groups, will leave here for China. The first batch consisting the chef-de-mission and BOA secretary general leaves Aug 4. The second batch comprising athletes and coaches will leave on Aug while the rest on Aug 7.
