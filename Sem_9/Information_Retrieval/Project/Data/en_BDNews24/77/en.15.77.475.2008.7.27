 Dhaka, July 26, (bdnews24.com) -- At least 20 people were injured after a 5.6 earthquake rocked Dhaka and other parts of the country early Sunday. The earthquake that lasted a few seconds was felt shortly before 1:00am. Mominul Islam, a meteorologist of the Storm Warning Centre, told bdnews24.com that the quake measured 5.6 on the Richter scale. Several callers phoned the bdnews24.com newsroom and wanted to know details. Dhaka University students rushed out of their dormitories into the open and waited through the light rain, witnesses said. "The whole floor was shaking. I thought it was not safe to stay inside," Ishtiaq Abedin, a founder of American International University-Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com by phone, after he came out of his Old DOHS apartment. At least 20 Dhaka University students were treated for injuries after they jumped out of their dormitories in panic, said Tanvir Ali, a doctor of DU Medical Centre. Abul Kalam Azad, a DU student, broke his leg after he jumped off a floor of his dormitory, panicked by the earthquake. bdnews
