 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Wednesday stressed the need for close connectivity with Sri Lanka. Iftekhar, now in Colombo to attend the 15th SAARC summit, met his Sri Lankan counterpart Rohitha Bogollagama and sought cooperation in food technology, shipbuilding and other areas from the Island nation. "The beginning of direct air link is most welcome. But there should be more connectivity," Iftekhar said in a statement released by the foreign ministry. "There are also possibilities for collaboration in food technology, tourism, shipbuilding and information communication technology," the statement quoted Iftekhar as saying. Dhaka and Colombo got air-connected as private airline Best Air on July 28 started direct plane services from Dhaka to Male via Colombo. The foreign adviser arrived in the Sri Lankan capital Wednesday to lead the Bangladesh delegation to the SAARC Ministerial Meeting that begins Thursday ahead of the 15th SAARC Summit, slated for July 2-3. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will lead the Bangladesh delegation to the summit. "There is scope for greater cooperation, particularly in the economic field," Iftekhar said. The foreign adviser had a luncheon meeting with a member of the European Parliament, Nirj Deva, who is expected to visit Bangladesh sometime in August, according to the statement. Deva is in Colombo to see the SAARC summit representing the European Union, an observer of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. bdn
