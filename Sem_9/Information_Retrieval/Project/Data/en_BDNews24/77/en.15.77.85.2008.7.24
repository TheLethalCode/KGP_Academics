 Jessore, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  A BBC Bangla crew member died and 12 others were injured Wednesday night after their microbuses crashed on the Jessore-Khulna highway, a BBC official said Thursday. The dead crewman Saiful Islam Russel was an event assistant, said producer of the 'Electoral Dialogue' radio programmes Waliur Rahman Miraj. The BBC Bangla radio crew were on their way to Khulna from Rajshahi as part of the 'Electoral Dialogue' series, Miraj said. Abhoynagar police chief Shahdat Hossain told bdnews24.com the two microbuses reached Amdanga around 2am. "The drivers did not notice a bailey bridge on the road and drove into a deep ditch killing one man on the spot." Local people rescued the other accident victims and rushed them to hospital in Khulna, where Khulna Medical College Hospital doctor Israil Biswas said the injured were out of danger. The two vehicles were recovered Thursday morning, the police official said. bdnews2
