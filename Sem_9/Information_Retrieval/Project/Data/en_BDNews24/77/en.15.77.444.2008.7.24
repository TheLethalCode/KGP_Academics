 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has cancelled the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2008, declaring it illegal and unconstitutional. A High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haq and Md Abu Tariq gave the ruling Thursday on a writ petition by Supreme Court lawyers Md Shamsul Huq and Tajul Islam. Tajul Islam told bdnews24.com: "This verdict has re-established the dignity of the Supreme Court  The verdict proved that the ordinance was unnecessary." Deputy attorney general Idris Khan said he had already prepared to file an immediate appeal against the verdict. The same High Court bench has now overturned two separate presidential ordinances promulgated during the caretaker government's term. Earlier in July, it also cancelled the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Ordinance 2008. The Contempt of Court Act 1926 was scrapped on May 25, to be replaced by the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2008. On June 8, the High Court issued a rule nisi on the government to explain why some sections of the new ordinance should not be declared unconstitutional and cancelled. In Thursday's ruling, the High Court stated for a second time that the president cannot promulgate ordinances which are not related to elections and are not urgent during the tenure of the caretaker government. The ruling described the new Contempt of Court Ordinance as "a government's policy making decision" and overturned it. The High Court bench further said the ordinance violated the fundamental spirit of the constitution. It curbed the freedom of the judiciary and magistracy of the Supreme Court. The ordinance has been promulgated ultra vires (beyond powers) allowed by the constitution to the president during the caretaker government's term, it said. On the provision giving the president power to wave punishment for contempt of court, the ruling observed the provision gave special benefit to an employee of the state. It thus violates equality in the eyes of the law. The president cannot waive punishment for anybody without strong logic, the court added. The ruling said the ordinance instead of upholding the standing of the High Court and the Supreme Court, as the highest courts in the land, made them subservient. On the provision in the ordinance that a judge's personal behaviour can be criticised outside a trial, the court said if judges are afraid of criticism justice seekers would be deprived of justice. Terming the ordinance an attempt to hamper the inherent power of the judiciary, the HC bench said it violated the supremacy and rule of law. The ordinance is constitutionally illegal, and has therefore been cancelled, it concluded. Barrister Abdur Razzak represented the writ petitioners. Attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed represented the government. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq, barrister Amir-ul Isalm, Dr Shahdeen Malik, Ajmalul Hossain QC, former attorney general Mahmudul Islam and barrister AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury acted as amicus curie. bdnew
