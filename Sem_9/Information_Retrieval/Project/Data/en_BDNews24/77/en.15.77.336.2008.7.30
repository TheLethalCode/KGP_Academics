The former local government and rural development minister was freed from Dhaka Central Jail after the High Court had granted him bail in the GATCO scam case. On the BNP, Bhuiyan said: "BNP must be united. There is no alternative to BNP unity in contesting the election." He demanded that jails in the country be renovated and accommodation problem of jail officials and employees resolved soon. The former minister suggested that people charged with pretty crimes be released from jail as the inmates in jails far outstripped their capacity. BNP leader ZA Khan and Bhuiyan's lawyer Golam Mostafa Khan were present. The High Court granted two-month bail to Bhuiyan on Monday in the GATCO scam case.
