Giasuddin's wives Reshma Begum and Touhfiza Begum and son Golam Md Faisal surrendered to the court of special judge AKM Arifur Rahman. Giasuddin is behind bars in the same case. A lawyer for the accused sought bail for his clients but the court rejected the prayers and ordered them to jail. ACC assistant director Khairul Huda filed the case on Sept 5 last year.
