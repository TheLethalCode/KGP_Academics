 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)Transmission of news programmes by private TV channel Baishakhi resumed from Friday morning as striking workers returned to the station on assurances of payment of due salaries, a channel staffer said. The employees of the channel observed a work stoppage on Thursday, demanding payment of five months' overdue salary. As a result live news broadcasts were interrupted from 11.45pm. News editor Amirul Faisal told bdnews24.com Friday: "Following a fruitful discussion with the owners Thursday night, work at Baishakhi returned to normal and is going full speed." "Reporters returned this morning. All news bulletins are now being transmitted regularly." Deputy managing director of the channel Mosharraf Hossain Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "We want to pay two months' due salary by Sunday. And the salary for the month of July will be paid by August 7." The channel's employees went on strike for several days last year in similar protest against overdue salaries. bdnew
