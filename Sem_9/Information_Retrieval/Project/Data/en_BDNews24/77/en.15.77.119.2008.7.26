<TEXT>
 PARIS, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two paparazzi in camouflage gear scuffled with bodyguards of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt after they were found hiding on the grounds of the Hollywood stars' French estate, the couple's security chief said on Friday. Tony Webb, head of the team guarding the Chateau Miraval estate where the couple are staying following the birth of their twins earlier this month, said the incident took place on Thursday afternoon. "We caught the two and tried to escort them off the property, and the guy's just gone berserk, thrashing out, kicking and actually biting one of the security people, breaking his finger, drawing blood and screaming that he had Hepatitis C," he told Reuters. An officer at the police station in nearby Brignoles village confirmed that an incident involving paparazzi had taken place at the sprawling property but gave no details. Jolie and Pitt have reportedly sold exclusive picture rights to the first photographs of their newborn twins Vivienne Marcheline and Knox Leon to a U.S. publication for $11 million. The money would go to charity. Pitt's lawyers have threatened legal action against magazines or websites publishing recent pictures they say were taken by paparazzi of the actor and his family at the estate. Webb said they would also take action against photographers. "The family are really fed up that these people are trespassing, so we're going to try to get restraining orders and use the law to do whatever we have to to keep them off the property," he said.
