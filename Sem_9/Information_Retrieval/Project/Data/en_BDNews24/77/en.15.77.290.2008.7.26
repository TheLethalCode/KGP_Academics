<TITLE> Conditions delaying release of Khaleda: MK Anwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader MK Anwar said Saturday the government's conditions were delaying the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia from prison. The remark came at a programme, which was arranged at the grave of the late president Ziaur Rahman in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar to press freedom for Khaleda. Anwar did not explain the "conditions". The former agriculture minister who was released from prison last week inaugurated the programme that pulled in BNP leaders and workers. MK Anwar demanded unconditional release of Khaleda and warned of a worsening situation without immediate freedom for the former prime minister. The former minister hopes an internal feud that has divided the BNP will disappear after Khaleda comes out of jail. ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to the BNP chairperson, said people would not accept the government's dithering over the release of Khaleda. bdnew
