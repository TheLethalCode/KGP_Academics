 DHAKA, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh's left-arm pacer Syed Rasel has been sidelined for two months after sustaining an injury during a three-day game in England, officials said on Thursday. Rasel, who is touring England with the Bangladesh A team, injured his waist during the match against county side Leicestershire last week but the extent of the injury was not known until a scan. Rasel has spent much of the past eight months on the sidelines since being sent home from New Zealand with a dislocated shoulder in December 2007. He is expected to get a recall into the Bangladesh team which will play a four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Canada from Aug. 14 to 17. Bangladesh then go to Australia for three one-day matches from Aug. 31 to Sept. 6. Rasel has claimed 44 wickets in 34 ODI's and 12 wickets in six tests
