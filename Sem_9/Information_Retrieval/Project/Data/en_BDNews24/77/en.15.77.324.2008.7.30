 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Wednesday announced a 14-member GP-BCB academy squad to play two four-dayers and three one-dayers against the hosts South Africa academy team in August. Chief selector Rafiqul Alam declared the squad at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. BCB Game Development Committee chairman Shakil Kasem, Grameenphone director (marketing) Rubaba Dowla and academy operations manager Khaled Mahmud Sujon were also present. Alam said, they picked 14 players from the available 19 academy players as six academy cricketers were travelling with the Bangladesh A team in England. He added that they had excluded the players touring England now as getting South African visa for them from England would be difficult. The GP-BCB national academy team will leave here for South Africa on Aug 4 to play in Pretoria and Johannesburg. Talented batsman Marshall Ayub returned to the academy fold after about a year as the top-order batsman had to remain out of action during the period for injury. "He is now fully fit to play and has been practicing with the academy players for the last one and a half months," said the chief selector. Shakil Kasem said, the board in principle had decided to form a selection committee for the junior teams, which may be declared some time in August. Kasem, the former national cricketer said that the academy team serves as the source or pool of players for the national team to draw from and that's why the academy team is given international exposure as the domestic competitions are not of the expected standards all the times. "We (national team) can't perform as good in international cricket as we should do, so we try to take care of those potential young cricketers, the future of Bangladesh cricket, through sending them to different countries in line with bilateral agreements," said Kasem, the newly introduced member of the BCB ad-hoc committee. The former national cricketer also said that the discussion session scheduled for Aug 2 will provide the former and current national players a platform where they would share the knowledge of their South Africa tour experiences with the academy cricketers. Squad: Suhrawardi Shuvo (captain), Sahagir Hossain (vice captain), Farhad Hossain, Shamsur Rahman, Marshall Ayub, Nadif Chowdhury, Imrul Kayes, Jahurul Islam, Nasir Hossain, Raihan Uddin, Mahbubul Alam Robin, Shafaq-Al-Zabir, Ziaur Rahman and Deloyar Hossain. Itinerary: Aug 8-11 - 1st four-dayers, Pretoria Aug 14-17 - 2nd four-dayer, Pretoria Aug 20 - 1st one-dayer, Johannesburg Aug 22 - 2nd one-dayer, Pretoria Aug 24 - 3rd one-dayer, Johannesburg bd
