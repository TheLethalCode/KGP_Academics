 JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senior negotiators from Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC and the ruling ZANU-PF party began talks on Thursday and a report indicated they were close to reaching a deal on forming a unity government. The talks were under way on Thursday, President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga said. Senior Movement for Democratic Change officials and two Zimbabwean cabinet ministers were leading the rival negotiating teams meeting at an undisclosed venue around the South African capital Pretoria. Preliminary talks began on Tuesday after Mbeki secured a framework deal between President Robert Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai on Monday for talks to end the deadlock over Mugabe's re-election on June 27 in a poll boycotted by the opposition because of violence. Ratshitanga said even if negotiators missed a two-week deadline set under the framework agreement, it did not mean the end of talks. "It does not mean if the talks are not done in two weeks, that the talks will collapse," he said. The main aim of the Pretoria talks will be the creation of a government of national unity, but the two sides differ on who should lead it and how long it should stay in power. South African financial daily Business Day reported on Thursday that the two sides are close to reaching a deal but still need to iron out the final details. Business Day, citing sources in both parties and people familiar with the talks, said a final settlement can be reached soon as the parties had already agreed on many issues. "They have agreed on most of the issues, except mainly the framework for a new government. The deal is basically done, but what remains are a few issues of detail, implementation and logistics," Business Day quoted a source as saying. Zimbabwean political analyst Eldred Masunungure said a breakthrough in talks was possible as the rival parties had been talking under mediation led by South African President Thabo Mbeki since March last year. "A breakthrough is a reasonable possibility, even in two weeks. This is essentially the second phase of the SADC-mediated process, the first phase having started in March 2007," Masunungure said. MEDIATION Mbeki was appointed by regional grouping the Southern African Development Community to mediate between the Zimbabwean parties. He had been increasingly criticized, especially by the MDC, which accused him of taking too soft a line with Mugabe. As part of the framework deal, the rival parties agreed to a media blackout but Zimbabwe's state-owned Herald newspaper reported on Thursday that MDC and ZANU-PF's main negotiators flew to South Africa on the same flight on Wednesday. Masunungure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, said a major issue for the negotiators would be the form of a unity government with a number of options mooted, including splitting the executive to create a titular presidency for Mugabe and executive premiership for Tsvangirai. "The titular presidency for Mugabe does appear the more likely route. Given his age, Mugabe might be agreeable to easing out of power, rather than being kicked out. He will not lose anything except executive power," Masungure said. The MDC says 120 of its supporters have been killed since a first round of elections on March 29, in which Tsvangirai beat Mugabe but without the absolute majority to avoid a run-off. Mugabe blames the opposition for the bloodshed. The Herald said ZANU-PF's decision-making politburo met on Wednesday and gave party negotiators approval to continue with the talks. The Herald quoted ZANU-PF deputy information and publicity secretary Ephraim Masawi as saying the politburo expressed satisfaction with the framework deal signed by Mugabe, Tsvangirai and a smaller MDC faction. Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa and Public Services Minister Nicholas Goche will represent ZANU-PF at negotiations, while MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti and Deputy Treasurer Elton Mangoma would attend for Tsvangirai's party. "We gave Chinamasa and Goche the green light for them to go ahead with the negotiations within the parameters signed by the principals," Masawi said, according to the Herald.
