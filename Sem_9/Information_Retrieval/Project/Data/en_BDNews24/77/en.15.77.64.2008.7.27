 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)The High Court ruled on Sunday that August 15, the day of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination in 1975, be restored as national mourning day and a public holiday. In its ruling, a High Court bench declared illegal the scrapping of the country's national mourning day by the past BNP-led government. The HC bench of justices Md Abdur Rashid and M Ashfakul Islam passed the ruling on a writ petition filed by three Awami League-backed lawyers on August 5 last year. After the ruling, one of the petitioners Md Mozammel Haque told bdnews24.com: "The verdict has given us the chance to return the debt of blood shed by Bangabandhu and his family." "From now on the nation will again observe August 15 as a national mourning day with due respect," the Supreme Court lawyer and Bangabandhu Ainjibi Parishad organising secretary said. The other two writ petitioners are advocates Mollah Abu Kaiser and MA Malek. The HC had issued a rule nisi on the government, the day after the writ petition was filed, asking it to explain why August 15 should not be declared national mourning day and a public holiday. It also asked the government to explain why the decision to cancel the national mourning day and public holiday should not be declared illegal. Independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated on Aug 15, 1975, along with most members of his family. The AL government, which came back to power in 1996, declared August 15 a national mourning day and public holiday. The BNP-led alliance government scrapped the holiday in 2002, one year after coming to office. bdnews24.
