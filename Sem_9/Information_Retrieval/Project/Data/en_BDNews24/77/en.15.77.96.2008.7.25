<TITLE> Bangladesh seeks Russian fertiliser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has approached Russia for exports of fertiliser, at a sideline meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum meeting in Singapore, the foreign adviser said Friday. Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury made the request Thursday to his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, the adviser told reporters in a statement from Singapore. "I have discussed with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov the procurement of fertiliser from Russia," he said. He also expressed appreciation for Russia's support in the energy sector, the adviser added. The government had earlier announced plans to import fertiliser from Russia, Belarus and Morocco to ensure smooth supply in the coming Aman season. Agriculture adviser CS Karim and the foreign adviser held meetings last month with the ambassadors of Russia and Morocco in Dhaka, who assured them they would convey the request for fertiliser to their governments. Initially the government has moved to procure 5 lakh tonnes of non-urea fertiliser from the three countries. Bangladesh imports more than 10 lakh tonnes of fertiliser every year. The country suffers a huge deficit in fertiliser production, with agricultural production facing serious threat if fertiliser cannot be procured from abroad. This is the second time the foreign adviser has met with Lavrov. Iftekhar first met with him in December last year when he visited Russia. bdn
