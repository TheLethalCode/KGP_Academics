 Sirajganj, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The forthcoming Jatiya Sangsad election will elevate the quality of democracy and state governance in Bangladesh, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Wednesday. "We hope that we'll be able to realise the goal we had envisaged at the start of our journey on 1/11/2007," Fakhruddin said while addressing a local level national dialogue session labelled 'In transit to democracy' in Sirajganj. The chief adviser stressed: "Holding elections is a major requisite for any democracy to flourish and the purpose of such dialogues is to ensure realisation of popular aspirations in the post-election period." "We have come out of the capital to listen to the grassroots, so that their views may be reflected in our national activities." Fakhruddin said the forthcoming general election would be held in such a way "that it will be regarded as an example of an ideally executed state activity." "Through holding the polls as envisaged, the quality of practised democracy will be elevated and state governance will be improved." He said preparations for holding an acceptable election and handing over power to an elected government were almost complete. "Voter registration with photograph has been accomplished through all-out participation of the people, government and the Election Commission." "No other country in the world has ever been able to register so many voters with photos," the chief adviser said. "The Election Commission has also formulated the necessary electoral regulations," he added. Education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, moderating the session, said: "Democracy is traversing a transitory course in Bangladesh. We want to go ahead carrying the messages of people from all walks of life." Fakhruddin spoke as the chief guest at the national dialogue session in Sirajganj, which started at 9.30am. The session was also attended by local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and communications adviser Ghulam Quader. Deputy commissioner Sirajganj Ashraf Ali gave the welcome address. bdnews
