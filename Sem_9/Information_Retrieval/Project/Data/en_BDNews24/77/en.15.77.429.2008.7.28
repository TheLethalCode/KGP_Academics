 NEW DELHI, Mon Jul 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will visit the site of blasts in Ahmedabad on Monday as pressure grows on his government to beef up its intelligence apparatus to counter a series of bombings. The 16 bombings that killed at least 45 people in Ahmedabad came a day after another series of bombings in the IT hub of Bangalore, sparking criticism that authorities had been lax in probing increasingly confident militant groups. A group called the "Indian Mujahideen" said it carried out the Ahmedabad attack, writing in an e-mail sent five minutes before the first blast that it was in revenge for a 2002 massacre in Gujarat of around 2,500 people, mainly Muslims, by Hindu mobs. "Do whatever you can, within 5 minutes from now, feel the terror of Death!", the e-mail, seen by Reuters, said. It warned the governments of several states to stop harassing, imprisoning and torturing Muslims and told media outlets to stop their "propaganda war" against Muslims. It also warned Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries and one of the world's richest men, to think twice before building a luxury 27-story home on land in Mumbai previously owned by a Muslim charity. Two separate series of bombings ripped through Ahmedabad within 90 minutes. The first series went off near busy markets. A second wave of bombs went off around a hospital, where at least six people died. All were detonated with timers. Many of the bombs were packed into metal tiffin boxes, used to carry food, and stuffed with ball-bearings. Some were left on bicycles and one was reportedly a car bomb. The India Mujahideen said it carried out bombings that killed 63 people in the western city of Jaipur in May. As was the case with Jaipur, India has often accused militant groups from Pakistan and Bangladesh of helping local militants to carry out a wave of bombings in recent years, with targets ranging from mosques to Hindu temples. But few people are ever brought to trial. "It would be interesting to know how many prosecutions have followed terror incidents in recent years," The Asian Age said in its editorial on Monday. "Typically, the police round up a few Muslim boys as being terrorists and the courts let them off, so poor is the investigation or the basis of the initial arrests. India's cities were on alert on Monday, with extra police stationed at many malls, train stations and temples. Twelve people have been detained by police for questioning about the Ahmedabad blasts, but there have been no arrests. HINDU NATIONALISTS TARGETED? Ahmedabad is the main city in the communally sensitive and relatively wealthy western state of Gujarat. The state's Chief Minister Narendra Modi is one of India's most controversial politicians, accused of turning a blind eye to the 2002 riots. Ahmedabad and Bangalore are both in states ruled by Bharatiya Janata Party and are among the country's fastest-growing. Underscoring worries that another attack could be in the pipeline, two more unexploded bombs were found in cars in the city of Surat on Sunday, one of the world's biggest diamond-polishing centres, also located in Gujarat. There have been calls to reinstate an anti-terrorism law that the government scrapped after it came to power in 2004. The law was criticised for giving police too many powers to detain people without charge and allowing the abuse of government opponents. Police officers in many states said they rarely received warnings from the country's intelligence services. "It is difficult in any investigation without inputs, as you start from scratch as you put together clues and human intelligence," said Pankaj Kumar Singh, a top police officer probing the Jaipur bombings said. There are worries that more attacks could start to dent business confidence, although years of attacks have had little impact on the booming economy. The attacks had little impact on the stock market on Monday. "These incidents are certainly not very good from investor point of view," said Krishnakumar Natarajan, chief executive officer of Mindtree Consulting Ltd, a software services firm based in Bangalore: "In the short term, there will be enormous concern among overseas investors and, therefore, we need to ensure that these events do not happen so frequently
