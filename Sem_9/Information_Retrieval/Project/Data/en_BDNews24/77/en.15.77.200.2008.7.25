 Comilla, July 25 (bdnews24.com) - Two passengers were killed and 20 others injured when two local trains collided head on at Laksham junction in Comilla Friday, a rail official said. Train movement on Dhaka-Chittagong, Dhaka-Chandpur, Dhaka-Noakhali and Sylhet-Chittagong routes remained suspended following the accident. Laksham station master Masdhusudhan Chowdhury said a train heading to Noakhali from Dhaka and another going to Akhaura from Chittagong collided head-on as they were both entering the junction at around 12.30pm. "The accident occurred due to faulty signal. However, as the two trains were travelling at low speed, a serious accident was averted," said the station master. The identities of the deceased could not be known. The injured were admitted to Laksham Hospital. Communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman and Comilla deputy commissioner Md Monzurur Rahman visited the spot. bdnews24.c
