 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  The organiser of the four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Toronto, wants to see Bangladesh play the tournament in Canada every year, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board official Wednesday. The Sports International Marketing (SIM), a Pakistan-based event management group, is organising the Canada Cup Twenty20 tournament involving hosts Canada, Pakistan, West Indies and Bangladesh next month. The tournament is scheduled for August 14 to 17 in Toronto, which once hosted the most coveted Sahara Cup involving Pakistan and India, but it has been in pause since a few years ago. "The SIM let us know that they want to organise the Canada Cup T20 yearly and want to invite Bangladesh to the tournament every year," said Nizamuddin Chowdhury, BCB's acting chief executive officer. Bangladesh will get US$ 350000 as participation money. Chowdhury, however, said that the future of the Canada Cup depended on the success of the inaugural tournament. bdn
