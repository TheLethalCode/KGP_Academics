 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty on Sunday pushed the benefits for Bangladesh of a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with his country. Emerging from separate meetings with commerce minister Faruq Khan and law minister Shafiq Ahmed at the Secretariat, he told reporters that Bangladesh would boost trade with tariff cuts under the TIFA. Despite three rounds of talks between 2003 and 2005, there was no breakthrough with the TIFA and the US 2007 pressed the proposal afresh in 2007. Moriarty said he spoke with Khan on trade deals, tariffs, and investments. As to why some political parties object to the TIFA, the ambassador said he hoped the issue would be settled through discussion. Moriarty said he had spoken with the law minister on the "the government's ambitious plan" to reform the judiciary. The US would give all support if asked, said the ambassador. Asked about the frozen Singapore bank account of Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, the ambassador said the US was trying to retrieve alleged bribe money in cooperation with Singapore, a US ally. bdnews24.co
