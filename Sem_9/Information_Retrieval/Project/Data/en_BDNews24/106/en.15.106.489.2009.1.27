 RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho, dropped by Brazil last year following a loss of form, has been recalled by coach Dunga for next month's friendly against Italy in London. The AC Milan forward had been left out of Brazil's last three games following a dismal display in their goalless draw at home to Bolivia in September. Striker Adriano, banned for three domestic matches on Monday for punching an opponent during an Italian Serie A game on Sunday, was also called up. Brazil face the Italians at Arsenal's Emirates stadium on Feb. 10, the first meeting between the two sides since a 3-3 draw in France in 1997. Goalkeeper: Doni (AS Roma), Julio Cesar (Inter Milan) Defenders: Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Adriano Correia (Sevilla), Maicon (Inter Milan), Marcelo (Real Madrid), Lucio (Bayern Munich), Luisao (Benfica), Juan (AS Roma), Thiago Silva (Fluminense) Midfielders: Anderson (Manchester United), Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos), Felipe Melo (Fiorentina), Josue (VfL Wolfsburg), Elano (Manchester City), Julio Baptista (AS Roma), Kaka (AC Milan), Ronaldinho (AC Milan) Forwards: Alexandre Pato (AC Milan), Adriano (Inter Milan), Lus Fabiano (Sevilla), Robinho (Manchester City)
