<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Supporters of a BNP-backed chairman candidate entered voting booths at a Rangunia polling centre to force voters to cast their ballots for their man, an Election Commission official said on Thursday. "There were reports of voters being threatened in Rangunia, though largely peaceful voting took place in Chittagong on Thursday," said presiding officer Abul Kashem Chowdhury. Several complaints were received from voting centres of the Upazila that cohorts of Abu Ahmed Hasnat had pressured voters, said the PO. Hasnat is a chairman candidate supported by BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. Voters were thin in the morning in Rangunia, Boalkhali and Rauzan, but the number increased as the day rolled on. The overall low turnout was attributed by locals to waning enthusiasm for another election so soon after the parliamentary polls. North Rangunia High School polling centre had 2,505 voters listed, but up to 11am only 500 votes were cast. There were 2,514 voters registered at North Rangunia's Rafikabad High School voting centre but just 100 ballots had been cast in the first two hour of voting, till 10am. At North Dewanpur Government Primary School in Rauzan Upazila, 1,000 votes were cast till midday against 3,478 voters listed. At the East Amuchia Government Primary School in Boalkhali, 398 of 718 votes were cast till 2:15pm. As a general holiday was not declared in the metropolitan areas, many people could not come to vote during working hours, locals said. "Since the fear of false votes ceased to worry people, they are coming at their leisure after finishing their work," said Abdul Hakim, a voter in Raujan. bdnews24.c
