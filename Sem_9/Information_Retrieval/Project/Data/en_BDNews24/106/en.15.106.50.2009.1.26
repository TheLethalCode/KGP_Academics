<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain has alleged that president Iajuddin Ahmed had committed a breach of office that calls for his impeachment. "The President violated the Constitution by breaching trust. The Constitution provides for impeachment as punishment for such an offence," Delwar told a discussion on Monday. BNP parliamentarians boycotted the President's speech on the first day of parliament Sunday by staging a walkout. They alleged that the President had broken his oath by failing to hold elections within ninety days. Delwar, at a meeting of the BNP associated Tati Dal, also condemned what he alleged was the ruling Awami League's "oppression of BNP leaders and workers all over the country". "Awami League has not changed in power. Their old character has been exposed," said the BNP leader. He called on the ruling party to be democratic, saying, "Avoid past mistakes and work for 'digital democracy. If you take to the old path, you will face thorns." Saying that his party wants to play a constructive role in parliament, Delwar said," We want to extend you (Awami League) cooperation. But the way you are progressing is not the path of democracy." He was also critical of Iajuddin as there was no mention of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman in his speech at the opening of parliament on Sunday. Delwar asked BNP leaders and workers to follow the ideals of Ziaur Rahman at Monday's meeting that marked the ex-president's 73rd birth anniversary. Presided over by Tati Dal president Humayun Rashid Khan, others who took part in the discussion included BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, Krishak Dal vice president Takdir Md Jasim, city Mahila Dal general secretary Shirin Sultanaand Ulema Dal president Moulana Nesarul Huq. bdnew
