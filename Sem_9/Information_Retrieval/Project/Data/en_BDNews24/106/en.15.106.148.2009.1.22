 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka judge on Thursday ordered advertisements to be published on daily newspapers seeking plaintiffs in a case involving declaration of 1971 war criminals. On a petition filed on Nov. 13, 2008 seeking declaration of 33 persons including Jamaat-e-Islami's former chief Ghulam Azam, incumbent chief Matiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed "war criminals", ninth Dhaka additional judge Iftekhar Ahmed made the orders on Thursday. Petitioners Liton Mia, Md Safayet Hosain Sajib and Rajib Ahmed, all lawyers by profession, told bdnews24.com the court granted their appeal after a hearing. They had appealed for publication of adverts in the daily newspapers to know who wanted to be plaintiffs in that public-interest petition. The lawyer of the plaintiffs, Syed Ahmed Mostafa Rana, in the appeal said, "An advertisement needs to be published in newspapers to see whether any person or organisation wants to be plaintiff in the public-interest case." The petition also contended people would learn about the subject of the case if it was advertised. Jamaat's assistant secretary general Md Quamaruzzaman, Abdul Kader Mollah, Delwar Hossain Saiyedee and BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury are among others accused. The plaintiffs had appealed to the court to pass orders to bar them from running ninth parliamentary election in December last year. bdne
