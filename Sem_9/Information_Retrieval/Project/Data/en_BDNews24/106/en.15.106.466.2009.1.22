<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Thu Jan 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian author and teacher jailed for three years for insulting Thailand's crown prince in a little-read 2005 novel has applied for a royal pardon, backed by the Australian government. The case against 41-year-old Harry Nicolaides, who was sentenced Monday, is one of a slew of lese-majeste investigations in Thailand that rights groups say are stifling freedom of speech and political dissent. Nicolaides' Melbourne-based lawyer gave no details of the pardon request, other than to say it was lodged with the palace Wednesday. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said he had written to Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya to express the government's "strong support" for Nicolaides' request for a pardon. "Now that the legal processes before Thailand's Courts have concluded, Australian officials have advised Thai officials that the Australian government strongly supports Mr Nicolaides' plea for pardon," Smith said in a statement received on Thursday. Lese-majeste, or insulting the monarchy, is a very serious offence in Thailand, where many people regard 81-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej as semi-divine. It is punishable by up to 15 years in prison although convictions, especially of foreigners, are rare and are normally followed quickly by a pardon. Tuesday, police filed formal charges against a Thai leftist political commentator, accusing him of insulting the king in a 2007 book criticizing the previous year's military coup. Giles Ungpakorn of Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University denied all the charges. A Swiss man, Roland Jufer, was sentenced to 10 years in 2007 for spraying black paint on pictures of the king but was pardoned at Thai New Year in mid-April after serving only four months. Jufer was deported as soon as he was released
