 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Rejuvenated Bangladesh go for the kill on Friday in the decider at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium after the series-leveling win on Wednesday. Zimbabwe, who went down 3-1 in their 2007 home series against the Tigers, are now ahead of the hosts after thrashing Bangladesh twiceonce in the Tri-Nation Cup and then in the ODI series opener. However, Bangladesh bounced back strongly to draw level with an emphatic six-wicket win and the hosts now want to clinch the series and equal the four matches 2-2. "We went down to Zimbabwe in two games because of some mistakes and failure of the top-order batsmen and it made the difference between two sides," said vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza at a pre-match briefing in Mirpur on Thursday. "I think we are now a better side than before and playing better cricket this time. So I think we will be ahead of them in the match," said the Bangladesh pace spearhead. The paceman believed the bowlers would keep the momentum after a fine job in the previous match and urged the top order to put some runs on the board to give them something to bowl at. "More or less we have been bowling better in every match and I hope we will keep it up in the next match. "I hope the top-order batsmen will help us win the match by putting some runs on the board like they did in the previous match. "If you start to get runs, the confidence grows and I think the confidence of our top-order batsmen grew as they got runs yesterday (Wednesday). "I hope they will come with the same confidence to make runs so that we (bowlers) can defend it," said the Mashrafee. Bangladesh on Wednesday asked Mehrab Hossain Junior to open in place of out-of-form opener Junaed Siddique and he responded with a sensible 43-run knock. But the 25-year old pacer thought the inclusion of Mehrab had no impact on the side as everyone had to be prepared to play in any position. He, however, expected Mehrab to continue from where he had left off. "It will be an advantage for us if we get a good start whether it is batting or bowling," he said of 'final'. Zimbabwe opener Hamilton Masakadza also takes the match as final and expects to come back hard on Bangladesh. "Everyone knows Bangladesh as fighters, but we need to be prepared to fight it out in which we have a chance to bounce back and we are expecting so," Masakadza told reporters before the training session in the afternoon. The right-handed batsman said they were a bit concerned over their top-order batsmen, who had not been getting runs since the home series against Sri Lanka in November. Masakadza thinks the toss or wicket will not have much of a say as the wicket looks more even, but the batsmen will still need to be cautious. The 25-year-old opener said he will be aggressive in his batting. "Definitely I want to play my game, but we have learnt to come through first and need someone to put his hands up." Both Mashrafee and Masakadza believe a total of 220 to 230 would be defendable. Bangladesh picked the same 12, keeping Enamul Haque Junior and Junaed Siddique out of the squad. Bangladesh 12: Tamim Iqbal, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Mahmudullah, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Nazmul Hossain, Rubel Hossain and Mahbubul Alam Robin. Zimbabwe: Prosper Utseya, Elton Chigumbura, Graeme Cremer, Keith Dabengwa, Hamilton Masakadza, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Christopher Mpofu, Tawanda Mupariwa, Forster Mutizwa, Raymond Price, Edward Rainsford, Vusimuzi Sibanda, Tatenda Taibu, Malcolm Waller and Sean Williams
