 KABUL, Fri Jan 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan and NATO-led forces killed a militant suspected of planning last week's suicide bomb attack that killed a US soldier and four Afghans in the centre of Kabul, NATO-led forces said in a statement on Friday. The attack happened close to the German embassy and a US military base and targeted a US military vehicle guarding a fuel tank. One other US soldier is said to still be in a critical condition. NATO-led troops and Afghan security forces carried out raids on compounds in the capital and in Logar province, about 70 km south of Kabul, overnight, and detained one person and killed one other suspect. "A (bomb) facilitator was detained during the operation and a senior insurgent commander killed," the statement said. The operation was conducted by Afghan intelligence officers, a police chief for Logar province told Reuters, and the NATO statement added that no civilians were killed or injured during the raids. No further information about the identity of the suspects or the operation was available and a NATO spokesman said more details would be released on Saturday
