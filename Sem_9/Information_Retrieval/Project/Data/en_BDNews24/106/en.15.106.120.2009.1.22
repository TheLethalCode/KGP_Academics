<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has emerged as the first Bangladeshi ever to lead an ICC ranking when he became the world's top one-day all-rounder, according to an announcement of the game's governing body on Thursday. With 380 rating points, the 21-year old, who was number three last week, went ahead of New Zealand's Jacob Oram (368 points) and England's Andrew Flintoff (366 points), according to the latest ICC ODI championship rankings. "It feels great to be ranked number one. My one and only goal is to keep performing and win matches for the Bangladesh team and I feel more inspired and motivated to give my all in the field," said Shakib, who is close to getting into the ODI bowler's top 10 also. He is currently ranked number 12. "I also know that retaining the number one spot will be even tougher and it will require lots of sacrifices, consistency, hard work and dedication," said Shakib in his immediate reaction. Shakib is only the second Bangladeshi to break into the top 10. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak had shot to number eight in the ODI bowling rankings in November 2007. In Test cricket Shakib has also made his mark and is ranked 10 in the all-rounder's list. This also makes him the first Bangladeshi Test cricketer ever in the top 10.
