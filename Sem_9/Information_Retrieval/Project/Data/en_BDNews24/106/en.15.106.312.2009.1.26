 NEW DELHI, Mon Jan 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India bestowed its highest peacetime gallantry award on Monday on half a dozen security men killed fighting Pakistani militants in Mumbai last year, an attack that worsened tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. Thousands of police and soldiers lined the route of the annual military parade in New Delhi, while the chief guest, Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, looked on with Indian leaders from a bullet-proof stand. In a ceremony steeped in symbolism, President Pratibha Patil gave away India's highest peacetime military awards to 11 policemen and soldiers posthumously, including six shot dead fighting Pakistani militants in Mumbai. Patil handed over a citation and a medal to the family members of the dead security men, while a sombre announcement recalled their "valiant actions and supreme sacrifice". The Mumbai attacks, in which 10 gunmen killed 179 people in coordinated attacks, reignited tensions between the two South Asian rivals, with India blaming Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militants while also accusing Islamabad of not taking action. India, which has mounted a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan, is frustrated at what it sees as Pakistan's slow response in arresting planners of the attacks. Despite the tension, the chances of military confrontation between the old foes who have fought three wars since 1947 is low thanks in part to the diplomacy of the United States and other powers, analysts say. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did not attend the celebrations, which showcase the country's cultural heritage and military might, as he is recovering in hospital after a heart bypass operation last week. But his cabinet colleagues and opposition politicians attended the parade, watching tanks and armoured cars roll by, fighter jets roar through a misty winter sky in a full fly-past and helicopters hover overhead, showering the crowd of thousands with rose petals. Colourful floats from each of India's 29 states wound their way along Rajpath, or King's Path, past the VIP stand towards the ancient Red Fort in the old quarter. The country went on a high alert ahead of the annual military parade in New Delhi, which was turned into a fortress after police killed two suspected Pakistani militants in a pre-dawn car chase on Sunday just outside the city. "This year we have more policemen, more anti-aircraft guns and three helicopters ready to fly out with commandoes in case of any emergency," said Rajan Bhagat, Delhi police spokesman. Security was tight in other Indian cities as well, including Mumbai. The main railway station, a Jewish centre and two five star hotels were targets of the militants in the November attacks in Mumbai. Every year, rebels call for a boycott of India's Republic Day, which marks adoption of a republican constitution after independence from Britain, often attacking security forces and government buildings. Troops and police stepped up security in India's restive northeast, where rebels fighting Indian rule called a general strike on Monday. Maoist rebels were also observing a day-long strike in central India and set fire to about 20 vehicles. Separatist rebels in troubled Kashmir, where militant violence has fallen in recent years, called for a boycott of Republic Day celebrations
