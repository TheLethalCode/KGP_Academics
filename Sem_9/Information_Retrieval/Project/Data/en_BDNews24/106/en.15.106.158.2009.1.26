The lengthy email, written in English, was sent on behalf of a group calling itself the All-India Anti-Terrorism Group. It said Pakistan was linked to the Mumbai raids. "If the threat is taken lightly, it is 200 percent sure the envoy will be killed," the letter said.

India has provided Pakistan data from satellite phones used by the attackers and what it describes as the confession of the sole surviving gunman.
