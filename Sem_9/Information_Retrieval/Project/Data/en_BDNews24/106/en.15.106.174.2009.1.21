 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful saw the series-levelling triumph against Zimbabwe on Wednesday as s a relief for him and the team. The hosts level the series 1-1 with a convincing six-wicket win the second match with the decider slated for Friday. "It was a crucial match, specially after losing the first game to Zimbabwe and I now feel better defeating them," Ashraful told reporters at a post-match briefing at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Bangladesh captain was also upbeat about winning the series. "If we can play our best, I believe we will clinch the series." The 24-year old batsman praised all his pacers and spinners, who restricted Zimbabwe to 160 for nine in 50 overs. "After reducing Zimbabwe to 47 for six, we tried hard to break the seventh wicket between (Sean) Williams and (Prosper) Utseya, who adopted a defensive strategy and chose to not play big shots. "They, however, could not make so many runs. But, we will try to find a way-out to overcome such situation in future," said Ashraful, who played a 13-ball five, leaving Bangladesh side at 42 for two in 15.1 overs. "Yes, it was a bad shot, but it could have been better had I hit on top or below of the ball," said the top-order batsman, who was caught at short cover by Utseya off Raymond Price. Ashraful also admitted his decision to bowl first winning the toss in the series opener was wrong, "but we learnt this time." "We took the decision collectively that we would bowl first if we won the toss in the second match as the wicket was better compared to (the one for ) the first match," said Ashraful. Asked whether his captaincy was at risk, Ashraful said, "I will try to play better in the next match and put on some runs on the board." "I am not thinking of the captaincy as I am getting supports from all and I am trying my best." bdnew
