 MELBOURNE, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diminutive Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro continued her roller-coaster run at the Australian Open with a 6-3 6-2 fourth-round victory over compatriot Anabel Medina Garrigues on Monday. Suarez Navarro, who came from behind to upset sixth seed Venus Williams in the second round, was barely troubled, sealing victory in just 73 minutes with a forehand winner down the line after working Medina Garrigues around the court. The 20-year-old, who stands just 1.62 metres tall, used her strong backhand to help blast 20 clear winners and capitalised on four of her five break opportunities. She will play Russian fourth-seed Elena Dementieva in Wednesday's quarter-finals. "I think the next round is a very difficult match," Suarez Navarro said, speaking through an interpreter. "Dementieva is a very good player, it will be very difficult." Suarez Navarro, who speaks only a few words of English, is one of two unseeded women through to the last eight, along with Australian Jelena Dokic, but her progress is no real surprise although she is only playing in her fourth grand slam event. She burst onto the scene at last year's French Open when she made the quarter-finals, beating former world number one Amelie Mauresmo and Italian Flavia Pennetta along the way. Dementieva said she was impressed by Suarez Navarro the first time she saw her play and was not the least surprised by her progress at Melbourne Park. "I was watching her playing French Open last year when she qualified and played in the quarters beating Amelie Mauresmo," Dementieva said. "I think she's got a lot of talent, and she's physically very fit. So, no, I'm not surprised to be facing her." LATE STARTER Raised in the Canary Islands, Suarez Navarro did not start playing tennis until she was nine, encouraged to take up the sport by her mother, a former gymnast who worked as a teacher. Suarez Navarro turned professional in 2003 and spent the first four years playing lower-level ITF events, but her career did not take off until she left home to join a tennis academy in Barcelona. The following year she came through the qualifiers at the French Open and made the last eight, losing to current world number one Jelena Jankovic. She made such an impression that she was given a wildcard entry to Wimbledon, where she was beaten in the second round, again by Jankovic. She was picked for the Spanish team that made the Fed Cup final and made her Olympic debut at Beijing, before losing in the first round at the U.S. Open. Suarez Navarro finished 2008 ranked 50th in the world but is poised to go much higher after her great start in Australia and believes her experience in Paris last year will benefit her. "It's different because it's the second time, it's not the first time," she said. "I think I can play better than the first time with Jankovic in Roland Garros
