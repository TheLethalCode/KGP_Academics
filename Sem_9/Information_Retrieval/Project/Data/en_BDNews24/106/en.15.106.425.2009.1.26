<TITLE> FILM REVIEW: Why 'Slumdog' deserves an Oscar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Towheed Feroze Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)Some of you might be wondering why so much hype while others might dismiss it as a movie that just got lucky. Well, unless you have seen Slumdog Millionaire (I love the title, don't you?), it would be hasty to just brush it aside. Winning the Golden Globe was not luck, the film really has something that deserves attention  gripping human drama and all the elements of the present day urban tableau in the megacity that is Mumbai. Some have critcised the movie by saying that it tries to exploit the suffering of the Mumbai slums but that allegation doesn't hold up  taking the slum as a setting the film depicts an intriguing side of life in a thriving metropolitan city. Cinema critics also look for novelty and Slumdog brings it in bags  modern India's passion, emotion, rage, poverty, glitz, glamour, guns and technology. Put all that together and throw in some typical Bollywood style romance and you have a delicious, lip smacking film that refuses to let go till the end. But an Oscar? Well, why not? Slumdog's first strong point is a depiction of city life that is completely in tune with the frantic urbanisation experienced in this part of the world. And when Mumbai is the focus point, the stark contrasts in the elements form a very powerful combination. The unimaginable squalor of the slums, maiming of poor children to fit them into a life of begging, simmering tension between Hindus and Muslims, a dark urban underbelly dominated by gun culture, extortion and prostitution is contrasted with an astronomical rise in IT-based wealth and a society where fame, glory and money are the ultimate aspirations. The film is a candid look at what India is and, if India has for centuries seduced people with it promise of exoticism, then this film will do the same for movie lovers. Top all of that with that thing called destiny, and a country that never ceases to provide an astonishing array of cinematic vistas, and you have a winner. A number of hurriedly written reviews state that the movie is about a guy from the slum winning the biggest quiz show in the country and 20 million Rupees, but that description does not do justice to the film. Okay, we love it when a poor guy, against all odds, wins the jackpot, but Slumdog has several parallel stories that give us salacious insights into Mumbai in a dark sort of way  slum life and the overwhelming affluence just a stone's throw away, the city's underworld and 'the law' which may be haphazard and slow but ends being tough, unrelenting and merciless. Among the film's several layers  choose which one you want to fall in love with  the most powerful performance comes from Irfan Khan. Khan plays the tired, cynical, jaundiced police officer who does not believe in miracles and trusts only his instincts. Here we have the law of the subcontinent where no one flinches as electric shock is applied in the crudest possible way. Of course, many in the audience here will be struck by the love story that unfolds, and it's one hundred per cent Bollywood. But then, we do love Bollywood don't we? Unquestionably! If Slumdog gives us raw, unvarnished chunks of life filled with suffering, deception, lies and communal tension, it also presents a life where affluence is perennial and fame is a constant companion. And it's the astute blend that makes the movie so seductive. This is an unashamedly urban film that celebrates 'new money'. But, there is also a place for some good old melodrama involving love and destiny triumphing over all odds. We love miracles and we love to believe that somewhere down the line, destiny will play a marvellous twist in our lives. So, for which of the following reasons should Slumdog win an Oscar? A. It's a unique film. B. It's a multi-layered and multifaceted reflection of urban life. C. Destiny triumphs. If you ask me, I'll go for C. Am I sure? Of course, please lock answer C and let our belief in a miracle still survive. bd
