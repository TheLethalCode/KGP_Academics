<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England batsman Alastair Cook will serve as Andrew Strauss's vice-captain in the four-test series against West Indies which starts next month. "It is a very unofficial position but it is another chance for me to gain some valuable leadership experience and help Strauss in any way I can," Cook told the England and Wales Cricket Board's official website (www.ecb.co.uk) on Saturday. Strauss was appointed captain earlier this month after the turmoil surrounding the resignation of Kevin Pietersen and the sacking of England coach Peter Moores. The 24-year-old Cook is hoping his relative youth will bring a fresh perspective to the role of vice-captain. "He (Strauss) will need support not just from me but from the other senior players as well," said Cook. "We have a lot of leadership experience in the dressing room with three other guys who have captained England (Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and former one-day skipper Paul Collingwood). "They will be there to offer help and ideas and I can give them the viewpoint of someone that is slightly younger and might come at things from a different angle." The first test in Kingston, Jamaica starts on Feb.
