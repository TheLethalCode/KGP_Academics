<TITLE> Taylor can be genuine all rounder, says W.Indies coach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies coach John Dyson is hoping fast bowler Jerome Taylor can complete his transformation into a genuine all-rounder in next month's home test series against England. The paceman has been the main strike bowling threat for the West Indians in the past two years but Dyson has spent 12 months encouraging the Jamaican to improve his batting. Taylor responded with a knock of 106 in 107 balls against New Zealand in Dunedin last month. "Jerome will be aiming to build on his new all-rounder status following his maiden test century at Dunedin," Australian Dyson said in a news release on Friday. "Our bowling will again revolve around the pace of Jerome, Fidel Edwards and Daren Powell. They are no longer a rookie combination and big things are expected of them. "Edwards had a fine series in New Zealand and his pace and controlled aggression will be important weapons in the series and we will need strong support from Taylor and Powell if we are going to bowl out England," added Dyson. Taylor has a modest test batting average of 16.66 but he has improved dramatically since Dyson asked him to re-focus on that side of his game and he has moved up the order to number eight. West Indies have been plagued by middle-order collapses in recent series but Dyson has set about trying to address that issue by working on Taylor's batting and introducing Australian-born Brendan Nash at number six. Nash hit 74 and 65 in the drawn second test against the Kiwis and Dyson is hoping he can continue providing valuable support to the consistent Shivnarine Chanderpaul. "He (Nash) had an excellent debut series in New Zealand and will look to build on that impressive start and get his first test century," said Dyson
