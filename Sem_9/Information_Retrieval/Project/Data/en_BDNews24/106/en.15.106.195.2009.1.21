<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The government will form a high-powered panel drawing on experts from government, opposition and businesses in 15 days to combat the possible fallouts of the global meltdown on the local economy, the finance minister has said. "It's not clear yet what kind of negative impacts the ongoing global crisis may have on our economy. Different business organisations including the FBCCI, MCCI are anxious and we're observing the situation carefully," Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said on Wednesday. He said the committee that would be formed in 15 days will assess the global economic condition and suggest measures to avert the impacts. The finance minister was talking to reporters emerging from a meeting with the leaders of Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industries at the Secretariat in the evening. The committee will make recommendations on economic issues including what should be the interest rate on bank loan to survive the competition in the international market and what should be currency exchange rate, he said. "Its normal that if the inflation is less, the rate of interest on bank loan will also come down, as the [rate] is directly connected to inflation." "But it's a pity that this does not happen to our country," the minister said. Even during the previous Awami League tenure, when the inflation rate was two percent, the interests on bank loan were higher, Muhit said. A few days back (during the caretaker government), when the inflation touched double-digit, interests on bank loan were higher; but now although the inflation has come down much, those have remained the same, the minister observed. The committee will consider a cut in interests on bank loan, Muhith said. He said his government would continue with the activities of Bangladesh Better Business Forum (BDDF), formed during the tenure of the caretaker government. "The forum was formed with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed as chief during the caretaker government to pace up the country's economy." "The business leaders have said the forum showed efficiency and recommended that it be continued with. We'll continue it," Muhith said. "The main goal of our government is to take the country forward on the basis of partnership between the government and private sectors," he asserted. MCCI president Asif Chowdhury led the business representatives' team. bdnews
