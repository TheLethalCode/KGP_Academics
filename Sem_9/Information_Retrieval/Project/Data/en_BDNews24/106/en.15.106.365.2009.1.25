 Dhaka Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)New Speaker Abdul Hamid has invited opposition MPs to hold the ruling party accountable through 'strong criticism'. Veteran no-nonsense parliamentarian Hamid became the Speaker and retired colonel Shawkat Ali Deputy Speaker in the first sitting of the new parliament Sunday. In his maiden speech, the second-time speaker stressed active participation by all members of the House. "I hope the opposition will strongly criticise the ruling party's flaws," said Hamid. He also asked members of parliament to work towards the country's economic development, "free of all political interests". "Let our aim be to free this country of poverty." The ninth Parliament unanimously elected Hamid for the top office on a formal proposal from chief whip Abdus Shahid, seconded by whip Shagufta Yasmin Emily. Ali's election was also unanimous, on a proposal from whip A SM Feroj. Another whip Mujibul Huq supported him. Opposition BNP lawmakers were silent as the two were voted in. Sircar bids farewell, advises 'tolerance' The outgoing Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar adjourned the House at 3.44pm to allow oath-taking of the two new presiding officers by the President. Sircar in his farewell speech said solutions to all problems are inherent in democracy. "What is needed is a proper political culture and tolerance," he said. The outgoing speaker asked all to cooperate with the newly elected speaker and deputy speaker. President Iajuddin Ahmed, who had arrived at the parliament building at around 2.30 pm, administered the oaths at 4.15pm at his seventh floor office. After the swearing in, Abdul Hamid went to the speaker's office. Outgoing speaker Sircar stood up from the Speaker's chair and requested Hamid to sit on. Hamid's decades in politics Hamid, who was deputy leader of the opposition in the last parliament, was also speaker in the seventh parliament when the Awami League was in government. A lawyer by profession, Hamid has been involved with Awami League since the 1960s. He was elected member of the Pakistan National Assembly in 1970 at the age of 25. In his congratulatory remarks, 1960s student movement veteran Tofail Ahmed paid tribute to the new speaker, recalling Hamid's election as the youngest MNA nearly four decades ago. Tofail also referred to the post-1975 difficult days together with Hamid in jail. The Kishoreganj MP was elected deputy speaker of the 7th parliament when Awami League went into power in 1996. After Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury's death, Hamid succeeded him. Hamid was also elected MP in 1973, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2008 general elections on his party tickets. BNP deputy speaker Since the Awami League did not offer the post of deputy speaker to the opposition at the first sitting, the government, if it wants to keep its pre-polls pledge, will have to amend the article 74 of the constitution to create a second post . The BNP had hinted that it would accept the post of deputy speaker only if it was offered on the first day. bdnews24.com/
