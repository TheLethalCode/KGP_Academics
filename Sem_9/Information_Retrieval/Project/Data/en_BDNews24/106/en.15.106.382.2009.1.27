 BANGKOK, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More Rohingya migrants from Myanmar have arrived in Thailand but are being held by police rather than the army, which has towed hundreds of others far out to sea before abandoning them, police said on Tuesday. Police Colonel Veerasilp Kwanseng, head of Paknam district station in Ranong in southwest Thailand, said the navy had handed over 78 Rohingya, an oppressed Muslim minority from northwest Myanmar, or Burma as it used to be known. A dozen of the group were under 18, he said. "Most of them were suffering from quite serious exhaustion and required medical assistance. We have local medics looking after them," he told Reuters. "Many had wounds on their bodies, but I don't know exactly what caused them." Another officer said the migrants had reported the wounds as whiplashes inflicted by Myanmar government officials. The group's handling by police is a break with the army's secretive processing of other Rohingya on a remote Andaman Sea island before towing them out to sea and abandoning them in rickety, engine-less boats. A Rohingya rights group says 550 of nearly 1,000 towed out to sea since early December were feared to have drowned. NBT television showed pictures of the emaciated and exhausted men in the latest group being treated by medics and holding registration papers. Veerasilp said the 78, who were found floating near Thailand's Surin Islands after an unknown period at sea, would be prosecuted for illegal immigration. The offence carries a fine of up to 2,000 baht, but is seldom enforced in the case of destitute immigrants. More than 230,000 Rohingya are living a precarious, stateless existence in Bangladesh, having fled decades of persecution at the hands of Myanmar's Buddhist generals, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Tens of thousands more have left, often in rickety wooden boats, in search of a better life elsewhere. Many have ended up in Malaysia, where more than 14,000 are formally registered as refugees and thousands more work as casual labourers
