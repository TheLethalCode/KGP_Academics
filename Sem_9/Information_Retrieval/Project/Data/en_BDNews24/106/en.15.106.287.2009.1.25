 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh looks to provide free healthcare facilities to all with community clinics across the country, the health minister said on Sunday. "Basic health facilities will be provided by health workers at community clinics. Medicines will be given for free," said Professor Dr AFM Ruhul Huq. The minister said the government had asked the World Health Organisation for assistance to run the community clinics across the country. "Some 8,000 clinics have already been set up with another 10,000 in the pipeline," Prof Huq, who attended several sessions of the WHO's 124th executive board meeting in Geneva, told a press conference on Sunday at his ministry. Huq said the Geneva meeting looked at e-health, which could be part of the present government's pledge of a 'Digital Bangladesh by 2021'. "We also discussed aspects of disaster management as Bangladesh is disaster prone. World communities, especially China, assured assistance to develop disaster management here." "Impacts of the ongoing world economic crisis on health were also discussed in the session. But it will not affect the Bangladesh health sector," said the minister. The WHO meeting commenced on Jan. 19 in Geneva and is expected to end on Jan. 29. A six-member Bangladesh delegation headed by the health minister took part in the opening session. bdnews
