 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Britain will increase development assistance to Bangladesh to help the new government implement the election manifesto, said a visiting director general of the UK's Department for International Development (DFID). Mark Lowcock said the British government would increase its aid to Bangladesh in the coming fiscal year despite economic recession in Britain. "The British government will increase its development assistance to Bangladesh. We expect in the 2010-11 financial year to provide 150 million pounds," he said. "The British government can provide support to Bangladesh in the implementation of the manifestos of the government that has been elected," Lowcock told bdnews24.com after meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni at the foreign ministry on Thursday. "(We can provide support) especially on development cooperation, health, education, support for higher incomes for poor people of the country dealing with climate change, improving the governance of the country, and the ways public service are being provided," he said. "It is very much our intention to continue to support countries which are demonstrating their own intention to grow and reduce poverty, and provide better lives to their citizens, men and women, girls and boys." The DFID aid to Bangladesh in the current 2008-09 fiscal year is 114 million pounds. The UK in September last year also committed to provide 75 million pounds to the newly created multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) for climate change adaptation and mitigation for Bangladesh, considered to be one of the worst victims of climate change. Britain also urged other international donors to contribute to the MDTF for mitigation and adaptation programmes in Bangladesh. Until now, the UK is the only country to contribute to the MDTF. Lowcock said it was a priority for Britain to set up the real multi-donor trust fund for Bangladesh as the international community would have interest in climate change victims in 2009 ahead of the climate change negotiation in Copenhagen, Denmark. "We think that Bangladesh is a model other countries can follow in dealing with (climate change) adaptation. So the British government is very very keen to mobilise international support," said Lowcock
