<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Railway Bhaban break-in probe has found that no files were stolen from the headquarters after the incident, says the investigation committee. "There were no files missing in the break-in," the four-member committee said in its 143-page report submitted to railway director general Belayet Hossain on Sunday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina last Wednesday ordered an "immediate probe" into the break-in at Rail headquarters on the night of Jan 17 that left 56 offices being ransacked, according to police. Just one day later, DMP's Detective Branch said they had arrested prime suspect M Enamul Huq Khokan, who confessed that he and six accomplices carried out the 'burglary'. Cash and valuables, including a laptop and mobile phones, were looted during the incident. It was not clear at the time whether documents were missing. DB arrested Khokan from the city's Gulshan area on Jan 22 and recovered stolen goods, including Tk 5,000 and a mobile phone set, as well as 10 screwdrivers used for breaking locks and a microbus for the getaway, said police. "It was just a burglary and there was no other motive," said Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Nayeem Ahmed said at the time. Head of the committee, Bangladesh railway's joint director general Habib Ahmed, also told bdnews24.com on Sunday, "We haven't got any evidence of missing of files. It was just a burglary." bdnews24.
