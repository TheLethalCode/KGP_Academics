 MADRID, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid have been fined 3,000 euros ($3,900) by the Spanish football federation (RFEF) after a group of their fans were reported by a referee for making what he termed fascist gestures and chanting fascist slogans. Referee Alfonso Perez Burrull said in his report from Sunday's home Primera Liga match against Osasuna that some Real fans were waving flags and banners with "extremist or radical symbolism". He also referred to "chants making reference to the gas chamber, death to Osasuna and fascists forever" and said they were accompanied by gestures and signs "of a fascist nature". An RFEF spokesman said Real, who have had trouble in the past with a group of radical fans known as the "Ultra Sur", had been punished for breaching a rule that aims to prevent xenophobia and intolerance. Their latest fine is the same as the one levied by the RFEF on Sevilla striker Frederic Kanoute this month after he uncovered a shirt with the word "Palestine" written on it in several languages when he scored in a King's Cup match
