<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  The world's best all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan took three wickets and hit an unbeaten 33 to help Bangladesh take the three-ODI series 2-1 with an emphatic six-wicket win over Zimbabwe in Dhaka on Friday. Bangladesh reached 121 for four with 27 balls to go after the bowlers kept their performance up to restrict the Africans to 119 for nine in the fog-curtailed 37-over-a-side affair in the third and final match at Shere-e-Bangla National Stadium. Shakib won the man-of-the-series award and proved why he is the best all-rounder in world one day after the ICC revealed its ODI all-rounder ranking on Thursday. Opener Tamim Iqbal provided a fine foundation contributing 34 off 49 balls studded with five fours. After the dismissals of Mehrab Hossain Junior (2 off 25 balls) and Tamim, the Zimbabwe spinners tightened grip on Bangladesh with Mohammad Ashraful seemingly playing Test cricket. Finally, Ashraful was removed by spinner Raymond Price for 3 off 31 balls to continue his lean patch with the bat. Shakib came in the crease to ease the pressure along with Roqibul Hasan, trapped leg before by Prince for 14 to leave the hosts at 89 for four in 24.5 overs. The 21-year old all-rounder then put on 32 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim, who remained unbeaten on 20 off 31 that included three fours. Tamim Iqbal edged Christopher Mpofu to wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu off for 34 off 49 balls, studded with five fours after Mehrab Hossain fell short of the crease for a 25-ball two. Earlier, the Bangladesh bowlers kept their performance up to restrict the visitors to a moderate total in the 37-over-a-side affair after dense fog delayed the start for more than two hours. Pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, adjudged man of the match, led the attack rocking the visitors' top order with three for 26 while spin duo Shakib and Mahmudullah Riyad wrecked the middle and lower orders to share five scalps. Ashraful did not make mistake to choose to bowl first amid foggy conditions after winning the toss for the third time in a row. Mashrafee justified his decision making the inroad in the very fifth delivery of the innings as the strike bowler trapped opener Vusimuzi Sibanda leg before for a five-ball duck. Then, he removed Hamilton Masakadza, who had looked much confident having hit Nazmul Hossain for two fours, for 10 off 11 balls before uprooting the stumps of Stuart Matsekenyeri, also for 10 to reduce the visitors to 31 for three in 8.4 overs. First-change pacer Rubel Hossain followed up Mashrafee's feat to have Tatenda Taibu caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim for 12 in his first over. Reduced to 44 for four inside 13 overs, Sean Williams and Prosper Utseya, who had rescued Zimbabwe with a 96-run seventh-wicket partnership in the previous match, negotiated pacers Rubel and Nazmul and Naeemd Islam well to grow in confidence. But, the Bangladesh captain gambled by giving the ball to off-spinner Mahmudullah, who trapped Utseya lbw to break the 25-run fifth wicket. Mahmudullah in his third over got the prized wicket of Williams, who struck 59 in the previous match. Williams played a 46-ball 38 studded with five fours before being bowled by Mahmudullah, who took two for 19. Afterwards, left-arm spinner Shakib dismissed Elton Chigumbura (7), Raymond Price (7) Edward Rainsford (1) in a row to return three for 15 in his eight-over spell. Keith Dabengwa, however, remained unbeaten at 21 to take Zimbabwe beyond the 100-mark. b
