 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered an immediate investigation into the break-ins at Railway headquarters in Dhaka and Chittagong, and sacking security officials who were on duty during the occurrence. "The PM directed the home ministry to probe into the incidents at Railway Bhaban in Dhaka and the regional office in Chittagong, starting immediately with firing of the security guards as a first step," the PM's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said on Wednesday. Hasina gave the directive at the 103rd meeting of the National Implementation Committee for Administrative Restructuring, he said. The two Rail headquarters saw separate but near simultaneous break-ins by unknown intruders on Sunday night, with 56 offices being ransacked and valuables looted at the capital's Railway Bhaban. Police have so far said the two incidents were unrelated. Wednesday's NICAR meeting decided on ten issues in restructuring of administration, said Azad. They include vehicles for chief judicial magistrates of 64 districts and chief metropolitan magistrates of four districts, creation of 475 new Upazila level education posts, establish fire brigades in six Upazilas and create 113 new posts at BSTI. The six Upazilas are Sherpur in Bogra, Sree Nagar in Munshiganj, Dayarampur in Natore, Choura Bazar in Comilla, Harinakundu in Jhenaidah and Pekua in Cox's Bazar. The meeting also decided to set up fire stations in all 481 Upazilas countrywide. It decided to create a new Upazila by breaking 10 unions of Brahmanbaria Sadar and establish police investigation centres at Bashbari in Narsinghdi and Doulatkhan in Bhola by creating 20 new police posts. bdnews24.
