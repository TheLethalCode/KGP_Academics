<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Just a day after prime minister Sheikh Hasina's order for an "immediate probe" into the Rail Bhaban break-in, DMP's Detective Branch on Thursday claimed seven people were involved. "We arrested one suspect who confessed his involvement and others will be nabbed," said Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Nayeem Ahmed at a briefing. "It was just a burglary and there was no other motive," said the commissioner. DB members arrested M Enamul Huq Khokan, who confessed that he and his accomplices used screwdrivers and a shovel for what he said was "just burglary". "Based on his confessional statement police have already raided different places in Dhaka and Narayanganj," said the commissioner. DB police arrested Khokan from the city's Gulshan area and recovered stolen goods, including Tk 5000 and a mobile phone set, as well as 10 screwdrivers used for breaking locks and a microbus for the getaway, said police. Khokan, appearing under police custody, told the reporters he used to work as a microbus driver for a zipper factory. Now a rental-car owner, Khokan said: "I planned the burglary when I was passing by Rail Bhaban a few days ago." Khokan said he and his accomplices 'Milon', 'Halim', 'Nurul Islam', 'Arif', 'Bashar' and 'Shahjahan' went in a rented microbus to Rail Bhaban Sunday midnight. "We entered the building by breaking open a glass window on the western wall of the building. After that we used screw drivers and the shovel to break the locks." After four hours of unhindered looting they fled the scene with their stolen goods, said Khokan. Police said some 56 rooms of Rail Bhaban were ransacked on the night of Jan 17. Cash and valuables, including a laptop and mobile phones, were looted. It is still not clear whether any documents went missing from the ransacked offices. bdnew
