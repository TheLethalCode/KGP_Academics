 Cox's Bazar, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Elections to Ukhia Upazila in Cox's Bazar have been called off, the district commissioner told bdnews24.com around 11pm on Wednesday, after 54 people were hurt as police and paramilitary BDR shot at unruly protesters earlier in the day. Manzur Alam Bhuiyan, the DC of the southeastern tourist district, said, "Tomorrow's elections have been verbally postponed at the directive of the Election Commission. A written order will be made available tomorrow." Ukhia Upazila Nirbahi officer Abu Ahmad Siddiqui also announced the postponement at around 11:30pm. Returning officer and additional DC M Omar Faruk said, "The process of deferring elections in Ukhia is on for the sake of holding a violence-free vote. However, I know of no final decision yet." The DC and district police chief were on the scene but Faruk said he did not have the details of the incident as he had been in Cox's Bazar town, some 37 km south off Ukhia. Senior assistant secretary at the EC Secretariat, Md. Abdul Baten, told bdnews24.com the polls to the Upazila were being postponed. He added an order would be issued by the EC on Thursday. The violence followed the Election Commission's cancelled candidacy of a local Awami League leader. "[The protesters] rampaged through a bus station and damaged shops in the area," said Ukhia police officer in charge Mustafa Kamal. The EC on Monday announced that Hamidul Huq Chowdhury, the general secretary of the Ukhia chapter of the Awami League, would not be allowed to run for Ukhia Upazila chairman on grounds of loan default. "Some 54 people were hurt, at least four of them sustaining bullet injuries, in clashes between the protesters and members of BDR, police and Ansar," said the OC. Among the four sustaining bullet injuries, Akhter, 22, Mohammad Ali, 35 and another unidentified man were rushed to Ukhia Upazila Health Complex. The fourth, Shahabuddin, was transferred on to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital. Police and witnesses said the mob tried to storm the local Upazila complex. "They snatched eight ballot boxes from a jeep headed to Thainkali Primary School polling centre and smashed them," said Mustafa. "They also took away 2,807 ballot papers which they later set fire to." Members of police and BDR were also among the injured, as was the candidate's wife Nigar Sultana Huq, said the police officer. Hamidul, who after visiting the spot fainted, was admitted to the Upazila health complex. The OC told bdnews24.com, "The Awami League demonstrators supporting Hamidul blockaded the main road." The incident brought traffic to a halt on the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf road until around 5pm, he added. The demonstrators had calmed down and were withdrawing barricades, and traffic movement had resumed in the evening, Mustafa said. However, Hamidul's media officer, Azad, who gave only one name, said Wednesday night, "The demonstration is still on-going. The protestors will not budge until they get a written order." District and Upazila election officials met with local AL leaders to discuss ways to restore normalcy. bdnews24.com/corr/msb/mt/
