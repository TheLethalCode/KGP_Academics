<TITLE> Political implications of Manmohan Singh's ill-health </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Fri Jan 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will undergo coronary artery bypass surgery on Saturday, only a few months before he is due to lead the ruling Congress party into general elections. Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee could take over prime ministerial responsibilities while Singh recovers. Here are some questions and answers on what implications Singh's ill-health could have. WILL SINGH LEAD CONGRESS PARTY INTO ELECTIONS? Still the most likely scenario assuming there are no complications in surgery and Singh recovers in a matter of weeks. Congress has repeatedly flagged Singh, seen as the father of economic reforms that led to India's unprecedented economic boom, as the best choice to take the party into the elections. WILL SINGH'S ILL-HEALTH HURT CONGRESS' ELECTION PROSPECTS? Maybe not. Analysts say neither Manmohan Singh nor Pranab Mukherjee are big campaigners and would not have been the best poster boys for the elections in any case. Congress' star performers are seen as party chief Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, who is reportedly earmarked as Singh's eventual successor. That said, opposition parties may start publicly asking who is leading the country in Singh's absence. WHAT IF SINGH'S RECOVERY IS SLOWER THAN EXPECTED? Pranab Mukherjee may carry on as acting prime minister if Singh makes a slow recovery. But most analysts see him as nothing more than a stop-gap, as Mukherjee has a prickly history with his own party. He was suspended from Congress in 1986 after being accused of disloyalty to the party under former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia's assassinated husband. Congress' former leftist allies, who pulled out of the government coalition after Singh secured a civilian nuclear deal with the United States, might look at Congress more favourably if Singh withdraws. Mukherjee has closer ties to the Left. If Congress wins the elections, the party's head Sonia Gandhi could well choose a new prime minister, one that her coalition partners would agree on. COULD RAHUL GANDHI TAKE OVER AS PM IF CONGRESS WINS? There has been some speculation that Rahul Gandhi, heir to India's most famous political dynasty, will take over as prime minister if Congress gets re-elected. While analysts do not rule out the possibility, most see him as too young, inexperienced and an unknown quantity. Amid heightened tensions with Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks, India may well want an experienced hand at the helm. WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON INDIA-PAKISTAN TENSIONS? As foreign minister, Mukherjee exerts huge influence anyway on India's stance towards Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks. So policy would unlikely change if he is the acting prime minister
