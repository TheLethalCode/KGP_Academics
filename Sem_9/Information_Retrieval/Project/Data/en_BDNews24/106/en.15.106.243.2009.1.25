 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith said on Sunday that the government would not lift restrictions on all bank accounts frozen by the emergency administration, hinting some may be freed. "Why should we lift the embargo on all? There is no question of doing that," Muhith told reporters, referring to nearly 300 accounts of top politicians and businessmen.
