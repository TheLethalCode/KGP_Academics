 LONDON, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp said he will send a weakened team out against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round this weekend because his priority is his side's relegation battle. "We've got some tough games, we've a game at Man United that really is so secondary to me now," Redknapp told Sky Sports after a torrid night at Burnley on Wednesday. Spurs were within two minutes of an embarrassing League Cup semi-final defeat against the Championship (second division) side when they trailed 3-0 at Turf Moor, before two late goals in extra time sealed a 6-4 aggregate victory. "If Alex is listening, I'm really going to send a real mish-mash team up there. I hope it doesn't upset the fans, but we played extra time and we're out on our feet a little bit," added Redknapp. Spurs are one of five clubs at the bottom of the table on 21 points and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. Next Tuesday they face fellow strugglers Stoke City at home. "The lads who didn't play tonight will play and I'm going to rest the key players who played tonight because I can't afford to lose any more to injuries," Redknapp said. "It will be a real very, very weakened team going to Old Trafford because we play Stoke on Tuesday. "We're in a relegation battle and need to get a team together to play against Stoke.
