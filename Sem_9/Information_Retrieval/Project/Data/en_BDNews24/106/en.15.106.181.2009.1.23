 TBILISI, Fri Jan 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading rights watchdog urged Russia and Georgia on Friday to investigate indiscriminate attacks and human rights violations, including possible war crimes, committed during their war last year. Human Rights Watch released a 200-page report documenting attacks on civilians during the five-day conflict when Russia repelled a Georgian assault on South Ossetia, a pro-Russian region that threw off Tbilisi's rule in the early 1990s. They include Georgia's assault with multiple-rocket launchers on the separatist capital Tskhinvali, alleged ethnic cleansing by South Ossetian forces, Russian bombing of apartment buildings and the use of cluster munitions by both sides. "Both Georgia and Russia should undertake an impartial and thorough investigation into abuses committed by their forces," HRW Europe and Central Asia director Rachel Denber said in a statement issued with the report. "Human Rights Watch urges the Georgian and Russian governments to investigate and hold accountable those from their respective forces responsible for international humanitarian law violations, including war crimes," the report states. Russia and former Soviet Georgia deny using excessive force or targeting civilians. South Ossetia's separatist authorities have also denied targeting ethnic Georgian civilians. Georgia says 228 Georgian civilians and 169 servicemen died. The Investigation Committee of the Russian Prosecutor-General's Office says it has documented the deaths of 165 South Ossetians, but that work is ongoing. During the war, Russia cited a South Ossetian death toll of 2,000. At one point, over 100,000 people were displaced on both sides. "WAR CRIMES" The use of multiple-rocket launchers -- capable of firing 40 rockets in 20 seconds -- on Tskhinvali "shows that Georgian forces attacked South Ossetia with blatant disregard to the safety of civilians," the report said. It said Russian forces, in a number of instances, "used indiscriminate aerial, artillery, and tank fire strikes, killing and wounding many civilians." Russia also failed in its duty as an occupying power to ensure public order and safety. "Instead of protecting civilians, Russian forces allowed South Ossetian forces who followed in their path to engage in wanton and widespread pillage and burning of Georgian homes and to kill, beat, rape, and threaten civilians," Denber said. "Such deliberate attacks are war crimes, and if committed as part of a widespread or systematic pattern, they may be prosecuted as a crime against humanity." Such crimes fall under the remit of the International Criminal Court. The West said Russia's response was disproportionate but it shied away from sanctions. Russia said it was obliged to intervene over its southern border to help its peacekeepers and save South Ossetian civilians, many holding Russian passports. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, accused by opponents of dragging Georgia into a war it could not possibly win, says he acted after separatists stepped up attacks on Georgian villages, and accused Russia of sending in armor to help them
