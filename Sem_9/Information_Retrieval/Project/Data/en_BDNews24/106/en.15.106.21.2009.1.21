 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The annual development grants from the European Union would not come down despite economic meltdown in the member countries, the EU presidency has assured Bangladesh. After meeting foreign minister Dipu Moni on Wednesday, Swedish ambassador Britt F Hogstrom on behalf of the EU Presidency said the 27-member European grouping wanted to see democratic practice to continue in Bangladesh. "We think that, when it comes to our commitment, they (EU grants) are still there. And we have seen so far no signs of declining. So we look forward to try to have more (grants)," said Hogstrom at the foreign ministry. "We hope that if the development works are in the right way, we will continue and we will not see any decrease (in grants)". She said the EU countries disbursed Euro 550 million in development assistance to Bangladesh last year. Hogstrom led eight EU missions in Bangladesh to meeting with Moni as Sweden looks after the EU presidency on behalf of Czech Republic, the current EU chair. "We have raised a number of issues regarding future democratic development," the ambassador said. She said Bangladesh should continue democratic practice though it would be a challenge. EU ambassador Stefan Frowein, British high commissioner Stephen Evans, the Dutch ambassador Bea ten Tuscher, German ambassador Frank Meyke, Danish ambassador Einar Hobogaard Jensen, Italian ambassador Itala Maria Marta Occhi, Spanish ambassador Arturo Perez and the charge d'affaires of French embassy also attended the meeting.
