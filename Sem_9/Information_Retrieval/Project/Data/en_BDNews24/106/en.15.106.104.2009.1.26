 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The government will import 13 lakh tonnes of fuel oil and another 1.5 lakh of urea this year, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Monday. "Seven lakh metric tonnes of crude fuel will be imported from Saudi Arabia and the other six lakh tonnes from UAE," Muhith told reporters after a cabinet committee meeting on government procurement. "A decision on the premium (shipment cost) will, however, be decided later," he said. The meeting also decided to import 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of urea this year to boost supplies, though the current fertiliser reserve is satisfactory, said the finance minister. Of the total amount, to be imported through Chittagong and Mongla ports, 75,000 tonnes will be field urea and the rest granular urea, said Muhith. Some 37,500 tonnes of the former at a cost of $298-301 per tonne and another 37,500 tonnes of granular urea at $299.37 per tonne will be imported through Chittagong port. Another 37,500 tonnes of field urea at $314.16 per tonne and another 37,500 tonnes of granular urea at $314.37 per tonne will be imported through Mongla port, he said. bdnews24.com/a
