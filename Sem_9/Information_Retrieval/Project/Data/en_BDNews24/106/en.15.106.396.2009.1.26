<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will only support 'routine ordinances' of the caretaker government, said a senior party leader on Monday. "Any other ordinances will not be supported in parliament by the BNP-led opposition," said Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, MP and parliamentary adviser to leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. The BNP leader, after a meeting of the party's MPs, told bdnews24.com they would strongly oppose the Upazila Ordinance in particular. He said the opposition BNP would support about 40 ordinances out of the total 122 passed by the previous interim government. "We are evaluating the ordinances because we feel that many of them are not consistent with the Constitution," said Chowdhury. "The Upazila Parishad system was created through a parliamentary act and any amendment to the law has to be made by parliament," he said. "Issuance of an ordinance in regard to this law is not legitimate, an BNP will oppose it." On BNP taking up a post as deputy speaker, he said, "Before polls, Sheikh Hasina said that if Awami League goes to power then the post of deputy speaker will go to the opposition, but that has not happened." "The opposition will not be involved in the creation of an additional post of deputy speaker," added Chowdhury. The meeting of BNP MPs, held at the Jatiya Sangsad, was presided over by Chowdhury. MK Anwar, Barkatullah Bulu, Jainal Abedin Faruk, Zafrul Islam Chowdhury, Mujibur Rahman Sarwar, Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad, and others were present. bdnew
