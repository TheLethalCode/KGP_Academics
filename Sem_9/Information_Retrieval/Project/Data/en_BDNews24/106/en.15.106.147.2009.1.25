 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  Heavy fog disrupted flights and ferries overnight to Sunday morning. Azad Zahirul Islam, senior traffic officer at Zia International Airport told bdnews24.com authorities had halted flight departures and arrivals at the airport after Saturday midnight due to poor visibility. At least one flight, of Royal Bhutan Airlines, was diverted to Kolkata early Sunday. Flights resumed shortly after 11 Sunday morning as the fog cleared somewhat, the official said. Ferry, launch and other river transport came to a halt for the second night too as dense fog blanketed the country Friday and to Saturday morning, BIWTC officials said. The unusually heavy fog is forecast to last two to three more days, met officials had said on Saturday. "Fog is falling across vast areas of Bangladesh, India and Nepal, but it is heaviest in Bangladesh at the moment with high levels of water vapour blending with pollutants in the air," said chief meteorologist Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma. On-duty meteorologist Rasheduzzaman told bdnews24.com massive amounts of airborne water vapour was rushing to Bangladesh from the Arabian Sea, turning into heavy fog as temperatures drop at night. Sharma said cold waves may sweep the country into February, adding that two cold waves had already blown over the country this winter. "The cold is more severe than the fog. Both are lasting longer this year," he said. bdnews
