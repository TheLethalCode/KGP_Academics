 MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fernando Gonzalez came from two sets down and saved a match point in a marathon four hour, nine minute 3-6 3-6 7-6 6-2 12-10 win over France's Richard Gasquet in the third round of the Australian Open on Saturday. Chile's Gonzalez, the 2007 finalist at Melbourne Park, saved a match point in the third set tiebreak before he fought back to win the match in which the fifth set alone lasted 88 minutes. "He was playing really a high level. I mean, he was playing like a superhero," Gonzalez said of Gasquet's performance in the first two sets. "I mean, I couldn't do anything. "If I went for my shots, he was coming with another better one. So, it was very tough in the beginning. "I saw he was really tired in the fourth set, fifth set. When we went to the fifth set, I felt really good. I felt the favorite for the match. "I mean, you know, six-all, eight-all, nine-all, 10-all, anything can happen. You have to keep fighting and wait for your chances. "It feels great. I have really a lot of support from the Chilean fans. It was really, really exciting to be out there." While the pair thrilled the crowd on Margaret Court Arena, they were well off the record for a grand slam fifth set, which was also played at the Australian Open in 2003. Andy Roddick beat Younes El Aynaoui 4-6 7-6 4-6 6-4 21-19 and that quarter-final match lasted four hours, 59 minutes. The deciding set lasted two hours, 23 minutes. Gonzalez earned a fourth round match-up against Rafael Nadal, who beat Tommy Haas 6-4 6-2 6-2, shortly before Gonzalez clinched his own victory. Nadal had gone on to court on Rod Laver Arena almost two hours after Gonzalez and Gasquet began their match. In contrast to Gonzalez, the world number one has played a total of four hours, 47 minutes in his three matches so far
