<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham scored his first goal for AC Milan in their 4-1 Serie A win at Bologna, while team mate Kaka netted twice less than a week after turning down a world-record move to Manchester City. Barcelona maintained their 12-point lead at the top of the Primera Liga with a 4-1 crushing of Numancia, while in England holders Portsmouth were knocked out of the FA Cup in the fourth round by second division Swansea. SPAIN Barcelona continued to set the pace in the Primera Liga in terms of results and spectacle as they maintained their 12-point lead at the top this weekend. Numancia are the only side to have beaten Barca in the league this season but they failed to complete an unlikely double on Saturday as Lionel Messi scored twice in Barca's 4-1 win at the Nou Camp. Champions Real Madrid moved clear in second after grinding out their fifth victory in a row by beating Deportivo Coruna 1-0 at the Bernabeu on Sunday. But third-placed Sevilla and fourth-placed Valencia both slipped further behind as they suffered surprise defeats, while Villarreal in fifth drew 1-1 at home with bottom club Osasuna. ITALY David Beckham netted his first Serie A goal and Kaka scored twice after a difficult week to give third-placed AC Milan a 4-1 comeback win at Bologna. Kaka, whose world-record move to Manchester City collapsed last Monday, converted a penalty and fired in a superb strike before Beckham wrapped things up with a near-post finish. Leaders Inter Milan regained their three-point advantage thanks to Adriano's goal in a nervous 1-0 win over Sampdoria having been joined at the top a day earlier when Juventus were fortunate to beat Fiorentina 1-0. Genoa remain fourth after a 1-1 draw with Catania while AS Roma moved joint fifth with Napoli after triumphing 3-0 in Naples. ENGLAND Holders Portsmouth were knocked out of the FA Cup in the fourth round when they were beaten 2-0 at home by Championship (second division) Swansea as first-half goals for Nathan Dyer and Jason Scotland delivered the biggest upset of the weekend. Last season's runners-up Cardiff City held 10-times winners Arsenal to a goalless draw at Ninian Park, while another Championship side, Doncaster Rovers, held high-flying Aston Villa to a 0-0 draw. Manchester United came from behind to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Old Trafford, with former Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov getting the winner. In the other big all-Premier League clash, Liverpool and Everton drew 1-1 at Anfield for the second time in a week as Steven Gerrard cancelled out Joleon Lescott's opener. The two remaining minor league teams went out as Kettering Town lost 4-2 to Fulham and Torquay United were beaten 1-0 by a late goal for Coventry City. FRANCE Monaco beat Nice on home turf for the first time in 13 years to reach the French Cup last 16 on Sunday thanks to an Alexandre Licata goal. In a rather dull weekend in France, the only significant upset was Ligue 2 high-flyers Boulogne-sur-Mer beating top flight Caen 3-1. There was no Cup magic elsewhere as Schirrhein, who play in the seventh division, were handed an 8-0 thrashing by Toulouse. In a last-64 match that was postponed, holders Olympique Lyon made light work of Concarneau, with the amateurs losing 6-0. Lyon will take on Olympique Marseille in the last 32 on Wednesday with the winner then travelling to Lille, 3-0 winners at amateur neighbours Dunkirk on Friday. NETHERLANDS AZ Alkmaar moved six points clear after a 2-0 win over Graafschap Doetinchem on Saturday courtesy of first-half goals from Ari and Sebastien Pocognoli. Second-placed Ajax Amsterdam failed to make up ground on Sunday when they lost 1-0 at Groningen. Danny Holla settled the match for Groningen, as Ajax finished with 10 men after a red card for Jan Vertonghen. Coach Marco van Basten also was sent off. Twente Enschede beat neighbours Heracles Almelo 2-1 to remain third, one point behind Ajax, while PSV Eindhoven slipped further off the pace after a 2-2 draw at home to NAC Breda. The champions are now 15 points behind the leaders, with 15 games left to play. SCOTLAND Aberdeen proved a thorn in the side of the Old Firm for the second successive week as they followed up their 4-2 victory over Celtic by holding Rangers to a goalless draw. Rangers, who surprisingly left top scorer Kris Boyd on the bench, could have gone top with a victory at Pittodrie but the nearest they came to a win was a late effort by substitute Nacho Novo. Celtic took full advantage by beating Hibernian 3-1 to stretch their Scottish Premier League lead to four points. Scott McDonald set them on their way after two minutes with Stephen McManus and McDonald's second completing the wi
