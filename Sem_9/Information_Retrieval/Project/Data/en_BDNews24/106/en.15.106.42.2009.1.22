 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) The Bangladesh Footbell Federation on Thursday rejected Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club's call for punishment to a referee and deferment of their encounter against Dhaka Abahani Ltd. The B. League committee of the BFF took the decision in response to the Mohammedan's demands including cancellation of Tuesday's 1-1 draw against Sheikh Russel KC. Mohammedans on Wednesday demanded the punishment to referee Azad Rahman and considering full three points against Russel. "We have found nothing to punish the referee, but have asked match commissioner Ibrahim Naser to give a detailed match report," B. League committee chairman Salam Murshedi told bdnews24.com after a meeting at BFF House. The committee also declined to defer Saturday's Mohammedan-Abahani match to the end of the League. "We don't want to slow the momentum of the B. League by deferring the Abahani-Mohammedan match as we had suffered a huge blow in the first leg because of the rescheduling for four to five times," said Murshedi, also a BFF senior vice president. He also allayed Mohammedan's fear of match-fixing if the Abahani-Mohammedan match took place earlier. "There is no chance to fix the matches after the Abahani-Mohammedan game as we video-record every match," said the former national striker. Murshedi hopes Mohammedan will turn up to face Abahani on Saturday in the greater interest of football. The fan groups of both Abahani and Mohammedan on Thursday submitted memoranda separately to the B. League committee. They requested the committee to appoint a neutral referee in the Abahani-Mohammedan match so that the match ends in a successful way. bd
