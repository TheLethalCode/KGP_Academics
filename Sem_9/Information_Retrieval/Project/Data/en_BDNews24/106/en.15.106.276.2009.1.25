Police shot dead the two men in Noida around 2 a.m., and said they could have been Pakistanis. "We recovered AK-47 rifles and grenades and some documents, including a Pakistani passport," Navin Arora, a senior police officer in Noida, told reporters. Brij Lal, a senior police officer, said the recovery of a passport indicated that the suspects were from Pakistan. One policemen was injured in the gun battle. The incident came as India prepares to celebrate its Republic Day on Monday and when the country is on high alert after the Mumbai attacks last year.
