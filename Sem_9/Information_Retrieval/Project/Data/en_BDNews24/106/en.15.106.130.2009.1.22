<TITLE> Pope to visit Angola March 20, on first Africa trip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LUANDA, Thu Jan 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict will visit Angola between March 20 and 23, during his first trip to Africa as pontiff, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The pope announced the African tour at a synod of bishops in October, but not the dates. He said he would travel to Cameroon to deliver the working document of a future synod whose theme will be Africa, and to Angola to celebrate 500 years of evangelisation there. Benedict's predecessor John Paul II travelled widely in Africa during his more than 26-year pontificate. He visited Angola in 1992. Between 60 and 70 percent of Angolans are Catholics. The former Portuguese colony is home to Mama Muxima, one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage sites in sub-Saharan Africa
