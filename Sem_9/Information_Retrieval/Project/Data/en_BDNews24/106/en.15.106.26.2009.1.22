<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal hammered out his Australian Open intentions with a thunderous display on Thursday while Serena Williams's champion's mentality lifted her to the third round despite a lukewarm performance. Nadal was both clinical and combative in his 6-2 6-3 6-2 win over Croatia's Roko Karanusic, the Spanish top seed taking only 97 minutes to destroy his opponent. "I won without any problems today, so that was good," the world number one smiled. Next for him is former world number two Tommy Haas. "The first big opponent, I think," Nadal said. "It is gonna be a very good test to see how I am. I am going to have to play very well if I want have chances to win, no?" Serena's route to the third round was less straightforward. Facing Argentine Gisela Dulko, three-times champion Serena won the first set comfortably enough but had to overcome 3-0 and 5-2 deficits in the second before to secure a 6-3 7-5 victory in 110 minutes. The second set lasted 79 minutes alone. "I was able to get through it not playing my best that's how I would sum it up," Serena said. "Lots and lots and lots and lots of room for improvement. "She definitely isn't known for the game she played today but I am used to people playing and really taking it to me now. It is always good to know that against me, at least these girls are bring their 'A' game. D-MINUS PERFORMANCE "Today I was at a 'D-minus' but it is good that I won." Serena meets China's Peng Shuai next. Serena's big sister Venus was due to open the night session later on Thursday with a match against Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro. They are followed onto centre court by men's pre-tournament favourite Andy Murray. The British fourth seed plays Spain's Marcel Granollers. Women's fourth seed Elena Dementieva extended her winning streak to 12 matches with a comfortable 6-4 6-1 victory over Iveta Benesova of the Czech Republic. Dementieva, who is unbeaten in 2009 after claiming the Auckland and Sydney titles, admitted after her first round victory over Kristina Barrois that her run of matches had left her a little fatigued. The world number four made 23 unforced errors and served five double faults on the second show court but was still too strong for 35th-ranked Benesova, wrapping up the match in 72 minutes. "Well, I'm not thinking about my chances. I'm really enjoying the way I'm playing right now. Just want to go as far as I can, just enjoy every single match I play here," she said. Former champion Amelie Mauresmo breathed a big sigh of relief after squeaking past the lone Briton left in the women's draw. The ex-world number one made heavy work of her 4-6 6-3 6-2 win over Elena Baltacha before admitting she needed to up her performance if she is going to survive much longer. "I'm expecting to play better and better as the tournament will go on," the 29-year-old told reporters. "I'm definitely expecting a tougher match, tougher opponent next round. So I will have to step up and play some better tennis." She will face Belarussian 13th seed Victoria Azarenka next
