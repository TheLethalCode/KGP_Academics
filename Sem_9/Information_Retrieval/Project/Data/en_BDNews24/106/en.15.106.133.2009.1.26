<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Pietersen smacked a century in his first appearance for England since resigning the captaincy in the opening match of the West Indies tour on Sunday. Pietersen, who quit as captain earlier this month after a disagreement over the coaching of the team, hit 103 from 107 balls as England reached 424 for eight at stumps on day one of the three-day tour match against a St Kitts XI at Warner Park. Andrew Strauss, the man who replaced Pietersen at the helm, won the toss but was then dismissed for a second-ball duck before Pietersen and Owais Shah (125 not out) gave England a healthy start. "I just wanted to get back playing cricket, back into the dressing room with the lads and there is no better place to do that than in the Caribbean," Pietersen said in a statement on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) website (www.ecb.co.uk). "To get back playing cricket is something I wanted to do and to get a hundred after everything that has happened is pretty satisfying." Pietersen said he had never doubted he could fit back into the team following his departure which came on the same traumatic day that saw Peter Moores sacked as coach. "I knew it was never going to be a problem," Pietersen added. "I loved doing the job, absolutely loved it, and I thought we were going to go in the right direction -- the direction in which I wanted to take the team. "But at the end of the day, I am not in charge, I am enjoying it and scoring a hundred is what turns me on, so that's good." Andrew Flintoff, another former skipper, was caught for 11 and was then withdrawn from the match as a precaution after complaining of a left side strain, the ECB said. Flintoff, 31, picked up the injury bowling in the nets prior to the match and medical staff will assess if he needs a scan. England are due to play four test matches, one Twenty20 and five one-day internationals against West Indies in the next two month
