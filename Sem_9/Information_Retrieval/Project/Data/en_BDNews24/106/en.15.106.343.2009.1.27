 GAZA, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli soldier was reported killed close to the border with the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in what Palestinians said appeared to have been an attack by gunmen in breach of ceasefire declarations made over a week ago. The Israeli military, which maintains censorship on casualties until next of kin are informed, said a bomb went off close to forces on the Israeli side of the border fence near the Kissufim crossing in the central Gaza Strip. It declined to comment on casualties but Al Arabiya television said one soldier was killed and three were wounded. It would be the first Israeli death since Israel ended its 22-day offensive in the coastal enclave on January 18. Palestinians living near Kissufim crossing told Reuters they had seen a small group of gunmen, numbering two or three, moving toward the border fence early in the morning mist. They later heard explosions and gunfire shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 GMT). They did not see gunmen return. Neither the ruling Hamas Islamist movement nor any of its allied militant groups made a claim of responsibility. Residents later saw Israeli helicopter gunships in the air and Israeli infantry moving inside the Gaza Strip. In the city of Gaza, some miles away, two loud explosions were later heard. Ten Israeli soldiers were killed during the offensive that began on December 27. Some 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict. Hamas and Israel declared separate ceasefires and both sides have been negotiating through Egyptian mediators on installing a longer term truce. Hamas is demanding an easing of Israel's blockade on the territory, where 1.5 million people live. Israel wants guarantees Hamas cannot renew rocket fire on its towns
