<TITLE> Parliament to decide if president was in breach: Shafiq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  The parliament will decide if the president had breached the constitution by becoming chief adviser, according to the law minister. "The parliament will decide on the possible breach of the constitution by the president," Shafiq Ahmed said. "[Iajuddin Ahmed] as president took over as chief adviser and later gave up but he will remain in the job until the new president is elected," he said at a Meet-the-Reporters programme. Dhaka Reporters Unity organised the programme on the theme, "The ninth parliament: People's expectations", on Saturday. The minister said the first parliamentary session beginning on Sunday will elect the speaker, the deputy speaker and 45 female MPs. "The fate of the 122 ordinances framed by the caretaker government will also be decided in the parliament," he pointed out. "The caretaker government passed quite a number of unnecessary ordinances which will not be tabled in the parliament but the ones related to the election will be made into laws as the polls are already over," he explained. To a question on picking a deputy speaker from the opposition and possible constitutional amendment for that, Shafiq said, "The MPs will determine the issue." "The people mandated the government with high hopes, and an honest, qualified and skilled cabinet can fulfil the nation's expectations," he observed. "The first parliamentary session must sit in 30 days after the election and the maiden session has to elect 45 women MPs." He dismissed the suggestion that the parliament cannot be deemed to have been constituted until the 45 reserved MPs are elected. Speaking of the 23-month rule of the caretaker government and legitimacy of polls after the constitution-mandated 90 days, he said, "The High Court has ruled the election held after 90 days poses no problem." "The High Court has also accepted the caretaker government's explanation for its inability to hold the election in 90 days and ruled for elections after 90 days. Therefore the question of validation of the interim government is uncalled-for." The court in another rule declared the Truth Commission illegal and an appeal against that ruling is pending with the Supreme Court, the minister, who also looks after justice affairs, said. He promised appointment of honest and capable judges 'soon' to resolve the crisis of judges in the High Court and clear backlog of cases. Asked if the ministers and MPs accused of Upazila election irregularities would face action, Shafiq said, "The Election Commission is independent and has separate laws." "But for the sake of the rule of law, we'll look into the matter." About holding war crimes trial, the minister said the government was considering the issue though it had not yet been on the agenda. He said, "The constitution bars religion-based politics, so does the special powers act. The government can ban such politics." About the state religion and building a secular Bangladesh, Shafiq said, "There has been no policy-level meeting on the issue but religion must not divide people as the country belongs to everyone of every faith." On the prices of commodities, he said the government took office only three weeks ago, the price of oil and fertiliser had already fallen. Prices of other essentials were also declining. The government has also put emphasis on law and order but the other matters will take some time to be addressed, he added. DRU president Shamim Ahmed presided over the programme while general secretary Pathik Saha made the inaugural speech. bdne
