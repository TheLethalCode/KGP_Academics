She entered the tournament having won the Auckland and Sydney titles and admitted she was aware she could become world number one if she wins the year's first slam. "I'm not the only one who can reach the number one position. I think there are a couple of players (have) a chance to do this. It's quite open right now." She added: "The person who's gonna win this tournament is going to take the number one position. I remember my first time here because it was my first grand slam.
