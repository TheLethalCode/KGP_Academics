 BEIJING Thu Jan 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Thursday defended the censorship on state television and domestic websites of inauguration speech references by US President Barack Obama to communism and dissent, saying it was an editorial right. Chinese state television abruptly turned away from the broadcast once communism was mentioned, and many websites deleted all mention of it. "I don't understand the situation you've raised. I think Chinese media, like media present here, have their own editorial rights," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news briefing. Communist China, which has shut more than 200 websites in recent days for "vulgar" content, is seen by many to be trying to stifle dissent in a year of sensitive anniversaries, including the 20th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. "Recall that earlier generations faced down communism and fascism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions," Obama said in his 18-minute inauguration address on Tuesday. He later added: "To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist." Jiang declined to comment on Obama's speech reference to human rights, saying his remarks were not directed at any one country, and defended China's own record instead. "China's government always respects and protects human rights," she said. "But as we are still in the primary stage of socialism, there are a lot of things that have to be improved.
