 Narayanganj, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  At least 50 people, including 15 policemen, were injured at Mission Para as clashes erupted after law enforcers swooped on a group of gamblers at around 10pm Sunday, said police. Police, with RAB, baton-charged the unruly mob, and at one point fired rounds teargas and rubber bullets to quell the situation. "We warned the gamblers to stop, but they didn't listen," said Narayanganj NDC Bhikharudowla. The clashes spread to Khanpur, Don Chamber and the town centre when police tried to prevent the gamblers, who were allegedly betting on a raffle draw at a trade fair. "We had to fire ten rounds of teargas shells and 25 rounds of rubber bullets before the mob dispersed," said Narayanganj additional SP Masud Karim. The month-long fair is being held under the auspices of the Bangladesh Benarasi Muslin Jamdani Society with the assistance of the Narayanganj Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The NCCI had earlier requested authorities to halt the fair after reports of illegal activities, the chamber's president Mohammad Ali told bdnews24.com. bdnews2
