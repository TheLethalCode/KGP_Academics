 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafiq Ahmed tabled 122 ordinances, passed by the caretaker government during its two-year tenure, at the maiden sitting of Parliament Sunday. All ordinances must be placed at the first sitting of a new parliament. The seat of Bangladesh's democracy, Jatiya Sangsad returned to business as usual after nearly two and a half years as the new parliament convened around 3.15pm with the arrival of outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar. Four minutes later, as the recital from the Quran was going on, leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia led her party MPs to the House, wearing black badges. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and most treasury bench members had arrived much earlier. The first sitting of the first session saw election of a new speaker Abdul Hamid and deputy speaker Shawkat Ali. One of the first tasks of the new speaker was to invite the law minister to present the raft of ordinances passed by the immediate past interim government. A panel tasked to examine the scores of ordinances passed has initially recommended that 45 of them be enacted, the law minister said earlier in the week. "All the ordinances will be placed on the first day of the first session of the parliament on Jan 25. Of them, the scrutiny committee will recommend 45 ordinances to tabled as bills," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the ministry. "Of the remaining ones some ordinances will be presented through bills after discussions in parliament and others will be repealed," he said. The 117 ordinances had been split in three categories according to their importance; the 45 ordinances to be tabled the first day include the most important ones, the minister said. bdnews
