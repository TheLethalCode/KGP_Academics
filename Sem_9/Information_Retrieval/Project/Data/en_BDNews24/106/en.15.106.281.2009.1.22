 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) - The opposition BNP has accused supporters of the ruling Awami League of forcefully occupying polling stations, forcing BNP-backed candidates' polling agents out of the stations and stamping ballot papers for AL candidates in the Upazila elections on Thursday. "The ruling party's supporters have occupied polling stations across the country, intimidating BNP-backed candidates' polling agents out of the stations," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told a press briefing at the party's Gulshan office. "The allegations are arriving at our monitoring cell with proof from Upazila across the country. We've information that the ruling party supporters have been forcefully occupying many polling stations across the country, stamping the ballot papers and dropping them into the ballot boxes," said Rizvi. He also accused local administration of failing to take any measures to prevent such incidents. Rizvi alleged that polling agents of BNP-backed candidates were forced out of the polling centres at Munshiganj Sadar, Araihajar Upazila in Narayanganj, Barura in Comilla, Belkhuch in Sirajganj, Chowgasa in Jessore, Companyganj in Noakhali, Ramganj in Lakshimpur, Mahendiganj in Barisal, Gabtali in Bogra, Magura Sadar, Fulgaji Sadar, Sagalnaia in Feni, Thakurgaon Sadar, and Pangsha in Rajbari. "In many polling centres ballot boxes were seen to be full although their were few voters," he said. Rizvi mentioned different polling stations in Araihajar Upazila as examples: "Awami League supporters occupying those stations had filled ballot boxes with 50 to 60 percent of ballots by 11.00am." "The local police superintendent did not pay heed although a written complaint was lodged. Rather he [the police superintendent] harassed the complainants." "A good number of BNP-backed candidates had boycotted the election by noon seeing massive rigging in the voting," Rizvi said. "Awami League have snatched the people's mandate in the Upazila Parisad election as they did in the general election on December 29." "This incident has made clear their fascist character," said the BNP leader. bdnews24.
