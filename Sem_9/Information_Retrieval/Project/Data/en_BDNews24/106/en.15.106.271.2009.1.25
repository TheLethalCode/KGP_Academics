<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Having enjoyed grand slam glory and held the world number one ranking, there cannot be too many tennis regrets for Andy Roddick. There is one defeat he cannot expunge, though, one that still causes him to wincea loss to Serena Williams. "She always just gives me crap," the American groaned at the Australian Open on Sunday, "ask her about it. "But she won't give me a rematch. I saw her yesterday, and she walked on the court and started laughing because she knew I had probably seen it," he smiled, referring to a post on Serena's website (www.serenawilliams.com) revealing the result. The match in question took place when the pair were children and Roddick claims there were good reasons for the upset. "When we were ten, I had to literally run around in the shower to get wet. I was this big. She was bench pressing dump trucks already at that time. "I told her that yesterday, and she got a good laugh. Any chance she gets she just does it to get under my skin, and she does it very successfully. "But, you know, however many some odd Wimbledon titles (she has won) and she's like, 'What's your best match? I have a win over Andy Roddick.' "She forgets to mention that it was 1993." Roddick, who was born in 1982 and a year after Serena, called for a re-match. "I'd love to. Tell her to do it," he grinned. "She sat me down for five minutes yesterday and was going through her indirect wins," he said, explaining that Serena now jokes that her childhood win means she has beaten everyone Roddick has defeated. "She was pretty excited. She didn't know I had two wins over Pete (Sampras), so she was excited about that also." The mischievous Serena claims her victory was a one-sided 6-1 whereas Roddick insisted it was closer than that. "The score gets better for her also," he said. "She's good at not letting the truth get in the way of a good story sometimes. "I think it was 6-4." Roddick, who on Sunday reached the Australian Open quarter-final, had not dared tackle Serena's big sister Venus at the time. "She was way too good," he said. "I couldn't even be on the same court. It's great. I always enjoy seeing them do well. For literally about two-and-a-half, three years we had three courts in Florida, and it was me, Serena and Venus. "We just spent hours and hours out there just playing. We all have done pretty well, and all three of those little kids out there got to No. 1, which is pretty cool. "I'm just happy for them. They're good girls. It's nice
