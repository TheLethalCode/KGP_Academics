 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  A forum of lower court judges on Friday demanded removal of Kazi Habibul Awal as the law secretary for what they alleged was his taking steps "against" the judges. The High Court declared illegal the appointment of Awal as the law secretary, but yet he was taking steps against the judges, Abdul Gafur, president of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association, told reporters after an emergency meeting to press home their demand. "Because of his stand, the justice-seekers and others are not benefiting from the independence of the judiciary," he added. Four decisions incorporating views of the judges across the country were adopted in the meeting. One of the decisions asked authorities to immediately implement the 2001 guidelines on the appointment of judges to the law ministry which the Supreme Court had ruled as law. The judges asked for quick appointment to the vacant posts including those of the additional secretary and joint secretary to the law ministry in line with the guidelines. BJSA secretary general Gazipur Women and Children repression prevention tribunal judge Md. Shahjahan Saju along with Gafur read out the demands at the meeting. The meeting, chaired by Gafur was held at Jagannath Sohel Memorial Auditorium of the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions' Judge's Court Bhaban in the city, started in the morning and ended shortly before 5pm. "We had raised various issues on the judges' interests to the government in our earlier meetings; but today [Friday] we held the meeting exclusively to urge authorities to remove the illegal law secretary," Gafur said. The senior assistant secretary of the Law Commission, Mahbubur Rahman Sarkar, said Awal would have to stand in the dock for his treatment of judicial officials in the past. He alleged that the draft of the extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against prime minister Sheikh Hasina had been made at the office of the law secretary. As many as 50 judges have left job to escape the wrath of Awal, alleged former president of the association Rajshahi labour appeals tribunal judge Md. Rafiqu Islam. The members of the association also prayed after the meeting for immediate removal of the incumbent law secretary. bdnews24.com
