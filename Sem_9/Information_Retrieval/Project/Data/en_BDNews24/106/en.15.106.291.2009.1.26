<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)A special tribunal for trying war criminals could be set up under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973, said law minister Shafiq Ahmed on Monday. "It is not necessary to revive the Collaborators' Act for trial of war criminals. The 1973 Tribunals Act still exists," the minister told reporters. "A war crimes tribunal can be constituted to try them under this law." Asked what initiatives his ministry was taking to try 1971 war crimes, Shafiq said, "On principle, the home ministry will take the initiative. The law ministry will give legal assistance." "Give some more time to the government. Awami League will of course try war criminals in keeping with its manifesto pledge." "But the government is determined to undertake the trials by rule of law," said the law minister. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, meanwhile, sought UN support for the trial of war criminals on Monday. "We have had talks on trial of war criminals," UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien told reporters after calling on the minister. Dessallien said the UN would examine how it could help in this regard if the government sought UN support. "The minister said the government was committed to bringing war criminals to justice," said a foreign ministry statement. bdnew
