<TITLE> Stosur provides a glimmer of hope for Australians </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Samantha Stosur provided some temporary relief to Australia's dwindling tennis stocks when she beat Germany's Sabine Lisicki 6-3 6-4 in the second round of the Australian Open on Thursday. Following Jelena Dokic's win on Wednesday night, Stosur's victory ensured Australia would have two women in the third round of a grand slam for the first time in five years. However, their success was tempered by the failure of any of Australia's men to proceed past round two at Melbourne Park for the first time since 2002. Even more alarming for a country that has produced some of the greatest players of all time, is that when the latest rankings are released Australia will not have a single man ranked in the top 100. "I guess it's always good to have players still in that middle weekend," said Stosur. "I'm just really happy that I'm one of them." Stosur is currently Australia's highest ranked player at 48 but faces a tough job getting to the fourth round after being drawn to face in-form Russian Elena Dementieva, who is unbeaten in 12 matches this year. "I've got nothing to lose. I'm going to go out there, have fun, enjoy it, use the crowd to my advantage, see what happens," Stosur said. "She's obviously playing very well. I'm going to give myself a chance, play well, try and execute the tactics. I can't really do any more than that.
