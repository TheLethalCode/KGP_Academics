<TITLE> Obama makes about turn on lobbyists </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)President Barack Obama received overwhelming kudos from across America when he declared in his inaugural speech that the era of "protecting narrow interests" was over and lobbyists and special interest groups would lose their clout in his White House. To demonstrate that he meant business, Obama followed through on his promise on the very first day at the Oval Office by introducing the most sweeping ethics rule in American historyones that would "close the revolving door that lets lobbyists come into government freely". But just two days after that bold declaration President Obama on Friday waived those rules for his nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Lynn. Until last fall, Lynn was a registered lobbyist for Raytheon, one of the biggest defense contractors in America. Asked about why the new administration has reversed its policy on lobbyists so soon, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that "a waiver process that allows people to serve their country is necessary. In the case of Mr. Lynn, he's somebody who obviously is superbly qualified, is experienced, going back to his Pentagon jobs during the Clinton administration, make him uniquely qualified to do this." But that didn't seem to placate the Republican critics. In a written statement, the defeated presidential candidate and ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee John McCain, said he was "disappointed" that President Obama has waived his "revolving door" executive order so soon. "While I applaud the president's action to implement new, more stringent ethical rules, I had hoped he would not find it necessary to waive them so soon," McCain said in the statement. "Before I can determine whether to support his nomination as Deputy Secretary of Defense, I intend to ask him to clarify for the record what matters and decisions will require his recusal." Aside from the Republicans, the waiver has also surprised independent observers, who are now openly questioning whether the lobbyists' influence on American politics can ever be curbed. Although President Obama is known to harbor strong dislike for the special interests, lobbyists still have defenders in Washington, including one of Obama's most powerful allies, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid invited top lobbyists to join him and his supporters for an inaugural brunch last Monday where he told ABC News that he would still do plenty of business with them. "And there's nothing wrong with that," said Reid. "And Obama will be meeting with them too." When asked to clarify his remarks, given Obama's promises to change that part of Capitol culture, Reid responded that lobbyists are part and parcel of the job. "People should understand that lobbyists, per se, are someone's father, mother, son, daughter," said Reid. "They work for a living." To be sure, Reid's sons and a son-in-law have worked as lobbyists. According to news reports, lobbyists along with their corporate and union clients put up the money for some of the most extravagant inaugural parties, including the former vice-President Al Gore's Green Ball, the California Society's luncheon fashion show, and the Congressional Black Caucus cocktail party. While Obama is publicly committed to ban lobbyists and their money from his White House, independent observers now say, he may find that he can't ban them from Washington. Indeed, given the number of high-profile inauguration-related parties that they funded, there's no sign the city's 15,000 lobbyists will give up their power easily. "The lobbyists know that they were here before President Obama got elected and they certainly plan on being here after he's out of office," said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-profit organisation in Washington
