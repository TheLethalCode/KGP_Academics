 MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jo-Wilfried Tsonga completed a memorable day for French tennis when he beat Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic 6-7 7-6 7-6 6-2 in the second round of the Australian Open on Thursday. It has been 81 years since Jean Borotra provided France with their only Australian Open men's singles champion but there is a renewed hope of a breakthrough this year. Tsonga, runner-up to Novak Djokovic at Melbourne 12 months ago, was one of five Frenchman through to the third round at Melbourne Park. Fabrice Santoro, the oldest man in the tournament, progressed on Wednesday, while Gilles Simon, Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils also won on Thursday. Arnaud Clement, a finalist in Australia in 2001, was beaten on Thursday along with another Frenchman, Sebastien De Chaunac, but four winners from six was still a good return. "We're very (good) friends. We had a lot of good times together in juniors," Tsonga said. "They are really good guys, so I appreciate to be with them." Fifth seed Tsonga looked to be in early trouble when he lost the opening set and was down set point in the second set tiebreaker. But the 23-year-old reeled off a series of spectacular winners to square the match then broke Ljubicic's resistance when he won the third set in a tiebreaker. "I tried to think positive and say, 'okay, I keep going, keep going all the time'," Tsonga said. "Today I was a little bit lucky." Tsonga's only concern was a recurring problem with his back that forced him pull out of a warm-up event in Sydney last week. Although he did not require treatment or show any signs of discomfort as he leapt around the court, he said it was still troubling him. "Tonight my back was very stiff but I won. I'm happy with that. I know I can play with (it).
