 LONDON, Mon Jan 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's ruling Labour Party fell 15 percentage points behind the opposition Conservatives in an opinion poll released on Monday as public confidence in its handling of the recession-hit economy slides. The ComRES poll in the Independent newspaper showed Labour support at 28 percent, down six points from its December poll, and David Cameron's Conservatives on 43 percent, up four points from December. Britain's third party, the Liberal Democrats, had 16 percent support. Prime Minister Gordon Brown enjoyed a brief recovery in opinion polls late last year when he won plaudits for his initial response to the global financial crisis. However, Britain last week was forced to announce a second bank rescue in three months and figures on Friday confirmed it had entered recession in the final three months of 2008. Only a third of those asked thought Brown's government had taken the right steps to fend off the worst effects of the recession, while 58 percent said it had not. According to the Independent, the poll would give Cameron's Party an overall majority of 120 if it were directly translated in a general election now. Brown does not have to call an election until mid 2010. The ComRes poll, which was conducted between Jan 21. and Jan. 22, echoes the findings of a YouGov poll published earlier this month by The Sun newspaper, which put Conservatives on 41 percent, comfortably ahead of Labour at 34 percent and the Liberal Democrats on 15 percent
