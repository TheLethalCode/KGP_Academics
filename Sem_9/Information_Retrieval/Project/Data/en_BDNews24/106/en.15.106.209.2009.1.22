 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has okayed chargesheet against nine BTCL officials including its director Mohammad Toufique, a top ACC official said on Thursday. "The nine BTCL people are charged with concealment of facts and amassing nearly Tk 4 crore in assets beyond the known sources of income," said ACC director general colonel Hanif Iqbal on Thursday. The anti-graft watchdog also cleared eight money embezzlement cases for filing against 47 BTCL staffers including former director Nur Hossain Mia. "We will soon lodge cases also against these 47 people," Iqbal told a regular press briefing. "We've exacted proof of pocketing nearly Tk 17.27 crore through fake bills and another Tk 14.14 crore through abuse of office." The ACC unearthed evidence of withdrawal of some Tk 23.81 crore beyond the budget and misappropriation of about Tk 17.58 crore. It filed a case with Ramna police against Toufique and eight other BTCL officials. bdne
