 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)With the party over and the crowds gone President Barack Obama got down to business Wednesday making some unpopular decisions for his staff and imposing tough new rules for lobbying and for releasing public information. At a staff meeting to swear in top aides, Obama said he was freezing their salaries. "During this period of economic emergency, families are tightening their belts, and so should Washington," Obama told the assembled staff. The president said the salaries of everyone on the White House staff that exceeded $100,000 would be frozen. At least 100 senior staffer would be affected by this new order. On his agenda for Day One, Obama summoned his economic advisers to hammer out details of an economic bailout and called in his top generals to give them new marching orders. His staff was already putting into effect executive orders to usher in the Obama presidency, as well as his request that military hearings for terror suspects at the Guantanamo prison be suspended for 120 days. Obama went on to spell out restrictions on lobbying after employees leave the White House and vowed that the federal government would be more willing to make information public. The president said he was issuing the "rules of the road of my administration" to "make government more trustworthy in the eyes of the American people." Obama entered the Oval Office for his first day of work at 8:35 a.m. and got to spend 10 minutes alone before the demands of the nation began to demand his attention, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. During that time, he read a note left to him by former president George Bush that was addressed, "To #44, From #43." By tradition, notes from the departing president to the incoming president remain secret. Then the work began. At 8:45 a.m. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel entered to discuss the day's busy list of events, and by 9:10 a.m., first lady Michelle Obama joined her husband in the Oval Office. Obama then began calling Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmrt, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan's King Abdullah, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. This was intended to demonstrate his urgency in tackling the thorny Middle East issue. To further underline his seriousness, Obama appointed former Senate Majority leader George Mitchell as his special Middle East envoy In between, Obama attended a National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral, sharing a pew with Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, along with former President Bill Clinton and future secretary of state Hillary Clinton. During the afternoon, Obama hosted an open house of his new home, telling visitors to roam around, just don't break anything. As Obama charged through the long and emotional day Tuesday -- from attending a private church service in the morning to delivering his inaugural address to dancing well past midnight -- much of his staff got right to work. The new president's biggest priority will be reviving the faltering economy, and that includes hammering out with Congress the details of a massive $825 billion bailout. "They want to have a complete overhaul of this financial-rescue package within days," said ABC News' chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos. Obama met with senior economic advisers in the afternoon to discuss the stimulus package as well as the $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Funds that Congress approved at his request last week to stabilize the financial markets. Iraq is also high on the Day One agenda. In the late afternoon, Obama met with his top generals, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, National Security Adviser Gen. Jim Jones (Ret.) and Gen. David Petraeus, who heads the U.S. Central Command. According to the ABC News, Obama instructed the team to begin making plans to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months, which was his campaign pledge
