<TITLE> Jewel Rana swansong in Dhaka derby Saturday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Defender Jewel Rana is keen to have the last laugh before he hangs his boots up on Saturday after a crucial B. League clash between archrivals Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The usually reliable defender retired from the national team in 1999 immediately after Bangladesh clinched their first-ever SAFF Games football trophy in Katmandu in Nepal. Jewel donned his favourite Black and Whites jersey after leaving Brothers Union this season in a bid to put an end to his 20-year career. Mohammedan also honoured Jewel with captaincy and the central defender repaid by helping the Motijheel-based outfit to clinch the title of the season curtain-raising Federation Cup in 2008. He failed to keep up the momentum, however, in the ongoing Citycell B. League and hardly featured in the first team, a fact that may have prompted him, among other reasons, to call it quits midway into the second leg of the professional league. The focus, however, will remain on the match considered vital for the title race as Mohammedan are desperately looking to close gaps with leaders Abahani after a 1-1 draw against Sheikh Russel KC in the previous match. Defending champions Abahani are well ahead with 35 from 15 outings and want to consolidate their lead. Their old foes Mohammedan are six points adrift with secured 29 points from 14 matches. The Sky Blues are in good shape with four wins out of five second-leg matches, but Mohammedan's ride remained rough with only two wins in four second-leg outings. Mohammedan are on the backfoot after Bangladesh Football Federation on Thursday rejected their appeals to forfeit their match against Sheikh Russel, award them full three points and defer Saturday's match against Abahani. Doubtless, a win against Abahani will bring Mohammedan back on the track and leave the title race wide open since Sheikh Russel are also in the haunt with 34 points from 16 matches. "It is our last chance to come back to the race and a win over them (Abahani) closes the gaps," said Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq. "If we go down tomorrow (Saturday), all hopes are lost and we are looking forward to winning the match," said Haq. Abahani coach Amalesh Sen said they took the Dhaka derby as if a final battle. "We don't want to miss the chance. If we win the match, 90 percent of our job to retain the title will be completed and all players are ready to give their best," said Sen. Abahani and Mohammedan shared the honours in the first-leg match with a 2-2 draw as the strikers were in great rhythm. Abahani's Nigerian striker Emeka Christina had struck 11 goals in 15 matches while his partner Jahid Hasan Emily found the opponents' target 10 times in 14 games. Mohammedan's Nigerian recruit Alamu Bukola Olaleken also struck 10 goals, including a hat-trick, while young striker Mohammad Robin scored seven goals in 13 matches. Mohammedan will also look to their new Korean recruit Oh Ddogyi, who is yet to find the back of the net in the two matches he has played.
