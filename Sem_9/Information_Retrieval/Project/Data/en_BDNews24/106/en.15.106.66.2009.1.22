 WELLINGTON, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand have named two new faces in their 14-man squad to play Australia in the Chappell-Hadlee one-day series starting next month. Uncapped all-rounder Brendon Diamanti and 18-year-old bowler Trent Boult were included after impressive domestic performances. Batsman Peter Fulton and seam bowler Iain O'Brien were recalled. "We're treating this somewhat like a home series -- we may look to bring players in and out of the squad as required," head of selectors Glenn Turner said in a statement. The tour includes five one-day matches and a Twenty20 game against Australia. Squad; Daniel Vettori (Captain), Trent Boult, Neil Broom, Brendon Diamanti, Grant Elliott, Peter Fulton, Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor
