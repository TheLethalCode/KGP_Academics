<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty on Wednesday said Bangladesh and India might form a new platform to fight terrorism and insurgency across the two countries. The envoy said the formation of the forum could be discussed during the two-day visit of Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, from Feb. 8, to Bangladesh. He said Bangladesh and India were expected to sign a new deal on protection and promotion of investments in both countries. "A new body could be formed that will deal exclusively with the issue of terrorism, insurgency, cross-border crime and so on," Chakravarty told bdnews24.com after his first call on new foreign minister Dipu Moni on Wednesday. He went to the foreign ministry to discuss the Pranab's upcoming two-day visit. They also talked about the possibility of the new regional panel or taskforce as was outlined by Awami League in its election manifesto. The high commissioner said Pranab's priority issues would be some security issues. "Priority issues immediately would be to deal with certain security issues which I think has been articulated in terms of greater cooperation on security issues. "(We have to work) so that we can jointly tackle some of the problems of terrorism, the insurgent groups and other wanted people fleeing across the border taking refuge either here or there," he said. Chakravarty said the bilateral trade treaty, which was renewed after every three years, would be signed during Pranab's visit. "The other (trade agreement) is a new one which is almost ready to be signed. It is called bilateral investment protection and promotion agreement." Defending the agreement, the high commissioner said India's investment in Bangladesh and Bangladeshi businessmen money in India must be protected. He said the two foreign ministers would discuss trade facilitation for reducing the huge trade imbalance. Chakravarty stressed the need for building infrastructure along the borders for facilitating trades. On signing extradition treaty, the envoy said, "Extradition treaty is there. But we are not saying this has to be done tomorrow. I think it requires more work." He said Bangladesh should immediately send a delegation to New Delhi for talks on maritime delimitation as India must submit its claims on sea boundary to the UN by June this year. bdn
