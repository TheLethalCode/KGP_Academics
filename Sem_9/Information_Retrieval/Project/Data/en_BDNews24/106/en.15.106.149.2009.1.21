<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Wednesday asked people to watch for the conspirators, who he did not name. Those conspirators, he alleged, who wanted to make the country economically dependent on others through 'looting and exploitation' had again reared their head. He made the remarks at a discussion marking the 73rd birth anniversary of party founder late president Ziaur Rahman. Nationalist forces have to be united against them, he observed, adding that in 1981, Ziaur Rahman was killed at the hands of those conspirators. At the discussion held at the National Press Club and organised by the party's women front Jatiyatabadi Mahila Dal, Delwar said ,"The party needs to be reorganised to strengthen the nationalist forces and it has to be expanded at the grassroots level." He said BNP would be strong when all would be able to reorganise the party on the basis of the ideals of Ziaur Rahman. In the current context, he added, it was important to follow his ideals. Prof Tasmeri S. Islam, the dean of science faculty at the University of Dhaka, said," We are to move ahead first by rectifying ourselves through self-analysis. We need to analyse how it all happened." Presided over by Sarwari Rahman, leader of the Mahila Dal, others who spoke at the discussion were DU vice chancellor A F M Yusuf Haider, former MP Khaleda Rabbani, Rabeya Siraj, Shirin Sultana, Shahina Khan, Rowshan Ara Farid and Rehana Akhtar Ranu. bd
