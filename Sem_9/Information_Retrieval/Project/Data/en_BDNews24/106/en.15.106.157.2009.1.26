 MELBOURNE, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Illness and injury ravaged the Australian Open on Monday with Serena Williams, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Gilles Simon all advancing to the quarter-finals when their opponents quit their matches. Gael Monfils and Zheng Jie waved Simon and Kuznetsova through by pulling out with wrist injures while Williams advanced when Victoria Azarenka staggered off centre court in tears, off-balance and barely able to hold her racket. Thirteenth-seeded Belarussian Azarenka had been leading 6-3 2-4 but finally quit in tears after unsteadily patrolling the baseline for several points. Azarenka needed to be assisted off court by two trainers, supporting her either side. "Well I just woke up this morning feeling sick already, threw up all morning," Azarenka said. "Very disappointing for me.ADVERTISEMENT "They think it was a virus or something whatever happens, happens. There was not much I could do about it." Three-times champion Williams will play Russian Kuznetsova in the quarters after Zheng retired with a wrist injury. "I want to try to play, but I can't use the left hand, cannot play the backhand," Zheng said. "Only the strongest are blessed," said Kuznetsova, who led 4-1 in the first set when Zheng threw in the towel. "You know, the saying? We say it in Russian. NO PROBLEM "I was winning. It was no problem. I felt great. Either way for me was good. But I felt sorry for her because she was in great shape. "She was playing good. This pain I hope is not very dangerous." Sixth seed Simon suffered a bittersweet experience, advancing to the quarters after friend and fellow Frenchman Monfils was forced to retire with a wrist injury. Simon had been leading 6-4 2-6 6-1 and ahead 30-0 in the first game of the fourth set while serving when Monfils, who had been continuously flexing and shaking his right hand throughout the match, called a halt to proceedings. Monfils, the 12th seed at Melbourne Park, had received treatment on his right wrist during the third set and then had it strapped before the fourth set began. "Well, you never want to win like this," Simon told reporters. "It's already strange when it's another player, but when it's a friend like Gael it's more difficult." The 24-year-old Simon said he had chatted after the match to his fellow "New Musketeer", who said he was in pain. "When I really felt it was at 3-1 for Gilles," said Monfils. "I mean, it was maybe 3-0 (in the third set and) I served, that service game, then I started to feel it. "I FEEL IT" "Then I asked the physio. I was thinking maybe it was (in) my head. Then I said, 'I feel it'." Simon will meet either Spanish top seed Rafael Nadal or Chilean Fernando Gonzalez. Elena Dementieva stretched her winning streak to 14 matches when she demolished Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova 6-2 6-2 to advance. The Russian fourth seed now meets the dangerous unseeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro, who knocked out sixth seed Venus Williams, in the quarter-finals. "I think she's a very tough player," the Russian said. "She plays a very unique style of game. A lot of spin. It's gonna be a tough match." Suarez Navarro beat fellow Spaniard Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-3 6-2. The 20-year-old, who speaks only a few words of English, is one of two unseeded women through to the last eight, along with Australian Jelena Dokic. Pre-tournament favourite Andy Murray continues his bid to become the first British men's grand slam champion since Fred Perry won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1936. The fourth seed, U.S. Open runner-up last year, takes on Spanish baseliner Fernando Verdasco later on Monda
