 COLOMBO, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan soldiers on Sunday captured the last major town held by the Tamil Tiger separatists, forcing the rebels back into a handful of villages and defences in the jungle, the army's commander said on Sunday. "After one month's fight we have totally liberated Mullaittivu town," Lieutenant-General Sarath Fonseka said in an address on state television. He said the area now controlled by the rebels was just 300 square km.
