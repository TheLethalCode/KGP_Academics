 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Voter turnout picked up in the afternoon compared to thin presence in the morning, said election officials in polling areas skirting the capital. Long lines were seen in front of centres after 4pm, when voting officially ended, they said. Due to intense cold in the morning and it being a workday, more people came to vote in the afternoon, they added. In Savar and Manikganj, voters began showing up in bigger numbers after 2pm in the afternoon and as a result, vote taking went on beyond 4pm. In Singair, Manikganj, presiding officer Anwar Hossain said, "Those standing in line will not be sent back without casting their votes." In Dinajpur, Rangpur, Chittagong and Khulna voter presence was thin in the morning but also started to pick up later in the day. "This time the presence of women voters is low," said Nurul Huq, a voter at West Potia, Chittagong. Returning officer Ehsane Elahi said, "Till 1pm, 32-35 percent of votes were cast and till late afternoon, this may be 50-55 percent." bdnews24.com/st/g
