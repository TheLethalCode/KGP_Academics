<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia has asked children to get good education to lead the nation. "Today's children will lead the country in future. They will have to be well-educated," she said while giving away prizes among winners of an art competition at her Gulshan office on Saturday night. BNP's children wing Zia Shishu Kishore Sangathan organised the art competition marking party founder late president Ziaur Rahman's 73rd anniversary of birth. More than 50 children took part in the competition. Khaleda, also BNP chief, said her husband Ziaur Rahman, who took power on Nov. 7, 1975 through a revolt, had proclaimed independence from Pakistan in 1971. "When people were facing oppression during the war of independence, Ziaur Rahman declared the country's independence and fought for it," she said. Khaleda also referred to the measures taken during the BNP's tenures since general Zia had come to power. Secretary-general Khandker Delwar Hossain and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were present at the prize-distribution function.
