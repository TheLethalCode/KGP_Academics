<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Demonstrating Jagannath University students have threatened to launch tougher movement if their demands are not met by Monday. Over 500 students staged demonstrations on the campus and confined the vice chancellor to his office on Saturday demanding a stop to what they said was illegal control over the 12 halls of residence. The protesters besieged Abu Hossain Siddique at his office for two hours. They held a rally at the Shahid Minar ground on the campus and declared that they would take new moves on Tuesday if their demands were not fulfilled by Monday. Proctor Kazi Asad went to the meeting and assured the students of a quick solution. Following the proctor's assurance, the protesters lifted the siege at the VC's office at around 12:30pm. The students alleged that local businesses and politicians were pursuing business by keeping control of the dormitories outside the campus. bdn
