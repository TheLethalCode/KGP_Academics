 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Private university students, spurred by rumours, clashed and vandalised cars in the capital's Banani area on Thursday, forcing shops and offices to close and traffic to a halt, police said. Gulshan Police Station OC Mir Rezaul Hossain said a police motorcycle was also damaged by the unruly students who fought for two hours. According to police, security guards of Southeast University refused entry to a female student of American International University of Bangladesh (AIUB) on Wednesday when she had arrived with a male student of Southeast, leading to scuffles. The AIUB student's mother and sister were called, and both parties reached a settlement, police said. "On Thursday, three Southeast students arrived at AIUB for some work and received unfriendly treatment as a sequel to Wednesday's incident on their campus," the police officer said. "Rumour spread that the three Southeast boys were being detained at AIUB. So several Southeast teachers arrived at AIUB to settle the matter. "As they were in discussions with their AIUB counterparts, rumour reached Southeast that the students and the teachers were being assaulted on the AIUB campus. "A large number of Southeast students carrying sticks came out of the campus and marched towards AIUB. So did the AIUB boys, leading to the chaos." At around 1:30pm, witnesses said, clashes began at the Banani Road 18, spreading later to Kakali Crossing and Kamal Ataturk Avenue. The two-hour chaos saw 8-10 cars vandalised, including a police motorcycle. A RAB vehicle was also damaged, police said. The traffic congestion affected roads and alleyways in and around Banani and Mahakhali, home to scores of private universities without a proper campus. "We mediated, and the situation was brought under control at around 3pm," said the officer in charge. He said the police have not received any written complaint yet. b
