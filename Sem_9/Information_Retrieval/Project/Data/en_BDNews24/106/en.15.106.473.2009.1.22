<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gilles Simon overcame the distraction of a hostile crowd and an opponent armed with one of the most lethal serves in tennis before booking his place in the third round of the Australian Open on Thursday. The Frenchman failed in his attempts to win over the parochial Australian crowd but did at least succeed in finding a way to blunt the booming serve of Chris Guccione and win 6-7 6-4 6-1 6-2, knocking out the last local player in the men's singles draw. Simon, who is 20 centimetres shorter than the giant left-handed Australian, feared the worst when he lost the opening set in a tiebreaker to the towering Guccione. The centre court crowd roared with delight every time the Frenchman was aced but once Simon found a way to get the ball back into play, it was the Australian who was suddenly struggling. "I knew it would be hard (because) I prefer to play a player playing from the baseline," Simon said. "I just knew (I had) to get (the ball) into the court. That's why, even when I lost the first set, I just tried to focus on what I had to do." Once Simon started returning Guccione's serve, the match was as good as over. The Frenchman had few difficulties picking holes in Guccione's serve-and-volley game, whacking an impressive 53 winners. "It's an easy way to play, you don't have the choice," Simon said. "He's just coming to the net every time he can. "But what is hard is to stay focused on every point because you can feel the frustration even during the match because there is the crowd for him. "Every time he's serving an ace, 'Yeah, c'mon'. "That's why I'm pretty happy to win, because I didn't take pleasure to play today. It was really hard." Simon, seeded sixth for the first grand slam of the year, has made huge strides in world tennis over the last 12 months, reaching a career-high ranking of six, but has never made it past the third round of a grand slam. He faces Croatia's Mario Ancic on Saturday
