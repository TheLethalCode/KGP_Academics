 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile-phone operators on Wednesday asked the government to lift Tk 800 in SIM card tax. The members of the Association of Mobile Telephone Operators Bangladesh met and asked telecoms minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu to look further into Telecom Ordinance-2008. "We'll see what we can do about their demands as we'll discuss them with the finance minister," Razu told reporters after the meeting. "We'll also consult the relevant 2008 Ordinance with the [Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission] chairman," he said. "Some clauses could possibly be changed." AMTOB president and AKTEL director Fazlur Rahman told reporters, "We raised some growth-related issues and expect to discuss the ordinance in future." "The SIM card tax has increased the customers' expenses and impeded the trade's growth," he claimed. The association members briefed the minister about the network problems in the absence of a tower at the Secretariat, Rahman said. Telecoms secretary M Mahbubur Rahman focused on the operations of the mobile-phone companies. Officials present at the meeting represented grameenphone, AKTEL, CityCell, Teletalk, WARID and Banglalink, and also the ministry. bd
