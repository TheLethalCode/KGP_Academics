 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido has arrived in Dhaka Saturday to coach the Bangladesh national football team ahead of this year's qualifying round of the AFC Challenge Cup. After his arrival at the Bangladesh Football Federation House, Dido met BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi, vice presidents Badal Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahanghir and other members. Dido also watched the B. League match between Abahani Limited and Moahmmedan Sporting Club at Bangabandhu National Stadium and expressed satisfaction in the way some footballers played. The Brazilian also praised some of the players like Abahani's striker Jahid Hasan Emily, winger Jahed Parvez Chowdhury, Mohammedan's goalkeeper Aminul Haq and winger Nasir Hossain. While talking to the media, Dido briefed on his observation of football in Asia including Bangladesh. The Brazilian had earlier coached Vietnam and Taiwan. The 46-year old coach said that he had no idea about the facilities available for Bangladesh football. "There is no shortcut to a full-groomed football, it requires a long term strategy," said Dido. Dido said he has no problems if his native physio Ariel Colman works with him. The Bangladesh Football Federation plans to bring back the Brazilian physio, who worked here with Argentine coach Diego Andres Cruciani in 2005. Dido, a former Santos and Flamengo star in the late 70s and early 80s, will be paid $ 4000 a month, in addition to transport, accommodation, etc. The BFF officials have chosen Dido based on his experience in Asian football. Dido is the second Latin American to coach Bangladesh team after Argentine Cruciani, who coached the national team from August 2005 to Sept 2006. Dido played club football in Brazil and Israel from 1979 to 1996 before taking charge of Israel club Macabi Holon in 1996. He also coached clubs in Malta, UAE, Brazil, Netherlands and Denmark. bd
