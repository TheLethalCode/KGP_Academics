 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Mango Teleservices, the sole private licensee to run the lucrative International Internet Gateway (IIG), will now get an extra 40 days to pay up the fees for the third WiMAX license. "The deadline for Mango is March 2," BTRC chief retired major general Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. Four other companies failed to arrange in time the funds needed to buy the licence, letting Mango, seventh in line at the auction, grab the opportunity. "We agreed to a BTRC letter in December to get the WiMAX licence but wrote to them for more time as we were raising funds from the local sources," Mango managing director Mir Masud Kabir told bdnews24.com. And the regulators obliged, but eyebrows were raised. According to the WiMAX licence guidelines, a company, having made it at the auction, has to pay half the fee within 10 working days and the rest in three months. Mango was to have paid up the 50 percentTk 107.5 croreby Jan. 21, according to an extended deadline giving the company 30 days. But the company got an extra 40 days to pay this money along with the remaining 50 percent. "The time extension for the Mango Teleservices has taken us all by surprise. This is not right. We had been asked to respond in three days (whether we would be able to pay the 50 percent in 10 days)," Abdus Salam, a member of the fourth highest bidder, Vitel Bangla Consortium, told bdnews24.com. "We knew 50 percent had to be paid in 10 days. At the pre-bid meeting, we asked and were told that the time would not be extended," he said. "We too could get the licence if we were given such an opportunity." The BTRC chairman defended his action. "None except Mango Teleservices officially approached and we would have considered if others too had written to us," the former major general told bdnews24.com. "The 10-day timeframe has been extended to a month but the three-month deadline is still in force," he argued. Bangla Lion Communications, Brac Bdmail Network Limited and Augere Wireless won the right to buy WiMAX licences, offering to pay Tk 215 crore through an auction in September last year. The first deadline for fee payment was Oct. 15, which was extended to Nov. 15 on request, and Augere and Bangla Lion paid up in time. Brac Bdmail later said it would not buy the licence. Later, Vitel Bangla, P-1 and Bangladesh Internet Exchange too regretted the WiMAX licence offer. The WiMAX licence was given away to the state-run Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (BTCL) as a special case. As an IIG licensee, Mango would not even qualify to bid for the WiMAX licence if the regulators followed the original guidelines. Allegations have it that the guidelines were changed just to help Mango, because of the provisions that the existing licensees were barred from participating in IGW, ICX and IIG auctions. And those charging the regulators with foul play refer to the way the lone IIG licensee has been favoured in the past. "Mango is enjoying a 60% discount from BSCCL (formerly part of BTTB) on internet rates that any other ISP doesn't get, and thus making a huge profit," says an ISP CEO, refusing to be named. "BTRC should not try to guarantee profit for one particular company, instead, it should create a level playing field for other operators." Mohammad Monwar Hossain, managing director of BSCCL or Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd, confirmed the 60 percent discount was being given at the instruction of BTRC. Industry sources say this request came from BTRC and was later approved by the telecommunications ministry. "Currently, Mango, without making any value addition to the Internet business is enjoying almost a profit of Tk 50 lakh every month," said a BTCL official, who asked not to be named. What troubles other industry players is that the provision for the highly lucrative 60 percent came out only much later than the auction. BTRC is also accused of acting as marketing arm of Mango. "Officials of BTRC called each and every ISP to take at least 45% of their current bandwidth requirement from Mango Teleservices. They followed it up with a letter," said ISP Association joint secretary M A Hakim. "We buy bandwidth from BTCL at different rates. If we take 45 percent from Mango, we can't go for a higher BTCL slot that has a good price advantage. "It gets costlier because we cannot buy in bulk from BTCL. In addition, when we buy from two sources, we lose 10 percent due to load balancing. So we are forced to buy more than required," Hakim explained to bdnews24.com. The problem is the cost is eventually passed on to the poor customers, who end up paying more for the Internet. "Big bandwidth customers of ISPs such as grameenphone and Aktel were also asked to disconnect their service with ISPs and move to Mango," said another ISP official. Hakim said giving more than once licence to one company was frustrating. "This destroys the promised level playing field. Other investors will lose interest." The three private sector WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) licensees will get to operate on 2.3 gigahertz and 2.5 gigahertz. As per the conditions, each company will have to set up 80 base stations in the relevant areas in the first year of operation and get Bangladesh under WiMAX in three years. Two other conditions put a cap on foreign investment60 percentand the non-resident Bangladeshisup to 70 percent. bd
