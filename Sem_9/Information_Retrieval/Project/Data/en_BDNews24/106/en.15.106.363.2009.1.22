<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League on Thursday denied involvement in the sporadic violence during the Upazila elections across the country. Party spokesperson and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam called the incidents 'stray' and said, "We haven't heard of major incidents that could affect the polls." "Family feuds, communal conflicts and locality-based disputes are reasons behind violence and disorder in the Upazila elections." "We (AL) didn't field any candidate but supported. It wasn't a political election and our MPs and ministers didn't campaign for anyone," he said. Ashraful was critical of the current system of non-political election to the local government tier. "Political parties take part in the local government polls in the developed countries." "Even in America and Britain voter turnout is higher in the local elections than in the national polls." "The separate incidents wouldn't have occurred if parties were involved but the caretaker government and the Election Commission wanted a non-political election." The minister said the ninth parliament should and would consider inclusion of political parties in the local government elections. About the media reports that quoted an election commissioner as blaming the AL for violence, Ashraful said, "I need to make sure which commissioner said and what before comments." "Polls were peaceful in almost all the 481 Upazilas with postponements in six for incidents and also in 13 centres of eight Upazilas," the AL spokesperson said. "We're awaiting full information from the grassroots." "Voter turnout was poor compared with the national election, but remarkable numbers of ballots were cast." "We're still waiting for the percentage of votes polled." He said the government was giving every help to the Election Commission to hold a successful election. He congratulated the EC on holding a successful election and thanked the army for its role in the polls. bd
