 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Forty people were injured in clashes between students of Dhaka Government Alia Madrasa and prison guards of the Dhaka Central Jail over control of a playground at Bakshi Bazar in Old Dhaka on Saturday. The clash erupted shortly before 9am after a game in the field behind the madrasa. Both sides chased each other and hurled brickbats for an hour. The injured received first aid at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, jail hospital and surrounding dispensaries. Both madrasa and jail authorities claimed to own the playground. Students and teachers of the madrasa alleged the jailers had barred them from letting the students play in the field, beaten them, and damaged and looted a number of rooms of the dormitory adjacent to the field. Jail authorities denied the allegation. They said the students had obstructed the guards to play and exercise in the field. Students also rebuked the jailors, they alleged. According to witnesses, the jailers were playing and exercising on one side of the ground and the madrasa students playing cricket on the other. An altercation between the two sides ensued at one stage and deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui went to the spot. But the dispute continued and they started hurling stones at one another. The DIG took shelter at a nearby house at the time. The police, madrasa teachers and prison authorities rushed to the scene and brought the situation under control. Madrasa principal Md Islam Goni accused the jailers of beating, vandalism, and looting. Siddiqui told bdnews24.com the madrasa authorities had been lying to file a false case. Lalbagh police chief Nabojit Khisa told bdnews24.com they were looking into the matter. bd
