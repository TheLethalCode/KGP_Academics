<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce minister Faruq Khan has asked cable operators to reduce charges for satellite TV connections to help realise the government's pledge of a 'Digital Bangladesh by 2021'. "We could make cuts if the government provides security to the industry, revises the existing cable TV regulations and applies them properly," said COAB president SM Anwar Parvez on Sunday. Leaders of the Cable Operators Association of Bangladesh had in fact demanded the government raise connection charges, in a meeting with the minister on Sunday. "You should rather cut the charges," the minister told the delegation in response to their demand. "We (the government) will provide all possible help to cut the cable TV charges as necessary for a Digital Bangladesh," said Khan. Assuring the operators of all help, the minister asked them to work on delivering satellite TV to the masses. "Since lower connection charges are needed for bringing people of all strata into the cable network, the government will provide all facilities available under the trade protection laws." The commerce minister had earlier met with US ambassador James f Moriarty. "The ambassador expressed the hope that the bilateral ties would further strengthen," said Khan. "We also had discussions about increased US investments in Bangladesh and the TIFA (Trade and Investment Framework Agreement)." To a question, the minister said, "The caretaker government worked on the TIFA initiated by the former BNP government and we'll maintain that continuity." "But we haven't arrived at any decision yet on the issue." bdnew
