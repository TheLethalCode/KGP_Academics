 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Basic human rights were violated, the Supreme Court was strained and people suffered under the two-year tenure of the non-elected interim administration, outgoing High Court judge Mohammad Abdur Rashid said Monday. "Helplessness of people was most acute as justice was impeded, and rule of law was not possible as the Constitution was bypassed through undemocratic means," he said. "Some initiatives were not approved by law," Justice Rashid told a farewell reception accorded to him by the Supreme Court Bar Association in his courtroom. "The Constitution is now free of those shackles and prospects for democracy are brighter, but people's aspirations must be guided by the Constitution for the sake of democratic prosperity," said the HC judge. Bangladesh Bar Council vice chairman, advocate Abdul Baset, and attorney general Mahbubey Alam spoke on behalf of the SCBA. Judges of both the High Court and Appellate Division also bade him farewell at the judges' lounge later. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin spoke on the occasion. Justice Rashid was appointed a HC judge on Oct. 24, 1999. He went into retirement Monday as he turned 67. He has given a number of notable judgements in the past two years, including the High Court judges appointment case, on reinstating Aug 15 as National Mourning Day, and on the Supreme Judicial Commission. bdnew
