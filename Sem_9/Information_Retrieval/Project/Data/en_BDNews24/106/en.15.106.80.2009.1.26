 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Monday sentenced Safiur Rahman Babu, son of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, to 13 years for amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth information. "Politicians and their families should be alerted by the verdict," state counsel Monjur Mohammad Shahnewaz Tipu told bdnews24.com after the hearing. He said Safiur was given free rein "to act, being indulged by his father, the former finance minister". Judge Jasmine Anwar of Special Court-4 awarded the sentence and also ordered confiscation of the ill-gotten assets. According to case details Safiur amassed Tk 14 crore beyond his known sources of income and concealed assets to the tune of Tk 1.22 crore from the anti-graft watchdog. The fugitive Safiur faces 10 years and a Tk 10 lakh fine for amassing the illegal assets and the remaining three years and a Tk 5 lakh fine for concealing information in his wealth statement. The two sentences will run consecutively from the time of his arrest or surrender, and Safiur faces another two and a half years behind bars on failure to pay the fines. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on April 29 last year with Ramna Police Station. Some 20 witnesses testified in court on behalf of the state. bdnew
