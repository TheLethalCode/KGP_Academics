<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal on Monday came down hard on a group of trial court judges for what he called "a personal attack", after they called for the secretary's removal last week. "Action should be taken against the judges. The way they have made comments attacking me personally has tarnished my image among my family and in society," the law secretary told reporters at the Secretariat. "They are not supposed to make such comments," he said. A forum of lower court judges on Friday demanded Habibul's removal as law secretary for what they called his alleged actions "against" the judges. Abdul Gafur, president of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association, told reporters on Friday: "The High Court declared illegal Habibul's appointment as law secretary, yet he is taking steps against judges." Habibul said on Monday: "The final verdict is still pending on my appointment as law secretary. The matter is awaiting verdict in the Appellate Division." "Under the circumstances, the judicial officials are attempting to influence the higher court proceedings by making comments against me," he said. "Action should be taken against them on charges of breaching discipline of service," said the secretary. Habibul also protested against allegations by the judges that he was involved in "forcing" businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury to file an extortion case against prime minister Sheikh Hasina and that he was the "inventor of the Minus Two Formula". "I have worked only as a government officer," Habibul said, adding that he did not have personal enmity with anybody. "If the judges raise complaints against anybody they should do it against the government." "I work here today; I might not be here tomorrow. They are trying to make me a villain." "Measures should be taken against them," said the secretary. bdnew
