<TITLE> Satyam to look at funding options, L&T stake </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HYDERABAD,Mon Jan 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Satyam Computer Services Ltd will this week discuss a shortlist of three candidates for chief executive and look at funding options to get the fraud-hit outsourcer through the next few weeks. A meeting on Tuesday of the new board, appointed by the government in the wake of the country's biggest corporate scandal, is also expected to discuss a move by India's largest engineer and builder, Larsen & Toubro, to treble its stake in Satyam to 12 percent. While the board's focus had been expected to be on putting the damaged company back on track, with the selection of a new leadership team, Friday's stake building by L&T will be a distraction. The software services exporter is also striving to keep hold of its global clientele, which includes General Electric and Nestle. The Economic Times reported on Monday that Caterpillar Inc, the world's largest construction equipment maker and one of Satyam's oldest customers, had raised the prospect of ending its outsourcing contract amid concerns over stability and the departure of key staff. "Caterpillar has approached Satyam with a notification seeking termination," the paper said, citing an unnamed Satyam employee familiar with the discussions. A spokesman for Satyam confirmed Caterpillar is a client, but declined to comment further on the report. Satyam has been struggling for survival since Jan. 7 when founder Ramalinga Raju resigned as chairman revealing profits had been overstated for years and $1 billion in cash on the books did not exist. Raju, the company's former managing director and the chief financial officer are in police custody in Hyderabad. Satyam's board said on Friday it was close to finalising additional funds needed until end-March -- to pay salaries and other bills -- and would announce the new arrangement by Wednesday. It said it had a shortlist of three for the chief executive and chief financial officer positions. "We fully recognize the urgency and importance to have the right person with the right experience and abilities to successfully steer the company through these turbulent times," the board said. CIRCLING With a 12 percent stake underlining its position among Satyam's largest shareholders, L&T may emerge as frontrunner among potential buyers for the software services exporter. L&T, which operates a much smaller software services unit, had previously said it may look for an alliance with Satyam once the company's accounts had been fully investigated. "L&T has taken the lead and being a local company it will be favoured by the government also," said R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Mutual Fund. "But my feeling is for the time being they will stop at just below 15 percent. That stake may get them a seat on the board. When the asset/liability positions become clear, they can go for a 20 percent open offer." On Saturday, police said they arrested two partners at Satyam's auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers
