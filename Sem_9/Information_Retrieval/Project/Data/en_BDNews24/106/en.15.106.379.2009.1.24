<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralitharan plans to play through the 2011 World Cup before he finally retires. Muralitharan, 36, captured his 500th one-day international wicket on Saturday in the third and final limited overs match against Pakistan. He is the only bowler to take 500 wickets in both test and one-day cricket. "If I have an ambition it is to play until the next World Cup. After that I will call it quits," he told reporters. Already the highest wicket taker in tests with 769 victims from 125 matches, Muralitharan needs another three wickets to surpass Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram's record of 502 in one-day matches. "These milestones are not that important for me. Winning as a team is far more important. If these milestones come along the way I am happy," Muralitharan said. "I am happy I got this milestone today but the team wining the match in such a big way is more reason to celebrate." Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said Muralitharan was still going strong. "I think the other bowlers doing well is helping him and he is enjoying himself more and delivering for the team like he has always done," Jayawardene said
