<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court heard an appeal by Dhaka University authorities on Monday, against a High Court ruling that deems admission criteria to seven DU departments illegal. After a brief hearing on DU's appeal for a stay order, judge Tofazzal Islam fixed Wednesday for another hearing at the regular bench. The HC on Jan 20 declared that DU admission criteria to Bangla, English and five other departments were unlawful, on a petition by six madrassah students. The conditions say that students who have not taken HSC or equivalent exams in English and Bangla above 200 marks in each subject would not be eligible to take the admission test for the seven departments. The departments are: Bangla, English, Economics, Journalism and Mass Communication, International Relations, Linguistics and Gender and Women's Studies. A group of six madrassah students with Alim degrees lodged their petition with the HC in October, 2008, challenging the legality of the admissions criteria. bdnew
