<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) The government has handed the job of monitoring price movement of essential commodities to Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI), commerce minister Faruk Khan said Saturday. Speaking at a press conference after a meeting of BFTI board of governors, the minister said the government wants it to act as a think tank dealing both with internal and external trade issues. "BFTI would look into the factors of price movements in local and international markets and try to speculate what might happen in the market," Khan said. But can BFTI really do the job? Or does it fall within its ambit of work? BFTI chief executive Professor MA Taslim, a leading monetary and trade economist who co-chairs the macro-economics working group at Better Business Forum, said he hoped to start the work as soon as possible. "I am confident that with the resources we have now we can start the job in 3 to 6 months," he said. BFTI is a private-public initiative, focusing chiefly on trade policy research as well as development of training. "And the board can always expand its scope of work," said Taslim, also a member of the central bank board. The minister, who chairs the BFTI board, said he discussed how to strengthen the BFTI and what would be its tasks other than those relating to just training and development. Khan said he believed the information gathered by this research initiative would help the government take realistic steps towards market development. "It would also help on how to mobilise other government agencies in this regard." The minister said prices of essentials were already coming down. Established with an endowment fund from the government and the private sector, BFTI also receives technical assistance from the European Commission.
