 TAIPEI, Mon Jan 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rain and cold weather cast a damp cloud over the public debut in Taiwan on Monday of two Pandas from China, a gift Beijing hopes will symbolise improving ties with Taipei. The weather kept crowds disappointingly low as Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, whose names together mean "reunion" in Chinese, were unveiled at Taipei Zoo. Disappointed visitors complained they were rushed past the panda enclosure in a matter of seconds, without time to take photos, while vendors lamented that umbrella sales were greater than their panda merchandise. "We were a bit disappointed," said a woman surnamed Chen, who came with her husband and 2-year-old daughter to see the pandas on the first day of the Lunar New Year. "There were lots of people and you couldn't see much. They were just sleeping." There was no such disappointment in China, however, which launched an all-out media blitz on the first day of the weeklong New Year holiday, typically a slow news time. State run China Central Television (CCTV) carried extensive reports from the zoo, while the official Xinhua New Agency reported more than 1,000 people lined up before the zoo opened -- including one man who traveled four hours. IMPROVED RELATIONS The pandas arrived in Taiwan in late December, a symbol of improved relations between the longtime political rivals who once stood at the brink of war. On Monday Panda products were everywhere -- including caps, bags, puppets, pens, balloons, keychains and dolls -- but much went unsold as crowds stayed well below expectations. "The economy is bad. No one wants to part with their money," complained one vendor selling panda dolls outside the zoo. A zoo worker said around 10,000 people had come about midway through the day, well below earlier predictions of as many as 100,000 a day. China has claimed Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It has vowed to bring the island under its rule, by force if necessary, but ties have improved since China-friendly Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May. Beijing has given pandas to nine countries including Japan, the United States and the former Soviet Union since 1957. China had offered the pandas to Taiwan as a goodwill gift in 2006, but the island's then anti-China president refused to accept them. Pandas can only be found in the wild in China where they are rebounding from the brink of extinction but not yet out of the woods -- in large part because of difficulties in breeding
