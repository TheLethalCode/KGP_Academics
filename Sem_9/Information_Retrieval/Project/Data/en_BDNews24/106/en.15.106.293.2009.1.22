 MILAN, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sampdoria beat Udinese 4-1 on penalties to reach the Italian Cup semi-finals on Wednesday, Gaetano D'Agostino and Simone Pepe missing in the shootout following a 1-1 draw. Sampdoria striker Giampaolo Pazzini, who signed from Fiorentina last week, netted his first goal for the club on 55 minutes with an angled shot. Italy forward Antonio Di Natale equalised for the hosts eight minutes later from the spot after a foul by Reto Ziegler but struck the post with another penalty just before the end of normal time. Udinese had not won in 10 league matches heading into the quarter-final while Samp have struggled in Serie A all season. Holders AS Roma visit Inter Milan in the second quarter-final later (1945 GMT). Lazio host Torino on Thursday and Juventus entertain Napoli in the final last-eight clash on Feb. 4
