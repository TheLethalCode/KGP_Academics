 NEW DELHI, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian Premier League (IPL) tribunal completed its hearing into Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif's doping appeal on Saturday and will meet again on an unspecified date to decide what action to take. "They have completed the hearing today, but have reserved the decision," an IPL media official told Reuters after the hearing in Mumbai. "The tribunal will meet again, discuss and decide what action should be taken. No date has been fixed for that." Asif, 26, was suspended last May after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone in the Indian Twenty20 league. The player has denied any wrongdoing although both urine samples showed traces of the banned substance above the permissible limit. Asif and his lawyerr were present at the hearing which lasted for around three hours. The Pakistan Cricket Board has already suspended him from all cricket pending the tribunal's decision. Asif, who has played 11 tests and 31 one-day internationals since his Pakistan debut in early 2005, was also detained for 19 days in Dubai last June after customs officials found opium in his wallet while returning home from playing in the IPL
