<TITLE> Asia Inc's advantage over rivals: Access to money </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Fri Jan 23,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian companies from Sony to Hyundai Motor are slashing spending to cope with collapsing demand, but they can be comforted knowing that banks will still throw them a lifeline if the going gets tough. Most Asian banks are still lending, having largely avoided junk investments that felled mighty giants such as Lehman Brothers. Local corporate bond markets are also still active -- especially as central banks cut rates -- providing another crucial source of funding for corporate Asia. After an initial tepid reaction to the widening financial crisis last year, Asian governments have also rolled up their sleeves and joined their U.S. and European counterparts in ensuring liquidity flows through the financial system. For the export-dependent region, that has meant making U.S. dollars available as a crucial pillar of these measures, along with more conventional measures such as spending packages, tax cuts and, in some cases, outright support for industries. "Most of the Asian banks are in better shape than their U.S. and European counterparts," said Brayan Lai, a credit analyst at Calyon in Hong Kong. "They would still need to be selective in choosing who to refinance. Intuitively, this entails moving toward the high quality credits in their jurisdictions," he added. Times are indeed tough for Asia, as evidenced by data this week showing sharply slowing growth in China and a record plunge in exports in Japan. Earnings are under fire, even at Asian blue chips such as Sony Corp, which this week warned of its first operating loss in 14 years and has outlined a restructuring plan that includes curbing investments, closing plants and axing jobs. It won't be the only one. Hyundai Motor and Samsung Electronics are now churning out fewer cars and memory chips. Thailand's top oil and gas firm PTT PCL is delaying investment projects, and ports-to-telecom conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa put a halt to uncommitted spending until June. Bankruptcies, especially at smaller companies, are inevitable, analysts say. However, for bigger Asian corporates, access to funding may just play a crucial role in ensuring they make it through the crisis, dented but at least alive. Loan-to-deposit ratios -- a key measure of health in the banking sector -- are generally not yet at worrisome levels, giving room for Asian lenders to open their vaults, though there are notable exceptions such as in South Korea. Data in Japan showed lending grew at a record 3.7 percent last month, as companies in the world's second-largest economy, shut out from raising funds in markets, turned to their bankers. The capital market freeze has forced the Bank of Japan to start buying corporate bonds and commercial paper to ease the severe squeeze. The surge in lending growth is even more pronounced in China -- a crucial nexus of global trade -- with data showing new loans in China last month leapt 18.8 percent from a year earlier as state-owned banks did Beijing's bidding by providing funding. Although Asian companies' access to funding had diminished late last year, it was to a lesser extent than in Europe, according to a study by Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm for the financial sector. "Asian companies' access to funding for both capital expenditures and working capital has deteriorated to a lesser extent than it has for companies in Europe, indicating that banks have been more willing to support companies' organic growth plans in emerging markets," consultant Markus Ohlig said in the report. Greenwich's survey of over 500 treasurers and finance directors also shows Asian companies have not yet dipped significantly into bank credit lines -- having learned from the regional crisis a decade ago to build up cash reserves early. Asian companies also enjoy another crucial advantage -- the ability to raise funds domestically. Local currency bond sales surged 43.6 percent to $172.9 billion so far this year, compared to the same period in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is an increase from a stellar last year that saw issuance increase about 10 percent to a record $170.7 billion. These markets are bound to become more attractive as central banks in the region cut interest rates, bringing onboard investors in search for higher yield, and providing Asian corporates with another potential source of funding
