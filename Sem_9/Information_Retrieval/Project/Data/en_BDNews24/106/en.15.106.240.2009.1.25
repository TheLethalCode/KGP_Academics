 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  Heavy fog caused another bout of chaos to flights and ferries from Saturday night to Sunday morning. Azad Zahirul Islam, senior traffic officer at Zia International Airport told bdnews24.com authorities had halted flight departures and arrivals at the airport after Saturday midnight due to poor visibility. At least one flight, of Royal Bhutan Airlines, was diverted to Kolkata early Sunday. Flights resumed shortly after 11 Sunday morning as the fog cleared somewhat, the official said. Ferry passengers see massive delays Ferry, launch and other river transport came to a halt for a second night in a row as dense fog blanketed the country Friday and to Sunday morning, BIWTC officials said. Ferry services were suspended due to dense fog between Paturia-Daulatdia and Mawa-Kawrakandi for over 12 hours from Saturday night to Sunday morning. BIWTC official at Doulatdia Orpon Kumar told bdnews24.com that ferry services came to a halt at around 8:30pm on Saturday night between Paturia-Daulatdia and resumed at 11:30am on Sunday after fog lifted. Ferry movements resumed but severe traffic jams remained, with over 400 stuck at both ferry stations, Kumar told bdnews24.com. Traffic was backed up for about five kilometres along the road to the Paturia ferry station, and some four kilometres at Daulatdia. BIWTC Mawa terminal manager Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com that ferry service stopped at around 10pm on Saturday between Mawa-Kawrakandi as heavy fog appeared and resumed at 11:15am on Sunday. Severe traffic congestion also built up during these hours at both stations. Five ferries with around 150 vehicles between the stations were also stranded in the middle of the Padma. Three other ferries at Mawa could not ply. Fog to last The unusually heavy fog is forecast to last two to three more days, met officials say. "Fog is falling across vast areas of Bangladesh, India and Nepal, but it is heaviest in Bangladesh at the moment with high levels of water vapour blending with pollutants in the air," said chief meteorologist Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma. On-duty meteorologist Rasheduzzaman told bdnews24.com massive amounts of airborne water vapour was rushing to Bangladesh from the Arabian Sea, turning into heavy fog as temperatures drop at night. Sharma said cold waves may sweep the country into February, adding that two cold waves had already blown over the country this winter. "The cold is more severe than the fog. Both are lasting longer this year," he said. bdnews
