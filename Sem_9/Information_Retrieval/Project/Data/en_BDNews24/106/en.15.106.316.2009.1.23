 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Friday said there was no reflection of people's wishes on the Upazila election, unlike the national election. He also alleged the balloting to the local government body was a 'big fraud'. Hinting at the low turnout, Delwar said, "People did not turn up in the Upazila election because they know they vote for symbol but another symbol wins," he said at a discussion meeting marking the 73ed birth anniversary of late president Ziaur Rahman on Jan. 20. Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal, the freedom fighters' front of the party, organised the meeting at Naya Paltan party office on Friday. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, pointing to the tradition of thin turnout in the Upazila polls, had earlier expressed his dissatisfaction with the lower-than-expected turnout in Thursday's election. "The nation faces difficult times today. The specimen of democracy of Awami League was seen in the Upazila polls. It has been proved what type of democracy they want having forced presiding and polling officers out of the polling stations." He also likened the national and Upazila polls to the elections under military ruler HM Ershad in 1986. The former chief whip of parliament urged activists, including the freedom fighters to reorganise the organisation upholding Zia's ideal. Delwar termed both national and upazila elections and the sequence of incidents since Jan. 11, 2007 a part of local and foreign conspiracy. bdne
