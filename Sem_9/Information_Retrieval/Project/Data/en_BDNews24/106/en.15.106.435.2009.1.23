<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com) BNP lawmaker Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has said anything out of the traditional seating arrangement in the parliament with the ruling party to the right and the opposition to the left of the speaker is not acceptable. "The opposition party takes seats on the left of the speaker, while the ruling party seats at the right side of the speaker," Chowdhury told reporters at his home in Dhanmondi on Friday. "But the "digital proposal" of a ruling party whip on the seating arrangement in the parliament is not acceptable," Chowdhury added. The ruling party proposed that in the first 29 rows of parliament, seats will be allocated to the opposition based on ratio, and accordingly, BNP will get three sets on the first row. He said, "If something like this happens, it will be considered as 'digital rigging' and you'll see a different scenario in the parliament on January 24." "If the longstanding seating system is not followed then we will tell the people of the country that we are being barred from playing an effective role in parliament," the senior parliamentarian said. "A ruling party always wants to take seats allocated for government party, it's not clear to me why Awami League wants to take seats of opposition so soon." Chowdhury also said BNP is averse to the idea of boycotting the parliament. "It's our duty to join the parliament as opposition, but it's the responsibility of ruling party to take the opposition to the parliament." "We want to join the parliament and assist the government and we will carry on with constructive criticism of the government's work." "The BNP is against boycotting the parliament. We'll not follow the boycott culture that the Awami League had introduced," Chowdhury said. "We want to extend cooperation to the ruling party in implementing its electoral pledges". He repeated the party's claims that the Dec. 29 general election was "digitally rigged". The turnout for the Upazila election was not satisfactory due to what he said were electronic irregularities in the parliamentary election. The BNP leader was unhappy at the activities of the Election Commission and said, "Though the constitution states that there should be one voter list, election was carried out with two lists." "They have breached their oath; they should quit their positions if they are logical and are ashamed." The opposition MP also proposed an all-party committee to fill the constitutional posts. bdnews24
