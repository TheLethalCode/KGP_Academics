 MELBOURNE, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top seed Jelena Jankovic was knocked out of the Australian Open by an inspired Marion Bartoli in the fourth round on Sunday. The Frenchwoman capitalised on the Serbian's shaky serve, blasting winners at every opportunity before ending the world number one's misery 6-1 6-4 in just 82 minutes.
