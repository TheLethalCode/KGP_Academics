 Barisal, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has much to offer the US, ambassador James F Moriarty said on Monday, while celebrating 'America Week' in Barisal. "The new democratically-elected government of Bangladesh has given rise of hopes among the people of the country in its "Vision 2021". "And now it's their duty to fulfil it," he said at a press conference in Barisal. In a written statement, Moriarty thanked the outgoing caretaker government for holding a free, fair and neutral general election on Dec. 29. Citing longstanding ties between Bangladesh and the US, he said: "We intend to continue this strong bond of friendship and look forward to working with the newly-elected government of Bangladesh to achieve its goal of a better and more prosperous future for all of its citizens." Bangladesh has much to offer the US, the ambassador said. As Bangladesh's top export destination, the US helps provide livelihoods to the millions of Bangladeshis who provide the US with important goods, notably ready-made garments, Moriarty said. "Bangladeshi-Americans contribute to both of our countries as educators, entrepreneurs, politicians and civic leaders," he said. Bangladeshis in the US send home over one billion dollars a year in remittances, he added. Just prior to the press conference, the US ambassador along with Barisal mayor Shawkat Hossain Hiron formally inaugurated a three-day "America Week" event at the Barisal Club. Sponsored by the US Embassy, Dhaka, America Week highlights the important ties between the people of Bangladesh and the US by taking the embassy activities to the people outside the capital, a release said. The Barisal programme features presentation, outreach and site visits showcasing US government-funded programmes in Barisal, providing the visitors with the opportunity learn how to apply for study at a US university, apply for a US visa or participate in a US government development project, the release said. Annual America Week programmes have been held in Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet in previous years. The first one was held in Chittagong in 2002. "We are here to celebrate Bangladesh' transition to a democratically-elected government and the beginning of the Obama administration in the United States," the ambassador told the press conference reading out the written statement. "This week, we bring America Week to Barisal. We are here to share a bit of American culture and values and to learn about what makes Barisal unique," he said. The Barisal edition, the sixth one, from Jan. 26-28 is hosting some 40 booths run by the US Embassy, USAID and its development partners and some US businesses. USAID Mission director in Dhaka Denise Rollins accompanied the ambassador, who along with the Barisal mayor and Rollins, following the inauguration, visited a number of booths at the venue. Hiron also spoke the press conference. Following the press conference, Moriarty visited two projects  World Fish Centre and Blue Star Clinic, Shere-e-Bangla Museum and Gutia Mosque here. bdnews24
