 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) - Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, on the eve of the third Uazila elections, invited voters to cast their ballots without fear assuring there was "no scope for violence". "We can firmly assure all that there is no scope for any violent incidents this time and all can apply their voting right without any hesitation," the CEC said in a televised speech on Wednesday evening. Huda said sufficient security measures had been taken up "in the light of previous experiences" to ensure that voters can elect local government representatives freely without any fear. The CEC thanked all for their spontaneous participation in the Dec 29 general election and for extending all out cooperation in supporting the election process. On the significance of the local polls, being held after a gap of 18 years, he said: "The Upazila Parisad being a direct service providing institution, the elected representatives of this institution must come forward when you seek their help," "One mistake in electing a candidate will have consequences on you for the next five years and you will be deprived of the expected services," said Huda. "You must vote wisely, without provocation from any quarters, to elect competent representatives." The election chief advised voters on how to cast their ballots effectively, from knowing their respective polling centres ahead of time to having voter serial numbers ready. Mobile phone networks will run as usual on the day, though none but the presiding officers will be allowed to take mobile phone devices into the polling centres. Huda assured the nation that the voting would be free, fair and neutral: "The entire election process has been arranged in a way that the election results will only reflect the people's will." "No institution is so powerful against the people's will that it could reverse their verdict," said the polls chief. The EC will not announce unofficial poll results, he said. Giving an account of election and results counting rules, Huda warned all presiding and returning officers of severe consequences for any breach of those rules. Voting will take place in 32,381 polling stations of 480 Upazila from 8am to 4pm on Thursday without any break. The government has announced a public holiday in polling areas. Around 73 million voters will elect chairmen, vice chairmen and female vice chairmen of the key local government institution. According to the EC, there are 8,187 candidates contesting countrywide in the polls, for the three positions in each upazila. Of the total, 13 candidates have already been elected uncontested. The local body elections after such a long break come as a result of an initiative by Fakhruddin Ahmed's caretaker government, whose tenure ended on Jan. 6 with handover to Sheikh Hasina's elected government. The third Upazila polls are being held after some 18 years. Former president General Hussain Muhammad Ershad introduced the Upazila system. Elections to the local government bodies were first held in 1985 and then again in 1990. After the fall of Ershad, the then-BNP government repealed the Upazila
