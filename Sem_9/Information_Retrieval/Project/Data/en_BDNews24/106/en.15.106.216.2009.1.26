 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com) - Sheikh Russel KC and Brothers Union played a 2-2 draw in their second-leg match on Monday to widen Abahani Limited's lead in the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Sheikh Russel and Brothers Union now have 35 and 28 points respectively while Abahani stay atop with 38 points. Sheikh Russel, however, has played one match more than Abahani and Brothers' 16 outings. Brothers Union, who slipped out of the title race after losing to Mohammedan 3-1 and playing a goalless draw against struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad, took a 10-minute lead with a strike from Shakil Ahmed. Kenyan striker Nicodemus Anunda released a brilliant minus for Shakib, who just tapped the ball home to put Brothers ahead. Samir Omari levelled the Sheikh Russel margin with a spot kick in the 28th minute, as Brothers defender Ariful Haq brought Omari down inside the danger zone after the Moroccan striker advanced into the box to poise a threat. Alfaz Ahmed doubled the Sheikh Russel lead in the 39th minute as the veteran striker, being set up by Aminul Islam, struck his league's 15th goal to maintain his solo lead in the scorers table. After the break, Brothers stepped up their attack to bring an equaliser in the 66th minute. Jahid Hossain headed a Liton corner home to level the margin for Brothers. bd
