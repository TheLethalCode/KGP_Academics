 Rajshahi University Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi University's proctorial body have resigned en masse in the wake of an ultimatum by Chhatra League activists. "I have resigned as it's impossible to carry on with the duties of a proctor under the present circumstances," proctor Enamul Huq, who quit his post Monday alongside nine assistant proctors, told bdnews24.com. "If someone wants to resign voluntarily then we can do nothing," said acting vice chancellor professor Mamunul Keramat. RU's Chhatra League leaders gave Prof Enamul Huq 24 hours the previous day to resign his post. Clashes broke out on Sunday after police arrested five 'outsiders' who were rallying with BCL's rival Chhatra Dal supporters on campus. The detained were later released, which sparked protest among the Chhatra League. On Jan 17, in the presence of teachers, officials and others, a 22-point guideline was formulated to ensure a 'proper academic atmosphere' on campus. According to the guidelines, no 'outsider' is allowed within the campus. The guideline also outlines strict measures against those who break regulations. bdnews24.co
