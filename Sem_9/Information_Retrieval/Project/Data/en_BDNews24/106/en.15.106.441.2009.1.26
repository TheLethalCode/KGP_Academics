 Barisal, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com) - US ambassador James F Moriarty on Monday said it was critical that "two great democracies", Bangladesh and the US, work together to confront common threats and achieve common objectives of a freer, safer and more prosperous world. "Both the newly-elected leaders must confront the global economic crisis while trying to improve the lives of peoples," he said indicating Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and the US president Barack Obama. Moriarty made the remarks at an opening dinner of "America Week" at Barisal Circuit House. He said the newly-elected governments of Bangladesh and the US have come to power promising change and better future for their people. "That means policies, to strengthen our democracies, to improve our economies, and to better provide for the safety and welfare of our peoples," the ambassador said. "While pursuing change, however, both governments must keep their basic, long-term commitments to their peoples: to protect democracy, to develop the country, and to provide security for their citizens," Moriarty said reading out his written statement. He said the US works closely with Bangladesh on issues from climate change to peacekeeping to counter-terrorism. Last week the US inaugurated its first African-American president at a time when the country faces tough economic challenges and has troops fighting overseas to protect its values, he said. In Bangladesh, the people restored democracy in the most peaceful, free and fair election in this country's history, the ambassador said. "But these two elections are not the end. They are the beginning of new eras." The ambassador hoped that the new government in Bangladesh would continue reforms begun by the caretaker government to improve governance and to lay the foundation for a corruption-free nation. Barisal mayor Shawkat Hossain Hiron, USAID Mission director in Dhaka Denise Rollins, among others, attended the dinner. bdnews24
