<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  A deputy speaker is unlikely to be chosen from the opposition bench when the new parliament convenes on Jan 25, the Awami League spokesperson and LGRD minister hinted on Saturday. "The opposition may not get the post until the post of a new deputy speaker is created through amendment," Syed Ashraful Islam told bdnews24.com. "Our leader promised, in her manifesto, a deputy speaker from the opposition and the BNP pledged the same but only after creation of the second deputy speaker post by making changes to the constitution [will this happen]," said Ashraful. The opposition has expressed unwillingness to accept the job after creation of the post of a second deputy speaker through constitutional amendment. "The House leader in her pre-election pledges said her party, if voted to power, would make the parliament effective and give the post of deputy speaker to the opposition," senior BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury on Saturday told bdnews24.com, "But they are singing a different tune after assuming power. People will judge this," he said. "We'll not work at the diktat of the treasury bench. BNP wants to play a constructive role in the House and is waiting to see if the government allows us to do that." As per the section 74 of the constitution, the speaker and the deputy speaker must be elected on the very first day of the first session. Since no signs of picking up a deputy speaker from the opposition are in sight, both the speaker and the deputy speaker are likely to be chosen from the treasury. bdnews24
