 Dhaka Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Veteran no-nonsense parliamentarian Abdul Hamid was named by the Awami League Parliamentary Party (ALPP) to be new Speaker and retired colonel Shawkat Ali for Deputy Speaker, a party spokesman told bdnews24.com Sunday. After an ALPP meet ending just before the first sitting of the new parliament, Syed Ashraful Islam only confirmed widespread speculations about the two names. "The ALPP has also recommended amending the constitution to create a post of deputy speaker which will be given to the main opposition BNP," he said. Leader of the House Sheikh Hasina presided over Sunday's meeting of the ALPP, which started at 2.15 pm, at the ninth floor of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. Almost all of the AL MPs attended the ALPP, according to party sources. Hamid, who was deputy leader of the opposition in the last parliament, was also speaker in the seventh parliament when the Awami League was in government. Hamid has never lost an election since 1973 and become an MP seven times. The local government minister told bdnews24.com that the ALPP also discussed how the Awami League will implement its pre-election pledge of giving a post of deputy speaker to the opposition. According to existing constitutional provisions, the first sitting of the parliament must elect a new speaker and a deputy speaker. If the Awami League does not offer the post of deputy speaker at Sunday's sitting, the government will have to amend the article 74 of the constitution to create a second post of deputy speaker. The BNP has hinted that it will accept the post of deputy speaker only if it is offered on the first day. bdnew
