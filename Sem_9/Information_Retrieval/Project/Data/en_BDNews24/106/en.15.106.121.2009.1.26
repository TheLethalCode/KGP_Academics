 Moinul Haque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's 19th president may be elected on Feb. 18, Election Commission officials said on Monday. "The final schedule is likely to be announced on Feb. 1 and the Commission has sent the primary schedule to the Speaker," EC senior assistant secretary Farhad Ahmed Khan told bdnews24.com. The EC secretary, Humayun Kabir, has already written to parliament affairs secretary Ashfaq Hamid, said Khan. According to the primary schedule, Feb 8 is the last date for filing nomination, Feb 9 the date of scrutiny and Feb 11 the last date of withdrawal of nominations, he said. The primary schedule gets confirmed on the Speaker's approval. EC officials said since the voting for the election takes place in a Jatiya Sangsad room, the polling date has to be changed if it coincides with a parliament session. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had said early January the presidential polls would be held in February. EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed said the 'Presidential Election Act' requires the Election Commission to announce the presidential election schedule during the first session of the parliament. According to the Constitution, the new president has to be elected within 30 days of a new parliament convening. "Usually seven days is given for nomination-related formalities followed by a day for scrutiny and another day for withdrawal," he said. "In case of more than one candidate, the CEC oversees the polls inside the parliament as the returning officer." The ballot papers used do not carry symbols but the names of candidates, and the MPs sign their names against their choices on the ballot paper in public, he said. "But in case of a lone candidate he or she is declared elected uncontested," said the EC official. There have been 18 presidents since Bangladesh's independence in 1971. Abdur Rahman Biswas, justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, Dr AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and Prof Iajuddin Ahmed have been elected president under the parliamentary system, re-introduced in 1991.
