 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has hoped Bangladesh may get assistance from the US Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) at the year-end. "Due to corruption and lack of good governance, Bangladesh was deprived of this assistance but since a democratically-elected government has come to power, we will try our best to meet the conditions to get this assistance," he told reporters on Thursday after meeting US ambassador James F Moriarty. The US envoy said a final decision on the matter would be given at the end of the year on evaluation of the MCA assistance throughout the year. "For any country to get assistance it must fulfil certain conditions including establishment of democracy, good governance, corruption-free environment and today Bangladesh is moving towards a democracy by having a transparent and accountable polls," Moriarty commented. He also said the US was thinking about providing assistance to Bangladesh. The US gives assistance to poor countries from the MCA funds to help them meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set by the United Nations. bdnew
