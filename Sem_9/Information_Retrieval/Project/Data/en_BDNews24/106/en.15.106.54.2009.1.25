<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club slipped out of the Citycell B. League title race on Saturday with a heart-breaking 2-1 loss to leaders Abahani Limited in the second-leg derby at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Alamu Bukola Olaleken put the Black and Whites ahead in the 45th minute before Jahid Hasan Emily pulled one back for the Sky Blues in the 67th minute. Emeka Christina sealed the match for Abahani one minute from time. With the 12th triumph in 16 matches, Abahani stretched their lead to 38, four and nine points ahead of Sheikh Russel KC and Mohammedan SC, who, however, played a match less. The match started half an hour late as Mohammedan insisted on the shifting of the tie a later date and the punishment to the match referee and the officials of Sheikh Russel KC, who had held Mohammedan 1-1 thanks to a 'controversial' penalty. Mohammedan president Mosaddek Ali Falu intervened at the request of BFF president Kazi Salahuddin to get his side to take the field. The high-voltage match got off to an electric start before some 8000-strong crowda low turnout due to the uncertainly over the matchwith both sides attacking in the first 10 minutes. Abahani, however, went into the defensive as the match progressed and they sorely missed Ghanaian playmaker Auwdu Ibrahim as Mohammedan controlled the midfield. Yet, it was Abahani who made the first foray in the third minute when Abul Hossain headed a Mamunul corner. A Mohammedan defender cleared it but Abahani's defender Sujan headed on the follow-up before goalkeeper Aminul Haq. Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq sent on defender Kamal Hossain in the 25th minute in place of captain Jewel Rana, who ended his 20-year career. Players from both teams shook hands with him and the match was halted for almost five minutes. The former national defender waved to the fans of both teams before walking off the pitch. Mohammedan finally broke the deadlock in the 45th minute when Bukola headed home from a terrible play by Abahani's Arif Khan Joy and netminder Biplob Bhattacharya. Ripon hurled a throw-in from the left and both Joy and Biplob rose to clear the ball, but it went to Bukola taking deflection off Joy and the Nigerian striker did not make mistake to score in the open net. Abahani, after resumption, went all out and midfielder Pranotosh narrowly missed the target from close nine minutes into the second half. Mohammedan's Korean striker Oh Ddogyi once again failed to prove his worth. The tiny striker broke the off-side trap but failed to beat Biplob in a one-on-one situation in the 61st minute. Six minutes later, Abahani's Mamun with his favourite left foot curled a well-judged cross from the right for Emily, who headed the cross home to level the margin. With the match locked 1-1, Mohammedan stepped up the attack with Oh releasing a defense-splitting pass for Abdul Baten. The winger shot over the Abahani post despite getting goalkeeper Aminul alone in the 81st minute. Five minutes later, Mohammedan came close to scoring from a counter-attack, but Abahani defender Mohammad Sujan brilliantly tackled Bukola. As the crowd was preparing to leave the stadium thinking of a 1-1 draw, Emeka struck the 89th minute stunner. Emily drove a powerful shot outside the right-side box that got a bit of out-swing and though goalkeeper Aminul fisted it, but it went to unmarked Emeka, who side-volleyed in from 10 yards. "It was totally a team work as we played all out in the second half," said Abahani coach Amolesh Sen, who admitted that he wanted to parry Mohammedan off in the first half due to the absence to Ibrahim. "It was just bad luck as the players could not take the chances that came their way IN the match," said Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq. Haq thought their title hopes now depended on 'ifs and buts.
