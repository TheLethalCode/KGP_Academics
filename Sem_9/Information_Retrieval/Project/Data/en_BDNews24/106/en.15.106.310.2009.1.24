<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has overridden the chief whip's decision on seat arrangements for the opposition members ahead of the inaugural sitting of the new parliament starting Sunday afternoon. "The arrangement proposed by the chief whip proved to be wrong and it was righted by the Speaker," Sircar, the outgoing Speaker who belongs to Opposition BNP but will not have a seat in new parliament, told bdnews24.com Saturday afternoon. Treasury whips proposed that the leader of the opposition be seated as usual but only with two other colleagues on the front bench, which is to the left of the Speaker, and the other four-party members in columns forming behind the three front-benchers. A senior BNP leader, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, said Friday that the government whips' plan was "unacceptable" that it flouted parliamentary convention. The Speaker on Saturday overruled the whips' plan and ordered the front 10 seats to his left be given to the opposition bench led by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. The second row of 12 seats to the left of the Speaker will also go the opposition members, then five seats each in the third and fourth rows, according to the Sircar plan. Two other chairs have been kept vacant for opposition members should they get elected to seats given up by the top three leaders in by-polls. LDP's Oli Ahmed, according to the arrangement made by the Speaker, will get a seat on the front bench, and has been given the 10th chair to the left of the Speaker. Behind him will be BJP's Andalib Rahman. The treasury bench whips argued that they allocated three out of 29 front bench seats to the opposition based on their total number of MPs. BNP now has 28 MPs, allies Jamaat-e-Islami 2 and BJP 1. The Speaker cited the clauses 7 and 316 of the Rules of Procedure to impose his decisions on the government whips.
