 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) - Fog may last two or three more days in the country, the met office said on Saturday. Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma, chief meteorologist of meteorological department, said cold waves may sweep the country in February. He pointed out that two cold waves had already blown over the country this winter. "Cold is more severe than fog that is also lasting longer this year," he added. Fog usually happens if water vapour blends with the polluted air, he said. "Fog is falling across the vast areas of Bangladesh, India and Nepal, but it is the most in Bangladesh at the moment," the chief meteorologist added. Cold is more severe in the northern region than other regions in the country, on-duty meteorologist Rasheduzzaman told bdnews24.com. He also said huge water vapour was rushing to Bangladesh from Arabian Sea and turning into mist at night. Ferry services between Daulatdia and Paturia piers came to a halt for around 11 hours as dense fog blanketed the bank of the Padma from Friday night to Saturday morning, BIWTC officials said. Ferry service closed around 11:30pm, said assistant general manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation Gopal Majumdar at Daulatdia.
