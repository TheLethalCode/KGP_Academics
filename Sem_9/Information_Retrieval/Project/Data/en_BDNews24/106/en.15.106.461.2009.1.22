 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  A panel tasked to examine 117 ordinances passed by the caretaker government has initially recommended that 45 of them be made into law, the law minister said on Thursday. "All the ordinances will be placed on the first day of the first session of the parliament on Jan 25. Of them, the scrutiny committee will recommend 45 ordinances to tabled as bills," Shafique Ahmed told reporters at the ministry. "Of the remaining ones some ordinances will be presented through bills after discussions in the parliament and others will be repealed," he said. The 117 ordinances had been split in three categories according to their importance. The 45 ordinances include the most important ones, the minister said. The 'less required' ordinances, bracketed in the second category, would be discussed in the parliament and the third category ones will be cancelled, he added. Shafique said the former chairman and two members of Truth Commission had met with him. They said 452 people had sought clemency and pledged to give Tk 36 crore, and Tk 34 crore had been realised. As the ordinance of Truth Commission was being decided by Supreme Court, it was not certain whether the 452 would get clemency, the minister pointed out. "It is not wise to comment on the on-trial issue." On the appointment of Mahbubey Alam as attorney general, Shafique said: "The attorney general is changed with the change of government. Our government has followed it." "We might not completely change the (attorney general's) office like other governments. We will evaluate the honesty and efficiency of the staffers of the office." "We will see whether they can properly handle the cases filed by the government." The appointments to the attorney general's office will be made on competence, the law minister said. He said many fugitive accused had come back to the country and surrendered to the High Court. "They are surrendering to the High Court. The judges give verdict considering the charges against them." "We have full faith in the judges," he said. Asked whether the people were going to the High Court fearing they might not get justice in the trial court, he said: "I don't think so." On the meeting with election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain on Thursday, the minister said: "He came to us to discuss legal issues. We did not talk about Upazila elections." On the moves of the law ministry to curb militancy, Shafique said: "The home ministry has directed the law-enforcing agencies and work is underway." b
