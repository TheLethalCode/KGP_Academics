 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Russel KC returned to the winning ways in the Citycell B. League when they handed a 2-1 away defeat to struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad KS in the second-leg match on Friday. Rajon Mia and Al Morshed slotted one goal apiece for Russel while Rokonuzzaman Kanchan pulled one back at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Sheikh Russel maintained their second place in the point table with 34 points from 16 matches, just one point behind league leaders Abahani Limited, who played a match less. Muktijoddha remained at nine points from 15 points at second place from the bottom. Sheikh Russel, who played a 1-1 draw against Mohammedan in their previous encounter, went ahead in the 12th minute from an unexpected strike from Rajon, whose left-side cross found the back of the net after a fumble by goalkeeper Paul. Muktijoddha, who played better in the second leg to draw against Brothers Union and Chittagong Abahani, scared the title contenders with an equaliser in the 28th minute. Kanchan, the former national forward, tapped a Jalal minus home to level the margin for the All Reds, who then parried Sheikh Russel off for 50 minutes before Morshed struck the winner. The league's top-scorer Alfaz Ahmed set Morshed inside the danger zone and the winger slotted the ball home to give Sheikh Russel their fifth win in second-leg six outings
