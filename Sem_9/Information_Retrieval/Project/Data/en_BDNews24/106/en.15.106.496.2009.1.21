 Chittagong, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University resumed academic activities Wednesday, after days of disturbances sparked by student clashes and a two-day campus lock-down by Chhatra League. "The campus has returned to normalcy. Many students were back on campus," newly appointed proctor Dr Mohammad Anwarul Islam told bdnews24.com. Most departments held classes and examinations, said the new proctor. "The university administration has also returned to its duties. All-inclusive steps will be taken to totally normalise campus activities," said Islam. However, vice chancellor Dr M Badiul Alam was not seen in his office. CU's Bangladesh Chhatra League unit laid siege to the campus on Saturday and Sunday, demanding the resignation of the VC. Although the Awami League-backed student body did not hold any demonstrations or rallies on Wednesday, they promised to continue with their 'movement' until their demand was met. CU Deans Committee, CU Teachers Association, and the 'progressive teachers alliance' have also decided on a 'non-cooperation' movement against the vice chancellor. The CU VC faces allegations of corruption in recruitment and patronisation of the BNP-Jamaat-backed Islami Chhatra Shibir, which has long had a stronghold on CU campus. "The deans are not working with the vice chancellor," Prof Dr Gazi Saleh Uddin, dean of social sciences, told bdnews24.com. "We have taken this decision as there are allegations of corruption and irregularities raised against him," he said. "We called upon the government to take steps against the administration for corruption and irregularities," associate professor Mohammad Quamrul Huda, general secretary of CU Teachers Association, told bdnews24.com. "It means we are demanding the VC's resignation and will not work with him," Huda added. He said they had taken this decision in a working committee meeting on Tuesday. Prof Nurul Anwar, convenor of the 'progressive teachers alliance' also told bdnews24.com: "We have decided not to cooperate with vice chancellor Prof M Badiul Alam due to the allegations against him," He said the alliance, which represents about 250 teachers, also demanded the VC's resignation. bdnews2
