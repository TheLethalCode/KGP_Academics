<TITLE> Sony warns of biggest loss ever </TITLE>

 TOKYO Thu Jan 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sony Corp warned on Thursday it would post a $2.9 billion annual operating loss -- its biggest loss ever -- due to sliding demand, a stronger yen and costs to restructure its ailing electronics operations. The operating loss will be Sony's first in 14 years, underscoring deepening troubles for a company that has fallen behind Apple Inc's iPod in portable music, Nintendo Co in video games, and is losing money on flat TVs. The maker of Bravia LCD TVs and PlayStation game consoles said it would give further details of restructuring plans outlined in December at a briefing at 5.30 p.m. (3:30 a.m EST ) in Tokyo. Chief Executive Howard Stringer will attend. Sony said it now expects an operating loss of 260 billion yen ($2.9 billion) for the year to March, down from an earlier projection for a 200 billion yen profit and far worse than earlier media estimates for a loss of 100 billion yen. "The operating loss is much bigger than I expected," said Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Nobuo Kurahashi. "They may soon announce additional restructuring steps, as what's already out there is not that drastic. I cannot help but have a negative impression from all of this." Last month Sony outlined a restructuring plan that included curbing investment, closing five to six plants and cutting a total of 16,000 regular and contract jobs globally to save $1.1 billion a year in costs. As part of that plan Sony said earlier on Thursday that it may consolidate TV production in Japan into one plant, while keeping the other for distribution and other purposes. Analysts say the electronics and entertainment conglomerate should take more drastic steps. "Its business model and operational issues account for 80-90 percent of Sony's poor earnings. Domestic production costs are a concern but this move is not something that would bring it back to the black or cut losses in half," said Nomura Securities senior analyst Eiichi Katayama. "Sony has to consider ways to lower fixed costs not only for its TV business but for the whole company. It will have to start cutting development costs in addition to production costs." Sony attributed 340 billion yen of the 460 billion yen swing in its operating forecast to its core electronics division, as the slowing global economy depresses demand for its digital cameras, video recorders and flat TVs. But it has also been hurt by the slide in the Japanese stock market, which sliced into the value of securities held by its financial unit. Slower sales in its game and movies divisions have also hit its results. Illustrating the problems Sony faces, Japanese exports plunged 35 percent in December from a year earlier, with electronics sales to China and other parts of Asia among the worst affected as Western orders from Asian assembly plants dry up. The yen rallied nearly 20 percent against the dollar last year and it hit a 13-year high of 87.10 yen on Wednesday. Sony is not the only electronics maker suffering. Rival Samsung Electronics this month reorganized itself into two major groups in response to the global downturn, while Panasonic Corp has also cut its outlook and stepped up restructuring measures. Sony's shares closed down 2.6 percent at 1,938 yen ahead of the revision, underperforming a 1.9 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei average
