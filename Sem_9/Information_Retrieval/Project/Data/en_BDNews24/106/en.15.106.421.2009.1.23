<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce minister Faruq Khan on Friday said his government will adopt measures to spur the growth of the readymade garment export. "The government will cooperate with the garment manufacturers and exporters to take the country to the top among the readymade garments exporting countries," he said at the launch of Chittagong Apparel Fabric and Accessories Exposition. Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) is organising the fair at the Engineers Institution in the port city. The government, being business-friendly, is committed to clearing all barriers to let RMG export flourish, the minister said. "The pre-condition to improving the quality of life is economic development. All steps will be taken to make the economy stronger. It is our government's pre-electoral pledge." The government would soon take realistic initiatives to cut charges at the Chittagong port and set up a garment village in the city to spur business and economic growth, Faruq said. The government will amend laws in the parliament to facilitate business, he added. He further said he believed people would get results of the initiatives to develop gas, power and ports for the industries. Annisul Huq, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries, sought the assistance from the government to elevate garment export to $25 billion from $10 billion. He underlined the need to have a four-lane highway linking the capital Dhaka to Chittagong, the commercial capital. Huq demanded Sunday, instead of Friday, as the weekly holiday. Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin stressed the need for establishing a bonded warehouse by the side of Chittagong port to facilitate businesses. BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez presided over the launching ceremony of the fair that will run through to Jan. 25. Garment manufacturing equipment and apparels are being displayed at 42 stalls of 31 institutions from home and abroad. bdnew
