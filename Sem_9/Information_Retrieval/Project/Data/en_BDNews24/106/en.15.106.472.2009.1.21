 LOS ANGELES, Wed Jan 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "The Guru," a comedy that Mike Myers spent years developing only to see it flop at the box office last summer, led the contenders for the annual Razzie Awards, a tongue-in-cheek commemoration of the year's worst movies, organizers said on Wednesday. The film, in which the Canadian comic plays a spiritual healer, picked up seven nominations, including worst picture, director and screenplay. Myers will compete for worst actor alongside some of Hollywood's biggest stars -- last year's winner, Eddie Murphy, ("Meet Dave"), Al Pacino ("88 Minutes" and "Righteous Kill"), Mark Wahlberg ("The Happening" and "Max Payne") as well as comedian Larry the Cable Guy ("Witless Protection"). The worst actress category comprises Myers' co-star Jessica Alba, who was also honored for "The Eye," Cameron Diaz ("What Happens in Vegas"), Paris Hilton ("The Hottie & the Nottie"), Kate Hudson ("Fool's Gold" and "My Best Friend's Girl"), and the cast of "The Women," including Annette Bening, Eva Mendes, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Meg Ryan. Director M. Night Shyamalan's "The Happening" and the low-budget romantic comedy "The Hottie & the Nottie" were also nominated for worst picture, alongside the similarly themed spoof combo "Disaster Movie" and "Meet the Spartans," and the fantasy adventure "In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale." "Disaster Movie" and "Meet the Spartans," competing as a single entity, garnered six nominations, while "The Hottie & the Nottie" and "In the Name of the King" landed five each, and "The Happening" four. As with "The Guru," they all yielded nods for worst director and worst screenplay. Hilton scored a total of three nominations. The socialite, who is not known for her acting chops, was also cited for her supporting role in "Repo: The Genetic Opera" and in the worst screen couple race for "The Hottie & the Nottie." The Razzies are determined by 687 voters -- more than eight times as many who vote on the Golden Globes. Winners will be announced during an appropriately tacky ceremony at a Hollywood theater on February 21, a day before the Academy Awards. The nominees are usually nowhere to be seen, although Halle Berry sportingly showed up four years ago to accept her prize for "Catwoman.
