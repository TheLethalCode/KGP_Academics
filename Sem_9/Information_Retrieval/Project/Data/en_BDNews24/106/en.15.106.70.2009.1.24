<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Accounts of influential persons and organisations frozen by the caretaker government will not reopen soon, the finance minister has said. The government has not taken any decision either about whether these accounts will operate, AMA Muhith said after meeting a delegation of the International Medical College on Saturday. "The file on the frozen bank accounts is on my table and many parties, Anticorruption Commission, National Board of Revenue and other government organisations are involved in it. "The decision in this case will be taken by judging all aspects." On Jan. 20, electronic media quoting the finance minister reported that the government would allow access to frozen bank accounts. The daily newspapers ran the report the next day. "I have not said the bank accounts will be reopened in seven days. I said the government will take a quick decision on the frozen accounts. I have not made any comment on the reopening of bank accounts," Muhith explained. "Many parties are involved in the whole process. There will be no quick decision on the matter. Decision has to be made taking into consideration the whole process". As many as 300 bank accounts were frozen by the caretaker government on charges of corruption and irregularities. Most of the accounts were owned by influential politicians, businessmen and industrialists and their organisations. On the rise of essential commodities, he said, "After we took over, prices of some commodities including rice, lentils and edible oils started coming down. "We hope prices will fall further. We are thinking of a stocks policy. In the meantime, work on formulation of a stocks policy has started. "The policy will be determined by how much foodgrains will remain in stock with the government and which commodities are to be stored to build up the stock." The finance minister said in the budget for upcoming 2009-2010 fiscal year the stock policy will be announced. On his meeting with the delegates of the International Medical College, he said, "Most of the steering committee members of this college are from Sylhet. "They came to congratulate me since I am a man from the area. They informed me that there is great demand of nurses abroad. If they can be trained out of necessity, the amount of remittance will increase." He said he had told them the government would consider their proposition. Prof. Shahela Khatun led the delegation. bd
