 LONDON, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur survived a torrid evening against Burnley to reach the League Cup final despite losing the semi-final second leg 3-2 after extra time on Wednesday. The holders, leading 4-1 from the first leg, trailed 3-0 and were three minutes away from an embarrassing exit on away goals when Roman Pavlyuchenko put them ahead on aggregate and Jermain Defoe rubbed added another goal in the dying minutes. Championship (second division) Burnley looked set to reach their first domestic cup final for 47 years when Jay Rodriguez pounced to put them 3-0 ahead in the 87th minute after goals by Robbie Blake and Chris McCann had given them hope. With away goals only counting after the extra 30 minutes, Burnley were hanging on grimly until Russian Pavlyuchenko finished off a slick passing move. Tottenham will face Manchester United in the Wembley final after the English, European and world club champions saw off Derby County 4-3 on aggregate on Tuesday. The two teams also meet this weekend in the FA Cup fourth round
