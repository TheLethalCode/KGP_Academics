<TITLE> DU to appeal HC ruling on admissions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities will appeal against a High Court ruling declaring illegal Dhaka University's admission criteria to seven departments. "An appeal will be filed in the coming week," new DU vice-chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique told reporters on Thursday. The decision came from a meeting of the DU deans committee chaired by the VC, after a High Court bench ruled illegal requirements for admission to seven DU departments of minimum two 100-mark courses in both Bangla and English at higher secondary level. Prof Siddique said according to a 1973 ordinance, departments under different university faculties can decide independently on admission criteria and the seven departments had taken their decisions under the rules. The deans will also announce the schedule for viva voce as the admissions process had remained halted following an earlier HC order, the VC said. A two-member High Court bench, of justices Mir Hasmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain, gave the ruling on Tuesday on a writ petition by aspiring DU entrants. The petition was filed by five madrassa students challenging the legality of the admissions criteria that barred them admission. Seven DU departments imposed the conditions last year: Bangla, English, Economics, Mass Communication and Journalism, International Relations, Linguistics, and Gender and Women Studies. The HC on Dec. 2 halted the admissions process of the seven departments for the 2008-09 session. bdnews
