 MELBOURNE, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova got an easy ride into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Monday when her Chinese opponent Zheng Jie retired from their fourth-round clash with a wrist injury. Kuznetsova was leading 4-1 in the first set when Zheng threw in the towel, souring her dream of a sweet victory on the Chinese New Year's Day. Although she is right-handed, like most professional players Zheng uses both arms on her backhand but said she had lost all her power in her left wrist and was in too much pain to continue. "This is the first time (it has happened)," she told reporters. "I don't know. I hope it's not too bad. "This was my first time in the fourth round of the Australian Open. I was so happy but today is Chinese New Year. "I hoped I could win this match. It's so bad I'm injured." Kuznetsova, a former U.S. Open champion seeded eighth at Melbourne Park, extended her sympathy to Zheng. STRONGEST BLESSED "Only the strongest are blessed, that's a saying we have in Russia," Kuznetsova said. "I felt sorry for her because she was in great shape. She was playing good. This pain, I hope is not very dangerous." Despite her concerns, Kuznetsova said she was confident of winning the match, had it continued. "I started to play well. I was attacking her serve. I think I was in control of the match," she said. Kuznetsova was the fourth Russian woman through to the last eight in Australia this year, joining Dinara Safina, Elena Dementieva and Vera Zvonareva. She faces a tough quarter-final on Wednesday against Serena Williams, who also advanced when her fourth-round opponent Victoria Azarenka retired. "It's definitely gonna be hard. She's won many grand slams, she's very tough, she serves well," Kuznetsova said. "But I'm definitely confident in myself and I just want to play my best and will go there with motivation, just fight with spirit
