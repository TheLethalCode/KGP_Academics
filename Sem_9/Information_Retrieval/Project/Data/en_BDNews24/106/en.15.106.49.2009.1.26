<TITLE> JS seating plan to be changed: Hamid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Jatiya Sangsad seating plan, which has drawn complaints from some quarters, will be changed, the new speaker said the day after parliament convened. "The seating arrangement made by the outgoing speaker was not right," Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com on Monday. "The new layout will be decided after consultation with both the ruling and opposition parties," he said. Hamid will hold a meeting with the treasury and the opposition whips Tuesday morning, chief whip Abdus Shahid told bdnews24.com Monday evening. However, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury - MP and parliamentary adviser to opposition leader Khaleda Zia - has already made it clear that his party will not accept a revised seating plan. Shahid said the treasury bench was still looking to allocate front row seats on a proportional basis, meaning the opposition BNP would get three out of the total 29 seats on the front bench. The chief whip had earlier protested Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar's decision of allocating BNP two front rows to the chair's left, saying it amounted to "dishonouring the treasury bench and the leader of the House". Outgoing speaker Sircar, the day before parliament convened, overruled government whips' plan and then again rejected the chief whip's call to review his decision. Shahid in his plan had given the BNP three out of ten seats in the front bench as the main opposition gained only 30 seats in the 300-seat parliament which convened on Sunday. He quoted Sircar as telling him the day before the inauguration: "I have done what I thought right as per the parliamentary practices and rules of procedure. If you think my decision is incorrect, the next speaker can change the arrangement." According to the rules of procedure, the speaker will decide the seat arrangement and he can either accept or reject the recommendations of the treasury bench. The speaker may also change the JS seating plan at any time. But according to previous practices, the outgoing speaker finalises the seating layout for a new parliament through consultation with the chief whips of treasury and opposition benches. Outgoing speaker Sircar, however, finalised the arrangements without holding talks with the treasury bench. bdnews
