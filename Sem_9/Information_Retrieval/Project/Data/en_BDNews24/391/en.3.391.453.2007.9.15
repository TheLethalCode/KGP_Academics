<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  In a change of mind, pro-BNP lawyers will now file a bail petition for former prime minister Khaleda Zia with Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court in a couple of days instead of Sunday. The changed decision came from the lawyers' meeting Saturday. Khaleda's lawyer Sanaullah Miah had earlier told bdnews24.com: "The petition will be filed at 9am Sunday." But in the evening he said: "The bail petition cannot be filed Sunday. The leaders of the Lawyers Forum in an evening meeting made the new decision." Sanaullah Miah refused to say who were present at the meeting, replying, "I was present in the meeting." Earlier on Wednesday, Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Jalal Ahmed did not accept a petition for bail to the detained former prime minister, who was arrested on Sept 3. He refused to accept the petition saying that it was not in his jurisdiction to hear a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2, accusing 13 people including Khaleda. bdnews24.
