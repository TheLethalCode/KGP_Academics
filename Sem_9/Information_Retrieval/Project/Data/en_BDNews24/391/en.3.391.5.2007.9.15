 Rangpur, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  The strike called by interns at Rangpur Medical College Hospital was withdrawn Saturday, bringing an end to patients' sufferings that started Friday. Relatives of a college teacher, alleging that he was not getting proper treatment at the hospital, attacked doctors Friday. Ten people, including three doctors, were injured in the clash between the doctors and the patients' relatives and their supporters. Immediately after the incident, the internee doctors stopped providing medical care to the patients. They called an indefinite strike demanding an investigation into the incident. Patients suffered doubly as several meetings Friday and Saturday failed to end the stalemate. At about 2.30pm Saturday, the hospotal director Dr Saidur Rahman held a meeting with the internee doctors. Rangpur Medical College principal Prof Azizul Islam, and acting deputy commissioner Amir Hossain also joined the meeting. After the meeting at about 4pm, Dr Saidur Rahman told reporters that as per doctors' demand, it was decided to increase the number of night guards in the hospital. A police team led by a sub-inspector would stay in the hospital round-the-clock. The district administration had assured the doctors of action against those responsible for the attack. Following the assurance, the doctors withdrew the strike and joined work. A three-member committee was formed to probe Friday's incident. The committee led by associate professor Dr Amaresh Saha has been told to submit its report in three days, the hospital director said. Medical care in all the wards including the emergency department of the hospital had stopped due to the strike from Saturday morning. Patients coming from different areas to the emergency department went to private hospitals after waiting for hours. bdnews2
