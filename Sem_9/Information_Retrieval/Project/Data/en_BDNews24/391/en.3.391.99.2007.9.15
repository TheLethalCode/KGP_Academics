 BEIJING, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian and Chinese rescue workers found the bodies of two of six Russian tourists who have been missing in China's vast far west for nearly two weeks, state media reported on Saturday. The bodies were discovered beneath two canoes along the Yurungkax River, which flows through the city of Hotan in the western region of Xinjiang, Xinhua news agency said, citing sources at the rescue headquarters. The group had been exploring the river since mid-August and failed to turn up at Hotan early this month as planned. Authorities have not yet identified the bodies which were being brought to Hotan, Xinhua said. An eight-person rescue team, including five Russians, parachuted into the area on Saturday to join eight workers already there, Xinhua said. China, with its vast deserts, mountains and forests, is attracting more and more adventure tourists
