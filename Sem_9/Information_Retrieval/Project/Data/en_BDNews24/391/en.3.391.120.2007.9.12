 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  The expatriates welfare ministry Wednesday asked the government to declare 14 non-resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) as commercially important persons (CIPs) for their foreign currency contributions to the economy. "We have placed a proposal to the Cabinet Division. On average these individuals send at least $150,000 a year through legal channels," Abdul Matin Chowdhury, acting secretary of the ministry, told bdnews24.com. Matin added that providing the high status would encourage more non-resident nationals to remit money to the country through formal banking channels. According to the ministry, expatriates will receive various benefits under the proposed status such as speedy resolution for land registration and legal aid on cases over land disputes. The ministry took the initiative after the previous political government framed a guideline in July 2006 to declare expatriates who send at least $150,000 through banking channel as CIPs. Under the proposed move a person will need to apply for CIP status, although tax-dodgers and loan defaulters will not be eligible. Matin also said there were plans to extend the scheme to expatriates who send less than $150,000 a year to the country. Some 5 million expatriate Bangladeshis provide the country with its second biggest foreign currency earnings after exports. They pumped $5.97 billion back into the economy in 2007, up 24.5 percent from a year ago, according to official data. bdnews24.com/
