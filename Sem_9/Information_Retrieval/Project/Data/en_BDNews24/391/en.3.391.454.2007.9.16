<TITLE> Hannan, Delwar fight turf war over BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)Disagreement has surfaced over party leadership between BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah who claims himself to be the "chief coordinator" of the troubled party. Hannan Shah claims the reins of BNP in the absence of the detained chairperson, but Delwar has labelled the move as 'contradicting the BNP constitution'. "There's no such thing as the chief coordinator in the party constitution," Delwar said Sunday. "BNP will decide issues like participating in the Election Commission dialogue or holding a party council after discussing the matters with its chairperson." "Despite difficulty, we're trying to meet Khaleda Zia to discuss the issues," the secretary general, installed by Khaleda, told bdnews24.com. "The chairperson has been detained but the party still works under her leadership as before," he asserted. Hannan, on the other hand, told bdnews24.com: "The chairperson entrusted me with party coordination tasks before she was detained." "I've shouldered all the burden of coordinating the party activities since the emergency rule was imposed in January. Now, many leaders are popping inout of nowhere. But I'll continue to work as the coordinator as instructed by Khaleda Zia," he said. Party insiders said a rift grew between the two leaders over some issues, such as wooing former president Badruddozza Chowdhury back into the BNP camp and holding the party's divisional meetings after the Ramadan. bdnews
