 Dhaka, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com) Three pro-reform Awami League leaders were mobbed and heckled Wednesday by party activists and followers after a special meeting of the party. Mukul Bose, AL's acting general secretary, faced angry protests from workers when he came out of the AL chief's office in Dhanmondi. Abu Sayeed, a central leader and former minister, was also heckled while Abdul Mannan, organising secretary of the party, faced a similar situation after the meeting. Mukul Bose was leaving at about 5.15pm when party activists started to jeer at him. At the time, some other activists stepped in and brought the situation under control. The supporters then started chanting slogans for AL chief Sheikh Hasina, and surrounded and punched Mukul's car. When Abdul Latif Siddiqui stepped in and tried to stop the activists from attacking Mukul's car, it made them more furious. They started to vent their anger with kicks and punches to the car that continued until it sped away. Abu Sayeed who came to the meeting with AL's health and population affairs secretary Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin went to Latif Siddiqui upon seeing Mukul Bose's situation. When Latif Siddiqui took Sayeed into his car, activists and supporters started kicking his vehicle too. At about 5.30pm, when the situation was a bit calm, Abdul Mannan came out only to be surrounded by activists. Three or four of them tried to protect Mannan but failed. Retired major general Subid Ali Bhuiyan stepped in and tried to calm the mob, but the angry activists did not listen to him and started tugging at Mannan's clothes until he was taken back inside by some others. Meanwhile, AL's organising secretary and Hasina's political affairs secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury left the place anticipating a bumpy situation while the press briefing was going on. Presidium member Tofail Ahmed hurried out of the Dhanmondi office after the press briefing ended. Earlier, when Saber reached the office, a supporter told him, "If you talk about reforms leaving the issue of the leader's (Hasina) freedom aside, you will face the same as Mukul Bose." Moments later, AL leader KM Jahangir came in. An activist told him: "There cannot be any agenda other than Hasina's freedom." The activists started shouting when Jahangir wanted to say something. He rushed into the officeapparently scared. The supporters shouted a "traitor" referring to him. Meanwhile, an oraganisation named, "Sheikh Hasina Mukti Parishad" (Council for Sheikh Hasina's Freedom) distributed leaflets in front of the AL chief's office. Front organisations, Jubo League and Shechhwashebak League posted stickers on cars and posters on walls demanding Hasina's freedom. bdnews24.co
