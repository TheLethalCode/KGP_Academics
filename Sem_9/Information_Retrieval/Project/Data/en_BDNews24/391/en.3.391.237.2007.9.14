<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Lt Gen (Retd) Mahbubur Rahman Friday said it was possible to keep BNP united by purging it of corruption. He said he hoped a "reformed" BNP would emerge and lead the country again with people's mandate in the next election. "We will sit in a meeting Saturday. We want to restore the image of the party tarnished in the past through corruption and criminalisation," Gen Mahbub, a standing committee member, told bdnews24.com Friday afternoon. The former army chief said they were deliberating on what could be done. "Not only in words, but the party will have to be reformed through deeds." "We must always keep in mind the party is greater than individual and the country is greater than the party. Our respected leader [late president Ziaur Rahman] taught us so. BNP is facing crisis today as it deviated from the ideals of Zia." Pro-reform leader and expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan has called a meeting of the party executive committee including the standing committee, the council of advisers and former lawmaker at the Elegant Community centre in Gulshan Saturday. Mahubub said, "Though sad it is true that the party is facing disaster due to corruption. A cleansing inside the party is necessary." He said the scope to practise democracy in the party, an end to individual leadership and necessary reforms to the party constitution were urgent needs. bdnew
