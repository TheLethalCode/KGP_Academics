 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka were in record-breaking mood as they beat Kenya by 172 runs in a Twenty20 World Cup mismatch in Johannesburg on Friday. After their batsmen had hammered the Kenyan bowlers by amassing a record twenty20 score of 260 for six, their attack ensured the Africans' reply had the tone of a test match innings as they crawled to 88 for nine in 19.3 overs. Thomas Odoyo was injured and could not bat, Left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas took two for 15 in his four overs with the new ball and Lasith Malinga looked in fine form with two for 13. Sri Lanka's winning margin is the biggest in twenty20 internationals, beating England's 100-run victory over Australia in Southampton in 2005. The Sri Lankans plundered 30 fours and 11 sixes in a brutal run-fest that crushed Australia's record score of 221 for five against England in Sydney earlier this year. They lost opener Upul Tharanga for 10 and meandered to 19 for one in the first three overs after being sent in to bat. But Sanath Jayasuriya (88) and Kumar Sangakkara (30) then showed their liking for the Kenyan bowling with a second-wicket stand of 75 off 41 deliveries. The run-rate quickened when captain Mahela Jayawardene (65) joined Jayasuriya and they took the score to 181 in the 15th over. Jehan Mubarak ensured it was no contest as far as the world record was concerned scoring 46 not out off just 13 balls
