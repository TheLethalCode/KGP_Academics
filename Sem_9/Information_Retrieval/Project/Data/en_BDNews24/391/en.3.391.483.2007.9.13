<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  LDP leader Abdul Mannan Thursday said 'good sense has prevailed in the BNP' as efforts are underway to take Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury into the 'reformist' fold. However, it remains to be seen whether Badruddoza, now the LDP president, will accept a position within the embattled and divided BNP. Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's pro-reform BNP faction Thursday urged the party's founding secretary general to return to the party. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Mannan said: "Badruddoza Chowdhury has been with the party through its various ups and downs." "But the BNP behaved in a very unfortunate way with him. Everyone knows the disgraceful way in which he was removed from his post." The LDP leader added: "Lately however Mannan Bhuiyan and his associates have realised how much the BNP still needs him." bdnews24.com
