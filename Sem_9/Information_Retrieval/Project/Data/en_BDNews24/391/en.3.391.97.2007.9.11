 LONDON, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index rebounded on Tuesday after two days of sharp losses to end up 2.4 percent as cheapened banks and commodity stocks were in demand on growing hopes of an imminent US interest rate cut. The FTSE 100 closed up 146.6 points at 6,280.7, the biggest one-day percentage rise since Aug. 17 when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to calm panicky investors. In the previous two sessions, the UK benchmark index had lost more than 2.8 percent. Other European markets also finished higher on Tuesday. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a speech in Berlin, did not discuss the outlook for US economy or interest rates. Still, market players remained hopeful that the US central bank will cut rates at its meeting next week. "The commodity prices have helped the miners. The price of oil is close to new high so oil shares are better. The hope of an interest rate cut is pushing the market," said Les Ames, a trader at WH Ireland. Banks were the biggest winning sector, contributing more than 30 points to the index. Northern Rock, HBOS, Lloyds TSB, Alliance & Leicester, Standard Chartered and HSBC were all up. Barclays climbed 4.7 percent to top the FTSE 100 gainers. The bank's president, Bob Diamond, said on Monday a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland would probably trump its bid for ABN AMRO. RBS rose 2.9 percent. Elsewhere in the financial sector, hedge fund group Man Group added 3.4 percent and credit information firm Experian Group was up 3.8 percent. Commodities were the other standout gainers as metal and crude prices firmed, with BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Vedanta Resources, Xstrata, Anglo American, Lonmin and Kazakhmys up 2.7 to 4.3 percent. Index heavyweight BP advanced 1 percent and Royal Dutch Shell tacked on 1.3 percent. UK-based oil explorer Cairn Energy rose 3.5 percent after it said its Indian subsidiary had received a key approval for a pipeline critical to exploiting its Rajasthan fields but still awaits full government clearance. TESCO, NEXT CLIMB Tesco put on 4.4 percent after Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating on the stock to "overweight" from "neutral". Plumbing products and building materials distributor Wolseley rose 3.8 percent in its largest one-day rise in 3-1/2 weeks as traders cited a bounce in line with the market after hitting its lowest point since December 2004 on Monday. Among other individual movers, clothing retailer Next added 4.3 percent after it beat first-half profit forecasts but said trading was tough and that it remained on track to meet analysts' current expectations for the full year. Sporting goods retailer JJB Sports slumped more than 14 percent after it said its underlying first-half profit would be nearly a third below original expectations as like-for-like sales fell 4.4 percent. Electricals goods retailer DSG International, however, was one of the two losers on the UK benchmark index, down 0.2 percent to 146.9 pence after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock to "underweight" from "equal weight" and cut its price target to 135 pence from 155 pence.
