 BEIJING, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has freed one of the founding members of an opposition party after serving nearly eight years in prison for subversion, a Hong Kong-based rights group said on Saturday. Mao Qingxiang, a founder of the now-defunct China Democracy Party, returned to his home in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, on Friday, the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said in a faxed statement. The organisation said it had confirmed Mao's release by telephone. Mao was sentenced to an eight-year term in November 1999, the group said, adding that more than 23 other members of the party were still in prison. China's ruling Communist Party maintains a firm grip over dissent in the country, routinely jailing those who speak out against its policies.
