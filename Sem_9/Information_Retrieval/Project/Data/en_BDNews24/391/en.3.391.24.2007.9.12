<TITLE> Banning politics in democracy is bizarre: rights group </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government's decision to partially lift the ban on political activities has not gone far enough to redress a lack of basic freedoms in Bangladesh, the Human Rights Watch said in a statement Wednesday. "The idea that politics is banned in a democracy is bizarre. If the Bangladeshi authorities are serious about restoring democracy, they must fully end the ban on political activities," said Sophie Richardson, Asia advocacy director for the New York-based rights organisation. The nongovernmental organisation outlined the current political landscape in Bangladesh from the imposition of the state of emergency in January through the imposition of the ban on politics to the announcement of the ban's relaxation on Sept 10. It stressed the importance of extending the permitted activities for political parties beyond only discussions on internal party reforms. "Politics is not a sport that can be played only in an indoor arena," Richardson said. The report also questioned the legitimacy of restricting political gatherings of more than 50 people and the large number of offences that have been made non-bailable. "The government should make the same commitment to ending human rights abuses that it has made to fighting corruption," Richardson said.
