 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Aghore Mondal, the former sports editor of Bhorer Kagoj and Channel i, Wednesday cleared his position on the ICC accreditation card. Aghore was accused of cheating the Daily Janakantha to get the ICC accreditation card to cover the ongoing ICC Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. "I have never applied to Janakantha to cover the ICC event. It was a mistake made by Rushmans, the man responsible for media accreditation of ICC Twenty20 World Cup, but unfortunately the newspaper carried a slanderous story to defame me," said a weeping Mondal at the press conference. On September 11, the Daily Janakantha carried a story accusing Mondal of deception that deprived their reporter Asif Iqbal of getting the accreditation card to cover the ICC event in South Africa. It also accused him of taking money from different sponsors using the name of that Bangla daily. Mondal denied the accusation and called it baseless and an attempt to damage his character. The senior sports journalist presented all relevant documents at the press conference stating that he had applied for accreditation as a freelance journalist and the ICC approved his application. He demanded an unconditional apology from Janakantha within a week. Otherwise, he would go for legal action against the newspaper, he added. bdn
