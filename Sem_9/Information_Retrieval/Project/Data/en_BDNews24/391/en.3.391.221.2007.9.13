<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Liberal Democratic Party leader Oli Ahmad in a controversial statement Thursday said it would do the country no harm if some corrupt persons died in the so-called crossfire of security forces. The chairman of one of the LDP factions blamed the BNP for the present political crisis in the country. He is also a former standing committee member of the BNP. Oli praised the caretaker government for its efforts to put corrupt politicians on trial. "Many people have died in RAB's crossfire. It would not cause any harm to the country if some corrupt people were killed in crossfire through necessity," Oli told reporters at the LDP office in Moghbazar. So-called 'crossfire' in Bangladesh refers to suspicious deaths by gunfire during arrest or in custody by law enforcers, including the police and the elite Rapid Action Battalion. "The country has seen so much corruption in the recent past because of the irresponsibility of some politicians. I thank the government for arranging their trials," Oli said. He came down heavily on BNP's expelled secretary-general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, saying: "Khaleda Zia allowed sycophants like Bhuiyan to rise in the party and rule the country for five years. The country has met its present fate only because of them." Oli spoke after an LDP meeting, the first since leaders from other political parties have joined LDP. bdnews2
