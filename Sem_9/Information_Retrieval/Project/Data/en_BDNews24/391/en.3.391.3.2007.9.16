Bangladesh were dismissed for 144 and South Africa replied with 146 for three to win with seven balls remaining of the Group A match. Smith and Morkel each scored 41 and put on 43 runs for the second wicket after Smith and JP Duminy, who made 36, had shared an opening stand of 65. Two moments of fielding brilliance by Duminy had helped South Africa limit the Bangladesh batsmen. Duminy's dive and under-arm throw from extra cover ran out Shakib Al Hasan for 19 in the eighth over. Three overs later Duminy backpedalled and dived to take a spectacular catch after Masharafe Mortaza, who scored 12, skied a drive off fast bowler Vernon Philander. Bangladesh, who were put in to bat, scored freely early in their innings but struggled to keep the momentum going once the wickets began to mount. Aftab Ahmed hit five fours in his 36, Bangladesh's top score, while South Africa paceman Shaun Pollock took three for 40
