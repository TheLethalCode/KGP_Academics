<TITLE> BNP doesn't endorse Bhuyian's reform plans: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Acting secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday said BNP was not averse to reforms but did not endorse the those proposed by Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, the expelled secretary general. He also played down reports of his conflict with the chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah and denied the deep schism that has torn apart BNP recently. "There is no divide in the party. BNP is united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. Those who think splitting the BNP will serve their purpose are daydreaming," Delwar told reporters at the NAM flat in the Sangsad Bhaban area. On media reports that he was in dispute with Hannan Shah, Delwar said, "There is no conflict between us. The reports of a quarrel are imaginary." Delwar said BNP did not own Saturday's meeting of the Bhuiyan-led group of 'reformists' that branded chairperson Khaleda Zia as dishonest. "If anybody claims that was a meeting of the BNP I would say that was an illegal meeting. The meeting was a super flop. No-one except some known leaders attended the meeting." He said the number of followers of Bhuiyan would fall gradually and no leaders and workers would stay with him in the end. "It does not suit Mannan Bhuiyan to criticise the previous BNP government. He was a minister [in the government]. He had better stop talking about it." bdnew
