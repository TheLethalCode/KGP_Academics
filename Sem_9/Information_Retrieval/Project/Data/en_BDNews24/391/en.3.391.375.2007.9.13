<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's pro-reform BNP faction urged former president and BNP founding secretary general Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury to return to the party Thursday. BNP chairperson's adviser AHM Mofazzal Karim spoke to reporters after meeting Bhuiyan and other senior party leaders at his Gulshan home. "An injustice was done to Badruddoza Chowdhury. He was the founding secretary general of the party and was unjustly expelled from the BNP," Karim said. "We have urged all leaders free from corruption to return to the party fold. Prof Chowdhury has asked for time to make a decision on whether to return to the party or not." "The BNP will sit with the Election Commission in the interest of establishing democratic rule. As the party's chairperson has now been detained the BNP will take decisions in the party's standing and executive committees," he said. Karim pointedly criticised recently appointed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and the 'loyalist' wing of the party for creating a schism within the party. "Most of the leaders and workers of the party are with us. After electing a new leadership in the party council we will go to our Naya Paltan office. Until then our office will remain closed," he said. "All political parties should sit with the Election Commission for talks in the interest of holding the next parliamentary election." Karim added: "Everyone must cooperate so that free elections can be held according to the Election Commission's roadmap." "The future of our democracy depends on the next elections success. That is why we will go for talks without any conditions." bdnew
