 NABLUS, West Bank, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian militant belonging to President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement during a raid in the West Bank city of Nablus on Sunday, local medics said. An Israeli army spokesman said troops operating in the area of the Balata refugee camp fired at two gunmen and confirmed hitting them. Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades said the militant had belonged to their group, and that Israeli soldiers had shot him during a raid. Medics also confirmed he had been killed, and said another gunman had also been shot, but was wounded.
