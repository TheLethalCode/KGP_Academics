<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yasuo Fukuda, the frontrunner to succeed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, says he will stay away from a Tokyo shrine seen by neighbours as a symbol of Japan's past militarism if he is chosen as the new leader. Ties with China and South Korea had turned icy under Abe's predecessor Junichiro Koizumi, largely due to his annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine which honours some convicted Japanese war criminals along with the country's war dead. "Would you do something your friend would not like? You wouldn't right?" Fukuda, 71, told a news conference on Saturday where he announced his candidacy. "Relations between countries are the same. So there is no need to do something that the other side would not like." Fukuda, the son of a prime minister and a former chief cabinet secretary, favours a less US-centred stance and friendly ties with China over containment. Opinion polls show him leading hawkish former foreign minister Taro Aso in the race for the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as most party factions have already pledged him their support. Aso shares many of Abe's conservative agenda aimed at bringing back traditional values and patriotism, and in the past has referred to China as a "threat". The LDP president is assured of the premiership as the ruling coalition commands a firm majority in the parliament's lower house, which picks the prime minister. Abe's year in power was marred by scandals involving his ministers and a devastating election defeat in July that cost his ruling coalition its majority in the upper house. His shock decision to quit this week stirred worries of delay in decisions on vital policies such as tax and fiscal reform. ASO VOWS TO FIGHT The 66-year-old Aso, himself a grandson of a prime minister, criticised the factional support for Fukuda as backroom deals, saying that it would tarnish the party's image among the public, and vowed to fight on despite being outnumbered. "If I were to give up because of the inferiority, then the LDP would be finished. I am going to fight to the end," he told his supporters. While Fukuda appears to have won the backing of most LDP lawmakers, Aso is counting on support from the party's local chapters, which also cast votes at the Sept. 23 party poll. Although he has a record for gaffes, Aso can work a crowd and commands a following among some youths as he is a fan of Japanese "manga" comic books and "anime". "We need his strong character to save the country," Justice Minister Kunio Hatoyama told the gathering of Aso supporters. While no lower house election need be held until 2009, the opposition are demanding that the house be dissolved for a snap election as soon as possible, and deadlock in parliament could prompt one as well. Whoever succeeds Abe faces a potential deadlock in a divided parliament, including a showdown over a Japanese naval mission in support of U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan. Enabling legislation for the mission expires on Nov. 1 and opposition parties are against extending it. Fukuda called on the main opposition, the Democratic Party, for dialogue to make possible the extension of the naval mis
