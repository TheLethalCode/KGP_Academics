<TITLE> Rafique not ready for ICL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Ace Bangladesh spinner Mohammad Rafique says he does not want to play the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) going against the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). "I can only consider playing the ICL if the board releases me since I am still a contracted player of the BCB," left-arm spinner Rafique told bdnews24.com Thursday. A leading Bengali daily has reported that Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Yousuf had called up Rafique in July to know if he was interested in playing in the ICL. Recently named by the International Cricket Council as the Test Player of the Year, Yousuf is one of the four high-profile Pakistani cricketers to have joined the rebel Twenty20 League due to start next month. The multi-million dollar series is being financed by India's largest listed media firm Zee Telefilms and features six teams containing four leading international players each side. The report carried by Daily Prothom Alo quoted Rafique as saying, "Yousuf asked me to call back if I am really interested." "No, I didn't contact anyone or get any official offer from the ICL after Yousuf's call," Rafique told bdnews24.com. He added that he wanted to play for the national team if the board though he still had something to offer. The 37-year old allrounder is now nursing a chest injury that he had sustained during the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka in June-July. "I'm just six scalps away from 100 Test wickets and don't want to miss it," said Rafique, who also has grabbed 125 ODI wickets from as many one-dayers. bd
