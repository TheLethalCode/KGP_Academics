<TEXT>
 Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected case of foot and mouth disease has been found on a farm in southern England and the herd in question is to be culled, a government source said on Wednesday. The return of the disease has raised fears of a repeat of a foot and mouth crisis in 2001 that devastated farming and cost Britain about 8.5 billion pounds ($17 billion). Here is a chronology of key events since the disease was found last month: Aug. 3, 2007 - Britain's agriculture department confirms finding the virus of foot and mouth disease in cattle on a farm near Guildford in Surrey, close to London. Aug. 4 - The United States, Ireland and Japan ban British meat imports. Britain tries to contain the outbreak by culling cattle at the farm. Aug. 5 - A research laboratory about 5 miles (8 km) from where a herd of cattle was infected is sealed off. Aug. 6 - The European Union, South Korea and Russia ban British livestock, meat and dairy exports. Aug. 7 - Veterinarians confirm a second case of the disease within a 6-mile (10-km) protection zone set up around the farm where the disease first broke out. -- In a short preliminary report, government investigators find a "strong probability" that the strain of virus behind the outbreak came from two research labs near the site of the infection. It also says there was also a possibility that the release of the virus involved "human movement". The laboratories reject the report's suggestions the next day. Aug. 8 - Britain says a third suspected case of foot and mouth has been found within the protection zone in southern England and orders culling of animals on the farm. Aug. 9 - Britain lifts a ban on the movement of livestock to slaughter outside the protection zone. Aug. 18 - Britain eases restrictions further on livestock movements after initial tests for foot and mouth disease at a farm in Kent, southern England, and a theme park in Surrey prove negative. Sept. 3 - Britain lifts ban on livestock markets allowing animals to be taken to agricultural shows in England and Wales, excluding a surveillance zone in Surrey. Sept 11 - European Union (EU) vets agree to declare Britain free of foot and mouth disease from November 9 and allow all exports of British meat, dairy and live animals from then. Sept. 12 - Officials say a suspected case of foot and mouth disease has been found on a farm in Surrey, around 30 miles (50 km) from the scene of the last outbreak, and say the herd in question is to be culled. A nationwide ban on livestock movement will be imposed if tests are positi
