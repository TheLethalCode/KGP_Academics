 Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed his prime minister, clearing the way for him to appoint a new premier who is likely to become the leading contender to be the next president. Here are some of the figures in the running to replace Mikhail Fradkov as prime minister: Sergei Ivanov, 54. He is a first deputy prime minister and, like his friend Putin, a former KGB spy who hails from Russia's second city of St. Petersburg. Opinion polls put him as the favourite to replace Putin after the March 2008 presidential elections. A Russian newspaper on Wednesday cited a source in Putin's staff as saying he was leading contender to replace Fradkov. He studied languages at university, spent some months living with a family in London and then 20 years in foreign intelligence, and speaks Swedish and English. He is more hawkish than many of his colleagues in the government. As defence minister from March 2001 until earlier this year, he focussed his efforts on beefing up the military in line with Putin's drive to revive Russia's influence. He has spoken out angrily about Washington's plan for a missile defence shield in Europe, and encouraged consumers to boycott goods from Estonia after the Baltic state removed a monument to Soviet soldiers from the centre of its capital. Dmitry Medvedev, 41. Like Ivanov a first deputy prime minister, Medvedev is second favourite in the opinion polls to be Russia's next president. He is also chairman of state-controlled gas giant Gazprom . A soft-spoken lawyer also from Putin's home city of St Petersburg, analysts say Medvedev belongs to the less hawkish camp in the Russian government, favouring less state interference in the economy. He was previously favourite in the polls to replace Putin, but this year has ceded first place to Ivanov, who has enjoyed more public exposure and is often seen shoulder-to-shoulder with the president. Sergei Naryshkin. Naryshkin, a 52-year-old deputy prime minister, worked with Putin in the St Petersburg city government in the 1990s. He was also born in the city and studied at a university there to be a radio engineer. Seen as an influential technocrat, his career has been spent almost entirely working behind the scenes. Analysts say Putin could endorse him for the presidency if he decided he wanted a low-key figure in the Kremlin top job who could be relied on not to rock the boat. Naryshkin speaks English and French. Before the collapse of Communism, he worked as trade attache in the Soviet embassy in Belgium. Anyone taking a foreign posting at the time was carefully vetted for their political reliability. There are a number of lower-profile figures who could be picked for the prime minister's job. They include: Vladimir Yakunin, powerful head of Russia's state-owned railways. He is a major backer of the Russian Orthodox church, and has called for a revival of traditional moral values. Boris Gryzlov, the speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament and leader of United Russia, a pro-Putin party that has a majority in the Duma. Sergei Morozov, speaker of the upper house of parliament. He is also a Putin loyalist, and heads a new left of centre party called Fair Russia. Sergei Chemezov, head of Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport, he is a close Putin associa
