<TITLE> Russia's Ivanov tipped for PM job-newspaper </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sergei Ivanov, the pollsters' favourite to be Russia's next president, could be promoted to the post of prime minister in the very near future, a Russian newspaper reported on Wednesday. The report comes after weeks of speculation that Ivanov is being groomed to replace President Vladimir Putin, and rumours fuelled by regular public appearances where the two men have been seen side by side. Vedomosti, a respected business daily, said in a front-page report the question of Ivanov's promotion to the premiership is "practically decided." It quoted a source in the presidential administration as saying Ivanov's position was getting stronger and many inside the government and presidential administration were expecting him to get the job. Putin, limited by the constitution to two consecutive terms, says he will step down next year. Whoever the popular Putin endorses to replace him is almost assured victory in the March 2008 presidential election. Ivanov, like Putin a former KGB spy from St Petersburg, is one of two first deputy prime ministers. He has repeatedly denied having any presidential ambitions. Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov has long been the subject of rumours he could step aside to make way for a younger figure. Asked on Tuesday about a possible government reshuffle, Kremlin aide Arkady Dvorkovich, speaking at a Reuters investment summit in Moscow, said he did not know of any planned changes. But he added: "At any moment any changes can happen ... Of course you cannot rule anything out." bd
