 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh dropped the tsunami alert in an early morning bulletin Thursday. The alert was withdrawn at 1:20am, Samarendra Karmaker, director of the Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com by phone. His office had issued a warning Wednesday that a possible tsunami may risk coastal areas of Bangladesh after Wednesday midnight as an earthquake measuring 8.2 struck Indonesia's Sumatra region. In a bulletin, the weather office said that 1-2 feet higher than "normal astronomical tide" might occur in coastal districts and their offshore islands and shoals. The office said "no further bulletin will be issued". India and Sri Lanka also lifted the warnings. Golam Kibria, spokesman for the monitoring cell the food and disaster management ministry Wednesday revived to track tsunami risks, told bdnews24.com that people had been moved to safety from risky areas in 17 districts. The ministry had asked deputy commissioners of 17 districts in coastal zones to deal with the situation in the event of tsunami waves. "Nobody is at risk now," he claimed. Authorities Wednesday ordered a shutdown of activities in the country's premier port after the government issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The Chittagong Port Authority asked all ships on the anchorage to remain alert, secretary Syed Farhad Uddin confirmed. Earlier, deputy commissioner of Chittagong Ashraf Shamim told bdnews24.com that steps were being taken to evacuate people from low-lying coastal areas to safer places in Chittagong. Loudspeakers were used in all areas and even from mosques asking people to move to cyclone and other shelters, he said. SM Munirul Islam, district commissioner of Chandpur, said he issued a red alert after a low-magnitude earthquake hit the country's biggest river port. The Sumatra earthquake on the day, measuring 8.2 magnitude, triggered tsunami warnings in the Indian Ocean and sparked sparking panic in coastal areas across southeast Asia. Five launches that started for Dhaka also returned to the dock at Barisal, our correspondent reports. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had issued an Indian Ocean tsunami warning after the huge quake struck at 6:10 p.m. (1110 GMT). It said tsunami may hit Bangladesh's Chittagong region at about 1801 GMT. Sri Lanka, India, Maldives, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia may also face tsunami, it said. About 2- hours after the quake hit, Indonesia's meteorological agency lifted its tsunami warning and said via a telephone text message that there had been no tsunami. But Malaysian authorities reported a tsunami measuring 1-3 metres in height and heading away from the epicentre of the quake. A huge earthquake struck the same area on Dec. 26, 2004, causing a massive tsunami and over 230,000 deaths in countries across the region. Indonesia suffers frequent quakes, lying on an active seismic belt on part of the so-called Pacific "Ring of Fire". Some residents of Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand also felt the quake and some buildings were evacuated. Budi, a police chief in Bengkulu, said on Indonesia's Elshinta radio that he felt a strong quake. "People panicked and tried to save themselves," he said. He added he heard a report that a three-storey building had collapsed. Authorities from Malaysia and Sri Lanka issued independent warnings, as did India for the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and Australia for Christmas and Cocos Islands. bdnews24.com/mrf
