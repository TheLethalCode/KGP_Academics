 Johannesburg, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  A batting blitzkrieg backed up by superb bowling helped Bangladesh whack the West Indies out of the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup with a six-wicket win in the Group A encounter at New Wanderers Stadium Thursday. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful blasted a thunderous 61 off just 27 balls as he and Aftab Ahmed, who batted through the innings to finish with an unbeaten 62, powered the Tigers to 165 for four with 12 balls to go. The outcome confirmed Bangladesh's Super Eight berth and set up an explosive clash with hosts South Africa on September 15 to decide the group winners. Earlier in the day, Zimbabwe stunned World Cup holders Australia with a five-wicket win. Bangladesh also broke the voodoo of having never beaten the Caribbeans in any form of the game with an amazing allround display and have only to beat England. Man-of-the-match Ashraful smashed pacer Fidel Edwards for a six to set the Twenty20 record for the fastest-ever fifty in 20 balls, overtaking Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya who had taken 23 balls. The mercurial batsman tore into the West Indies bowling as he welcomed Daren Powell for three fours in a row and smashed three sixes and seven fours. After the openers left without making an impression, he put on a priceless 109 off just 62 deliveries with Aftab for the third wicket before being caught by Chris Gayle off his Caribbean counterpart Ramnaresh Sarwan. Aftab hammered a 49-ball 62, clobbering eight fours and one six while Alok played a seven-ball five. Pacer Ravi Rampaul shook Bangladesh as he sent dashing openers Nazimuddin (1) and Tamim Iqbal (10) back cheaply to leave the Tigers at 28 for two in four overs. Put in to bat first following a delayed start because of a wet pitch, the West Indies lost key man Chris Gayle, who hit 117 from 57 balls in the defeat by South Africa, for a third-ball duck. The enigmatic Jamaican chose to offer no stroke to the opening two deliveries before cutting Syed Rasel to Kapali at point. Dwayne and Devon Smith clicked timely to propel the West Indies to a fighting total with opener Devon hitting a chancy 51 and Dwayne blazing a hurricane 29 off just seven balls. Devon Smith smashed six fours in 52 balls and Dwayne Smith clubbed four massive sixes and one four. Big-hitting Marlon Samuels hit two sixes and two fours in an over to make a 14-ball 27 while Shivnarine Chanderpaul chipped in with 37 off 31 balls. Smith and Chanderpaul repaired the initial damage to put on 95 runs for the second wicket before Abdur Razzak removed both Chanderpaul (37 off 31 balls) and Smith in the space of nine runs. Left-arm spinner Saqib Al Hasan was the most successful Bangladesh bowler with figures of four for 34 in his four-over quota. Razzak finished with two for 25. Occasional spinner Mohammad Ashraful, who was whacked for one-over 24 -- three consecutive sixes and a four -- by Dwayne Smith, was the most expensive bowler with 55 for one in four overs. Rasel produced an outstanding figure of one for 10 in his four-over spell and was denied by a single of becoming the first player to bowl successive maidens in Twenty20 internationals. bdnew
