 PRISTINA, Serbia, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's call on Serbs in Kosovo to boycott November's parliamentary election amounts to a call for the Albanian-majority province to be partitioned, a prominent Serb political leader said on Thursday. Oliver Ivanovic, a moderate among leaders of the Kosovo Serb minority, said Belgrade was sacrificing the two-thirds of Serbs who live in scattered enclaves in order to keep hold of the northern triangle where the rest of the Serbs dominate. By not voting, he said, approximately 60,000 Serbs living in enclaves watched over by NATO peacekeepers will be deprived of a voice and forced to head north, if the ethnic Albanian majority wins the independence it demands. "The message, 'don't take part in the election', is read in Kosovo as, 'don't even stay in Kosovo'," Ivanovic told Belgrade's Radio B92. "It's a direct call on Serbs south of the Ibar river to pack up and leave." "You are basically getting a signal from Belgrade that Kosovo should be divided," he said. Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said this week that "conditions had not been met" for Serbs to take part in the Nov. 17 poll, which Albanians hope will be their last under United Nations administration. Leaders of Kosovo's 2 million Albanians, whose 1998-99 guerrilla war drew in NATO intervention to halt Serb atrocities, are threatening to declare independence if last-ditch talks led by the West and Russia end in December with no accord. With special reserved seats, Serbs in Kosovo could have up to 20 deputies in the 120-seat Kosovo parliament. But they boycotted the last election in 2004, and continue to take guidance from Belgrade. Ivanovic said this policy left Kosovo Serbs voiceless. "Everyone should realise that if we don't take part in the elections, Serbs will again have no one to turn to," he said. Instead, they would vote with their feet and leave for the relative security of northern Kosovo, or Serbia proper. Serbs form the majority north of the Ibar river that slices through the former mining town of Mitrovica, dividing its Serb and Albanian residents. Serbia denies wanting to split the territory, but in eight years since its forces withdrew it has concentrated on cementing its financial and political control over the north, from which it runs a virtual parallel Serb state in Kosovo. The West began by ruling out partition, but faced with the threat of renewed conflict in the Balkans if Russia continues to block independence on behalf of Serbia, the door to a split is now, tacitly, left open should the two sides agree on it. The risk is that Albanians in Kosovo could revolt and drive out Serbs south of the Ibar, possibly stirring unrest among Albanians in neighbouring Macedonia and southern Serbia t
