 TOKYO, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Friday as beaten-up financial shares followed their US peers higher, but European markets looked set to open lower after Britain's biggest mortgage lender sought financial support from the central bank. UK stocks were called 39-44 points lower and the pound dipped as Northern Rock became the latest casualty of the global credit market squeeze. The UK government authorised the Bank of England to give emergency help to the mortgage lender to reduce its reliance on strained money markets for funds. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were seen opening as much as 40 points lower. The dollar held near a 15-year low against a basket of major currencies on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week to spur the flagging economy, while oil prices retreated from a fresh record high of over $80 a barrel. Investors were cautious ahead of US August retail sales data, due at 1230 GMT, which may fuel the argument that the struggling housing sector is weighing on the overall economy and ignite further debate over how deeply the Fed should cut borrowing costs to avoid a feared recession. US retail sales were expected to have risen 0.4 percent in August, following a 0.3 percent gain in July, which would show household spending holding up at a decent pact. But some analysts were pessimistic that a strong figure would brighten the outlook for the US economy. "A good figure is not enough to change the picture. There will be more adjustments in the housing market and that may affect consumption in coming months," said Masafumi Yamamoto, a currency economist at Nikko Citigroup in Tokyo. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan climbed 1.3 percent by 0602 GMT, extending Thursday's 0.5 percent gain, while Tokyo's Nikkei average ended the day nearly 2 percent higher. The MSCI index looked set to close higher for a fourth straight week and has risen more than 20 percent from a five-month trough plumbed on Aug. 17. It is now just 4 percent below its July 24 life-time high. MSCI's index of financial shares in the Asia Pacific region gained nearly 2 percent after a Wall Street analysts said brokerage shares were undervalued after the recent sell-off. News that Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest US mortgage lender, had lined up $12 billion of financing to help weather the housing slowdown also helped ease credit worries. Asia financials followed their US peers higher, with Nomura Holdings putting on 1.5 percent and Daiwa Securities Group rising 2.4 percent. Investors also pushed up shares of Macquarie Bank more than 6 percent after the top Australian investment bank said it expected record first-half profit and had only modest credit exposure to hedge fund industry. Financial stocks were badly hit during the market sell-off between late July to mid-August sparked by fears of a global credit shortage stemming from the US subprime-mortgage crisis. Stock markets rose across the board, but many investors avoided buying too aggressively before the Fed meeting on Tuesday. Australia's S&P/ASX index climbed 1.2 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.5 percent. Taiwan's main TAIEX share index edged up 1.2 percent. Also in favour were Japanese exporters such as Canon Inc and Tokyo Motor, which extended gains as the yen pulled further away from a three-week high touched earlier in the week. After setting a record high of $80.20 overnight, US crude took a breather, slipping 43 cents to $79.66 by 0600 GMT as a hurricane subsided in the Gulf of Mexico. Spot gold extended its pullback to $705 an ounce, from a 16-month peak set on Tuesday. DOLLAR SOFT The yen struggled to gain traction after losing ground overnight, hurt by economic and political uncertainty in Japan following the shock resignation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier in the week. The euro traded at $1.3875 near a record high $1.3930 hit on Thursday, while the dollar's trade-weighted index against six major currencies was at 79.610, not far from the 15-year low of 79.302 hit the previous day. The US currency stayed on the back foot ahead of the sales data later in the day. Despite weakness against other currencies, the dollar traded at 115.00 yen was well above 112.60 yen hit on Monday. The euro fetched 159.60 yen after hitting a one-month peak near 160.50 yen on Thursday, and was also well off the week's low at about 155.15 yen. Strength in stocks dampened demand for safe-have government bonds, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds up as much as 5.5 basis points to 1.580 percent.
