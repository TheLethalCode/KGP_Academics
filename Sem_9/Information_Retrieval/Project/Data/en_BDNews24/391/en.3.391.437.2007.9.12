 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com) -- A drive to free health-directorate land in Mohakhali from squatters in the so-called "seven-storey slum" area left about 1,000 families homeless Tuesday. The drive, led by magistrate Md Nazrul Islam Khan, took off at 10.30am and ended Tuesday evening. Asked why the eviction started before arranging rehabilitation of the slum residents despite the government deciding in principle that rehabilitation would be ensured before eviction, the magistrate said: "That's not our job. The government will look into the issue of rehabilitation." A total of 160 policemen, including Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque, participated in the drive, accompanied by assistant police commissioner Shihab Kaiser for Gulshan zone. Police earlier on Sunday and Monday used loudspeakers urging the slum's residents to leave the land owned by the Directorate General of Health Services. The slum peoplemade homelessgathered their belongings in a nearby place and took shelter under open skies. The slum residents and lawyers said the eviction was not legal as there is a High Court stay order on slum evictions. Human-rights activist and former adviser of the caretaker government Sultana Kamal along with three slum residentsAbdul Khaleque, Tamijuddin Master and Mosammat Angkurrunnesafiled a case in 2003, prompting the court to issue the stay order on all slum evictions in the city, including the "seven-storey slum". Rights organisation "Ain O Salish Kendro" has been continuing a legal battle against the eviction of slums since 2003. A lawyer of the organisation, advocate Abu Obaidur Rahman Tagar, told bdnews24.com: "As per the High Court order on April 19, 2003, the slum cannot be evicted until the disposal of that case." Obaidur Rahman said they would take the next steps after discussions with the evicted residents. Abdul Khaleque, one of the plaintiffs on whose case the High Court issued the stay order, told bdnews24.com: "The eviction defying the stay order is contempt of court. But nothing can be done against it now as there is a state of emergency." However, he added, they would continue the legal battle in this regard. The local people claimed that there were about 5,000 families living in the seven-storey slum area, but according to magistrate Md Nazrul Islam Khan there were 700 to 800 families. He said a facility called "National Institute of Health Management" would be constructed on the land after eviction. The Saudi Arabian government will provide a Tk 200 crore grant for the project, he added. The dwellers of the slum alleged the local public works office and some officials and employees of the health directorate announced the eviction drive only 12 hours before the eviction. It created confusion among the slum dwellers, they said. Slum resident Suravi Akhter Hena said: "Where will we take our belonging in such a short time and where will we stay?" Another dweller, Monwara, said her husband Abdul Baten Mollah is suffering from diabetes and is bed-ridden. She alleged they were not given enough time to remove their belongings. "We begged for time but the bulldozer smashed everything." Another slum dweller, Sufia Begum, said: "Though our houses have been destroyed the house of public works employee Abu Taher remains intact. Why this double standard?" Asked why part of the slum and the large tin-roofed house of Abu Taher was not dismantled, magistrate Nazrul Islam Khan said: "The employees of the health ministry live in that part of the slum. The land belongs to the health ministry. Besides, the eviction drive was conducted following the boundary fixed by the works ministry and the health directorate." On the stay order, Khan said: "I don't know anything about the case. Neither any slum dweller nor any human rights organisation informed me in writing about it. The drive was conducted as per the health directorate order." On whether permission was taken from the national advisory council committee on law and order, he said: "The members of the committee including the committee chairman [law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein] know about the matter." Khan said: "An initiative to evict the slum was taken on August 14. But after completion of all preparations, it was suspended due to floods and unavailability of police." bdnews24.com/ans/
