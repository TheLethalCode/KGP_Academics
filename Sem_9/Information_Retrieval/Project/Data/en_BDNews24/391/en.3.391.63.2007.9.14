 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Despair has hit the police, especially at the lower rungs, after recommendations for a pay hike and increased rations for all ranks did not get approved, a top police official said Thursday. "We have been attempting to raise morale of the police through various activities lately undertaken in the name of 'police reforms'. "But I'm afraid motivation alone may not be enough to sustain the changing attitude of our police force," said Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura, additional inspector general of police to bdnews24.com. Officials at the police headquarters said in July they had proposed that all policemen get a 'risk allowance' equalling 25 percent of basic pay. The proposal also recommended increasing family ration allowances by 80 to 100 percent, depending on the rank. For traffic police, a traffic allowance amounting to 60 percent of basic pay was also recommended in addition to the risk allowance. The home ministry figured out that an additional Tk 128.22 crore would be needed to implement the proposed increases for 80,000 constables and 43,000 police officers. The ministry sent the proposal to the finance ministry for approval. A joint secretary with the finance ministry preferring requesting anonymity told bdnews24.com, "Of the proposals forwarded to us, only two have so far been earmarked for partial implementation." "The risk allowance increase was not approved, but the traffic policemen will have a hiked allowance. Also, police officers will be paid expenses incurred during their case investigations." The decisions would be made public soon, he said. bdnews24.com tried to reach the finance secretary for comment, but he was not available. "From the police headquarters, a number of recommendations were sent, including the one which proposed investigating officers paid Tk 1,000 to 10,000, depending on the particular case he/she would be handling for meeting their investigation expenses," Tripura, the AIG said. "Police officers have so far been bearing the cost from their own pocket." Asked they would do now that the finance ministry has snubbed most of the recommendations, Tripura said, "We are trying to convince the government policymakers. Let's see what happens." Tripura is the incumbent project director of the police reform programme being implemented with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme. A police sergeant posted at the Bangla Motors intersection told bdnews24.com, "We try our best to keep the traffic moving smoothly under the blazing sun and torrential rains. "We often let the VIPs pass ignoring the automated traffic signals, but will they ever understand our pains or the efforts we put in?" A constable from Rajarbagh police lines said, "We try to protect other's lives and property and ensure peace, but can hardly manage to protect our own with whatever peanuts we get in exchange, you see. "Unfortunately, most people think of us only as 'grabbers', not really caring to know what we are deprived of." A detective branch inspector of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said, "We have been disheartened to hear that our payrise proposals have got stuck at the finance ministry. "We hope the government will finally decide positively about increasing our pay and allowances." bdnews24.c
