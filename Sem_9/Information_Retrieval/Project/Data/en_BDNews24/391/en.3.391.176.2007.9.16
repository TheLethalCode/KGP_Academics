<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will hear an appeal Monday that challenges the government's proposed adoption of the Policy Support Instrument agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Supreme Court lawyer Mesbahul Islam filed the public interest litigation with Justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Md Abu Tarique. The petitioner urges the HC to direct the government to cease negotiations with the IMF over the probable PSI agreement, under which Bangladesh would be subject to policy advice without any financial assistance. Abdul Wadud Khandaker, counsel for the petitioner, told bdnews24.com that the previous BNP administration had rejected IMF pressure to adopt the proposal by the donor agency and World Bank. "However, the caretaker government has now partially accepted the IMF-World Bank prescription. It has increased the prices of fuel, which has resulted in a price hike in all essential commodities. "This has badly affected industrial production. The government has withdrawn fertiliser subsidies at the IMF's insistence. This is suicidal as agriculture is the backbone of our country. "The government is currently negotiating the PSI agreement with the IMF. This prescription has been widely criticised by economists in the country. Even the economic adviser to the caretaker government criticised it on Sept 14," Khandaker said. The writ appeal also challenges a move to engage a private company to manage the container terminal at New Mooring in Chittagong port. "At the IMF's insistence the government is going to hand over the handling of the container terminal at New Mooring in Chittagong Port to a private company. The tender's conditions mean no Bangladeshi citizen will be able to participate in the tender," he said. Khandaker added that the IMF had also proposed an "unnecessary" $500 crore reserve fund for the country. The writ appeal states that the caretaker government cannot make the policy decision because the constitution bars the caretaker administration from making any policy decisions. In line with the constitution, the caretaker government can only take decisions required for day-to-day administrative work. bd
