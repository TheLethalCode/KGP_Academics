<TEXT>
 Dhaka, September 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting Awami League general secretary Mukul Bose Thursday termed Wednesday's incident of getting mobbed by party men a 'simple outburst of emotion'. "The occurrence was part of a conspiracy to have the Awami League office shut down. The Awami League stands united. It was a ploy to destroy our unity," he told newsmen at the home of AL leader Abu Sayeed. So-called reformist leaders including Mukul Bose, Abu Sayeed and Abdul Mannan faced the anger of party activists and supporters when they went to the Dhanmondi office for the working committee meeting Wednesday. The workers and supporters who gathered at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi hurled abuses at the reformist leaders and chased them. They also chanted slogans describing them as "collaborators". Abu Sayeed thanked the private satellite channels for airing the news incident. "You aired the news objectively and impartially," he said. Mukul Bose said: "We unanimously adopted a resolution at the working committee meeting demanding the release of Sheikh Hasina and all other arrested party leaders and activists." "Despite all, the sad and unwarranted incident took place. Personally, I had been an activist of the Chhatra League for long and have continued with Awami League till date, but somehow I failed to recognise the villains who sparked off the incident Wednesday." The reformist leader said: "Our president said she will endorse all the decisions of the working committee. She has urged all to remain united. That's why we remained united." He said a proper inquiry into Wednesday's incidents would be conducted and disciplinary measures would be taken against the offenders. "I have talked to the party acting president. He told me that he would take steps against those involved in the incident." Abu Sayeed said Wednesday's incident was against the expectations of the 1/11. "It is the demand of the time to strengthen the Awami League. Those who staged the occurrence want to weaken the party," he said. "Hooliganism, crime and power-grabbing will not do us good. Our policy is the same old idealistic one and it will not be defeated. We will surely win," he said. "Some people are conspiring to split the party, and they will do anything to hinder its progress," Sayeed said. bdnews24.com/su
