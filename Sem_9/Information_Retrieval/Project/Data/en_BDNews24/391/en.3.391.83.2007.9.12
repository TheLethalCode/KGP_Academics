 Dhaka, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday said it was not right time to go for 'contractionary' monetary policy that crimps money supply. "As far as I know, Bangladesh Bank has not pursued a contractionary monetary policy over the last two months following a squeeze in private-sector credit growth," he said. Azizul talked to reporters at the planning ministry after a meeting with a visiting IMF team led by Thomas R Rumbaugh, IMF adviser for Asia and Pacific Department. He said the IMF also agreed. The central bank has been seeking to reduce the size of the money supply since January 2006 to rein in the soaring private-sector credit growth and counter inflationary pressure. Economists and businessmen have been saying that the monetary policy did not work. It did work, they said on an ambivalent note, all too well to reduce private-sector credit growth, but not inflation. "A drop in private-sector credit growth was not for monetary policy stance as the Bangladesh Bank has not increased the lending rate, a fundamental of the contractionary policy," Azizul said. He blamed a demand-side slag for the credit squeeze at 15 percent at the end of fiscal 2006-07 from over 18 percent in the previous year. Inflation on a point-to-point basis reached 10.1 percent in July from 9.2 percent in June and 8.5 percent in May this year. Food inflation has crossed 12 percent in July from 9.8 percent a month ago. Azizul blamed the inflation on a relentless rise in the prices of essentials, including rice, wheat and edible oil on the international market. "That's why the inflationary pressure has not been contained despite the monetary policy stance," the adviser said. "This is a cost-pushed inflation." He said it was tough to control prices when an economy, like Bangladesh, depends on imports. "Our target is to contain inflation by increasing the supply side constraints," he said, adding that the government was trying to boost imports and get BDR and small importers into the trade. On the loss of confidence of businesses, the adviser said the fear that looms large over them would go by two months. "I see no valid ground for their apprehension," he said. On the IMF concern over the poor revenue growth and, the adviser said it was too early to make such assessment as only two months have gone in the current fiscal year. He said he had assured the IMF that the projected budget deficit (5.3 percent of GDP) would no way exceed. On the policy support instrument the IMF is pushing the government to sign, he renewed the pledge that he would not sign any deal contrary to the country's interest. bd
