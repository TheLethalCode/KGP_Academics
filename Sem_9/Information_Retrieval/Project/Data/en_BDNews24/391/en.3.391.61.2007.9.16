<TEXT>
 ISTANBUL, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A controversial decision on whether Turkey's new constitution will allow headscarves in universities will be left to the prime minister as a commission drafting the charter failed to reach agreement, media reported. Secularists, including the powerful army, see the use of the headscarf at universities as a threat to the secular order.

The wife of President Abdullah Gul -- whose candidacy was opposed by the secularists -- took Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights over the ban, while his daughter prompted controversy by wearing a headscarf at her graduation ceremony.

The party has says the draft will go to parliament early next year. Plans to rewrite the constitution were part of the AK Party's manifesto for the July 22 parliamentary election, which it won with 47 percent of the vote.
