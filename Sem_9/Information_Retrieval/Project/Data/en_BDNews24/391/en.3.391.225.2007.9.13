 BAGHDAD, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Sunni Arab tribal leader instrumental in driving al Qaeda out of Iraq's Anbar province was killed by a bomb attack on Thursday, less than two weeks after he met US President George W. Bush in the desert region. Abdul Sattar Abu Risha was killed near his home in Ramadi, capital of Anbar. He was the most important leader of an alliance of Sunni Arab tribes that joined forces with US troops to push al Qaeda from much of the western region. National security adviser Mowaffaq al-Rubaie condemned the attack and blamed al Qaeda. Two bodyguards and Abu Risha's private secretary were also killed in the attack on the day Iraq's Sunni Muslims marked the start of the holy fasting month of Ramadan. "The sheikh's car was totally destroyed by the explosion. Abu Risha was killed," Ramadi police officer Ahmed Mahmoud al-Alwani told Reuters. Bush met Abu Risha and other tribal leaders during a highly symbolic trip to Anbar on Sept. 3, where the American leader declared that improved security in the vast desert province was an example of what could happen elsewhere in Iraq. The president is expected, in a televised address later on Thursday, to endorse plans for limited cuts in US troop levels in Iraq. He will likely refer to better security in Anbar to support his argument, but offer little else to Americans looking for a change of course in the unpopular conflict. Police sources said Abu Risha was killed by a roadside bomb that targeted his armour-plated car. But one bodyguard who was not with Abu Risha at the time said a bomb had been planted in his car, a theory police said they could not discount. "This operation may have happened because of treachery by one of his bodyguards," Colonel Tareq al-Dulaimi, a senior police officer in Ramadi, told Iraqiya state television. Residents said a state of emergency had been declared in Ramadi. They said American and Iraqi troops had poured into the streets in a heavy show of force. "We believe Abu Risha was one of the most important security personnel in Iraq," said Brigadier-General Abdul-Kareem Khalaf, spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Baghdad. "The minister of interior has made an order that a statue be erected where he was killed or in any other place that the people of Anbar select." SUCCESS STORY Abu Risha, who was believed to be in his early 40s, set up an alliance of tribal sheikhs in Anbar last year to fight Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, an effort which has been held up by US leaders as one of the biggest success stories in improving security after more than four years of conflict. Bush's trip last week to Anbar would have been unthinkable just months ago when it was the most dangerous province in Iraq for US troops and the heart of the Sunni Arab insurgency. "It was once written off as lost. It is now one of the safest places in Iraq," Bush had said. In Washington, Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell on Thursday called Abu Risha "a brave warrior". "It's certainly our hope and our belief that he has spawned a movement that will outlive him," Morrell said. Al Qaeda once controlled large swathes of Anbar but the network angered local tribal leaders with its indiscriminate killing of civilians and harsh interpretation of Islam. Abu Risha was instrumental in getting young men to start joining local police forces, a development that has sharply reduced levels of violence and forced many al Qaeda fighters to flee to other provinces. It was one of the first examples of the US military working with tribal leaders in Iraq to develop local police to secure their own communities. The US military commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, highlighted the "particularly dramatic" security gains in Anbar during testimony to Congress in Washington this week. After meeting Bush last week, Abu Risha told an Iraqi television station: "We told President Bush that we are Iraqis and that we do not believe in sectarianism at all. We want to be united and build Iraq together." Despite the better security in Anbar, the tribal alliance had shown signs of splintering over dissatisfaction with Abu Risha's leadership and infighting between tribal leaders.
