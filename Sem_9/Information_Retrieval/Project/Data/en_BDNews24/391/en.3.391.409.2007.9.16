 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur has lodged a "strong" protest with the Malaysian government against a company, which allegedly cheated Bangladeshi overseas workers. The commission urged the Malaysian government to take "stern" action against the Malaysian company Asia Pacific. A team, headed by expatriate welfare and overseas employment secretary Abdul Matin, will visit Malaysia in a day or two to probe the recent incidents of labour unrest among Bangladeshi workers. The delegation is expected to submit a report to the government to find a solution to the problem. "The high commission has already lodged a strong protest to urge the Malaysian government to take action against company Asia Pacific for cheating Bangladeshi workers," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, foreign and expatriate welfare adviser, told reporters at his foreign ministry office Sunday. The adviser said he was in constant touch with the high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur and has instructed him to take necessary measures to resolve the labour unrest. He also said the striking workers had been ejected from the Bangladesh High Commission premises in Kuala Lumpur. Earlier on Sunday, adviser Iftekhar Chowdhury had chaired an emergency meeting on labour unrest. "We will take steps as per the recommendation of the inter-ministerial team which will visit Malaysia in day or two. If any Bangladeshi agent is found guilty of cheating workers, actions will be taken against them," said Iftekhar after the meeting. He said bringing the workers back to Bangladesh was not a problem, rather finding a sustainable solution to their plight should be the answer. In recent days, Bangladeshi workers had staged a hunger strike in front of the Bangladesh mission in Kuala Lumpur protesting at what they alleged was an underhand dealing by Asia Pacific, a Malaysian employment agency. Their demands included payment of six months' overdue salaries and permanent working opportunities in KL. The workers alleged that the high commission had not taken any initiative to resolve the crisis, an allegation vehemently denied by the high commission. However, the Bangladesh mission claimed Thursday that a number of Bangladeshi workers were hampering a solution to the crisis. The Bangladesh High Commission, in a statement Thursday, said some workers were too obstinate in their demands for a refund of the money they had paid to travel agents in Bangladesh. Some of these workers were deported back to Bangladesh, with the help of the Malaysian government, according to the overseas employment ministry said bdne
