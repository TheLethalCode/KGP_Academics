 MOSCOW, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's parliament overwhelmingly confirmed Viktor Zubkov as prime minister on Friday, two days after President Vladimir Putin surprised observers by nominating the virtually-unknown official. Lawmakers in the 450-seat State Duma voted by 381 to 47 to confirm Zubkov, an old Putin acquaintance who the president plucked from obscurity as head of a money laundering watchdog to replace sacked prime minister Mikhail Fradkov.
