 ISLAMABAD, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 10 Pakistani soldiers were killed on Thursday in a powerful blast in an army building in a town near the capital Islamabad, the military said, the second major incident involving the army this month. The blast occurred in a building used by the army's elite Special Services Group (SSG) in the town of Tarbela Ghazi. President Pervez Musharraf, who is also army chief, has also served in the SSG. "So far, we have reports that 10 soldiers have been martyred and several wounded," military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said. A senior government official said the death toll could rise because several soldiers were critically wounded. Arshad said it was being ascertained that whether the blast was caused by a gas cylinder or it was a bomb. Earlier this month, 25 people, most of them staff members of an intelligence agency of the army, were killed in twin suicide attacks in Rawalpindi garrison town, adjoining Islamabad. Officials said evidence pointed to the involvement of al Qaeda-linked militants who are battling security forces in the tribal region near the Afghan border in those attacks.
