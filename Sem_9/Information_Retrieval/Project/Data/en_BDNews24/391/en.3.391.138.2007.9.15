<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has initiated a move to introduce online tax payment facility from the next financial year, the top tax official said Friday. Corrected "Similar to water and gas bill payment system, the NBR is thinking of introducing the automation system by which taxpayers can pay without having to visit the tax office," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told bdnews24.com recently. "The harassment involved in tax payment will be greatly reduced," he said. "It may not be possible to introduce such an automated system within the current year, but we can start it from the next fiscal year," he added. The NBR chairman admitted to harassment of taxpayers by tax officials and hoped that the online system, when introduced, would significantly cut back on such problems. "If allegations of harassment to taxpayers are proved, the board will take legal action against the guilty officials," Rahman pledged. The NBR has suspended 25 tax officials in September on charges of harassing taxpayers, according to NBR officials. The board is on way to take legal actions against officials found to have harassed taxpayers, the Rahman said. "Those tax officials who perform better will be rewarded," he added. The allegation of tax officials harassing taxpayers have resurfaced in recent months. Businessmen at a recent meeting with the chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, army chief General Moeen U Ahmed and the NBR chairman Badiur Rahman alleged that they regularly faced various forms of harassment by tax officials. NBR officials told bdnews24.com promotion of some tax officials had been held up after allegations of harassing taxpayers were registered against them with the board. Some officials, serving in Dhaka and Chittagong, have however been promoted on better performance. bdnews24.c
