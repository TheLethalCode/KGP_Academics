<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  An important meeting of reformist leaders of the BNP faction led by Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday severely criticised the party central leadership, including its chairperson Khaleda Zia. Leaders from the BNP's reformist faction held the meeting to hammer out a policy that would hold the troubled party together. Bhuiyan, the recently ousted secretary general of the party, chaired the meeting at the Elegant Community Centre in Gulshan. Bhuiyan said: "We are the mainstream BNP. The leaders and workers of the party are united except for some corrupt individuals who have amassed illegal money. We will form the next government after reforming the party." The meeting was attended by 120 leaders. Former lawmaker Nazir Hossain announced that 187 MPs from the last administration are now with the reformist section of the party, although 34 of them are currently in jail. A rift in the party deepened when Khaleda Zia expelled Bhuiyan from the party prior to her detention on September 3. Khandaker Delwar Hossain was appointed in his place. Nazir said: "Only three former MPs, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, ABM Ashrafuddin Nizam and Sohrab Hossain are not with us. Only a few former lawmakers remain neutral." Party vice president Hafizuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com:"The process used to appoint Khandaker Delwar as secretary general is illegal. Khaleda Zia remains our leader." The BNP's office secretary Mofiqul Hasan Tripti had earlier told bdnews24.com: "We are holding this meeting after receiving written permission from the police commissioner. All members of the party's executive committee are attending." Former lawmaker Zahiruddin Swapan said: "Corrupt practices done in the name of the party are no longer acceptable. The party has to change." Former lawmaker SS Sultan Titu added: "Everyone knew that Khaleda Zia would have to go to jail. There are many questions centring on her." "However, before going to jail she expelled an honest secretary general which is not acceptable. There is no question over the honesty and patriotism of Mannan Bhuiyan," he said. More than 100 workers from pro-reform elements in the Chhatra Dal, Jubo Dal and city unit of the BNP congregated outside the community centre in the afternoon. bdnews24
