<TITLE> Profit warning evaporated $2 billion off Alcatel Lucent </TITLE>

 Martyn Warwick LONDON, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com) - This morning more than 1.5 billion euros has been wiped off the value of Alcatel Lucent as the company announced feeble sales have forced a further heavily downward revision in its revenue forecasts for financial 2007. This is the company's second profit warning so far this year. It might not be the last. Translated in greenbacks, that 1.5 billion euros equates to more than $2 billion as the dollar continues its slide against the European currency. As I write this Alcatel Lucent shares are down by 12.5 per cent on their value as at the close of the markets last night after the embattled organisation admitted that poor sales, well below earlier forecasts, will result in "a failure to post a profit in the third quarter". Alcatel Lucent whose merger was billed as "a marriage of equals" and the greatest thing since sliced bread has so far failed miserably to live up either to its own hype or market expectations. This time around the company's excuse for poor performance is "a change in capital spending" by US wireless operators. This is believed to be a veiled reference to declining demand for CDMA equipment occasioned, in part at least, by the ongoing litigation against US manufacturer Qualcomm and the consequent import ban on some handset models. Alcatel Lucent (or just Lucent as it was before what has been trumpeted as the greatest merger of the 21st Century to date) has long been heavily (some would say overly) reliant on the sales of CDMA equipment. Whatever the underlying reason for the continuing decline, the company line is that it is "not seeing the projected volume changes that would have mitigated the ongoing pricing pressures it is experiencing". In other words, it's not selling enough and prices are falling, hitting profit margins The latest profit warning is stark evidence that the merger of two vastly different corporate cultures is still incomplete and that the union has failed to gel. Indeed, Per Lindberg, an analyst at Dresdner Bank puts the matter in a nutshell when he says, "This is a merger of shared dilemmas." The fact is that the two companies were forced into a merger when they realised they could not compete in a cut-throat global market on their own. However, the amalgamated company isn't producing what's needed whilst rivals such as Ericsson continue to take bites out of its market share and drive down prices thus giving another twist to the seemingly remorseless downward spiral Alcatel Lucent seems to be trapped in. Alcatel Lucent started the year on a bum note when it warned that the costs associated with the merger would impact adversely on annual results and announced a massive (and massively expensive) cost cutting programme. Now it has lowered its full-year sales growth target. Today's events will ratchet up the pressure on CEO Patricia Russo who has been under fire by investors, analysts and the media for failing to meet targets and overseeing a marked decline in the company's performance. Unless she can get this unwieldy behemoth back on course quickly, calls for her resignation are bound to increase.
