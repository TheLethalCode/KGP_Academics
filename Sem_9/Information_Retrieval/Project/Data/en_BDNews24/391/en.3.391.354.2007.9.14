 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  A group of Dhaka University teachers Thursday demanded freedom for two detained colleagues and expressed concern over the charging of two others, in a meeting with senior army officers. DU syndicate member Prof Sadeka Halim told bdnews24.com that the teachers had also sought all cooperation in reopening the university. The university, which was closed in the wake of the August rioting, is set to reopen on Oct 28. "We said we are not comfortable with the present situation," Prof Sadeka said. Another teacher, asking not to be named, said that five deans of the university had decided to meet with army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, but later they sat with chief of general staff Major General Sina Ibn Jamali and other senior officers. Prof Sadeka said the army officers had assured the DU teachers of all cooperation in reopening the university, but asserted that nobody is above the law. The discussion focussed on the charges against four teachers. The meeting coincided with a court order to arrest DU teachers Sadrul Amin and Nimchandra Bhowmik in connection with violent student protests at DU. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka also issued arrest warrants against 13 students of the same university. Sadrul Amin is the president of the Dhaka University Teachers Association and Nimchandra Bhowmik is the provost of Jagannath Hall. The 13 cases filed in connection with the August violence at DU and other educational institutions saw 36 people, including the four DU teachers, accused of having roles in it. Police have already arrested 12 of the listed accused persons, including DU teachers Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid. Prof Sadeka said: "At the meeting, we talked not only about Dhaka University teachers, but Rajshahi University teachers as well. Teachers are a community." The DU teachers spelled out concern over the posting of a report on the DU violence and related pictures on the Bangladesh Army website. bdnews24.com/ehb-ahd/mhs/jf/ad/0059 hours >>
