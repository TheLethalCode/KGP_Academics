 ATHENS, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greeks go to the polls on Sunday in the aftermath of deadly forest fires to vote in a closely fought election seen as critical for reforms needed in the euro zone's second-poorest member. The heirs to Greece's two top political families again vie for Greece's top post, pledging to create jobs, improve standards of living and shore up an ailing pension system. Conservative Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, nephew of the late statesman Constantine, scored a landslide victory in 2004 against socialist PASOK party leader George Papandreou, son of the late charismatic prime minister Andreas. But the gap between the two parties has been narrowing due to financial scandals and forest fires that killed 65 people last month, turning voters to smaller parties. "After the fires I decided to vote for an environmental party. I don't want to vote for one of the big ones who have made a mess of the economy and the environment," said Athens housewife Sofia Ofsanian, 46. Opinion polls published before a Sept. 1 blackout showed New Democracy leading PASOK by 1-2 percentage points with neither gathering enough votes to form a government. This could force parties to seek coalitions and, if none succeed, a new election would be held. Papandreou has not ruled out cooperating with other parties but Karamanlis has made clear Greece was headed for repeat elections if he did not win a strong mandate. The far-right LA.O.S. party is expected to enter parliament for the first time and could end up a powerbroker. The pressure on the loser to resign will be strong, especially on Papandreou, if he suffers a second defeat. "PASOK has shown it can move Greece forward. In the past four years we have seen Greece go backwards, ruled by an inefficient and socially unjust government," Papandreou, 55, told Reuters in a recent interview. Karamanlis prides himself on creating 200,000 jobs since coming to power but unemployment remains above the EU average despite a healthy 4.4 percent GDP growth rate this year. "From Sept. 17 we will continue on the path of reforms with fast, bold steps," Karamanlis said on Friday. "We will continue the changes towards our common goals -- a strong economy, dynamic growth, an efficient and responsible state and social cohesion." About 20 percent of Greeks live below the poverty line and per capita GDP is the lowest next to Portugal's in the euro zone. Brussels says more structural reforms are needed to make Greece competitive
