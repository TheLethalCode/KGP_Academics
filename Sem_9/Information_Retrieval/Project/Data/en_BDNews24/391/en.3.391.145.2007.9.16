<TITLE> Disillusioned Greeks vote in cliffhanger poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ATHENS, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greeks voted on Sunday in an election seen as crucial for economic reforms needed in the euro zone's second-poorest member. The poll could reflect public discontent with the big parties and transform smaller ones into powerbrokers -- including possibly the far-right LA.O.S. party that is expected to enter parliament for the first time. Conservative Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called the early vote, confident that his economic record would secure an easy win. But a slow response to summer forest fires that killed 65 people and a series of scandals have hurt his chances. The election pits Karamanlis against socialist leader Andreas Papandreou, both heirs to prominent political dynasties, but opinion polls suggest neither may win an outright majority with voters defecting to smaller parties. Polls opened nationwide at 7 am (0400 GMT) with over 9 million registered voters. "People here are generally split between the two main parties but many here will vote for smaller parties because they are disappointed," said Dionysis Mitrogiannis, 52, a civil servant, on his way to a polling station near the western town of Arta. Opinion polls published before a Sept. 1 blackout showed the conservative New Democracy party leading the socialist PASOK by 1 to 2 percentage points and neither had enough votes to form a government. More than 10 percent were undecided. Karamanlis, nephew of the late statesman Constantine, scored a landslide victory in 2004 against Papandreou, son of the late Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. Karamanlis has said he would rather call a new election than form an uneasy coalition while Papandreou has not ruled out cooperating with smaller parties. "To move forward ... this country needs a government which can take swift and bold decisions on changes and reforms," said Karamanlis in a speech on Friday. If Sunday's vote is undecided and attempts for a coalition fail, Greece faces new elections. That could delay reforms, including shoring up a pensions system which could go bust in 15 years, economic analysts say. Karamanlis prides himself on cutting deficits and creating 200,000 jobs since coming to power but unemployment remains above the EU average despite a healthy 4.4 percent GDP growth rate this year. PASOK favours pro-market policies with strong social protection and has promised tax breaks, increased pensions and to spend at least 5 percent of gross domestic product on education, up from about 3.6 percent now. About 20 percent of Greeks live below the poverty line and per capita GDP is the lowest next to Portugal's in the euro zone. Brussels says more structural reforms are needed to make Greece competitive. bd
