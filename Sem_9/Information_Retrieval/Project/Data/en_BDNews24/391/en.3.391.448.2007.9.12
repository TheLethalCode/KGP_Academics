 DHAKA/JAKARTA, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The weather office Wednesday warned that a possible tsunami may risk coastal areas of Bangladesh after midnight as an earthquake measuring 8.2 struck Indonesia's Sumatra region. Samarendra Karmaker, director of the Meteorological Department, said his office had issued a tsunami warning. "If nothing happens, we will withdraw the warning," he told bdnews24.com by phone. "If a tsunami forms, it may strike the coastal areas of Bangladesh after midnight," he said. Meteorologist Monowar Hossain of the Patenga weather office in Chittagong told bdnews24.com there was a forecast that not only the Bangladesh coastal areas, but also those of the countries along the Indian Ocean, were likely to be hit in the event of a tsunami. Deputy commissioner Ashraf Shamim told bdnews24.com that steps were being taken to evacuate people from low-lying coastal areas to safer places in Chittagong. Loudspeakers were used in all areas and even from mosques asking people to move to cyclone and other shelters. All members of the local administration had been directed to take necessary measures in this regard, he added. In a statement, the Disaster Management Bureau Wednesday repeated the same warning for a possible tsunami and asked residents of Sandwip and other coastal areas to move to safety. The Sumatra earthquake triggered tsunami warnings in the Indian Ocean and sparking panic in coastal areas across southeast Asia. About 2- hours after the quake hit, Indonesia's meteorological agency lifted its tsunami warning and said via a telephone text message that there had been no tsunami. But Malaysian authorities reported a tsunami measuring 1-3 metres in height and heading away from the epicentre of the quake. Indonesia's Global TV reported several buildings in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra had collapsed, while Metro TV reported some buildings had caught fire. A Reuters witness said residents of Padang fled for higher ground. "The city is in complete chaos. Everyone is heading to higher ground, I saw one house collapsed to the ground. I'm trying to save my family," said the witness in Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra, north of the earthquake's epicentre. An aide to Padang Mayor Fauzi Bahar said by telephone there had been no initial reports of casualties. "Some buildings suffered from broken glass but we have not heard of any major damage." Indonesia's Meteorological agency said via an sms alert the quake's epicentre was 159 km (99 miles) southwest of Bengkulu, which is in south Sumatra. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had issued an Indian Ocean tsunami warning after the huge quake struck at 6:10 p.m. (1110 GMT). Authorities from Malaysia and Sri Lanka issued independent warnings, as did India for the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and Australia for Christmas and Cocos Islands. A huge earthquake struck the same area on Dec. 26, 2004, causing a massive tsunami and over 230,000 deaths in countries across the region. Indonesia suffers frequent quakes, lying on an active seismic belt on part of the so-called Pacific "Ring of Fire". Some residents of Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand also felt the quake and some buildings were evacuated. Budi, a police chief in Bengkulu, said on Indonesia's Elshinta radio that he felt a strong quake. "People panicked and tried to save themselves," he said. He added he heard a report that a three-storey building had collapsed. TSUNAMI DETECTED IN MALAYSIA In Malaysia, Mohd Rosaidi Cheabas, director of the Meteorology Department's seismological division told Reuters it was not following Indonesia, which lifted an earlier tsunami warning for the neighbouring country. "Right now, the tsunami is already detected over Padang, Indonesia, at a height of 1-3 metres," he said. "We are not following Indonesia. We are still monitoring the movement of the tsunami wave to our region." He said the tsunami had been detected by a tide gauge and was not clear on the direction of the wave. The division estimated that if the tsunami was headed for Malaysia, it could reach the north-western shores of the Malaysian peninsula after 1400 GMT. Malaysian authorities issued a tsunami warning for citizens to stay away from beaches. "A tsunami alert has been issued following 7.9 quake in Bengkulu. People in Perlis, Kedah, Perak and Penang (states) advised to move away from beaches," said the warning, delivered via text message to mobile-phone subscribers nation-wide. Police on the resort island of Penang, hit in the 2004 tsunami, have been mobilised to evacuate people from beach-side hotels and other dwellings, a local government official said. bdnews
