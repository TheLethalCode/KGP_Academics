 WARSAW, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish police seized nearly 120 kg of heroin hidden in a truck crossing the border from Ukraine on Thursday in one of Poland's biggest drug busts. The drugs, estimated to be worth $9 million, were packed in nearly 270 bags and detected in a compartment beneath the cabin roof when police x-rayed the vehicle at the Hrebenne crossing in eastern Poland. "This is the largest such seizure on the eastern border," a police spokesman said from the nearby city of Lublin. The police arrested a 41-year-old Turkish driver, whose lorry was officially carrying washing machines.
