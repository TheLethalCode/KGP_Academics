 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government has resumed the work of introducing machine-readable passports and visas after the initiative had stalled for over a year. Home secretary Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "The government has revived the initiative to introduce machine-readable passports. Reviewing is going on." Additional secretary of the home ministry Mohammad Mohsin said: "Two consultants from the International Organisation for Migration have been working for the last two months on introducing MRPs and MRVs in Bangladesh." "We are scheduled to have a meeting with the consultants Thursday. I hope a specific plan can be formulated to introduce MRPs after the meeting," he added. Mohsin said it would not be possible to enter many countries including the USA without an MRP after 2010. "The work of introducing MRPs and MRVs restarted keeping this in view." According to home ministry officials, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the US and European countries have been urging the introduction of MRPs and MRVs in different countries including Bangladesh. The previous BNP-led government responded positively to their requests and decided to take up the MRP and MRV project in mid-2002. A 13-member committee was formed in 2004, headed by the additional secretary of the home ministry, to prepare recommendations in this regard. A senior consultant was also appointed. A team of experts from Bangladesh visited Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore and the Maldives to see their respective MRP, MRV and MRNID projects. Large-scale research was done on the project. The committee prepared a package project including the three items and floated an international tender in two phases. In the first phase, 34 companies participated in the tender and four companies qualified. In 2006, a meeting of the cabinet committee ordered a new proposal excluding the MRNID cards (machine-readable national identity cards). The work of implementing the project stagnated. A home ministry official told bdnews24.com that the alliance government took up the project in an unplanned way. "Although the government spent a huge amount of money on the project they could not implement it." The new programme started after the government reviewed the previous plans, the official said. With the introduction of the MRP and MRV it is expected that Bangladeshis will find it easier to travel abroad, and demand for Bangladeshi workers would increase on the international labour market. The home ministry also expects it will help implement policies relating to national security. At present there are more than 80 lakh Bangladeshis holding passports. bdnews24.com/e
