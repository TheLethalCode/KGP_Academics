 BRUSSELS, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopia's Meseret Defar won a car for setting a women's two-mile world best at the Van Damme Golden League meeting on Friday although she will have to find someone else to drive it home. The 23-year old will have to get her driver's licence before she can use her prize for powering to victory in eight minutes 58.58 seconds, beating her previous record of nine minutes 10.47 seconds set in California last May. "I am going to have to get one (driving licence) now," she said. "The race was very nice. My shape was good," Defar said adding that she knew she would win. The pint-sized 5,000 metres world champion has now set her sights on winning that event at this month's world athletics final in Stuttgart and at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix but said she would wait until next year for more record attempts. "Not this season but in 2008, I want to break my own record for the 5,000 metres and 3,000 indoors," she told Reuters
