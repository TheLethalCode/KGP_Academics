 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  President of Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA) Professor Sadrul Amin Sunday turned himself in to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Sunday and was sent to jail. Prof Amin, who faces an arrest warrant on charges of breaching emergency powers rules, surrendered through his lawyers Masud Ahmed Talukder and Golam Mostafa Khan. The DUTA president stands accused of fanning violence at Dhaka University in August with what the emergency government said was provocative comment. Prof Amin is among the four DU teachers who have been formally charged by the police with having roles in the August campus rioting. Two of them professors Anwar Hossain and Harun-or- Rashid are already in jail. The fourth teacher who is facing an arrest order is Prof Nimchandra Bhowmik, provost of Jagannath Hall. Metropolitan magistrate SM Ferdous Ahmed ordered jail authorities to provide good treatment and division as per the jail provision following the hearing. Prof Amin's lawyers appealed for his division and treatment during hearing as there was no provision to seek bail under the emergency powers rules. A Dhaka court on Sept 13 issued an arrest warrant and ordered confiscation of wealth of 16 persons including professors Amin and Bhowmik. On Sept 9, police pressed charges in the court in two cases showing professors Hossain, Rashid, Amin and Bhowmik and 14 others fugitive. bdnews24.co
