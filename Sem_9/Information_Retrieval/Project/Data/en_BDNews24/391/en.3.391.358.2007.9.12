 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks fell for a second day Wednesday on selling pressure in the last one and a half hours of trading as retail and institutional investors locked in profits. Almost all the shares closed lower after market majors in power, bank, pharmaceuticals and cement stocks fell even though stocks with low market capitalisation moved up. A securities broker however said the market should not lose sleep over the decline. "There's nothing to worry about. [Stocks fell] because of profit-taking. But investors should make their investment decision based on company fundamentals," said Sharif Ataur Rahman, managing director of SAR Securities. BRAC Bank, the most active share, was down 3.73 percent to Tk 1295 although it gained Tk 21.7 against each share in the six months to June 2007. Market heavyweight Power Grid Company of Bangladesh that posted Tk 17.46 in earnings against each share in 2006 slipped 1.95 percent to Tk 628.25. Summit Power slumped 3.31 percent to Tk 1326.5. DESCO however added 2.36 percent to a one-year high of Tk 1199.75. It earned Tk 35.38 against each share in 2006. The main DGEN or general index dived 27.51 points or 1.06 percent to 2547.16. The DSI or all-share price index however narrowed down its losses thanks to a surge in the shares of market bigwig Rupali Bank. The DSI closed 2116.38, down 13.17 points or 0.61 percent. Turnover stood at Tk 1.60 billion from trading of 67, 10, 884 shares. Losers outnumbered gainers 120 to 67. Some 21 issues held steady. The Chittagong Stock Exchange also slumped, depressed by a fall in most of the shares. A total of 10, 10, 789 shares worth Tk 203.40 traded and 36 advanced, 69 fell and seven were stable. UCBL ended at Tk 4157.5, down 2.25 percent from the previous day. Of the other active shares by turnover, Apex Footwear and Aftab Automobiles moved up but City Bank, Square Pharma and National Bank dropped. Top gainers were Popular Life Insurance, AMCL (Pran) and Apext Footwear, while Niloy Cement, Peoples Insurance and Prime Insurance led the big losers. bd
