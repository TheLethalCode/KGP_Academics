 WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tensions and friction between the World Bank's unit investigating corruption and the rest of the bank have undermined the lender's efforts to fight graft, an independent panel said on Thursday. Led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the panel was asked by the World Bank to examine the role of the Department of Institutional Integrity, or INT, following concerns about its investigative practices. In its findings, the panel said departments like INT "were not typically candidates for popularity prizes" but it found resistance by bank staff to the unit's work were "particularly strong" due to distrust. Recent problems involving the department, established in 2001, began with the appointment in 2005 of Suzanne Folsom, a US ethics lawyer, as INT director by former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, who resigned in June amid an ethics scandal involving his companion. Questions arose over whether Folsom's appointment was tied to her political connections with the Republican Party and escalated as INT became more aggressive in response to a controversial anti-corruption campaign by Wolfowitz, a former US deputy defense secretary and an architect of the Iraq war. The panel said tensions contributed to a "siege mentality" at INT which had become less communicative with the rest of the bank. "The bank's internal discord in dealing with investigations, in turn, has undermined relationships with some important borrowing countries, potentially damaging the development effort," the panel said. Despite the strains, the panel concluded the anti-corruption unit had had some notable successes and its employees, including Folsom, were competent and professional. The panel also said it was satisfied the department's investigative procedures as a whole were "reasonable and fair to bank staff". But it suggested the bank find ways to integrate its work into the bank's mainstream operations and anti-corruption strategy. "INT cannot function well in isolation, insensitive to the purposes and operating needs of the entire World Bank group," the panel said, adding the bank lacked clear procedures to ensure it responded to INT's findings of corruption in projects. It recommended that an external board of experts be set up to advise on INT's practices and performance and said that investigations of World Bank staff for misconduct should be pursued by a body separate from the INT. World Bank President Robert Zoellick said he planned to keep Folsom in her job, telling reporters in a conference call: "It has obviously been a very tough job. She has operated in extremely difficult circumstances." He acknowledged there were problems with the anti-corruption department and said he would appoint an internal working group to consider the panel's recommendations. He would also seek comments from the public. Zoellick said it was understandable that tensions would arise around a department probing corruption but it was important INT's work had the backing of the bank's staff. "This is an opportunity for the bank as an institution to be forward-looking, to fix the problems, but it has to be backed by everybody within the institution and, as the Volcker report noted, that wasn't always the case in the past," he said. In an interview, Volcker said it was not the panel's mandate to judge individuals like Folsom, but he insisted she got high marks for professionalism. "There is no doubt there are a lot of accusations made about whether decisions have been politically involved," Volcker told Reuters and another agency, adding the panel had found no "systematic evidence" that was the case. Volcker said the anti-corruption unit felt it was under attack from the rest of the bank. "There is no question INT has withdrawn into itself as it felt under attack and gathered the troops around its fortress," he said, stressing that it needed to maintain its independence while improving its relationship with the rest of the bank. Volcker said the problem of corruption was widespread in bank-funded projects. "It is fair to say we think it is substantial," he add
