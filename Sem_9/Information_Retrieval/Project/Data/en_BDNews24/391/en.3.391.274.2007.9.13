 Cape Town, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)  Zimbabwe stunned favourites Australia with a comprehensive five-wicket victory in a nail-biting finish in their Twenty20 World Cup Group B match Thursday. Brendan Taylor cracked an unbeaten 45-ball 60 and put on 53 runs with Henry Masakadza (27) to propel the Africans to the upset win. Vusi Sibanda (23) began the reply well but wickets slowed the scoring before rain forced a delay. Earlier, medium-pacers Gary Brent and Elton Chigumbura shared five wickets to limit Australia to a moderate 138 for nine. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first, but slumped to 48 for four in the 10th over. Andrew Symonds boosted the run rate with his 33 off 25 balls before sharp work by wicketkeeper Brendan Taylor meant he was stumped off Hamilton Masakadza. The Australians owed their final total to Brad Hodge, who scored 35 not out off 22 balls. Chigumbura took three wickets for 20 runs and Brent finished with two for 19.
