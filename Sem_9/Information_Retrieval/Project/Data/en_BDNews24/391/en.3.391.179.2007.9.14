 CAPE TOWN, Sept, 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia roared into the Super Eights of the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup after thrashing England by eight wickets in the final Group B match on Friday. The world champions were in danger of being eliminated in the first stage of the competition after their shock defeat by Zimbabwe in their opening match. But they made amends on Friday after they overhauled England's total of 135 all out with 31 balls to spare. Zimbabwe were knocked out of the event on net run rate since all three teams in the group finished with two points. Fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Bracken grabbed six wickets between them while Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist shared an opening stand of 78. Johnson took three for 22 while Bracken claimed three for 16 to help dismiss England, whose batsmen struggled to score steadily against Australia's disciplined bowling. Andrew Flintoff's 31 from 19 balls was their top score and their biggest partnership was the 30 runs shared by Flintoff and Owais Shah, who scored 14. Kevin Pietersen, who had said England were eager to "humiliate" Australia by pushing them towards an early exit, was bowled by Bracken for an uninspired 21. Australia's batsmen continued the good work and Gilchrist lashed 45 from 28 balls with five fours and a six. Hayden was just as aggressive and reached his half century from 34 deliveries before guiding his team to victory with an unbeaten 67 from 43 balls with 11 fours and one six
