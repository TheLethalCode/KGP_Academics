 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Microsoft and Sun Microsystems announced Wednesday that Sun signed on as a Windows Server original equipment maker. Besides, forgetting all historical bitterness Sun and Microsoft will now work together to swap their operating systems in each other's server. The Microsoft servers run on Windows while the Sun servers run on Solaris operating systems. "Sun and Microsoft will work together to ensure that Solaris runs well as a guest on Microsoft virtualisation technologies and that Windows Server runs well as a guest on Sun's virtualisation technologies," the companies explained in a joint statement. The landmark alliance is also a cultural revolution among the two global IT giants. Former Sun chief executive Scott McNealy once said, "It's mankind against Microsoft." He had publicly said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates is "probably the most dangerous and powerful industrialist of our age." But now Sun has become a "Microsoft Gold Certified Partner" under a new leadership. "Today's announcement is another example of Microsoft's commitment to (Sun's) 64-bit computing," Microsoft's senior vice president Bob Muglia said. "The Sun hardware platform is an excellent foundation for Windows-based enterprise solutions, such as Microsoft Virtual Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) Edition." "Microsoft's recognition of our x64 systems and storage systems is a testament to the superior system design at the heart of our product portfolio," Sun Microsystems' executive vice president John Fowler reciprocated. "Sun is now a single source for today's leading operating systemsSolaris and Windowson the industry's most innovative x64 systems and storage products," he said. "Customers can now take advantage of the virtualisation benefits of Windows and Solaris on Sun's energy efficient x64 systems," Fowler added. Sun will offer Windows Server on its x64 hardware and provide additional utilities and value-added software to server systems carrying Windows Server. Windows Server 2003 will be available on Sun x64 systems within 90 days. Microsoft also "recognizes Sun's compelling x64 server and storage products in the market today." Microsoft and Sun will continue to work together to test and validate the Windows platform on these systems for scale-up enterprise computing. The companies will continue to collaborate to advance the worldwide deployment of the Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV and multimedia platform on Sun servers and storage systems. AT&T U-verse digital TV offering has chosen Sun for one of world's largest deployments of the Microsoft Mediaroom platform, which includes server and client software. "The combination of Sun's server solutions and Microsoft's TV software technology and expertise is expected to speed time-to-market for IPTV services, while providing superior cost and performance characteristics for communications service providers worldwide," the announcement said. bdn
