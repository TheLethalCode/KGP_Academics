 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Fresh from a dazzling six-wicket win over the West Indies, Bangladesh take on hosts South Africa in a clash to decide who emerge as the Group A winners at Newlands, Cape Town Saturday. ESPN will telecast the match live from the venue at 10:00pm BdST (Bangladesh standard time). Mohammad Ashraful and his boys are high on spirit after the superb display that sank the Caribbeans a win that fuelled the notion that no-one is favourite in the newest version of the game, which is full of drama, thrill and fun. The game is not expected to draw huge interest now that the group has been settled after the exit of the West Indies. But the Bangladesh skipper hopes to repeat the Guyana feat against the Proteas, who were tamed by the Tigers in the last edition of the World Cup super eight phase in the West Indies. "We are capable of beating any team and in Twenty20 there are no favourites. We will go against South Africa with victory in mind," said Ashraful, hit the fastest-ever fifty in Twenty20 cricket off just 20 balls. "We beat them in the World Cup, and we still believe we can do it again," Ashraful, who scored a an explosive 27-ball 61, was quoted by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), as saying. Having broken the jinx of having never beaten the Caribbeans in any form of the cricket game, the expectations are now high among fans. They expect Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed to relive the fireworks that tore into the West Indian bowling. The opening duo of Tamim Iqbal and Nazimuddin, who failed to prove their potential Thursday, are also expected to fire on all cylinders. Ashraful should utilise his pace weapon of Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who was withdrawn from the attack in the first match after conceding 20 runs in two overs. Ashraful, thrusting himself in place of Mashrafee, spilled 55 runs in four overs. The Bangladesh skipper hinted that they might stick to the winning combination in South Africa game. South Africa, however, is likely to miss skipper Graeme Smith and explosive Herschelle Gibbs, who picked injuries in the match against West Indies in Johannesburg. Coach Mickey Arthur admitted losing both Smith and Gibbs would be a significant blow. "They are two of our most experienced players and they are in good form at the moment, so it is a little bit of a concern but we are confident of having them ready for Sunday (Super Eights match)," Arthur was quoted as saying by cricinfo.com. He said that AB de Villiers is likely to remain at No. 3 with either Gulam Bodi or JP Duminy replacing Gibbs against Bangladesh. Bangladesh should be relieved that Gibbs is not playing after the dashing batsman guided his side to win against the West Indies. Gibbs also stood tall in their loss to Bangladesh in Guyana. The Newlands wicket may have a say in the fate of the match as the wicket may get slow during the second innings. Arthur thinks the situation would be more variable at Newlands. "Batting second allows you to manage your innings a lot better. "You know exactly what you are chasing so it does become easier. I think down here at Newlands it could be slightly different and you can put pressure on by putting a big score on the board because the wickets are slower," said the Proteas coach. He doesn't want to take the match lightly as the gap between sides is not much in Twenty20. "You can't take anyone lightly. It does become a little bit of a lottery and class-wise the teams coming a little closer together." bd
