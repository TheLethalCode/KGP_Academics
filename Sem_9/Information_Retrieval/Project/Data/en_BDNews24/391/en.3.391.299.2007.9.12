 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Expelled BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Wednesday said the Election Commission should invite him and his followers to the electoral reforms dialogue. "Those who don't want anything to change in the BNP have been working towards splitting the party apart," Bhuiyan told reporters at his Gulshan home. "Expelling Ashraf and me from the party without following any constitutional procedure was a blunder which majority of the BNP executive committee members and former lawmakers did not endorse," he said. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain on Sept 3 just before her detention. On the ouster of Mofiqul Islam Tripti, the office secretary, an outraged Mannan said, "We don't even recognise Khandakar Delwar (Hossain) himself. What shall I say about his authority to expel anyone else from the party? "Those who are devoid of all sense of discipline and propriety can only commit such follies." Quoting the party constitution, he said, "Approval of the permanent committee is a must before ousting anybody from the party or any party office, which has been flagrantly violated in some past instances." Asked who should be manning the BNP headquarters in Naya Paltan, he said, "Majority of the BNP national committee members and the former MPs are with us. But we hear a band of usurpers gathered to take possession of the BNP head office the other day. Isn't that shocking?" "It's a sheer lie Delwar's claim that much of the BNP permanent committee is with him. The same is true for [retired lieutenant general] Mahbubur Rahman is loyal to him." bdnews24.co
