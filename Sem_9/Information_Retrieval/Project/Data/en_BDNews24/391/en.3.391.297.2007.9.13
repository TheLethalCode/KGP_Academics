 BOSTON, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Brazil struck twice inside the last 10 minutes to record a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Mexico in a lively friendly on Wednesday. Mexico went ahead in the 43rd minute with Juan Carlos Cacho's first goal for his country, only for Brazil to draw level two minutes later through Kleber's first strike in national colours. Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa produced a series of saves to keep his side level but Kaka put the Brazilians 2-1 up in the 80th minute. Despite being down to 10 men following the dismissal of Elano, Brazil substitute Afonso added a third four minutes from time to complete a successful pair of friendlies after their 4-2 victory over the United States on Sunday. Brazil, who had coach Dunga sent off in the final stages after arguing with the fourth official, begin their World Cup qualification campaign away to Colombia on Oct 13. Mexico keeper Ochoa twice saved his side early on through his speed off the line -- in the ninth minute he was out quickly at the feet of a goal-bound Vagner Love and then was sharp and brave again to deny Kaka.

The youthful Mexico side showed plenty of endeavour after the break but they needed the inspired display from their keeper to keep them on level terms. Ochoa, who was outstanding in Mexico's 2-0 win over Brazil in the Copa America in June, was at full stretch to push wide a Ronaldinho effort in the 66th minute but had his team-mate Guardado to thank a minute later as he cleared a Gilberto Silva header off the line. Mexico introduced 18-year-old Barcelona forward Giovani Dos Santos but the game turned in Brazil's direction 10 minutes from the end when Kaka slotted home after Mexico defender Rafael Marquez failed to clear a low cross from Maicon. Brazil then had substitute Elano sent off for a wild challenge on Gerardo Torrado but extended their lead when substitute Afonso raced away to confidently fired home
