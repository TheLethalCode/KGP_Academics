 LONDON, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose towards $78 a barrel on Tuesday, within sight of its record highs, as OPEC debated a modest rise in crude production to assuage consumers worried by prices near record highs and rapidly diminishing stocks. U.S. light crude rose 35 cents to $77.84 a barrel by 1355 GMT, off highs of $78.32 that placed it within striking distance of its record high of $78.77, on the back of pipeline attacks in the world's fifth-largest crude producer Mexico. London Brent crude was up 29 cents at $75.77. Ahead of the OPEC ministerial meeting in Vienna, opinion was divided on the need for output increases, but as talks gathered pace behind close doors the mood had veered in favour of an output increase. Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said as he left the group's meeting that most OPEC oil ministers favoured an oil output increase. Several OPEC members, notably Iran, Venezuela and Libya, had earlier said they see no need to raise output as current stock levels are comfortable, though an OPEC source said Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states backed a modest rise. OPEC sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait favoured a supply increase of between 500,000 bpd and 1.0 million bpd. "The big question ... is whether an additional 400,000-700,000 bpd of OPEC crude will make a difference, and the answer is a qualified "no"," Global Insight analyst Simon Wardell said. GULF STATES KEY The views of the Gulf Arab states, particularly the world's biggest exporter Saudi Arabia, are key to OPEC policy decisions. They straddle more than half of OPEC's proven oil reserves and have almost all the organization's spare production capacity. An increase of around 500,000 bpd on top of current OPEC supplies would do something to placate consumer nations without flooding the market and causing a price collapse. It would also unwind most of the 1.7 million bpd of OPEC cuts agreed since October 2006 because the 10 states subject to output restraint are already pumping nearly 1.0 million bpd above their 25.8 million bpd limit. OPEC President Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli said in his opening speech that the world oil market was well supplied and stocks healthy, noting that the turmoil in world financial markets could damage demand for oil. "A modest release will, in our view, put some pressure on prices, while leaving things as they are will most likely spark a run to the record highs," Edward Meir at MF Global said in a research note. A number of consuming nations, including top consumer the United States, have called on OPEC to increase oil supplies as they see stocks declining rapidly in the coming peak winter season. U.S. crude oil and gasoline stocks during the week to Sept. 7 were forecast to fall again, a Reuters survey of industry analysts showed. "U.S. crude stocks won't stop decreasing in the next weeks whatever OPEC's decision," said SG Commodities. Oil prices are 27 percent up this year and have tripled since 2002 as investors buy into growing consumer demand, real or potential supply disruptions in producers such as Nigeria and Iran and infrastructure constraints such as a lack of refini
