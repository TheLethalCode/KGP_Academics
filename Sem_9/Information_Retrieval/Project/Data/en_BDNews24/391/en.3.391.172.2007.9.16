 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand beat India by 10 runs in the Twenty20 World Cup Group E match in Johannesburg on Sunday. Earlier, New Zealand set India the massive challenge of overcoming 190 all out in 20 overs in their Twenty20 World Cup Super Eight match in Johannesburg on Sunday. Craig McMillan and Jacob Oram shared a partnership of 73 runs in 5.2 overs to boost New Zealand's score. McMillan scored a scintillating 44 off 23 balls, with four sixes, and Oram slammed 35 off 15 balls, with three sixes. The pair reversed a decline in the innings that saw New Zealand slide from 69 for one in the ninth over to 91 for five in the 13th. Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took two for 24 in his four overs, while left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh finished with two for 29. Neither McMillan nor Oram could bat through to the end of the innings, however, as New Zealand lost four wickets in the final over, wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni claiming the credit for three run outs. Brendon McCullum top-scored for New Zealand at the top of the order with 45 off 31 balls, setting the Kiwis on their way to their highest total in Twenty20 internationals. Their previous best was 170 all out against Australia in Auckland in 2004/05.
