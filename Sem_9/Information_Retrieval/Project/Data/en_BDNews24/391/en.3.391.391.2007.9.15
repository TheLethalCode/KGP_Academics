<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has said the time is not yet right to lift the state of emergency. In an interview with BBC Bengali Service Saturday, he said his administration was pressing on with reforms to hold a free, fair and credible election. The ban on indoor politics has been lifted and the emergency rule, which is a temporary measure, will also be withdrawn when the time is right, Fakhruddin said. On whether reforms could not be carried by lifting the emergency, the chief adviser said the main issue was not whether reforms could be achieved by relaxing the state of emergency; the issue rather was to look into whether major obstacles were being faced during emergency rule. He said except for processions, meetings and big rallies in the open, people's lives were not being hampered by the state of emergency. There was no restrictions on carrying news in the newspapers. Normal life apparently was not being hindered, Fakhruddin said. Defending the government decision to set certain conditions for allowing parlour politics, the chief adviser said: "I do not consider the directives as conditions, rather clarifications. "We have issued them to make certain points clear to the politicians who will engage in indoor politics". Fakhruddin brushed aside allegations of the government's involvement in splitting the major political parties or in changing their leadership. "I can categorically say the government is in no way involved in such process. Choosing leadership and fixing ways of determining leadership are political parties' internal affairs." On the extent of the army's involvement in national affairs, the chief adviser said: "I don't think that there is dual rule in the country." "The army is assisting the government as per the law of the land. I don't suppose that they army have a political role." On the proposed formation of a national security council, Fakhruddin said: "We are holding discussions on forming a national security council. But the government is yet to take a final decision." He also commented on reports that private TV channels could not telecast talk shows "under instruction from an agency". "The government has not imposed any restriction on media. The government is accepting media's criticism. The government benefitting from the criticisms of the media. "Since the incident on Dhaka University campus, the government perhaps issued some temporary directives (for media) as an advisory," Fakhruddin said. "Criticism of the media is important. But I hope that the criticisms will be objective. In addition, the media should have some self-regulatory role. "There are instances of such self-regulatory mechanism in different countries. I made such a request at my meeting with the editors. I have told them (editors) that the government will assist if any institution wants to bring in a code of conduct for them." On allegations of media carrying provocative news , the chief adviser said, "The emergency powers rules bar carrying provocative news items. Despite the ban, we during the last seven-eight months have accepted their constructive criticisms. "It is clear to people how the emergency powers rules are being used in relation to the media despite such rules." Referring to the Bangladesh Bank governor's opinion, Fakhruddin, who himself headed the central bank, said, "There may be some impact (on business as a result of the ongoing anti-corruption drive). "But I don't think that there was an impact (on business) as a whole. Therefore, I have repeatedly assured the businessmen of providing assistance in their doing business." "Our main goal is to hand over power to an elected government by holding a free and fair election. This is our prime challenge. "Preparing a level-playing field for the (upcoming) elections and encouraging honest candidates to assume leadership at the national level are our challenges too," he said. bdnews24.com/mhb/
