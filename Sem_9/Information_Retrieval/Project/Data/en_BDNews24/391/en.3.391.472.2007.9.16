 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Ashraf Hossain will work as acting secretary general for a BNP faction in absence of Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, who is scheduled to travel to Singapore for treatment of a cardiac ailment. Bhuiyan, the expelled BNP secretary general, told reporters at his Gulshan home: "Senior leaders can take any decision in favour of reforms." "I am going to Singapore for treatment (at Mount Elizabeth Hospital). I ask countrymen to pray for me." Bhuiyan will fly Thai Airways, accompanied by son Bhuiyan Anindo Mohaimen. Senior leaders of the party will see him off. An arterial blockage had been removed from Bhuiyan and a stent was implanted through angioplasty at the same hospital last year. bdnews24
