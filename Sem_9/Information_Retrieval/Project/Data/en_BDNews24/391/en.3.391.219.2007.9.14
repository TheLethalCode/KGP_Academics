 Fazal M Kamal Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com) -- For a country which is not only almost petite in physical size but also continues to struggle with development goalseven though on the socio-economic front it has achieved some astonishingly laudable objectivesit sure gets a great lot of persistent keen and close attention from a whole array of entities and capitals. How lucky, indeed, we are! From Washington to Wellington, from Delhi to London, from Brussels to Genevathey are all watching us with eagle eyes. Of course it's known to most all that a major part of the cause for this type of attention resides with many of our political leaders who, over the decades, have most assiduously courted, what may aptly be called, "good behavior certificates." Some, it would've seemed, possibly even thought of having quotations from them printed in cursive letters and hung in various points in gilded frames! But maybe I'm fantasising. Who knows where the truth actually lies. Consequently, receiving approbation especiallyand probably exclusivelyfrom foreign nationals in general and officials in particular often times was pursued with tremendous energy and regular alacrity. Naturally then, from the other parties, there was an awful officiousness in handing out their two-cent worth of opinions on anything that had something to do with Bangladesh, and everything was fair game. Our economy, society, politics, governance, and to some even we ourselves as a peopleall were subjected to comments, suggestions and, when thought fit, opprobrium. In recent times one remembers, with a modicum of awe but not shock, the parting words of wisdom of the last United States envoy, which proved yet again, if such proof was really necessary, that whatever you may do, you are at liberty to stretch the facts whichever way you want and in as many directions as you wish. At the end, at least some people are going to pat you on the back regardless of all else. (Certainly in all this, a kind of three-ring circus some of the times, one cannot overlook, if one is to be brutally honest, the role enacted by sections of the media whose eagerness, nay desperationat least that's what it appeared occasionally, I'm afraid, I've to confessseemed boundless when attempting to get some alien figure declare somethinganythingfor a quote which sometimes was more dawdling than the event called for. But that can't be a popular opinion; or can it?) One also recalls with some bemusementand this is from personal experience in all seriousnessthe busybodiessome have been described as cranks; but not by mein the British capital who apparently are always all keyed up to hold a seminar/discussion/meeting or call it what you will, to analyze, dissect and ultimately deliver a judgment on whatever was happening in Bangladesh in spite of the fact that they had precious little actual knowledge of the ground realities in this country and had half-ingested factoids to go on and on and on ad infinitum, ad nauseam with vociferous encouragement from our brothers and sisters from the "home country". Given this briefest of backdrop, should anybody be surprised that suggestions and reprimands come flying into this country so thick and so fast? Anyone with an iota of common sense (which, incidentally, isn't all that common) will definitely be always expecting foreign entities and countries to try their damndest to be most helpful to Bangladesh notwithstanding the finance advisor's recent proclamation that external assistance will not be accepted by sacrificing the nation's interests. The latest such "friendly intervention" has come from the European parliament whose members are ever-eager to assist this nation to raise its standards. However, before going any further on these topics let it be comprehensively and clearly comprehended that defending and preserving human rights, ensuring adherence to due process and rule of law, and similar values are not subjects to be trifled with and must be upheld irrespective of any extenuating circumstances. (A footnote: This hack's stand on these matters over the past three decades and more is out there in print on the pages of news publications for all to scrutinise.) Nevertheless, perhaps, it'll not be out of place to suggest that the Saarc Council of Ministers, maybe, ought to delve into certain issues and adopt an appropriate resolution. For instance, how about inquiring why some persons of South Asian extraction were being hounded and molested in Germany? How about finding out why an unarmed Brazilian on his way to work was shot at least a half dozen times, in the back, while he was face down on the floor of a London subway train? Or why have people from the former French colonies become so immeasurably desperate claiming discrimination and worse? And then what about that creative euphemism "extraordinary rendition"? In no way are the significance, relevance and the immutable value of rights and wrongs being questioned here; it's the easy and ready pontification of so many others that need to be examined. Moreover as Alfred North Whitehead declared: What is morality in any given time or place? It is what the majority then and there happen to like and immorality is what they dislike. There's more stuff to think about than you'd normally contemplate. b
