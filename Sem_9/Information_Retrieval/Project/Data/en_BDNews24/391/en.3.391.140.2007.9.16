 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka and New Delhi have finally signed a memorandum of understanding Sunday on the duty-free export of eight million garment pieces manufactured in Bangladesh to India annually. "I hope Bangladeshi exporters will be able to export to India within one month, after the completion of all paperwork," Indian High Commissioner in Bangladesh Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty told reporters after the agreement was signed at the commerce ministry Sunday. Chakravarty said the paperwork includes the Indian government issuing official notification to Indian customs authorities in this regard. Officials of both countries hope the move will help Bangladesh reduce the trade gap with its closest neighbour. Two-way trade between the two countries stood at $2.5 billion in fiscal 2006-07. Of which, Bangladesh's exports to India accounted for only $300 million, according to commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed. "This MoU is a gesture of goodwill. India has shown its commitment to narrowing the trade gap with Bangladesh," Ahmed said. Garment exporters hope the move will help them to enter an alternative market, which will ease dependence on the traditional US and European markets for readymade garments. Bangladesh's total exports registered $12.1 billion last fiscal year (2006-07), with around 75 percent of earnings coming from the RMG sector. The country's major export destinations are the US and Europe. Garment entrepreneurs are eager for alternative markets to reduce their dependency on limited markets. The MoU allows import of eight million apparel articles each calendar year from Bangladesh by India, duty-free and without any conditions imposed on sourcing of fabrics or port restrictions, the Indian high commissioner said. Bangladeshi exporters are now free to export RMG products made of Bangladeshi or any other country's fabrics. According to the original proposals by India, a portion of the RMG products from Bangladesh should have been made of Bangladeshi fabrics and the rest of Indian fabrics. Moreover, the earlier restriction for export of these items through some six specific land ports has now been removed, with sea, air and land routes permitted for the exports. Although India first made the offer two years ago under the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (Safta) framework, both parties took some time to reach a consensus on the modalities for export. The council of advisers led by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed approved the modalities of the MoU last month. Abdul Wahab Mian, joint secretary of the commerce ministry, and Mukta D Tomar, deputy high commissioner for India, signed the MoU for their respective sides Sunday. bdn
