 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile courts will keep vigil on Dhaka streets throughout Ramadan to discipline public ease traffic tailbacks, according to a government decision. The courts, being implemented as a joint initiative of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, BRTA and Dhaka City Corporation, will penalise those in breach of traffic rules on the spot. An inter-ministry meeting held at the home ministry on resolving traffic jams in the city took the decision Thursday, a senior government official told bdnews24.com. The meeting also proposed opening up the roads that run through the BDR headquarters in Peelkhana to public vehicles for two hours each in the morning and afternoon to ease traffic gridlock in surrounding areas. DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed, the director general of Ansar, representatives of the BDR, DCC and other agencies concerned were present at the meeting presided over by home secretary Abdul Karim. The meeting discussed neglect and inefficiency on the part of traffic police in managing traffic. Representatives of relevant departments agreed to further train the inspectors, sergeants and constables of traffic police to make them efficient in traffic management. Traffic officers have been asked not to stop vehicles in the middle of the road to check papers. They have also been told not to pull over abruptly in the middle of the road obstructing traffic, an official present at the meeting told bdnews24.com. Traffic police would face punitive measures if found guilty of harassing drivers after investigation into such allegations. Officials at the meeting said they had identified several causes of traffic jams in the city. They said 74 trains arrive at and depart from Kamalapur Rail Station every day through different points of the city. Traffic at Kamalapur, Maghbazar, Mohakhali and Banani is interrupted for a total of six hours a day at the level crossings. In addition, about 600,000 illegal rickshaws ply the city roads causing traffic problems. Damaged roads, ineffective traffic signals, lack of road markings and signs, and illegal bus stops are other major causes of traffic jams in the city. The meeting discussed reducing the number of bus routes on the city's 200 km roads to between 35 and 40 from about 138. Officials at the meeting acknowledged, however, that according to a police proposal, removing traffic jams completely during the city's peak hours was not possible. Police have proposed introduction of underground rail or monorail systems to reduce road traffic. bdnews24.com
