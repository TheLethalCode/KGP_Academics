<TITLE> Employment tribunal dismisses ex-HSBC banker claims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British employment tribunal has dismissed claims brought by a former senior HSBC Holdings Plc banker that he was sacked from his job because he was gay. Peter Lewis, fired by HSBC in 2004 for gross personal misconduct, lost a 5 million pound ($10 million) lawsuit against the bank in May last year, when an employment tribunal rejected his claim of unfair dismissal based on sexual orientation. An employment appeals tribunal rejected an appeal by Lewis last December. The tribunal in its original ruling upheld four of his 16 claims against the bank, finding HSBC had been discriminatory in its initial handling of allegations against Lewis of a sexual harassment incident at the bank's gym, which he denied. HSBC had appealed against the tribunal's decision on those four claims. That appeal was upheld last December and the four findings were looked at again. "The claims are not well-founded and are accordingly dismissed," a spokesman for the employment tribunal told Reuters on Friday. HSBC said in a statement: "The two judgments therefore fully vindicate HSBC's position that Mr Lewis was never discriminated against at any stage and all of his claims have now been rejected. "He was dismissed for gross misconduct following a complaint of sexual harassment made against him by another member of staff and for no other reason," HSBC added. The case is the first high-profile lawsuit under new sexual orientation legislation that came into force in Britain in 2003 to protect homosexual people in the work
