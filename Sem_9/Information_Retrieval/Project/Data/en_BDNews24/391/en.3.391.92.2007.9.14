 MOSCOW, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister-designate Viktor Zubkov told a confirmation hearing in parliament on Friday he would stick to President Vladimir Putin's economic policies if he was appointed. He also told the State Duma that the new government he headed should help rebuild Russia's once-mighty defence industry after years of neglect. Putin this week plucked 65-year-old Zubkov, a long-standing associate, from relative obscurity as head of an anti-money laundering watchdog and surprised observers by nominating him for the prime minister's job. The Duma (lower house) was to vote on the nomination later on Friday. Since it is dominated by Putin loyalists, it was expected to confirm Zubkov by a wide margin. Speaking in parliament, Zubkov thanked Putin for his trust and said he would try not to let him down. "I believe our priorities should be the strategic targets and programmes of concrete actions set out in the president's state of the nation addresses in the past few years," the premier-designate said. Zubkov said keeping inflation down and preventing sharp rouble fluctuations would be a key priority and he pledged to seek ways to cut taxes. He said Russia should squeeze more income out of its mineral wealth. "Russian oil and gas, forest, fish and other natural riches should bring more revenue", he said. On the military, he said it would be the new government's strategic goal "to help lift the defence industry complex." Under Putin, Russia's defence budget has been growing by around 30 percent a year and the armed forces have begun testing new weapons, including improved long-range missiles and a powerful vacuum bomb. Answering a legislator's question, Zubkov said corruption pervaded Russian society and he called for a special anti-corruption task-force to be set up. He said he would be making changes in the heavily-criticised Health and Social Affairs ministry. Minister Mikhail Zurabov was expected to be a likely casualty in a reshuffle. Communist leader Gennady Zyganov, who leads the biggest opposition force in parliament, was sceptical. He told Zubkov he was a Kremlin placeman. "You will simply not be allowed to form your own team to carry out these changes," he said. The nomination of Zubkov deepened uncertainty about whom Putin will endorse to replace him when he steps down as president next year. Most observers had expected the premier's job to go to one of the established presidential contenders. There has been speculation that reformist Economy Minister German Gref could be dropped in the expected government reshuffle once Zubkov is confirmed. Markets were focusing most attention on the fate of Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, who is credited with bringing Russia's finances back to robust health. Zubkov is a former collective farm boss who in the 1990s worked alongside Putin in St Petersburg's city administration. Once a senior official in the tax inspectorate, Zubkov has been head of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service, whose main task is to combat money laundering. That job gave him privileged access to details of the financial dealings of Russia's elite -- information which could give him considerable political leverage. Putin is to step down as president next year in line with the constitution that prohibits him from standing for a third consecutive term. Zubkov said on Thursday he did not rule out standing for the Kremlin top job. Most analysts do not see him as next president but as a caretaker figure who would help ensure stability while Putin manages the potentially turbulent succession. Zubkov replaced Mikhail Fradkov, who was fired by Putin after three years in the job. Putin praised Fradkov's work, but said he wanted a fresh team to take Russia through the March 2008 presidential election and beyo
