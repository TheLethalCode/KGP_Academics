<TITLE> Alcatel-Lucent slumps on outlook warning </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sudip Kar-Gupta PARIS, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent lost almost a tenth of its stock market value Thursday after issuing its third outlook warning this year. The company said it had seen a change in capital spending among its wireless customers in North America, which meant it had not compensated for lower prices with higher sales volumes. The group, created in December by the takeover of US-based Lucent by France's Alcatel, now expects 2007 revenue growth to be flat to slightly up at constant exchange rates. It previously forecast revenue would grow around five percent at constant currencies. The company, which has been dogged by merger-related costs and uncertainty over product integration, also projected third-quarter operating income "around break-even". Alcatel-Lucent shares closed down 8.7 percent at 6.62 euros. The stock had earlier fallen as much as 13.9 percent to an intraday low of 6.24 euros, its lowest level since the company's creation. The stock was the biggest loser on France's benchmark CAC-40 index and its fall weighed on European stock markets. "I was in the stock but I dumped the whole thing," said Ion-Marc Valahu, head of trading at Amas Bank in Switzerland. The latest cut to its revenue forecast comes after Alcatel-Lucent issued a profit warning in January, followed by a sales warning in April. Rumors of a new profit warning had caused Alcatel shares to fall at the end of last week. It was also the second blow to the technology sector this week after US chipmaker Texas Instruments barely changed its current quarter revenue and earnings forecasts, disappointing investors who had hoped for a raised outlook. MORE JOB CUTS? Investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort said in a research note Alcatel-Lucent might need a cash call or asset disposal to help its business. The cost of insuring debt of Alcatel-Lucent rose sharply. Five-year credit default swaps on Alcatel were 20 basis points wider at 232.5 basis points in early morning trade, according to prices from Deutsche Bank. "We're not going to get into the stock because of the profit warning problems, even if the sector looks attractive and the stock is at an attractive level," said Agilis Gestion fund manager Frederic Hamm. Alcatel-Lucent said it was continuing to work on its integration plans and left its target for synergy-related pre-tax savings this year unchanged at 600 million euros ($832 million). "While the company acknowledges that it is competing in a challenging market environment and executing a complex merger, it remains confident that it has the right combination of people and assets to position the company as a leading player in the industry," Chief Executive Patricia Russo said in a statement. Alcatel-Lucent has already said it plans to cut around 12,500 jobs by 2009 out of a group total of 80,000. Asked whether Alcatel-Lucent could raise this job cut target, a spokeswoman replied: "It's a possibility, but we will give more details at our third quarter earnings on October 31." Alcatel-Lucent is the market leader for fixed-line network equipment and associated services but lags Ericsson in wireless hardware. Cut-throat competition from Ericsson and other rivals has forced Alcatel-Lucent to sell wireless network products at relatively low prices, putting pressure on margins. Amas Bank's Valahu said Alcatel-Lucent's statement contrasted unfavourably with one in August from US rival Cisco, which reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and included a bullish outlook. Alcatel-Lucent shares have fallen by around 40 percent since the start of 2007, making them one of France's worst performing blue-chip stocks.
