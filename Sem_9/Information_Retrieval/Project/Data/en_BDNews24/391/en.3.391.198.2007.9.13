<TITLE> Game against India is huge, says Pakistan's Butt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DURBAN, South Africa, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Salman Butt was in no doubt about the enormity of the occasion awaiting his team when they clash with India in the Twenty20 World Cup in Durban on Friday. "That's an easy question to answer -- it's the biggest game there is," Butt told a news conference on Thursday. "The guys have a chance to perform well against India and the whole nation will be depending on us to do well. "There are two sides to the coin," he said. "You can either see the match as a pressure situation or as an opportunity to perform." Butt played down the significance of the absence from India's ranks of stalwarts Saurav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, saying it was "the team that counts, not individuals". The pitches played on so far in the tournament have offered bowlers bounce and movement off the seam. Butt said the conditions would continue to play an important role. "A lot depends on the conditions on the day," he said. "You need a little bit of luck, and the toss can decide everything." India are due to play their first match of the tournament against Scotland in Durban later on Thursday
