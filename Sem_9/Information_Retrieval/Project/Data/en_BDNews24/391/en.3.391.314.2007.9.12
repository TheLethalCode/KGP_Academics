 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)-- Former adviser to the caretaker government ASM Shahjahan Wednesday urged police to be more aware of women's rights at police stations. Shahjahan, a former inspector general of police, highlighted the issue in the face of ongoing allegations of human rights violations against the police. "The police need to be more gender sensitive in their stations so that women feel comfortable seeking police services," said Shahjahan at a meeting on police and gender sensitivity at the YWCA auditorium. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Naim Ahmed said: "We are planning to develop a corporate plan for police activities in the Dhaka metropolitan area to provide an improved service to the public." Many cases of police abuse directed at women have come to light in recent years. In 1994, a domestic help called Yasmin was gang-raped and murdered by police in Dinajpur. Police later fired on a group demonstrating against the incident, killing five people. The United Nations Development Programme organised the discussion under the UN Police Reform Programme. bdn
