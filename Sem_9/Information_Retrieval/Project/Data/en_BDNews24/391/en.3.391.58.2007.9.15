 Savar, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Three persons of a garment factory were arrested and police filed a case with Ashulia Police Station Saturday in connection with Friday's clashes at Dhaka Export Processing Zone. The three workers of Feather Light factory were arrested on suspicion of their involvement in the clashes. The DEPZ area was calm Saturday with authorities saying that work had resumed in the factories. The labour unrest started Thursday following a rumour that a worker of Feather Light Ltd, a garment factory owned by former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud, had been killed. The violence lingered into Friday when workers ransacked several factories and put up a blockade on the road. About 50 people were injured in clashes between workers and police. Ashulia police sub-inspector Mir Basirul Alam filed a case Saturday in connection with the incident. Besides, two workers of Feather Light factory Ilias Miah and Moniruzzaman, 100 to 150 unidentified people have been made the accused in the case. Basirul Alam told reporters, "The agitated workers attacked police on the DEPZ premises Friday. A total of 20 policemen were injured. The case has been filed on charges of obstructing government work." Investigating officer sub-inspector Mazharul Islam said the accused Ilias Miah and Moniruzzaman were arrested in the DEPZ area at 10pm Friday. Besides, another worker of the factory, Adam Ali, was arrested in Baipail area Saturday. On the non-filing of any case in connection with the ransacking of the factories, Ashulia police chief Kamrul Islam said: "No owner of the affected factories filed any case." He said the police were searching for a quality inspector of the Feather Light factory, Firoz Ahmed, who allegedly was the first person to spread the rumour of a worker being killed. BEPZA general manager Shamsul Haque told reporters Saturday: "The DEPZ situation is now under control. Production in all factories, excluding three, is normal." The closed factories are: Feather Light Ltd and Ring Shine in the new zone and Padax Jeans Ltd in the old zone. The BEPZA official said the Feather Light Ltd and Padax Jeans Ltd remained closed following the attack and ransacking. Ring Shine factory had been closed earlier following labour unrest. On a visit to the DEPZ Saturday morning, an uneasy calm was found prevailing in the area. RAB, police and army members were patrolling the area. Tofail Hossain, administrative officer of Feather Light, told bdnews24.com: "Our factory has been closed for an indefinite period." He said that there was no truth in the rumour of the killing of worker Helal. He however said: "Attempts are on to find Helal." LENNY FASHION In a statement to bdnews24.com, authorities of Lenny Fashion said that the activities in the factory were not hampered by Friday's clashes. "However, some windowpanes were broken when 20 to 30 unruly people hurled brickbats at the factory. They could not enter the factory because the security guards were active. The production in the factory went on unhampered," the statement said. bdnews24.com mistakenly reported Friday that authorities shut down Lenny Fashion in the wake of the violence. bdnews2
