 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Energy and power adviser Tapan Chowdhury Thursday said the country needed to decide soon about its energy resources. "The experts have to give specific opinion on whether we will mine or import coal and if we go for mining, in what process we'll do it." "We see potentials of generating atomic energy," Tapan said at a roundtable titled 'Energy Efficiency: Third Fuel for Bangladesh' organised at the CIRDAP auditorium by an energy-related magazine, Energy and Power. "We have around 13.5 trillion TCF gas in reserves now. We are using 16,000 million TCF gas per day for generating power, running fertiliser factories, vehicles and doing household chores. "Our gas fields are not being maintained properly and these fields are losing their productivity. If the situation continues, we will face a gas crisis in a few years. "We have to be economic in using fuel from now and we have to think about alternative fuel," the adviser observed. "The government needs subject expert's specific and clear-cut recommendations in this regard. I won't go into any controversies over coal. However, we do have good quality coal," he said. "We'll need around 6000 MW (megawatt) power by 2012. The government is thinking of introducing and popularising energy-saving bulbs to save power." Senior adviser to German Technology Assistance Organisation, Khursheed Ul-Islam presented the keynote paper in the seminar moderated by magazine editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain and Dr Izaz Hossain and Dr S Shahnewaz Ahmed of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology also spoke. "Energy-saving bulb is economical. The government will have to allow duty-free import of bulb and provide low-interest loan to set up bulb industry so that more and more people are encouraged to buy and use it," Mir Nasir said. The keynote paper said widespread use of energy-saving bulb in households, businesses and industries could help save power. bdnews24.com
