 Dhaka, September 12 (bdnews24.com) A High Court verdict Wednesday declared the detention of former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed illegal and asked the government to release him immediately if no other cases were filed against him. A two-judge HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubair Rahman Chowdhury gave the verdict after hearing a writ petition filed by Moudud's relative Md Amir Hossain. Moudud's counsel barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokon told bdnews24.com that there was no barrier to Moudud being released now after the verdict. He said the HC granted Moudud bail on Aug 18 in the narcotics case filed against him. Although the government filed an appeal against the bail order with the Appellate Division, no stay order has yet been issued. "It means there is an opportunity of his freedom," he said. Joint forces arrested Moudud at his home on April 12 and the government placed him in a 30-day detention on July 5, which was extended to 90 days. Barristers Rafique-ul Haque and Mahbub Uddin Khokon took part in the hearing on the writ petition filed against their client's detention. The same HC bench declared the arrest order of former BNP lawmaker Jainul Abedin Faruque and asked the government to release him if there was no other case filed against him. The court issued the order after reviewing the writ petition filed by Faruque's daughter Tamanna Faruque. Faruque was detained on May 25 and placed in a 30-day detention on July 9, which was extended to 90 days. Barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokon took part in the hearing representing Faruque. bdnews24
