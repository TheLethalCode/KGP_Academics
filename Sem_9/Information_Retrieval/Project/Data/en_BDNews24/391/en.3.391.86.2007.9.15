 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com)  The United States has asked Bangladesh to crack down on two pirate CD manufacturers it has accused of causing huge losses to some of its domestic producers. "The Bangladesh government has taken the issue seriously and decided to crack down on the two CD companies," a commerce ministry official said Saturday The US previously expressed its concern over the lax implementation of copyright regulations in its 2007 Special 301 Report and at World Trade Organisation discussions. The US has accused two CD manufacturers, World Com Ltd and Sonic Enterprise Ltd, located in Tejgaon Industrial Area and Konabari of Gazipur respectively, of unchecked CD piracy. The commerce ministry official, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com: "Of the two companies, one is of Pakistan origin and registered with the Board of Investment." "Copyrights rules are now very strong in Pakistan and that's why the company shifted to Bangladesh. We've asked the BoI to take appropriate action," he added. Golam Mostakim, additional secretary of the commerce ministry, told bdnews24.com: "The cultural affairs ministry is the right authority to take action against CD piracy that violates intellectual property rights." "We've requested the cultural affairs ministry to sit with the home ministry so that immediate action can be taken against those responsible," Mostakim said. Cultural affairs secretary ABM Abdul Howk Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that his ministry moved to take action against the two pirate CD makers. "We've already advertised in the media, discourgaing CD piracy," Chowdhury said. The US government's 2007 Special 301 Report included Bangladesh in its 'watch list' for copyright violations despite Bangladesh enjoying a waiver in the application of WTO copyright rules until 2013, as a least-developed country. "The US decision to put Bangladesh on its watch list was prompted by rising piracy in CDs and books," said a commerce ministry document, adding, "The inclusion may be of concern to Bangladesh because it discourages US investment, trade and commerce here." The 2007 Special 301 Report provides the US government with an effective arsenal of trade and investment sanctions against foreign countries that it deems to have infringed its intellectual property rights. According to commerce ministry officials, Bangladesh was previously included in the watch list for 2004, although the efforts of the Bangladesh mission in Washington resulted in its subsequent exclusion until now. Registrar of copyrights MA Shah Mahmudul Hasan said his office had already served notices on the two companies. Both denied the allegations, he said. "We have requested the home ministry to conduct an investigation," Hasan told bdnews24.com. bdnew
