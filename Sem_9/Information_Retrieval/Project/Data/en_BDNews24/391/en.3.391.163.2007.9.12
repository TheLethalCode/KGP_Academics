 Chittagong, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  Engineers and firemen put out a Bakhrabad gas pipeline fire in Chittagong late Tuesday night after hours of struggle, an engineer said. The gas transmission pipeline running through the Karnaphuli River caught fire in an area of 25 industrial and two residential units. Bakhrabad engineer Mohammad Nahid told bdnews24.com that the fire was dowsed sometime between 11:35pm and 11:40pm. Earlier, energy secretary AMM Nasiruddin had told bdnews24.com that officials rushed to the spot, while authorities shut the main transmission line in a bid to stop the raging fire. Witnesses said the supply line from Bakhrabad gas field to several industrial units exploded into sudden flames at around 8:30pm. The site of the incident is half a kilometre off the Kalurghat Bridge over the Karnaphuli river which flows past the port city of Chittagong. Jamil Uddin, a witness to the incident, said he saw the flames "leap up to a height of 500 feet". Two hours later, bdnews24.com correspondent Ruhul Amin Rana saw the flames still reaching as high as 150 feet. The fire lit up the skies and created panic in the neighbourhood. The roads on both sides of the river were jammed with traffic as hundreds of people rushed out of their homes. The trigger for the fire could not be ascertained immediately, but an engineer told bdnews24.com that there were "some faults with the pipeline". Officials with the regional office in Chittagong of Bakhrabad Gas Systems Limited, a company owned by Petrobangla, said engineers had struggled for hours to control the fire. bdnews2
