 Cape Town, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  A no-nonsense Australia thrashed Bangladesh by nine wickets in the second Super Eights match of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup at Newlands Sunday. The Aussies raced to 124 for one with 37 balls left after restricting Bangladesh to 123 for eight in 20 overs. Opener Matthew Hayden cracked an unbeaten 73 off 48 balls and put on 104 runs with his partner Adam Gilchrist, who 43 off 28 deliveries before being run out in the 12th over. Earlier, Man of the Match Brett Lee struck the first hattrick in Twenty20 internationals to stop a slow-going Bangladesh from breaking away . It was a complete reversal to the aggressive display Bangladesh had put against hosts South Africa Saturday. Lee first had Saqib Al Hasan caught behind Adam Gilchrist in 16.3 overs, then yorked Mashrafee Bin Mortaza before trapping Alok Kapali leg before to reduce the Tigers to 108 for six. Bangladesh batted more cautiously than they did in losing to South Africa at the same venue on Saturday, but they again failed to mount a challenging total. Their biggest partnership was the 40 runs shared by openers Mohammad Nazimuddin, who made 11, and Tamim Iqbal, who top scored with 32. Nazimuddin (11 off 17 balls) drove Mitchell Johnson to Ricky Ponting, who got the Bangladesh opener at his second attempt. Tamim topscored with an uncharacteristic 32 off 40 balls clubbing three fours. He tried to loft Michael Clark down the ground, but found Ricky Ponting at cover to leave the side at 65 for two in 10.5 overs. Aftab Ahmed fell one run short of Tamim in his 34-ball knocked laced with two fours. Saqib Al Hasan and Mohammad Ashraful chipped in with 16 and seven. Bangladesh and Australia pinned their hopes on the same teams that played their last group matches against South Africa and England. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Nazimuddin, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful, Saqib Al Hasan, Alok Kapali, Farhad Reza, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mashrafe Mortaza, Syed Rasel and Abdur Razzak. Australia squad: Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting, Andrew Symonds, Mike Hussey, Brad Hodge, Michael Clarke, Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken and Stuart Clark bd
