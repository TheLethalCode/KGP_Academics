<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  A so-called reformist group of the troubled BNP Saturday came down heavily on "corrupt" leaders and branded chairperson Khaleda Zia as dishonest. They backed Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan on his leadership for the crumbling party. The support for the recently expelled secretary general came from a crucial meeting, held Saturday to hammer out a policy that would hold the troubled party together. Bhuiyan chaired the meeting at the Elegant Community Centre in Gulshan. BNP's office secretary Mofiqul Hasan Tripti said approximately 130 activists are now backing the reformists' agenda. Tripti told bdnews24.com: "We are holding this meeting after receiving written permission from the police commissioner." "All members of the party's executive committee are attending," he said. A rift in the party deepened when Khaleda expelled Bhuiyan from the party prior to her detention on Sept 3. Khandaker Delwar Hossain was appointed in his place. Former lawmaker Zahiruddin Swapan said: "Corrupt practices done in the name of the party in the past are no longer acceptable. The party has to change." Former lawmaker Anwarul Azim said: "We plunged into this crisis because the party leadership was corrupt in the past." "This would not have happened if our prime minister had been honest. We now want honest leadership." "Let Khaleda Zia say she was not corrupt and let her accept her mistakes. Then we will accept her leadership," he said. Former lawmaker SS Sultan Titu added: "Everyone knew that Khaleda Zia would have to go to jail. There are many questions centring on her." "However, before going to jail she expelled an honest secretary general which is not acceptable. There is no question over the honesty and patriotism of Mannan Bhuiyan." More than 100 workers from pro-reform elements in the Chhatra Dal, Jubo Dal and city unit of the BNP congregated outside the community centre. bdnews24.co
