<TITLE> Politicians will figure high on next graft list: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday said politicians would dominate the next list of corruption suspects. "I think most names will be of politicians on the next list of corruption suspects. There are chances of having fewer businessmen on the list," he told reporters at the housing and public works ministry that he also heads. "Now the government wants to strengthen the economy. The businessmen are being assured (by the government of cooperation) so that economy does not suffer and they are being requested to invest more." Mainul said the construction sector was not responding to the government initiative to inject impetus. "As many as 1,6203 designs were submitted to Rajuk for approval until December 2006. Of them 1,4257 designs were approved and 423 were of construction firms," he said, adding unapproved designs had been sent back for correction. Earlier, one had to hop to 18 branches to get a design approved, but with the introduction of the one-stop service centre, approval can be taken from the desk where the design was submitted, he said. "Those who have undeclared money can invest after paying income tax. The government has assured the businessmen of cooperation on this issue," Mainul said. bdnews24.
