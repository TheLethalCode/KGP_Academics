 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested Shibly Biswas, son of former Jatiya Party lawmaker Abdul Gaffar Biswas, on unclear charges in Khulna Saturday. Shibly, 38, was taken into custody for interrogation after he was arrested on his way home from Dhaka, assistant commissioner of Khulna Metropolitan Police Idris Ali Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com by phone. Acting on a tip-off, the police team arrested Shibly when he arrived near Rupsha Bridge in a car at 8:30pm. Bhuiyan did not specify the charges against Shibly but said the arrest was made after the police extracted "important intelligence" from his younger brother Sohel Biswas, who was arrested Friday.
