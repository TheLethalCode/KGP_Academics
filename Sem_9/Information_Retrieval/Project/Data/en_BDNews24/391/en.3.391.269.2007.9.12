 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will look to hunt down the wounded West Indies in their group opener of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup at New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg Thursday. ESPN will telecast the match live at 2:00pm BdST (Bangladesh standard time). The Tigers would try to win the tie to secure a second-round berth. The Caribbeans, on the other hand, would push hard for a victory in their group last match to avoid a premature exit. They lost to hosts South Africa Tuesday despite scoring 205 in the tournament opener thanks to a Chris Gayle storm. The West Indies are one of three cricketing nations Bangladesh are yet to defeat on either one-day or Test. But Bangladesh have already proved their potential, storming into second round of the last edition of the World Cup in the West Indies, and stunning favourites India and South Africa. Bangladesh geared up to get in shape for the newest version of cricket by playing a four-nation tournament in Kenya before going to South Africa. Banking on young cricketers led by Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh can fancy their chances of finally taming the West Indies in the unpredictable game if their opening duo of Tamim Iqbal and wonder-boy Nazimuddin can fire on all cylinders to give them a solid start. Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak and Alok Kapali have the ability to make things happen. The Tigers, however, must contain Gayle, who took the aerial route to make a thunderous 117 off 57 balls with record 10 sixes and seven fours. bd
