<TEXT>
 Savar, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Agitated workers Friday went on the rampage in the Savar Export Processing Zones (EPZ), blockading a key road and clashing with the police leaving at least 50 people injured. The labour unrest forced traffic on Nabinagar-Kaliakoir road to screech to a halt for about four hours before midday. The clash was triggered by a "rumour" Thursday that a worker of garment factory Feather Light, owned by former state minister Iqbal Hasan Mahmud in the exclusive trade territory's new zone, died. The workers claimed the henchmen of the owners killed the worker named Helal. But police and factory authorities said the news of the death was nothing more than a rumour. Helal, however, remained untraced Friday. Workers Momin, Kamal and Shahin said Helal had a facas on cell phone with Sujon, an official of the factory at around 11am Thursday. Helal went missing after 5pm, leading the workers to believe he had been killed. As the word flew around that some workers had seen the body in the bathroom of the factory before the authorities had hidden it, the workers became agitated and attacked the factory. The authorities claimed Helal was alive and the workers asked them to bring him before them by Friday morning. About 3,000 workers gathered at the main gate of the EPZ's new zone at around 7am and started shouting for Helal. They put up barricades on the road and stopped traffic movement on Nabinagar-Kaliakoir road. They stopped workers of other factories entering the EPZ and were soon joined by workers of other factories. Finally, some 5,000 workers proceeded to the old zone of the EPZ in a procession. Security workers obstructed the demonstrators when they tried to enter the old zone but had their offices attacked and ransacked. The workers also ransacked Honour Way, Lenny Fashion, Padax Jeans, Actors Sporting factory, Dutch Bangla Bank and some other buildings at the EPZ gate. They also smashed at least 10 vehicles and stopped traffic. The police and joint forces rushed to the spot and the law-enforcers fired tear gas canisters to disperse the workers. The workers threw brickbats at the police and at least 50 workers including Shafiqul, Bilkis, Kamrul, Delwar, Kamal, Jharna, Mizan, Khairul, Iti, Sufia and Anil were injured. At about 10:30am police reinforcements were rushed to the spot and the workers retreated. Traffic began to move on the road at 11am. Authorities shut down Honour Way, Lenny Fashion, Padax Jeans, Actors Sporting and Feather Light factory after the violence. BEPZA chairman Ashraf Abdullah Yusuf, who went to the scene at about 10:30am, told journalists, "The incident of killing was a rumour. An evil quarter is trying to fan labour unrest by spreading rumour." The BEPZA chairman however said he did not know of whereabouts of Helal, the missing worker. "We are trying to find him out." Administrative officer of Feather Light factory Tofail Hossain told journalists the factory authorities had announced reward for anyone who could have information on Helal's whereabouts. Officer-in-charge of Ashulia Police Station Kamrul Islam also dismissed the allegation of killing of a worker as rumour. "A quarter is trying to destabilise the situation by spreading rumour," he told bdnews24.com at midday. He said the situation was calm now. No case had been filed in connection with the incident of ransacking, he said and added that action would be taken if anybody made an allegation. bdnews2
