 Narayanganj, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) -- More than 300 dyeing factories in Narayanganj went out of production Saturday, hit by the ever-increasing rises in the prices of chemicals. The export-oriented knitwear industry will be adversely affected, industry insiders said. Waheduzzaman, president of the dyeing factory owners association, said the prices of chemicals, an essential raw material of the dyeing factories, is being increased hourly by creating an artificial crisis in the market. "In this situation, it's impossible for us to run the factories. Production in more than 300 dyeing factories in Narayanganj stopped Saturday alone." "The factories still running may close any time soon. If the dyeing factories are closed, the export-oriented knitwear industry has to bear the brunt of it," he said. Waheduzzaman urged the government to take urgent measures to save the dyeing industry from collapse. "We have already informed the deputy commissioner for Narayanganj about the matter," he added. Mohiuddin Milon, general manager of NRG Knit Composite Ltd, a dyeing subsidiary of knitwear exporting firm NR Group, in Fatullah, said that there were instances of the prices of chemicals increasing three times in a day. He said the main raw materials of dyeing factories were soda and salt. He said 12 days ago the prices of a tonne of soda was Tk 24,000, which rose to Tk 65,000 after several hikes. The prices of soda increased to Tk 65,000 from Tk 55,000. The prices of Globe salt increased Tk 2,000 a tonne. A drum of 40kg bleaching powder rose to Tk 5,000 from Tk 2,900 about 15 days ago. The prices of sulphur rose to Tk 51 per pound from Tk 42 over the week. Factory owners are facing a serious crisis due to "unabated price hikes of chemicals". He said his factory might be closed any time if the prices of chemicals continued to rise unchecked. Most export-oriented knitwear industries are located in Narayanganj. About 30,000 workers are employed in about 400 big and small dyeing factories, the backward linkage industry of the knitwear industry, in Narayanganj. bdnews2
