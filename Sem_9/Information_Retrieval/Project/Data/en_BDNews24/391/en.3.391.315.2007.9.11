<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  An explosive unbeaten 90 by Herschelle Gibbs Wednesday eclipsed a thunderous 117 off just 57 deliveries by Chris Gayle to propel hosts South Africa to a convincing eight-wicket win over the West Indies on the inaugural match of the Twenty20 World Cup New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesberg. Gibbs and Justin Kemp (46 off 22 balls), both dropped, smashed 120 runs in just 9.3 overs for the unbroken third wicket to steer the Proteas to 208 for 2 with 14 balls to go. West Indies opener Chris Gayle smashed a record 10 sixes and seven boundaries to fire the Caribbeans to a challenging 205 for six in 20 overs. Opener Gibbs, dropped on 31 by Chanderpaul, creamed the runs off only 55 balls, cracking 14 fours and two sixes. Kemp, dropped on 13 by Samuels, struck five fours and two sixes. Gibbs put on 54 runs with opener Graeme Smith (28 off 21 balls) and another 34 runs with AB de Villiers (16 off nine balls). Put in to bat first, Gayle blazed maiden Twenty20 hundred to take the West Indies to a strong position. Except for Johan van der Wath, Gayle punished all South African bowlers to make before being caught behind Mark Boucher off van der Wath. The devastating left-handed opener, who welcomed Shaun Pollock with a first-ball four, reached fifty in 26 balls with the help of four sixes and three fours. He raced to the second fifty in just 24 balls hitting five sixes and one four to complete the maiden Twenty20 hundred in history. The 27-year old batsman, who sent Pollock over the rope for highest four times, smacked a total of 10 sixes and seven fours. Gayle and Devon Smith proved Proteas skipper Graeme Smith's decision to put them in to bat wrong, whacking record 145 runs for any wicket in 13.3 overs. Vernon Philander finally broke the stand having Devon Smith caught behind by Boucher for a 34-ball 35. Pollock was the most expensive bowler with 52 runs in four overs, with Gayle milking him for 45 runs from just 19 deliveries. Van der Wath was the most successful South African bowler with 33 for two wickets in four overs. South Africa: Graeme Smith, Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Justin Kemp, Shaun Pollock, Albie Morkel, Johan van der Wath, Vernon Philander, Makhaya Ntini and Morne Morkel. West Indies: Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Marlon Samuels, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin, Devon Smith, Daren Powell, Ravi Rampaul and Fidel Edwards. bd
