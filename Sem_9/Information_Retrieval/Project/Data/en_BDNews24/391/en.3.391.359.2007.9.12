 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced DCC ward commissioner Chowdhury Alam and wife Hasina Chowdhury to 10 years in prison in another extortion case. Judge Md Amanullah of Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judges' Court-4 for Dhaka also fined them Tk 10,000 and said they have to serve six more months in failure of payment. On February 22, Alam turned himself in to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. The court ordered him into jail the same day. His wife is on the run. According to case details, Alam and his associates demanded Tk 50 lakh in toll on March 11, 2003 from ASM Alauddin, managing director of Western Engineering Limited, a company assigned to construct a building for Bangladesh Freedom Fighters' Welfare Trust in Gulistan. They allegedly threatened to stop work on parts of the building if the money was not paid. The construction work, however, did not finish on the face of their hindrance. On Nov 24, 2004, Alam and 10 to 12 persons came to the construction firm and pressed Alauddin to allocate a shop in his wife's name and took away Tk 15 lakh. Alauddin signed an allocation paper and handed it to Alam. On April 4, 2007, he filed a case with Paltan Police Station against Alam and his wife. On August 29, Alam was awarded 10 years in jail in an extortion case. bdnews24.co
