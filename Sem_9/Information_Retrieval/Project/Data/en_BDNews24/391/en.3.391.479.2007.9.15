 DURBAN, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India beat Pakistan 3-0 in a dramatic five-ball bowl-out at three stumps after their Twenty20 World Cup match ended in a tie on Friday. Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa hit the stumps in the bowl-out while Pakistan trio Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul and Shahid Afridi all missed. "We practice the bowl-out at each training session and the guys we chose were the ones who bowled the best in practice," India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told reporters. "It's very different, and amusing, to win a cricket match 3-0 but I don't think a bowl-out is the best way to decide a match." Earlier, Uthappa top-scored with 50 as India totalled 141 for nine after being put in to bat. Paceman Mohammad Asif took four for 18 to reduce India to 36 for four before Uthappa and Mahendra Singh Dhoni steadied the innings with a fifth-wicket stand of 46. Fast bowler Arafat had Dhoni caught for 33 by Younis Khan at long-off in the last over. Pakistan's reply faltered when they lost three wickets for three runs to slip to 47 for four in the ninth over. Misbah-ul-Haq (53) hauled his team back into the match before being run out off the final ball as Pakistan finished on 141 for seven. Despite their defeat, Pakistan will join India in the Super Eights second round stage. "When you play against India and lose, it hurts," said Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik. "But we didn't lose in 20 overs, we lost in a bowl-out, and I'm satisfied with the way the team performed.
