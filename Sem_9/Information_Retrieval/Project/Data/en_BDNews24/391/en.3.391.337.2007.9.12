 LONDON, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain found a suspected case of foot and mouth disease on a farm in southern England on Wednesday and immediately imposed an exclusion zone and had the herd in question culled. A statement on the agriculture ministry's Web site said an exclusion zone had been placed around the suspect farm in Egham, Surrey, around 30 miles (50 km) from the scene of the last outbreak in August. A government source told Reuters officials were determined to act quickly as farmers leaders warned that Britain's agriculture industry would be "devastated" if the case were confirmed. "We are not taking any risks," the source said. Britain suffered a crippling outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001 when more than six million animals had to be culled. The outbreak hit agriculture and tourism hard, costing the economy an estimated 8.5 billion pounds ($17 billion). Prime Minister Gordon Brown's official spokesman said the government would impose a nationwide ban on the movement of livestock if tests on Wednesday confirmed a fresh outbreak. He said test results were expected on Wednesday afternoon and the government's emergency committee Cobra would meet at around 5pm local time (1600 GMT). The new suspected case comes less than 24 hours after European Union veterinary experts had agreed to declare Britain free of foot and mouth disease (FMD) from Nov. 9 and lift a ban on all exports of British meat, dairy and live animals which was imposed after FMD was found on two farms in Surrey in July and August. That decision was immediately suspended on Wednesday as news of the new suspected case broke. A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said they viewed the news with "extreme concern". The NFU's president went further, saying: "This is an absolute disaster." "If it is confirmed, it puts us back to where we were on Aug. 3," he told BBC television. "If the worst outcome is confirmed then the farming industry will be devastated." An investigation into the July/August FMD outbreak highlighted biosecurity breaches at a nearby government-funded laboratory, the Institute of Animal Health. Britain's Health and Safety Executive issued a separate report in which it said it was "highly likely" that the virus entered a drainage system shared by IAH and another commercially owned research laboratory on the same si
