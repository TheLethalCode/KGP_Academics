 DURBAN, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mark Gillespie spearheaded New Zealand's nine-wicket demolition of Kenya in the second match of the Twenty20 World Cup in Durban on Wednesday. The paceman took four wickets for seven runs in 2.5 overs as Kenya, who were put in to bat on a responsive pitch, were dismissed for a record low of 73 in 16.5 overs. The total is six runs fewer than the previous record held by Australia in a match against England two years ago. New Zealand replied with 74 for one in 7.4 overs, Lou Vincent top scoring with 27. New-ball pair Shane Bond and Gillespie got New Zealand off to a perfect start by reducing the Kenyans to 1-4 from the first 11 balls of the match. Collins Obuya and Thomas Odoyo, who each scored 18, stabilised the innings with a stand of 36 for the fifth wicket.
