<TITLE> Voter ID card project runs into a hitch </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor DHAKA, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  The voter ID card project is bracing for delays after what appears to be the first major irregularity detected in public procurement since the current caretakers took over. The Election Commission needs 8,000 laptop computers for the project and so solicited bids way back in June. The lowest bidder did not get the work order, kicking off trouble. The EC thought it appropriate to award the deal to the second lowest bidder, which came more than one million dollars costlier, according to documents obtained by bdnews24.com. Acting on a formal complaint from the lowest bidder, the government's procurement watchdog has ruled that the EC decision flouted guidelines. A second round of bidding has since been ordered, fuelling fears of delay in getting the voters listed. But the project's new head says he is not worried. Of the eight offers received, only two were initially found responsive when bids came in response to the June 7 tender. Thakral Information Systems offered Lenovo (formerly IBM) laptops at $5,529,800 while Telecommunication Consultants India (TCIL) quoted $6,644,728 for Dell laptops. The Election Commission chose TCIL's Dell, $1,114,928 (Tk 7.8 crore) costlier than Thakral's Lenovo. The commission's bid evaluators declared Thakral non-responsive bypassing the rule, making TCIL the only bidder in the country's largest ever personal computer procurement. Takral formally lodged complaint with the Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), of the planning ministry, which enforces the public procurement regulation (PPR-2003). The CPTU formed a three-member review panel headed by a former additional law secretary, Abdul Matin, on August 28. The PWD's former additional chief engineer Emdadul Haque and the FBCCI's representative Kamaluddin Ahmed were the other members. The review panel found the Election Commission's favourite Dell laptop "does not fulfil the requirement of the technical specification" in the first place. In its report, the review panel observed the Election Commission's belated decision of making Thakral's bid with Lenovo laptops non-responsive was "a violation of the provisions of PPR-2003". "The decision for assessing responsiveness of the tender offer by EC should have been taken after examination of all papers and sample laptop," it said. Adding another twist to the saga, the review panel suggested the Election Commission go for retender. "Mysterious indeed," said a planning ministry official, refusing to be named. A note of dissent came from none other than the panel chairman himself. "It is not wise to put any suggestion to the Election Commission," said Abdul Matin, the former judge who later worked as additional secretary at the law ministry. He seemed to have many good reasons to differ. His other two colleagues in the panel "came to know that any single manufacturer cannot manufacture and supply 8000 laptops in 4 weeks time". In the report, they speculated: "Successful bidder may manufacture those computers in different factories of different companies. In that case it will be difficult to maintain uniform qualities." "But the panel members have not attributed to the source of such absurd findings," said another planning ministry official, preferring anonymity. Yet the two panel members have advised the Election Commission to "consider dividing the supply in four groups (2000 laptops in each group)" while re-tendering. This means it will quadruple the bid evaluation period. The commission has already lost invaluable four months in the now-scandalous process to procure the 8,000 laptops. No wonder the red-faced commission has reconstituted the voter ID project team. A military officer, Brigadier General Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury, has joined as the new project director. Visibly uncomfortable with his predecessor's scandalous legacy, this signal corps officer is rather keen to look forward. "The voter ID project will be timely completed and we are fully committed to it," Brigadier General Chowdhury told bdnews24.com in his office Thursday. But how will the Election Commission maintain the voter ID schedule while complying with the CPTU review panel's decision to retender? He seems to have an answer but is reluctant to reveal that at this stage. "Everything will be done on time as well as strictly in compliance with the law," says the brigadier general. bdn
