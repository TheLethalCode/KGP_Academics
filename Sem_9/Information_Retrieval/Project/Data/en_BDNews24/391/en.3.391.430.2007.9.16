 Cape Town, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh conceded a seven-wicket defeat to South Africa in the Group A match of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup at Newlands, Saturday. Opener Graeme Smith and one-down Albie Morkel struck identical 41 to steer their side home to score 146 for three with seven balls to go after restricting Bangladesh to 144 all out in 19.3 overs. Smith put on 65 runs with JP Duminy (36 off 28 balls) and added another 33 runs for the second wicket before the Proteas skipper was the second man out to leave the side at 108 for two in 13.4 overs. Smith was caught behind off Sakib Al Hasan for 41 off 34 balls smashing six fours. Earlier, opener JP Duminy (36 off 28 balls) was trapped by Abdur Razzak, who also removed Morkel to finish with two for 26 in four overs. Morkel scored a 29-ball 41 with the help of two sixes and three fours. Bangladeshi bowlers bowled tightly, but that was not enough to defend the total. Put in to bat first, Bangladesh made a brilliant start, but struggled to keep the momentum to slump to below 150 against some brilliance fielding by JP Duminy, who drove from extra cover to run out Sakib Al Hasan and backpedalled to take Masharafe Mortaza spectacularly. Aftab Ahmed topscored with 36 off 14 balls, smashing two sixes and five fours before he was bowled by Morne Morkel to leave the side to 58 for four in 4.2 overs. Opener Tamim Iqbal welcomed Shaun Pollock for two successive fours in the first over, but fell to the same bowler in the first delivery of Pollock's second over for a seven-ball eight. Makhaya Ntini stuck struck with his first ball, trapping Nazimuddin for a first-ball duck, but was then hoisted for two sixes as Aftab Ahmed stepped down the track fearlessly. Bangladeshi batsmen took the aerial route to accelerate the run, and six batsmen were out for catches. Sakib Al Hasan and Farhad Reza chipped in with 19 runs each. Pollock was the pick of the attack with three for 40 in 3.3 overs, while Morkel and Vernon Philander grabbed two wickets each for 21 and 23 in their four-over spells. bd
