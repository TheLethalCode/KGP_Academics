<TITLE> Neither WB nor IMF told us to close jute mills: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has categorically denied involvement of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in the government's closure of state-run jute mills. "Swear on God, neither the World Bank nor the IMF has uttered a word to close down any jute mill," the adviser said Thursday at a seminar on "Producers, Traders and Consumers" related to price and policy issues. Civil society, politicians and economists have been criticising the caretaker government for the recent closures in the state-run mill sector, which have left thousands of workers unemployed. "There is a limit to government subsidies. Some Tk 7,900 crore has been injected to these jute mills since 1992," said a heated Azizul. "[This government] has given Tk 300 crore as subsidy." He said the critics that have made comments against the closure of the jute mills are "live in a wonderland". Peoples Jute Mills Ltd, Crescent Jute Mills and Star Jute Mills Ltd were closed on April 19, 2007, within three months of the present caretaker government taking charge. The adviser was addressing a seminar based on the findings of a triangular study, conducted by a private organisation Power and Participation Research Centre in support with Katalyst. The PPRC study finds a clear lack in coordination between demand and supply and structural weaknesses in the market that prompt inflation. The study also says intermediaries in the system are poor. Speakers at the seminar said although the study covers three vital areasproducers, traders and consumersin identifying the problems for the continued price hikes in the local market, it fails to mention importers, a key player in the today's market. They also asked the government to undertake policy interventions to encourage farmers in crop diversification to meet market demands. Agriculture adviser CS Karim, who also addressed the seminar, said the country lacks proper data on demand of food grains and other essentials. "Accurate estimations will help us in designing future crop patterns," Karim told the seminar. A number of speakers also reiterated recent demands to appreciate the taka against the US dollar to counter the spiralling prices and inflationary pressure. Responding to the suggestion, the adviser said the move could affect Bangladesh in three areasexport, trade gap and remittance. "The exchange rate theory tells us that an improvement of taka value should help prices to go down," Azizul said. "But will this actually happen?" he asked, citing an example. "Date exporters in Saudi Arab increased their price soon after we withdrew the import duty of the item prior to Ramadan." bdne
