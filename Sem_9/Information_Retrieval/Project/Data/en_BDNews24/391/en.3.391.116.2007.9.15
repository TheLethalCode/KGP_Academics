 Kingsmead, Durban, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com) - India Saturday beat Pakistan 3-0 in a bowl-out and booked their berth in the Super Eights after their World Twenty20 match ended in a thrilling tie. Pakistan, who also had qualified, needed one to win off the last ball but Misbah-ul-Haq (53) was run out and the game spilled into a bowl-out. India's first three bowlers of Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa hit the stumps but Pakistan's Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul and Shahid Afridi missed. India were in tatters after pacer Mohammad Asif took four wickets for just 18 runs in a superb spell. But Uthappa brought the Indians back to game with a fine 50 that helped them post 141 for 9. Asif justified Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik's decision to put their arch-rivals in by holding a superb return catch to dismiss Gautam Gambhir for a duck off the match's third ball. He then had Sehwag play on to his stumps in his next over, induced Yuvraj Singh to give a catch at mid-on in his third over and finished by bowling Dinesh Karthik in his final over. Uthappa hit Yasir Arafat for two magnificent sixes, but Sohail Tanvir had Uthappa caught behind soon after to leave matters to Dhoni. Left-hander Irfan Pathan hit leg-spinner Shahid Afridi on to the roof of the main stand and spanked another booming six off the next delivery. But Afridi bowled him for 20 off 15 balls in a three-ball spell which encapsulated all the excitement of Twenty20 cricket. A third, brief rain delay interrupted the thrilling entertainment just as Dhoni seemed to be getting into his stride. Afridi bowled Harbhajan Singh almost immediately after the resumption and Umar Gul dismissed dangerman Dhoni when the Indian captain mis-timed a slower delivery high into the floodlit sky. Ajit Agarkar's 14 at the death helped India push up the total as they sought to ensure their run-rate remains high enough to eliminate Scotland - even if they lose. RP Singh took out Imran Nazir's leg stump in his second over but Pakistan seemed intent on going for a quick victory to knock their arch-rivals out of the tournament. Wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal, promoted up the order, blasted a six and a four to set pulses racing. But Salman Butt struggled to score to the required rate and was caught by Dhoni off Agarkar for a sluggish 17 off 25 balls. Yuvraj swooped to run out Akmal after a mix-up and Pathan bowled Younus, and all of a sudden India were scenting victory as Pakistan lost three wickets for three runs. Malik and Misbah-ul-Haq put on 40 for the fifth wicket before Harbhajan Singh removed the skipper but not even the belligerent Afridi could rescue Pakistan. Agarkar dropped Afridi from a towering straight whack but Dinesh Karthik held another high chance off a Harbhajan full toss to dismiss the big-hitter for seven. Misbah blasted a big six and a four to leave Pakistan needing 29 from the final two overs. Misbah and Yasir Arafat hit 17 off the penultimate over and only 12 were needed off the last six balls. The Indian duo got the scores level but could not manage a run off the last ball as Sree Santh bowled a tight line and the bowler even managed to run Misbah out. In the bowl-out Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa all hit the leg-stump while Pakistan's Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul and Shahid Afridi all missed.
