 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur has warned that the repeated incidents of labour unrest among Bangladeshi workers in the Malaysian capital may hamper manpower exports to Malaysia. The high commission made the observation in a recent report to the expatriates welfare and overseas employment ministry, as a number of Bangladeshi workers have continued their hunger strikes in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur to realise their labour demands. The demands include the repayment of the money they paid to their recruiting agents and payment of six months worth of unpaid wages. In the meantime, the high commission has sent some workers back to Bangladesh. "Owing to the non-cooperative attitude of some Bangladeshi workers, the high commission in Kuala Lumpur with the help of the Malaysian government, has deported them to Bangladesh," the expatriates welfare and overseas employment ministry said in a statement Thursday. The ministry said the high commission had offered the protesting workers 1,000 Malaysian Ringit as compensation and temporary employment them with some companies. However, some workers refused to accept the offer and continued their hunger strike, the press release said. Overseas employment adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury had earlier instructed the high commission to settle the labour unrest in Kuala Lumpur after a television channel and newspapers reports had recently highlighted the plight of Bangladeshi labourers in Malaysia. The ministry said a high-powered three-member committee, headed by the expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary, will visit Kuala Lumpur next week to recommend ways to stop a repeat of employers and their agencies cheating overseas workers
