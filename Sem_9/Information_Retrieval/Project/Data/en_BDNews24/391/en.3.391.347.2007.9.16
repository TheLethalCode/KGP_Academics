<TITLE> Tigers ready to take the Aussies on </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Tigers, oozing confidence, run into a shored-up Australia in the Super Eights game at 6pm BdST Sunday at Newlands, Capetown with everything to play for. Mohammad Asharul and Co would not read too much into the loss against hosts South Africa in the last group stages match Saturday where the batsmen showed raw aggression probably to see how it came off against a top bowling side. They went for an allout attack and toyed with a few batting options before the crucial tie against the Aussies who have more variety in their bowling than the Proteas'. Bangladesh lost the game by seven wickets with three balls left but they would be far from losing heart in the inconsequential game. The free-scoring Tigers will need to keep the momentum if they get a good start in batting. The opening duo of Nazimuddin, who failed to score in both games, and Tamim Iqbal, who made promising starts before falling, are a worry. Both need to put some runs on the board to ease pressure on the middle order. Aftab Ahmed who topscored with 36 against the hosts looks to be in fine fettle and Ashraful would look forward to unsettle the Aussie bowlers, who bowled against English bowlers with renewed purpose, with his trademark cheeky shots.  "We have three games in the Super Eight and I think all of us can do well," Ashraful said. Australia captain Ricky Ponting was quoted as saying ahead of the game that they could not afford to turn in another below-par display if they were going to be crowned World Twenty20 champions. Australia were shocked by Zimbabwe on Wednesday, before recovering to thrash England by eight wickets on Friday. "If we're not at our absolute best in this format, everyone is a bit vulnerable. We showed a lot of character to bounce back in the manner that we did," Ponting said. Australia knocked off 135 to beat England with more than five overs to spare and Ponting believed his side can keep on improving. "We're very early into our season and we have to build on the way we played on Friday. "We've got to look at the things we did well and look at the areas where we were deficient - we can't afford to rest on that." "If we didn't learn from the mistakes from Zimbabwe then we'd all have been dummies and I think we've respected the game a lot more."
