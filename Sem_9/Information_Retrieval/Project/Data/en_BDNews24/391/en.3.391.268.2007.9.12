 MOSCOW Wed Sep 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters/BBC) - Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his prime minister on Wednesday, clearing the way for him to appoint a new premier who is likely to become the leading candidate in an election for president next March. Putin accepted Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov's resignation at a Kremlin meeting and did not immediately name a replacement. But the respected business daily Vedomosti, in an earlier report on Wednesday, said Sergei Ivanov, one of two first deputy prime ministers and a close friend of Putin's, could replace Fradkov very soon. BBC said,Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and his entire government, the Kremlin has said. Mr Fradkov offered to resign, citing "approaching significant political events", said Tass news agency. Fradkov will continue on an acting basis in the post until the new premier is named and confirmed by the State Duma (parliament). Elections for the Duma are scheduled to take place in December. "We all have to think together how to build a structure of power so that it better corresponds to the pre-election period and prepares the country for the period after the presidential election in March," Putin told Fradkov during the meeting, which was carried on Russian television. Fradkov gave as the reasons for his departure "approaching significant political events in the country and his own desire to give Russia's president full freedom of decision including staff decisions". Both men sat opposite each other wearing dark suits at a desk in a presidential office for the encounter, during which Putin thanked Fradkov for "substantial positive results" during his three and a half years as premier. "GDP has been growing at a substantial rate over these years and the volume of economic development has been expanding, inflation has been declining and the incomes of our citizens have been rising," Putin said. Financial markets had been expecting a change of government as a prelude to the long-awaited announcement of a new premier and likely presidential successor, so stocks and the rouble did not react to the announcement. "I do not think this will have a big impact on the market," said Oleg Vyugin, chairman of MDM Bank and a former head of the Russian financial markets watchdog. "Such a scenario has been discussed. It was not clear when it would happen ... What is interesting is who will head the new government. That is what the markets are waiting for." MYSTERY AROUND PUTIN'S CHOICE During the last transfer of presidential power, then President Boris Yeltsin named Putin as prime minister in 1999, several months before Putin became acting president. Putin's likely choice of successor has hitherto been shrouded in mystery, but most analysts have for some time considered Ivanov a leading contender. Vedomosti said in a front-page report that the question of Ivanov's elevation to the premiership was "practically decided". It quoted a source in the presidential administration as saying Ivanov's position was getting stronger and many inside the government and presidential administration were expecting him to get the job. Ivanov, like Putin a former KGB spy from St Petersburg, has repeatedly denied having any presidential ambitions. But rumors he is being groomed to take over from Putin have been fuelled by regular public appearances where the two men have been seen side by side. Putin, limited by the constitution to two consecutive terms, says he will step down next year. Whoever the popular Putin endorses to replace him is almost assured victory in the March 2008 presidential electi
