 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Sept (bdnews24.com) -- The chairman of Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board said he might quit his post ahead of his scheduled retirement date due to ill health. "My heart is not doing that well and I don't think it is wise for me to continue working, especially when the BTTB is becoming a company," Anwarul Azim, the boards chairman, told bdnews24.com Saturay. Azim was scheduled to retire on Dec 18 although he was rumoured to have resigned Thursday. However, telecoms secretary Sheikh Khurshid Alam told bdnews24.com that he had not received any resignation letter as yet from Azim. Azim rose to become BTTB's chief in May 2007 following a long-running power struggle. However, BTTB officials have said that the recently installed chairman failed to consolidate his position within the state-run telecoms monopoly. "He bowed to various inconsistent regulatory orders and caused huge losses of revenue in both foreign and local currencies," said a BTTB official, requesting anonymity. However, Azim said: "I am considering quitting for purely health reasons because the workload will dramatically increase once BTTB becomes a company." bdn
