 Rangpur, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Doctors at the Rangpur Medical College and Hospital Saturday called indefinite strike after 10 people including three doctors were injured in a clash Friday over the death of a patient. The agitating shut the emergency department to patients in protest. It all started after the vice principal of a local college, Mahbubar Rahman, 55, died at 10am Friday after he was admitted to the cardiology department of the hospital Wednesday with heart failure. According to witnesses, the grieving sons of Rahman alleged that their father had not been properly treated. They argued with the doctors and at one stage a brawl broke out between them. Assistant registrar of the cardiology department Dr Morshed, medical officer Dr Milon and an interne were injured. Rahman's sons Jewel and Rubel told reporters some interne doctors started beating them when they had alleged neglect on the part of the doctors. The doctors also refused to release the body to them, the sons said Head of cardiology department Prof Nawajesh Farid claimed the patient was given proper treatment. "The patient was brought to the hospital in critical condition. He was given necessary treatment. But the relatives of the patient have seriously injured three persons including two senior doctors," Dr Farid said. Riot police led by Kotwali Police Station officer-in-charge Jahangir Hossain were deployed at the hospital to douse tension. The body of Rahman was released to his relatives at 1pm at the intervention of hospital and municipal authorities. However, a group of intern doctors submitted a memorandum to hospital director Dr Saidur Rahman at about 2:30pm seeking justice. They called an indefinite strike at the hospital and locked down the emergency department, turning away people who came to the hospital for treatment. The striking doctors in an unsigned memorandum said the strike would continue until those who attacked the three injured doctors were arrested and safety of the doctors was ensured. Rangpur municipal chairman Abdur Rauf Manik, however, held the intern doctors responsible for the incident. Local ward commissioner Azmal Hossain said patients have been hit hard by the doctors' strike. Hossain said it was the doctors who had created chaos and demanded punishment to the guilty. bdnews24.c
