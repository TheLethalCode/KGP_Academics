 BRUSSELS, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American sprint world champion Tyson Gay has pulled out of Friday's Golden League meeting in Brussels, scuppering a duel with 100 metres world record holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica, organisers said on Tuesday. Gay, who won the 100, 200 and sprint relay in Osaka, has not fully recovered from the world championships, organisers said in a statement on their Web site (www.sport.be/memorialvandamme). The American could not be persuaded either to run the 200 metres in Brussels against his Osaka rivals Usain Bolt, Wallace Spearmon and Rodney Martin. "Tyson Gay has everything to lose and nothing to gain," event organiser Wilfried Meert said. "He has not fully recovered physically or mentally after his busy programme at the world championships." Powell, who finished third in the 100 metres in Japan, had thrown down the gauntlet to Gay by setting a new record over the distance of 9.74 seconds at Sunday's meeting in Rieti, Italy
