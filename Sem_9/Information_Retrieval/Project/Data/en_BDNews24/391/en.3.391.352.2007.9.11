 LONDON, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British retailers Next, French Connection and JJB Sports warned on Tuesday that already tough trading during the country's wettest ever summer was getting worse as rising interest rates hit spending. Fashion chain Next bought some cheer by beating analysts' forecasts with an 11 percent rise in first-half profit, as cost cuts and a strong performance at its Directory catalogue and online business offset weak sales at its shops. But Chief Executive Simon Wolfson warned that competition in online retailing, one of the sector's few bright spots in recent months, was heating up, and that refurbished stores and new ranges would not prevent a fall in second-half same-store sales. "I think the environment is getting tougher," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. "Not all of the (recent) interest rate increases have filtered through. Britain's retailers are struggling as debt-laden shoppers come to terms with five interest rate increases in little more than a year, taking the cost of borrowing to a six year high. UK retail shares have underperformed the UK's FTSE All-Share index by around 12 percent this year and the index is near a 20-month low. "The problem is you are still getting pretty bad news from the whole sector," said Paul Mumford, a fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management. "The time will come when it looks good value to get back in (to investing in retail stocks). But I don't think we are there yet." Stores exposed to the weather, like sportswear chains, have been particularly hard hit by heavy rain over the summer. JJB Sports issued a profit warning on Tuesday, sending its shares 15 percent lower, after Sports Direct said on Monday trading remained tough and Umbro posted a 43 percent drop in first-half profit last Thursday. Fashion group French Connection painted a similar picture to Next, saying its second-half sales were likely to fall, and knocking its shares down by around 7 percent. "We will be downgrading numbers later this morning by circa 5 percent, taking our recommendation into 'sell' territory," Numis Securities analysts said. They had expected French Connection, best known for its controversial "FCUK" brand, to make a full-year profit of 6 million pounds. The string of weak sales figures, on top of Monday's warning from budget clothes chain Primark that cut-price competition was squeezing its profit margins, will add to fears that consumer spending in Britain is grinding to a halt. The latest monthly survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed like-for-like sales across the country rose 1.8 percent in August, and are on course for their lowest quarterly rise since early 2006 if that trend continues in September. But, Landsbanki analysts said it was still possible to look for winners -- or at least best performing losers -- in the sector. They noted that the BRC data showed a 9.8 percent rise in like-for-like sales in London. "This trend is unlikely to continue at this rate, but it is worth highlighting the regional variation in context with specific retailers that have a higher London bias relative to the average," they said. Landsbanki tipped clothes and food group Marks and Spencer, music and books group HMV and supermarket chain Sainsbury as possible beneficiari
