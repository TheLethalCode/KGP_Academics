 BEIJING, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China urged troubled Myanmar to press forward with a "democracy process that is appropriate for the country", cautiously adding its weight to international pressure on the Southeast Asian junta to defuse public unrest. Senior Chinese diplomat Tang Jiaxuan made the comments to Myanmar Foreign Minister U Nyan Win, who was visiting Beijing for talks on Thursday, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Since August, Myanmar, formerly called Burma, has sought to stamp out public protests sparked by fuel price rises but reflecting frustration at the military's harsh rule.

Beijing is one of the few foreign capitals with friendly ties to Myanmar. China is generally hostile to Western pressure for political relaxation in other states. China has sold millions of dollars of arms to Myanmar. It has also invested in helping the country upgrade Indian Ocean naval facilities and is a big importer of its timber and minerals. The United States and Indonesia have said China and India should do more to pressure the junta. Tang's comments are a further sign that China wants to prod Myanmar to temper its actions without turning against the junta. He said the democracy process was "in the fundamental interests of the people of Myanmar and conducive to regional peace, stability and development". In a sign Myanmar may even be testing Beijing's patience, earlier this year China's Foreign Ministry published an unflattering account of Myanmar's new jungle capital, complaining it was remote, isolated and barr
