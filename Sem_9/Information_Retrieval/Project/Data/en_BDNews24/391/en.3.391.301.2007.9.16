 Moulvibazar, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com) Railway authorities expect train communication between Sylhet, Dhaka and Chittagong to be back on track by 4pm Sunday, 16 hours after the link derailed. "A recovery train arriving from Akhaura started rescue work and we expect train communication to resume by four in the afternoon," said Jahangir Alam, station master, Srimangal Railway Station, to bdnews24.com at midday. A landslide occurring between Satgaon and Rashidpur railway stations at 11:30 pm Saturday derailed the Sylhet-Dhaka Surma mail engine and two compartments. No casualties were reported.
