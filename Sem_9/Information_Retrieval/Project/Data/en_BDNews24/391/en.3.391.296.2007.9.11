 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's new secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Tuesday expelled office secretary Mofiqul Hasan Tripti from the party. Delwar made assistant office secretary Rizvi Ahmed acting office secretary. A statement signed by Rizvi Tuesday evening said Tripti had been expelled for violating party discipline by sending a letter to the Election Commission against the chairperson's decision and being involved in anti-party activities. Tripti's primary membership was also cancelled. Tripti later told bdnews24.com that the secretary general, according to the party constitution, cannot expel anybody. "The decision of expulsion was illegal as it breached party constitution," he said. Another statement signed by the former prime minister's assistant press secretary Mohiuddin Khan Mohan said Delwar appointed the party's assistant office secretary and former Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Rizvi Ahmed as office secretary. bdnew
