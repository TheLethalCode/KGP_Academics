<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Acting BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain Thursday said chairperson Khaleda Zia needed to be freed for the party to sit with the Election Commission over electoral reforms. "According to the party constitution, we need the party chairperson's approval to convene any forum meeting. The chairperson has been detained. She has to be freed and only then may we seek her consent for the party meeting," Delwar told reporters at his Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat. "[Abdul] Mannan Bhuiyan is nobody in the BNP. How can he claim to belong to the BNP mainstream?" Delwar said, brushing aside the claim Bhuiyan, the recently expelled secretary general, had made. "With the help of all BNP leaders and workers, I'll try my best to conduct myself as the party secretary general, though it appears quite a challenging job," he said. Questioning the authority of a council session called by the pro-Bhuiyan 'reformists', Delwar said, "No council session can be convened without the consent of the chairperson. I don't understand how 'outsiders' can call a party council." He called on the government to open the BNP headquarters in Naya Paltan in the capital. "We expect the caretaker government to stay neutral in this matter. The office belongs to the BNP." The acting secretary general urged the emergency government for measures to keep the prices of essential commodities within the reach of the people during Ramadan. RA Gani, BNP standing committee member, told reporters that reforms needed to be carried out under changed circumstances. "This happens to be a need of the moment. Reforms good for the nation will have to be accomplished. We'll not try anything to serve anybody's personal agenda." "There are no such factions as 'reformists' or 'anti-reforms' within the party," he said in a bid to cover the deep schism in the party. Other leaders and workers present there included retired Major Akhteruzzaman, Rizvi Ahmed, Sohrab Hossain, Shireen Sultana, Helen Zerin Khan and Rehana Aktar Ranu. Earlier, ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to the BNP chairperson, also spoke to reporters at his DOHS home. "The final decision about the dialogue with the Election Commission will be taken in an extended meeting to be held in Dhaka in presence of all divisional and upazila level BNP leaders after Ramadan," he said. Hannan also asked the government to withdraw police from the BNP headquarters. bdnews24.co
