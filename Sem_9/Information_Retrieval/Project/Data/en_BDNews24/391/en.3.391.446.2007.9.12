 KIRRA, Greece, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Residents of the central Greek town of Kirra had correctly predicted the result of the last parliamentary vote. Now they say the town is split down the middle ahead of the country's Sunday election. Vangelis Bakou, the town's only news-stand owner, says that judging by the political colour of the papers people buy, the score is even and no party will win an easy parliament majority, opening the way for either coalitions or new elections. "It might have been the influence from the Oracle of Delphi," joked town councillor Eleni Tsonou, referring to 2004, when Kirra's voters predicted the conservatives would sweep to power, ending 11 years of socialist rule. The 900 voters in Kirra, nestled in the green valley below ancient Delphi, matched the national ballot result almost exactly. "But this time around it will be a tough battle, people are divided down the middle," Tsonou said. Opinion polls published before a Sept. 1 blackout, showed the ruling New Democracy slightly leading the socialist opposition PASOK but both losing support to smaller parties. New Democracy has ruled out cooperating with the far-right LA.O.S. party, led by George Karatzaferis, which is set to enter parliament for the first time and even end up a powerbroker. "I never used to sell the Karatzaferis paper but now suddenly there are several people buying it," Bakou, 49, said. JOBS AND SUBSIDIES Like in most of the Greek countryside, concerns are for jobs to keep the young from fleeing to the cities, declining EU farm subsidies and the quality of life -- better roads and utilities. Although the recent forest fires that killed 65 people did not directly affect Kirra, they are a hot topic in the town, with some blaming the government for incompetence and others saying it handled well an unprecedented natural disaster. Sitting at a coffee shop favoured by PASOK supporters, two elderly men sipped the Greek firewater tsikoudia as they discussed the forest fires and financial scandals. They lamented the declining subsidies for olive oil, the area's main product. "People can't live off the olives, they have to have other jobs to survive. This government has made a huge mess," said retired sailor Christos Labropoulos, 71. His friend, retired construction worker Elias Glavanos, 62 agreed: "My children live in Athens and in America. I lost them because there are no jobs here." Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has been praised by Brussels for cutting deficits and turning the economy around but benefits have been slow to trickle down to the poor. He has asked for a strong new mandate to push on with the reforms Greece needs to catch up with its euro zone partners but admitted some of his pre-election pledges had not been met. Many in Kirra are prepared to give him another chance. "The others were in power for 20 years. What did they do?," Tsonou said, referring to the socialists who favour a pro-business model coupled with social protection. "I'll give Karamanlis another chance to finish his work. If he doesn't do it this time, then we'll vote for someone else." Opinion polls show the vote will most likely be decided at the last minute -- more than 10 percent of those asked were undecided a few weeks before the electi
