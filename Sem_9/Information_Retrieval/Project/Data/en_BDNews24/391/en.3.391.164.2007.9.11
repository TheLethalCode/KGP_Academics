Grapes in the south of Italy suffered from mildew, which causes rot, with Sicily hit particularly hard and output falling 30 percent there. In the north, mildew impact was limited but many vineyards were hit by strong rains and hail in August. Wine grapes quality varied greatly from region to region, the study said. In Tuscany, home to the famous Chianti and Brunello red wines, output is expected to be fall 5-10 percent from last year. In Piedmont, wine-grown region known for Barolo wine, output is seen down 5 percent.
