 Martyn Warwick LONDON, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/telecomtv.com) - The Internet search engine behemoth, Google, under increasing fire for the amount of data it keeps on tens of millions of individuals and the way it stores, manipulates and uses that information (of which, more later), is now looking beyond the earth for its next great PR coup. The company is offering a total of US$30 million in prize money to private groups that can send a robot craft to the moon, land it safely and then have it perform a number of tasks once it is on the lunar surface. Any group or individual trying for the prize has until the end of 2012 to design, build, launch, and land a device. Once on the moon the craft must then perform a series of actions such as roaming for specific distances and taking video of the action that will be transmitted back to earth where, naturally enough, it will be shown on a Google website. The competition is a collaboration between Google and the X-Prize Foundation, and according to a statement, is not yet another publicity stunt (perish the thought!) but a serious attempt to "stimulate research into the low-cost robotic exploration of space." However, in practice, "the low cost robotic exploration of space" is downright expensive and a landing on the moon combined with roving robotic lunar exploration, as well as costing and arm and a leg, will be an incredibly difficult feat to achieve. Hitherto it has only been managed via massive state funding and the involvement of national or international space agencies. The top prize for the first private lander is $20 million but to win it, the device, that must be equipped with sensitive and delicate high-definition still and movie cameras, will have to roam for at least 500 metres from its point of landing and gather a closely specified set of moving and still images as well as other "scientific" data. Google will pay an extra $5 million "bonus" if the spacecraft manages to fulfil a further wish-list that includes alternatives such as travelling for more than the stipulated 500 metres, staying in action and on-line over the course of a lunar night, taking shots of the remains of the Apollo space missions that remain on the moon, or, finding evidence of the existence of water or ice. There will be a special extra payment if a lander can be designed to source, scoop out and somehow sling back to earth a dollop of green cheese. (Actually, no there won't, I made that last bit up). The second lander to make it will get a prize of just $5 million. (that's under 2.4 million and, to put things in perspective, is the price of a moderately spacious house in one of the cheaper areas of west London). An incentive to get to Acton it might be, an incentive to fly to the moon, it ain't. The full $30 million prize will remain on offer until 2012; thereafter it will drop to $15 million in 2013 and disappear in the general direction of Uranus in 2014. Meanwhile, elsewhere, and in a breathtaking display of chuzpah, Google is calling on the United Nations, no less, to help protect the privacy of web users around the world! Google's "Head of Privacy" (so how come we know who he is then?) a certain Mr. Peter Fleischer, is to make a speech in Strasbourg at a meeting of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) at which he will suggest that governments and business should get together to design, implement and police global privacy standards. And they say the Yanks don't get irony. Mr. Fleischer says the inexorable spread of the Internet means that huge amounts of data pertaining to millions of individuals are whinging around the cyberspace endlessly and are being despatched to countries that have enacted no data protection legislation. He also says that without a global agreement on the privacy and protection of personal data, people might lose confidence in the Internet and thus slow its expansion. (And, by logical extension, delay Google's plan for universal domination of the Internet) Mr. Privacy says, "Three quarters of the countries in the world have no privacy regimes at all, and amongst those that do have laws, many of them were largely adopted before the rise of the Internet. It is said that each time you use a credit card, your details are passed through six different countries. We're talking about this to help set the framework for the Internet of the future." Of course you are Mr. Fleischer. No self-interest here is there? Just pure altruism. He continues, "A lot of data is being outsourced from Europe and the US to India, for example, but India doesn't have any privacy regulation. Europeans and Americans want to know their privacy is protected, and Indians themselves, as they come online, will also want these protections." Google claims that it is already in "discussion" in regard to privacy issues with officials in several European countries and says its aim is to raise the bar on privacy regulations and legislation worldwide. And this from a company that has been pilloried in the world's media of late for its own woeful lack of anything approaching a coherent and transparent privacy regime. Back earlier in the summer, Privacy International, the campaign and lobbying organisation, issued a public statement accusing Google of being "hostile to privacy" because of the unbelievably massive amounts of data it retains on an ever-increasing number of private individuals and its culling and manipulation of more and more information gleaned through its infamously profligate use of cookies. Google's ludicrous mantra, mission statement, collective ethic, corporate cock and bull - shit story (you decide) of "don't be evil", that was always a bad joke from the very start, now rings increasingly hollow and the company's blatant efforts to to reconcile the sentiment behind those three weasel words with the reality of its global reach and vaunting ambitions as it trims, ducks, bobs and weaves to get into every market on the planet is gob smacking in its hypocrisy. (Let's face it, the company would be all over North Korea like a bad rash if only it could convince that nice Kim Jong Il to open the cyber gates to Pyongyang and allow Google world come crashing in to the workers paradise. Truly a marriage made in heaven). And, whilst all this is going on, back in the real world of multi-billionaires, Google's founder Sergey Brin and Larry Page have managed to come to an agreement allowing them to park their Boeing 767 "Party Plane" on a restricted NASA airstrip by Google's California headquarters. Nobody else can do it but they can. After all, they have promised NASA that they will be able to install special scientific instruments on the Boeing, and two other Google planes in return for the favour. Messrs. Brin and Page went ahead with the deal despite the outrage expressed by ordinary residents of Mountain View who now expect to have their rural idyll rudely interrupted by the noise of Google planes taking off from and landing at what used to be a quiet federal backwater. That's it boys, carry on not being evil. Perhaps you can have your famous but meaningless phrase carved in letters ten miles high on the face of the moon? That's got to be worth $30 million, right? bdn
