 PHUKET, Thailand, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- The death toll in a plane crash on the Thai resort island of Phuket on Sunday was 88, Phuket deputy governor Vorapot Rajsima said. Another 42 people on the flight, which was carrying 130 passengers and crew, were injured, he told a news conference. Initial reports had said there were 128 on board.
