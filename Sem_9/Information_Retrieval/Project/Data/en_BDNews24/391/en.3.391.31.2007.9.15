 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) - A petition for bail to former prime minister Khaleda Zia will be filed with Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court Sunday in a corruption case, her lawyer said. Khaleda's lawyer Sanaullah Miah told bdnews24.com: "The petition will be filed at 9am Sunday." Earlier on Wednesday, Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Jalal Ahmed did not accept a petition for bail to the detained former prime minister, who was arrested on Sept 3. He refused to accept the petition saying that it was not in his jurisdiction to hear a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2, accusing 13 people including Khaleda. bdnew
