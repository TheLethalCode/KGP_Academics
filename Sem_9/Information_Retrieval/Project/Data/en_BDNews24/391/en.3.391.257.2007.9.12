 LONDON, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Rana Naved was taken to hospital after appearing to suffer a nasty injury while fielding for Sussex in their county championship match at Durham on Wednesday. "He ran full tilt for a ball on the boundary and slid along his front," the county said on their Web site (www.sussexcricket.co.uk) "He immediately cried out and rolled on to his back at which point it became clear he was not right.

Rana, 29, was given oxygen and treated by paramedics before being carried off on a stretcher
