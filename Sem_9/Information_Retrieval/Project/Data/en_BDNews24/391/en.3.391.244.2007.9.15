 DUBAI, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of an al Qaeda-led group in Iraq, in an audiotape posted on Saturday, announced a new phase of attacks to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. "I am honoured to declare at the start of Ramadan, an invasion named after the martyr Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ...," Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, leader of the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq, said in the 31-minute tape posted on an Islamist Web site. Baghdadi did not give details but renewed a call from the late Zarqawi -- killed last year by U.S. forces -- on Iraqis to fight the U.S.-led forces and their allies. He said the campaign in Iraq would last until the seventh day of the Muslim month of Shawwal, which falls around Oct. 12. Baghdadi also called on Iraqis who had "collaborated" with the U.S.-led forces and the Iraqi government to repent and assured them that they would not face reprisals during Ramadan, a time for Muslims to repent and change their ways. The Islamic State in Iraq, a group formed last year by al Qaeda's wing in Iraq and other Sunni insurgents, has claimed responsibility for mass kidnappings and a series of major attacks.
