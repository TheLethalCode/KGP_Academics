<TEXT>
 Amit Talukder Legal Affairs Correspondent Dhaka, July 08 (bdnews24.com)A letter sent by Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil through jail authorities to the president and the chief adviser, pleading for freedom, is not contrary to the Jail Code, legal experts said Sunday. On July 5, Jalil wrote a letter to the president and the chief adviser declaring that he had decided to quit politics. He urged them not to extend his detention order and to free him. Jalil also criticised the leadership of AL chief Sheikh Hasina. Jalil's letter caused widespread reaction among the party's leaders and workers. AL law adviser Advocate Sahara Khatun claimed the sending of such a letter from jail violated the provision of the Jail Code. Criminal law expert Advocate Anisul Haq disagrees. He told bdnews24.com that even a convict with death sentence might send a mercy petition to the president through jail authorities. "So Abdul Jalil's letter doesn't violate the Jail Code," Haq said. Former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru was also interviewed by bdnews24.com. "It is quite mysterious how a confined person could send a typed letter from jail to the president and the chief adviser," he said. But he refrained from commenting on any legal aspect of the letter. However he added that it was difficult to establish whether the letter was written voluntarily or not. Barrister Tanjib Ul Alam, speaking to bdnews24.com, said that Jalil has every right as a detainee to communicate any grievance to the jail authorities. "Since the jail authorities themselves sent Abdul Jalil's letter to the president and the chief adviser there was no violation of the Jail Code," Alam said. "Moreover, if it had violated the Jail Code, the jail authorities would not have sent the letter," he said. Barrister Maniruzzaman Asad told bdnews24.com that the inspector of prisons stated publicly that he had sent a sealed envelop to the president and the chief adviser. Asad said that if a prisoner wishes to communicate with those in authority, he must do so through proper channels, which Jalil did. "So, there was no legal bar with respect to Abdul Jalil sending the letter in," he said. bdn
