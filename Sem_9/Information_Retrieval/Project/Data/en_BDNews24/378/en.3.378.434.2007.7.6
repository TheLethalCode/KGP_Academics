<TITLE> Bhuiyan to seek Khaleda's approval for council </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com) BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday said they would seek approval from party chief Khaleda Zia in holding the council meeting to move ahead with the reform plan. Bhuiyan, however, brushed aside Khaleda's recent comment that he had violated the party constitution by placing proposals for reforms. "We'll go by the (party) constitution to complete reforms. For this we need to call a council meeting. Her approval will be sought. We'll do everything in line with the (party) constitution," Bhuiyan told reporters at his Gulshan home. Bhuiyan made the comment as reporters drew his attention to Khaleda's comment that action would be taken against the leaders who are plotting in the name of unveiling reform proposals. Khaleda Thursday came down heavily on Bhuiyan, saying had he been sincere he would have consulted her about reforms and the council meeting. Khaleda had said she would seek government permission to contact party workers and sit in the party office to prepare for the council. "I'll ask the government. I've got to go to the party office and I need to contact party leaders and workers in preparation for the council. We are ready to convene the council as soon as the ban on indoor politics is lifted." The schism in the BNP reached its peak amid the government's announcement that the administration might allow political parties to hold the council meetings despite the ban on indoor politics. Communications adviser MA Matin had recently said they would consider giving permission if proposals for holding council meeting came from the parties. BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain, meanwhile, after a meeting with Bhuiyan separately said Friday that they were taking preparations to hold the council meeting. "The chairperson will be briefed on the progress of our preparations whenever she wants," Ashraf told reporters. He differed with Khaleda's stance that the council meeting cannot be convened unless the ban on indoor politics is lifted. "I do not agree with her statement. There has not been a council meeting over past 14 years," Ashraf said. "We want to practise open politics, not indoor politics anymore. The party constitution says that a council should be held every two years." Ashraf told bdnews24.com at noon that the people tasked to hold the council were not willing to go by the party constitution. Dozens of party leaders and activists came to see Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home Friday morning. Former BNP lawmakers and district leaders and workers from Khulna, Narsingdi, Barisal, Jessore, Rajshahi, Noakhali, Faridpur, Madaripur, Patuakhali, Netrakona and Comilla visited Bhuiyan's home and discussed the latest situation with him. bdnews24
