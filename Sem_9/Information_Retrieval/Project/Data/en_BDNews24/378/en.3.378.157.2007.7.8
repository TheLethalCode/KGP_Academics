 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) Communications adviser MA Matin Sunday said the government was not involved in the process of forming or splitting political parties. "Political leaders are doing all this. We are just aiming to hold a free and fair election by 2008," Matin said. "The government is unwavering in its promise." Matin linked the rise and fall of political parties to the sub-continental history. He said Bangladesh became independent, breaking away from the rule of Pakistan, and Pakistan was born out of the Indian subcontinent with the end of the British rule. "I think something meaningful will come out of the process of creation and destruction," he said. "The government will not form any party. It is political leaders who have to make efforts to set up good political parties," he said. bdnews
