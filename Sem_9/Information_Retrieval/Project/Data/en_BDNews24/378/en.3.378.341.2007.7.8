<TEXT>
 BARQUISIMETO, Venezuela, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil and Uruguay confounded the critics who had labelled them dull and unimaginative by combining to fire 10 goals past their opponents in reaching the Copa America semi-finals on Saturday. After managing just one goal in three group stage games, Uruguay hit four in one match as they ousted hosts Venezuela 4-1 in San Cristobal. Brazil coach Dunga, repeatedly criticised for over-cautious tactics which inhibit his team's creativity, jumped with delight on the touchline as his side thrashed a demoralised Chile 6-1 in Puerto La Cruz. Two of Brazil's goals came from striker Robinho, the competition's leading scorer with six. Beaten 3-0 by Peru in their opening game, Uruguay were at their ruthless best as they brought Venezuela's creditable campaign grinding to a halt. Diego Forlan, who until now has had a negligible impact on the tournament, scored Uruguay's first and last goals. Forlan put Uruguay ahead in the 38th minute with a breakaway effort but Juan Arango replied from a freekick which went through the Uruguay wall three minutes later. Pablo Garcia fired Uruguay back in front in the 65th minute with his second international goal, a superbly struck effort from the edge of the area. Cristian Rodriguez and Forlan finished off the hosts in the last five minutes to silence a 42,000 crowd that were witnessing Venezuela's first ever match in the knockout stage of the competition. "We gambled on coming out to win the game," Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez told reporters. "I think the result shows we won well." Venezuela coach Richard Paez said: "Tonight, Uruguay showed where they stand. We were never comfortable with the pressure.... But we made history by getting to the last eight." Brazil quickly took control of their game as Juan, Julio Baptista and Robinho scored in a 13-minute spell in the first half. Robinho, Josue and Vagner Love added three more after halftime while Humberto Suazo replied for Chile with the best goal of the game, a delicate 20-metre chip. Chile went into the game amid reports of indiscipline at the team hotel and seemed to have little stomach for the fight. Before the game, defender Jorge Vargas said reports of trouble had been exaggerated. "We had a few drinks, nothing more than that," he said. "We didn't get into a fight and we didn't go out on the town, we stayed in the hotel." The Chilean League said: "Once the Copa America is finished, the directors will meet in Santiago to analyse the report presented by the technical staff." The win maintained an unhappy sequence of results for Chile against Brazil. The last four matches have ended 5-0, 4-0, 3-0 and 6-1 in favour of the five-times world champions. On Sunday, Argentina meet Peru in Barquisimeto and Mexico face Paraguay in Maturin in the final two quarter-final
