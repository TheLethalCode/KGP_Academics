<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8(bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday took a dig at Awami League leader Motia Chowdhury for her remarks Saturday and said some politicians are busy defending those who had destroyed democracy. The AL presidium member Saturday said it would be a folly to try to practise democracy excluding the top two political leaders referring to Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. She had made the remarks after police barred her from entering Hasina's Sudha Sadan home. "I don't understand why some political personalities are saying that practising democracy is not possible without so and so, who in reality were very much responsible for destroying democracy and democratic institutions in this country," Mainul told reporters. "Democracy is now shackled, which may give rise to resurgence of militants and reactionary forces," Motia had warned. She said that if democratic parties were made weak, militancy would become stronger. Motia said that though the Constitution is still in force, the Awami League president's movements were being controlled over the past month. "The country's constitution is still in force but the Awami League chief's interaction with her people has been restricted for last one month." On the restrictions imposed on visitors seeking entry into Sudha Sadan, she said, "I hope good sense will prevail and the government will lift the restrictions clamped on her personal movement and seeing people," she said. bdnews24.com
