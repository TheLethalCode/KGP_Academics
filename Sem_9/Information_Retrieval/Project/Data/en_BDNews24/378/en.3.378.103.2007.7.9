 JAKARTA, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil suit against former President Suharto on Monday, seeking recovery of state funds allegedly misused by one of Suharto's charitable foundations. Suharto, who resigned under pressure from civil unrest in 1998 after 32 years in power, was previously charged with graft but escaped prosecution after he was deemed too ill to stand trial. "Today we filed a civil suit against the Supersemar foundation, and we are suing the then head of the foundation, former President Suharto,"Prosecutor Dachmer Munthe told reporters. "The foundation was supposed to give scholarships and education assistance for underprivileged students. But in fact it went against the law by giving state money away outside the stated purpose." He said the Supersemar foundation since 1978 had collected some $420 million from various sources. The foundation collects donations from businessmen and other sources to provide scholarships. Helping a foundation with links to Suharto during his reign was seen as a civic duty.
