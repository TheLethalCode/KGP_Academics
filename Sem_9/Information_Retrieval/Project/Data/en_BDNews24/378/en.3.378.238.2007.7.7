 PUERTO LA CRUZ, Venezuela, July 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga was a combative figure in his playing days, appearing to spend much of his time snarling at the opposition. Eight years after he hung up his boots, little has changed except the opposition are now sitting in a room in front of him armed with tape recorders, microphones and cameras. Less than one year after taking over as coach and two weeks into his first official tournament, Dunga's relationship with the influential Brazilian media is becoming increasingly prickly. As a coach and player Dunga has made team spirit his watchwords and he eyes any question as a potential threat and as an instrusion into his squad's privacy. Either he ducks the question or he throws it back in the face of the reporter who is told he has got it wrong. On Friday, Dunga was asked if he was going to have a quiet word with Robinho, his top scorer, after he petulantly picked up a yellow card in the 1-0 Copa America win over Ecuador. "I'm going to speak to all the players," replied the coach, dodging the issue and a possible public criticism of his most important player. Asked why Brazil field three stoppers in midfield, Dunga opted for the counter-attack. "Argentina play with three defensive midfielders (Javier Mascherano, Juan Sebastian Veron and Esteban Cambiasso) and everyone says how well they attack, so why can't Brazil?," he replied. "If it's good enough for Argentina, why is it not good enough for Brazil?" Dunga's relationship with the media was always going to be a thorny subject. In 1990, the midfielder was made the scapegoat when Brazil fell in the second round of the World Cup in Italy. It was named the "Dunga era" because it was felt his hard-running style had taken precedence over Brazil's traditional attacking game. Although he resuscitated his career by captaining the World Cup-winning team four years later, many feel the wounds may not have healed. At the Copa America, Dunga has been repeatedly criticised for fielding too many defensive players in midfield and inhibiting creativity. Dunga, in turn, has tried to drill home the idea his team are attacking and the number of so-called defensive midfielders he picks is irrelevant. "Just because we don't field three forwards, it doesn't mean we don't attack," is a phrase he has repeated after almost every game. "Football depends on efficiency. This is the reality." But the media continue to lambast the team for being overcautious and, for the time being at least, the situation appears to have reached deadloc
