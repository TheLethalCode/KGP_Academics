<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) "After getting out of the vehicle the RAB officers beat us to unconsciousness on the road. After that they cuffed our hands and legs and beat us further with iron hammers so much that we bled." This is how the manager of Abul Khair Group, Zakir Hossain, accused of bribing the police, narrated his alleged torture by members of the Rapid Action Battalion in a statement to a special court in Dhaka Sunday. Judge Shamsun Nahar Begum of Special Judges' Court-4 was hearing the defence of those accused in a bribery case. On January 29 Fatullah police detained five ships containing rotten wheat, imported by Abul Khair Group, at the Afsar Oil Mill Ghat in Fatullah. On January 31 joint forces arrested Fatullah police chief, two sub inspectors and two officials of Abul Khair Group, as they were transacting a Tk 14.8 lakh bribe for dropping one of the Abul Khair Group officials from the chargesheet. RAB deputy assistant director Abu Sadek filed the case against the then OC of Fatullah Police Station Ashraful Islam, sub-inspectors Enamul Haque and Miraj Al Mahmud and Abul Khair Group's general manager ASM Mostafizur Rahman and manager Zakir Hossain accused in the incident. In court Sunday Zakir Hossain claimed himself "innocent and a victim of conspiracy." He claimed, "Two RAB members beat me. Another one was standing and watching." He also told the court, "RAB members gave me a written paper and told me to read it. Otherwise, they threatened to kill me in 'crossfire.' Instead of presenting me before the media they extracted a confession from me to the effect that I am guilty." Other accused persons submitted written statements claiming their innocence. The judge fixed Wednesday for hearing closing arguments. bdnews
