 BAGHDAD, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi police and residents using heavy machinery and small shovels searched for bodies in the ruins of a market in northern Iraq on Sunday after a huge truck bomb killed 150 people. Meanwhile, A bomb blast killed 25 new Iraqi army recruits and wounded 20 others on Sunday while they were travelling on a road near Baghdad, police and an army officer said. It was unclear if the new recruits, who were in a truck, were killed by a roadside bomb or if a suicide car bomber had rammed into their vehicle. The recruits were Sunni Arabs from western Anbar province who had just joined the Iraqi security forces. Two police officers in the Shia town of Tuz Khurmato confirmed 150 people had been killed in Saturday's explosion that Iraqi officials blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. The officers said 20 people were still missing and 250 wounded. As the clean-up work progressed fresh bomb attacks in and around Baghdad on Sunday killed at least 25 people, including 25 Iraqi army recruits when their truck was attacked on a road near the capital. Many of Saturday's Tuz Khurmato victims were women and children who were shopping at the time. The town mayor, Mohammed Rasheed, said the bomb destroyed around 50 small shops and 50 houses. "I just visited the scene. It looks like an earthquake happened there," Shalal Abid al-Ahmed, a member of the Salahuddin provincial council, told Reuters by telephone. The death toll of 150 makes it the second deadliest insurgent bombing in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. In March, a truck bomb attack also blamed on al Qaeda killed 152 people in the northern town of Tal Afar. In Baghdad on Sunday, a car bomb killed six people on a busy shopping street in the centre of the city, while two more people perished in a second blast in the capital, police said. The surge in bombings comes despite a major US and Iraqi military offensive that has focused largely on Baghdad and the beltways around the capital, where U.S. commanders believe a lot of car bombs are put together. The offensive has driven many militants out of Baghdad to areas where the troop presence is not as heavy. Ahmed said the truck was packed with explosives and covered by hay so it would not arouse suspicion when the driver parked it at the market in Tuz Khurmato, 185 km (110 miles) north of Baghdad. Police said heavy machinery had been brought in from larger towns to dig through the rubble. "People from the whole town of Tuz Khurmato are helping, some have brought along small shovels. We have also called in heavy machinery," one policeman said by telephone. U.S. officials blame most big car bombings on al Qaeda, which they say is trying to spark full-scale civil war between Iraq's majority Shia and minority Sunni Arabs. In Baghdad, seven people were wounded in the first car bombing in the mainly Shi'ite district of Karrada, police said. The second car bomb was near a hotel used by westerners in the southern neighbourhood of Jadriya, police said. Five people were wounded in that attack, near the al-Hamra hotel, although the hotel itself was not being targeted, police said. Jadriya is also mainly Sh
