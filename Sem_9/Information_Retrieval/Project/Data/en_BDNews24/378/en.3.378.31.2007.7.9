 ISLAMABAD, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security forces fired tear gas and traded gunfire with Islamist militants in a Pakistani mosque compound on Monday, but there was no sign of an imminent assault a day after the government gave "a final warning" to surrender. Holes have been blown in outer walls of the compound housing Islamabad's Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, and a girls' madrasa, where the government says 200 to 500 followers of a rebel cleric's Taliban-style movement have battened down for a siege. As the stand-off entered its seventh day, Muslim clerics asked the government to hold off, while they tried to find a way to avoid a bloodbath in the heart of the Pakistani capital. With at least 21 people killed so far in the violence that began last Tuesday, government forces have attempted to give women and children inside the compound time to flee. A woman who feared her daughter had been killed and buried inside the compound waited with around a dozen other anxious parents behind barbed wire barriers. "I request the law enforcement agencies to let me go inside. I can go alone, and I know nobody will fire from inside. I know these people very well," Asia Bibi said, adding she wanted to discover her daughter's fate for herself. There are concerns some children have been either coerced or persuaded to stay behind to act as human shields. Authorities blared out over loudspeakers what they said was a final warning on Sunday evening, and a drone flew over the compound overnight fuelling speculation an assault was imminent. Rebel cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi and his hardcore of fighters have scorned warnings to surrender or die. Ghazi said he and his followers hoped their deaths would spark an Islamic revolution. Government and military officials say there are 50 to 60 hard-core militants, some from groups linked to al Qaeda, leading the fighting, but most of the others are women and children. Officials say the militants have distributed suicide-bomb vests and even shot students trying to flee the mosque. BACKLASH FEARS Troops surrounded Lal Masjid on Tuesday last week after clashes between armed student radicals and paramilitary troops erupted after months of tension. About 1,200 students left the mosque soon after the clashes began but the number leaving has since slowed to a trickle. A senior official of the main Pakistani organisation overseeing madrasas (Islamic schools), and other clerics met with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on Monday to plead for a compromise. "We're doing our best to avoid bloodshed, especially of innocent women and children," Qari Hanif Jallundri, told Reuters. "But the time for talking appears just about over." Feeding fears of a militant backlash, three Chinese workers were shot dead and one wounded in an attack in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Sunday, which authorities said appeared to be a response to the bloody siege in the capital. The Lal Masjid has been a hotbed of militancy for years, known for its support for Afghanistan's Taliban and opposition to Musharraf's backing for the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism. At least 20 people, mostly soldiers and police, have been killed in four blasts, including two suicide attacks, and an ambush since last Wednesday, though it was unclear if the attacks were related directly to the Lal Masjid siege. The Lal Masjid movement is a reflection of the militancy seeping into cities from tribal areas on the Afghan border. In the restive tribal region of Bajaur, a wanted Pakistani Taliban leader, flanked by masked gunmen, vowed revenge for the attacks on Lal Masjid, as a crowd of more than 10,000 tribesmen chanted "Al-Jihad" and "Death to Americ
