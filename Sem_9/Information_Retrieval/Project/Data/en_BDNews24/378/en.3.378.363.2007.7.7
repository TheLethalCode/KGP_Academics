 BILBAO, Spain, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish police evacuated the De Lasarte horse racing track in the city of San Sebastian in the country's Basque region after receiving a bomb threat from the ETA rebel group on Saturday. Tension is high in the northern region after the ETA separatist group called off a cease-fire in June which had been in place since March 2006. On Monday French anti-terrorist police arrested three suspected ETA members as they prepared to cross into Spain in a van packed with explosives.
