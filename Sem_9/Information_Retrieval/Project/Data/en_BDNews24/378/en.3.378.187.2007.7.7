<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina Saturday asked the government to withdraw a case against the farmers who had demonstrated for smooth supply of fertiliser in Nachole of Chapainawabganj. If the government fails to ensure smooth fertiliser supply, output will come down resulting in a further hike in the prices of daily essentials, Hasina said in a statement. It was the responsibility of the government to ensure smooth supply of fertiliser, seeds and pesticides to farmers, she said. "Filing cases against farmers for demanding fertiliser at fair prices cannot be supported in any circumstances," Hasina said. Farmers in Nachole went on the rampage as the administration failed to supply fertiliser to farmers Wednesday. An angry group assaulted the Upazila Nirbahi Officer who beat up an agriculture officer. Next day, the upzila administration filed a case against thousands of farmers. Hasina said the government failed to control the soaring price hike of essentials and guarantee enough food for the poor. "Ordinary men expect that the government would contain the spiraling price hike and make opportunities for the poor to get at least two meals a day," she said. "Unfortunately, the government failed to meet the minimum expectations of people," Hasina said. bdn
