 PARIS, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  'Desperate Housewives' star Eva Longoria and basketball player Tony Parker married for a second time on Saturday, exchanging vows in a Paris church 24 hours after tying the knot at a civil ceremony. Hundred of fans hoping for a glimpse of the stars were disappointed as guards kept them well away from the 12th century church, across the road from the Louvre museum.

The reception was being held in one of France's most spectacular houses -- the Chateau de Vaux le Vicomte -- which cost an estimated 200,000 euros ($280,000) to hire. It has previously hosted the wedding of Indian tycoon Lakshmi Mittal's daughter, said to be the most expensive of all time at a reported $55 million. "It will certainly be a beautiful marriage because a lot of celebrities will be coming," said Jean-Charles de Vogue, whose family owns the chateau.
