 LONDON, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bovis Homes sent a shiver through Britain's housebuilders on Monday, reporting a sharp slowdown in reservations and striking a cautious tone on the outlook amid rising interest rates. Shares in Bovis Homes, Britain's fifth-biggest housebuilder by market capitalisation, fell as much as 8.4 percent to a 10-month low of 843.5 pence, dragging housebuilders down across the board against firmer broader market. "While the group is in a good position to expand ... the extent of the planned increase in volume for 2007 over that achieved in 2006 will depend on consumer confidence over the key summer and autumn selling period," Bovis said. Bovis Homes said pretax profit in the first half of the year met its expectations and reservations of 2,282 were up 0.4 percent from 2,273 a year ago. The 0.4 percent growth in reservations marks a significant turnaround in market sentiment in the last two months. Bovis reported a 9 percent growth in reservations on May 11. "The trading update is slightly disappointing suggesting first-half results are broadly flat on last year...which does not bode well for the 10 percent growth in pretax profit forecast for both 2007 and 2008," Bridgewell Securities said in a research note. "On the back of the announcement, we anticipate downgrading 2007 and 2008 estimates in the region of 7-10 percent." Britain's housing market has been booming for more than a decade, underpinned by a shortage of new homes, low unemployment and cheap borrowing costs. But five interest rate rises in less than a year, culminating in bank base rates hitting a six-year high of 5.75 percent last week, are showing signs of slowing the market. Builders have so far been divided about their prospects. Taylor Wimpey, which last week became Britain's biggest homebuilder following a 5 billion pound merger, struck a cautious tone in a recent trading update. Persimmon and Berkeley , however, have sounded more confident. With Bovis presenting the most cautious picture so far, the market is waiting for more clues from rivals such as Barratt Developments, which is due to give a trading update on Wednesday, to gauge market conditions. CONFIDENCE "In the wake of five interest rate rises ... investor confidence was already on the decline -- Bovis shares have retreated by just under 19 percent over the last 6 months -- and today's statement will do little to stop the rot," stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown said. "However, when allowing for both proven management ability and potential M&A activity within the sector, market consensus opinion is still cautiously positive in tone." Bovis said its first-half average sales price was in line with the previous half year at around 189,000 pounds ($380,300), with legal completions and operating margins also broadly in line with the previous year's level. "While the housing market ... is clearly not in a position to give any housebuilder a free ride, it is still allowing the strengths of groups that are well funded with strong strategic land holdings to make progress in profit terms," Evolution Securities said in a note. "Bovis is one such stock. It can add firepower to the balance sheet by...relying on a well-placed strategic land bank." Bovis Homes is expected to report 146 million pounds in 2007 pretax profits, according to Reuters Estimates. At 1302 GMT, shares in Taylor Wimpey were down 3.1 percent, Redrow was down 5.2 percent and Persimmon was down 3.5 perce
