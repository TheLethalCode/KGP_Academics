 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 07 (bdnews24.com) -- Aid inflows increased soon after the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government assumed power in mid-January, according to Economic Relations Division (ERD) findings. Donors disbursed $1,401.77 million to Bangladesh in fiscal 2006-07 that ended June 30. The disbursement was only $518 million in the first eight months of the fiscal year meaning that as much as $883.77 million was disbursed in the last four monthsfrom March to June. Some $1,567.636 million was disbursed during FY 2005-06, according to the ERD. "Aid disbursement picked up in the last four months of the past fiscal year," ERD additional secretary Shaheedul Haque told bdnews24.com. Haque believed that some movements, including the intensification of anti-corruption efforts and monitoring of development projects by the present caretaker government had helped faster aid inflows. During July-December period of FY 2006-07, only $396 million was disbursed, while it was $676 million for the same period in the previous fiscal. Only $34 million was disbursed in January and $88 million in February. But the disbursement jumped to about $400 million in March. ERD officials also said that they were optimistic that aid would continue to flow in the current fiscal year. Bangladesh has already received the third highest aid commitment worth $2,245 million, for the FY 2006-07, since independence after $2,648.516 million in 1998-99 because of the 1998 floods and $2,410.184 million in 1993-94 for restoring democracy and the 1991 storm, ERD statistics revealed. The commitment, made in FY 2006-07, would be released mostly in the current fiscal year, ERD officials said. Officials said that the present government has adopted detailed initiatives to implement development programmes, especially donor-funded ones. "Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has decided to monitor implementation of the development projects himself," another senior ERD official who requested not to be named told bdnews24.com. Haque said that the concerned ministries would prepare their respective work plans so that implementation and monitoring might be done in an organised manner. Some 30 projects that constitute 60 percent of the total Tk 8,750 crore foreign assistance projected to be received in the FY 2007-08 would be monitored by the ERD as per the work plans of different implementing agencies, the ERD additional secretary said. bd
