 BAGHDAD, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six US soldiers were killed in Iraq in the past two days, mostly in Baghdad, the US military said on Saturday. It said four soldiers were killed by roadside bombs in Baghdad, three on Friday and one on Thursday, and that two Marines were killed in combat in the western Anbar province. US casualties have been rising in Iraq in the past few months with reinforcements being deployed and US forces going on the offensive in and around Baghdad. The April-June period was the deadliest three months for US troops since the US-led invasion in March 2003. About 3,600 US soldiers have been killed in the conflict.
