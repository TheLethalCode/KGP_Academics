<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Ataur Rahman Kaiser Friday rubbished Suranjit Sengupta's proposal to introduce presidential form of government and, simultaneously, revive the 1972 constitution. Kaiser faulted Suranjit on the so-called reform proposal when the former shared his thoughts on reforming the party machine. But Kaiser backed the idea that the president, general secretary and members of the policymaking presidium be restricted to being in office no more than two terms. However, he said, the provision should not have a retrospective effect. This means he would not mind Sheikh Hasina continuing in the top office for a few more years. Kaiser, a former ambassador, differed with party chief Hasina on her idea that anyone above 60 years of age should give way to younger party executives. Kaiser, the latest senior AL leader to make such public statements, was particularly harsh on Suranjit. "His proposal to transfer the prime minister's executive powers to the president on the one hand and restore the constitution of 1972 on the other is contradictory," Kaiser told bdnews24.com in front of Hasina's Sudha Sadan home. Kaiser, known to be close to Hasina, came to see the AL president at around 11.15am, but the police did not let him in. Kaiser did not speak to the press until Hasina's personal assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud came over and handed him a slip. Whenever he faltered in answering questions from reporters, Hasan helped him out. Kaiser is the third presidium member to contradict four AL bigwigs, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit who had come down hard on Hasina's alleged authoritarian leadership. They also suggested reactivation of joint-leadership through the party's presidium. Last week, Razzak, Tofail and Suranjit suggested striking a balance of power between the president and the prime minister. Presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury and Motia Chowdhury had earlier criticised the trio on reform agenda. bdnews24.c
