 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) -- An Indian passenger train on trial arrived in Dhaka Sunday as part of the two neighbours' efforts to restore train communications after a gap of about four decades, officials said. The train, Moitree or friendship, arrived in Dhaka's cantonment area at 6:22pm while Bangladesh Railway's high officials welcomed 32-member Indian delegation with much enthusiasm. Additional secretary to the Indian home affairs ministry AE Ahmed lead the delegation. The train reached Darshana in the country's western district of Kushtia at 11:07am hours after it left Kolkata at 7:00am Indian local time, Belayet Hossain, director general of the Bangladesh Railway, told bdnews24.com. The train left Darshana at 11:50am, Hossain said. "According to the agreement of 2001, the time, number of trains and the modalities will be decided mutually. We are here to discuss the issues," A E Ahmed told bdnews24.com. He told this correspondent that his side was given a 'wonderful' reception in Bangladesh. Another member of the Indian delegation R K Tandon (Executive Director, Traffic--Railway board) told bdnews24.com that the immigration and customs formalities were completed in only 30 minutes. 14 Indian officials will hold a series of meeting with their Bangladeshi counterpart Monday and Tuesday to finalise all unresolved issues. Meanwhile, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury welcomed the event, terming it a symbol of mutual understanding between the two neighbours. "We welcome this event. It's a step forward towards our bilateral relations," Chowdhury told reporters at a press briefing. Foreign secretary (Is he still acting?) Touhid Hossain also said the new initiative would yield something good for both countries. "It'll deepen people-to-people bonding," he said. The visiting officials will sit with Bangladeshi officials on July 9-11 in Dhaka to make a final deal for the launch of direct passenger train services between the two cities. As per a previous deal between the two countries, the regular train services are expected to begin late this month but some media reports have said it will take another month to get through. The railway DG said they still have some issues to decide, and the officials from the two sides will discuss them to sign a final deal. The officials will discuss the issues about how the two sides will deal with customs and immigration at borders, the DG said. "We will make our efforts to resolve the issues like the frequency of trains a week and completion of customs and immigration formalities at the borders," he said. Kolkata and Dhaka are currently connected by air and bus links. The train services stopped in 1965 following a war between India and Pakistan. The train is expected to cover a distance of 215 miles between Dhaka and Calcutta in 12 hours. bdnews24.com/krc/ahd
