 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Shopping malls will be allowed to run for one more hour to 8pm, according to Saturday's cabinet decision that will come into effect soon. The decision was taken at a weekly meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. "It's a conditional decision. Shop owners have to cut power consumption," law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com by telephone after the meeting. Leaders of Bangladesh Shop Owners Association had earlier promised to limit power consumption by using fluorescent or energy-saving bulbs in shops, he said. "The decision will come into effect in a day or two." The government order to close markets and shopping malls at 7pm came into effect on Feb 25 to save power in a country that runs into nagging outages. The restriction did not apply to kitchen markets and small neighbourhood shops, drugstores, restaurants and other emergency service providers. Power adviser Tapan Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on July 1 that the curbs on nighttime shopping had saved 300 to 400 megawatts of power. The same day, Bangladesh Shop Owners Association chairman Amir Hossain Khan said businessmen would benefit from the easing restriction. "Keeping shops open for one hour more will increase sales 30 percent," he said. Hossain said the mandatory closure of shops at 7pm cost businessmen huge financial losses. bdnews24.c
