More attacks "could take place at any time and could be imminent," DFAT said. Particular care should be taken at this time to avoid known terrorist targets." These included Bali and the capital Jakarta, DFAT said. "Ask yourself whether, given your own personal circumstances, you're comfortable travelling to Indonesia including Bali, knowing that there is a very high threat from terrorism and you may be caught up in a terrorist attack," the advisory said.
