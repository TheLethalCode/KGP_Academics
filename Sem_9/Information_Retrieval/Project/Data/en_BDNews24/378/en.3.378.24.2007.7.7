 PARIS, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  'Desperate Housewives' star Eva Longoria and basketball ace Tony Parker married in a civil wedding ceremony on Friday, but well-wishers and photographers got only a fleeting glimpse of the celebrity couple. Hundreds of photographers and passersby climbed on to ladders, traffic bollards and parked scooters straining to spot the couple when they arrived to be married by the mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, in a Parisian town hall.
