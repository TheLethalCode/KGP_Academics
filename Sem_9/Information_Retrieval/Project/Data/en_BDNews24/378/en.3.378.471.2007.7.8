 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  An Indian passenger train on trial arrived in Bangladesh Sunday as part of the two neighbours' effort to restore train communications after a gap of 36 years, a Bangladeshi official said. The train, Moitree, or friendship, arrived in Darshana in western Bangladesh at 11:07am hours after it left Kolkata at 7:00am Indian local time, said Belayet Hossain, director general of the Bangladesh Railway. The train, which is carrying a 14-member Indian official delegation, left Darshana at 11:50am and is expected to reach Dhaka at 4:00pm, he said. "It is scheduled to arrive in the capital at around 4:00pm," Hossain told bdnews24.com by phone. The visiting officials will sit with Bangladeshi officials on July 9-11 in Dhaka to make a final deal for the launch of direct passenger train services between the two cities. As per a previous deal between the two countries, the regular train services are expected to begin late this month but some media reports have said it will take another month to get through. Bangladeshi officials refused to comment on the matter. Hossain said they still have some unresolved issues, and the officials from the two sides will discuss them on July 9-11. The officials will discuss the issues about how the two sides will deal with customs and immigration at borders, Hossain said. "We will make our effort to resolve the issues like the frequency of trains a week and completion of customs and immigration formalities at the borders," he said. Kolkata and Dhaka are currently connected by air and bus services. The train services stopped in 1965 following a war between India and Pakistan. The slow train is expected to cover a distance of 215 miles between Dhaka and Calcutta in 12 hours. bdnews24.com/
