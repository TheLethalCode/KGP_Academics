 LOS ANGELES, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jim Carrey, who brought Dr Seuss' Grinch to life on the big screen, will soon play another holiday curmudgeon, Ebenezer Scrooge, and three ghosts who haunt him, in a computerized remake of 'A Christmas Carol,' the Walt Disney said on Friday. Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis will direct the movie from his own script, based on the Charles Dickens classic novel, a Disney spokeswoman said.

Carrey, 45, is no stranger to playing holiday-season heavies, having starred seven years ago as the title character in the Ron Howard-directed 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' based on the popular Dr Seuss story. 'Grinch' was a huge box-office hit, but in recent years Carrey has suffered through a string of flops such as 'Fun with Dick and Jane' and 'The Number 23.' Dickens' classic tale of a bitter, old merchant given a Christmas Eve chance at redemption has been adapted many times for TV and the movies, including two Hollywood versions -- 1938's 'A Christmas Carol' starring Reginald Owen as Scrooge and 1951's 'Scrooge,' with Alastair Sim in the title ro
