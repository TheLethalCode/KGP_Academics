 LYON, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France midfielder Florent Malouda is to join Chelsea after Olympique Lyon and the English Premier League club reached an agreement, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas told Reuters on Sunday. "We have reached an agreement and Florent should be at Chelsea tomorrow (Monday)," Aulas said after a friendly match between Lyon and Lille in the French Alps resort of Albertville. The transfer fee will be around 20 millions euros ($27.19 million), a Lyon source said. The six-times French champions and Chelsea had been negotiating for weeks, Lyon first asking for 25 millions euros. Malouda, 27, has won four French titles with Lyon and was voted best Ligue 1 player last season. A member of the France squad who reached last year's World Cup final, he has played 30 internationals, scoring three goals. Chelsea executive midfielder Peter Kenyon had said on Thursday Chelsea hoped to conclude a deal for Malouda in time for him to join manager Jose Mourinho and his squad on their tour of the United States which starts on Monday. CASH DEAL Kenyon also said he expected Malouda to be their last acquisition of the close season. "I'd like to thank Peter Kenyon for having made a deal possible", Aulas said. "I am now awaiting an e-mail for confirmation. It will be paid (in) cash." A left-footed attacking midfielder, Malouda, who is both technically gifted and physically strong, had joined Lyon from French side Guingamp for 6.5 millions euros in 2003. Real Madrid had also expressed an interest in a player regarded as one of the finest France has to offer. Apparently upset that the talks were dragging on, Malouda had left Lyon's training camp in the French Alps on Wednesday. He becomes Lyon's third major player to leave during the close season after Portugal midfielder Tiago and France defender Eric Abidal, who have moved on to Juventus and Barcelona respectively. Lyon are now expected to concentrate on purchasing a top striker to help them in their bid to make an impact in Europe. In a class of their own at home for years, they have never advanced beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League
