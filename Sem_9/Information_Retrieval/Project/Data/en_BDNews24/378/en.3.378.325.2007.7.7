The announcement comes nearly two months after nutrition advocacy group the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) sued Burger King over the company's use of oil containing trans fats, saying it was the only leading restaurant chain that had not yet committed to eliminating trans fats from its menu.

Burger King shares were down 22 cents at $26.33 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchan
