 Sylhet, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government will ask the Election Commission to hold polls to the city corporations and some municipalities as soon as the electoral roll is prepared, an adviser said Friday. "Polls can be held in the areas where electoral roll will be prepared earlier," local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said. He made the comments at a discussion prior to inauguration of Bangladesh Rural Development Training Institute in Khadimnagar in Sylhet. The adviser said they hoped the national polls will be held by end-2008. "We'll ask the EC to hold city corporation polls and municipality polls after making the voter rolls." The interim government has recast the Anticorruption Commission, the Election Commission and the Public Service Commission and recovered the trust of people in the constitutional bodies, he said. The government has taken initiatives to strengthen local government, Iqbal said. "Corruption pervaded the country. We are trying to purge it of the curse." Iqbal said the government is working to hold neutral, peaceful and acceptable elections. bdnews2
