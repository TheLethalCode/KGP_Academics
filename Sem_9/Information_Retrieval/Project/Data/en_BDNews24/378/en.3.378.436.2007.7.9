 THOPPIGALA, Sri Lanka, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers will lose their last foothold in the island's restive east within days after troops captured a strategic plateau overnight, the ground commander in the area said on Monday. The military has captured vast swathes of territory from the Tigers in the east in recent months and has killed hundreds of rebel fighters since the operation to capture the landlocked area called Thoppigala in early February, the commander said.

Analysts say both the military and Tigers tend to overstate enemy losses and downplay their own. A Reuters witness saw bunker lines captured from the Tigers in Thoppigala. Troops were clearing anti-personnel mines laid by rebels in the area.

The Tigers control a large section of the island's far north and are fighting for an independent state in the north and east. Analysts say that while the rebels have lost land that they controlled in the east, historically territory has often changed hands and they see no winner on the horizon to a conflict that has killed nearly 70,000 people since 19
