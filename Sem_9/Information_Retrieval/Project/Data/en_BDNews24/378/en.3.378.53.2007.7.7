 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member RA Gani Saturday accused Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan of violating the party's constitution, saying that the council, not the media, should be the platform for placing reform proposals. Gani said the move had created confusion in the party but he was confident that it would not rupture the party. "As per the party constitution, any reform proposal must be placed before the party council," he told reporters in his Dhanmondi office. Bhuiyan, BNP secretary general, has drawn criticism from aides to party chief Khaleda Zia over the reform plan revealed days ago to the media. Khaleda also branded it as anti-party activities. The former prime minister Thursday said that action would be taken against them for their anti-party activitiesan allegation Bhuyian brushed aside Friday. Gani Saturday said everybody including the party chairperson wanted reforms. "But no reforms can take place excluding the party chairperson. It can't happen secretly," he said. Once the ban on indoor politics is gone, the party will place the reform proposals before a council session, he said. They are also thinking about how they can organise the council session, he said. Meanwhile, Bhuiyan continued his parleys with the party leaders Saturday about the party reforms and the possible council meeting. Some former lawmakers and leaders from Barisal, Bogra, Joypurhat, Rajshahi, Manikganj and Comilla met him Saturday. bdnews24.
