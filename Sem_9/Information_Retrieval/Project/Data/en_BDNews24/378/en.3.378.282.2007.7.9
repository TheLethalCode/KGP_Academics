 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Grameenphone, having above 60 percent market share until the first quarter of 2007, wants to solidify its position by diversifying with mobile internet services. GP has 14 million "Total Active" customers including 2.5 million "mobile internet" users, said the company's chief marketing officer (CMO) Stein Naevdal Monday. "We may have sold a lot more connections but 14 million subscribers have been using our network at least for the last three months," Naevdal said while explaining the methodology of measuring his latest clientele in a press briefing in Dhaka. GP has added 1.887 million customers from April to Junethe second highest net quarterly additionas it bagged 2.032 million customers a year ago in Q2 of 2006. "Continuously declining tariff coupled with mass availability of new and refurbished handsets has been fuelling the mobile phone's overall growth in Bangladesh." He said the call charges have been reduced by 78 percent since 2004 and the intensifying competition is likely to shrink it further. "Currently the lowest call charge is Tk 0.25 per minute while the highest is Tk 1.90 per minute in Bangladesh." If compared in the taka, the highest charge is Tk 3.20 and the lowest is Tk 0.20 in India. In Pakistan, the highest per minute tariff is Tk 1.40 and the lowest is Tk 0.90, GP's CMO said. Considering the current trend, he said, Bangladesh will have 50 million mobile phone users in 2009 where GP aspires to have at least 30 million customers. GP is also moving full speed ahead with a staggering 2.5 million mobile internet customers, which is much larger than the country's entire fixed internet users. Naevdal said lack of power and telecoms infrastructure in rural Bangladesh has prompted his company to respond with EDGE "to meet the huge unmet demand for data connectivity". But he refused to disclose the volume of total internet bandwidth GP consumes to cater to its 2.5 million mobile internet users. Brushing aside the Internet Service Providers' allegation of being predatory to the market, GP's CMO said his company has been doing business "strictly abiding by the law". But Naevdal admitted to subsidising the mobile internet business from his company's voice earnings. Referring to the national long distance business, he said GP has a licence from Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission to resell the optical fibre capacity it has been leasing from Bangladesh Railway. But the ISP Association of Bangladesh believes otherwise. "Grameenphone can use the Railway's telecoms infrastructure for its own operations but it does not have the licence to resell it," said ISPAB's president MA Salam quoting BTRC. bdn
