<TEXT>
 Edgbaston, 7 July (bdnewss24.com/Reuters)--- West Indies' star batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul is winning his battle to be fit for Saturday's decisive NatWest Series clash with England at Trent Bridge. And Windies coach David Moore urged the other members of the squad to look, listen and learn from the shining example of the 32-year-old run machine. Chanderpaul suffered an ankle ligament injury midway through his superb unbeaten 116 which helped the tourists win by 61 runs at Edgbaston on Wednesday to level the best of three series. He was unable to field during the England innings but has responded to treatment over the last 48 hours. Chanderpaul averaged 148.66 in the Test series and has yet to be dismissed in the current one-dayers after scoring an unbeaten 53 in the opener at Lord's last Sunday. Moore said: "The physios have worked very hard on Shiv's injury over the last couple of days and he is having a hit in the nets later today so we are very hopeful that he will be right for tomorrow. "We are very keen to have him play. It has been very advantageous for us to have Shiv playing in the role that he has played. "He is very versatile, has played exceptionally well in the Test matches and now to come out in the Twenty20s and one-dayers and also do well is fantastic. "It just shows the quality of the player. It is no fluke. We know he works very hard at his game and he is a true professional. Moore added: "The good thing about Chanderpaul is that he is always available to talk to players. He never cuts himself off. I've encouraged all the players, and not just the young boys, to speak to him. "You don't have to talk to him. You only have to look at how he trains and you will understand why he scores runs. "Obviously, he has got a level of skill to begin with but he is very committed, hits a lot of cricket balls and works very hard at his game." Moore believes winning the series would lift the confidence of his players after their woeful Test performances but insists there have been positives to take from the past fortnight irrespective of tomorrow's outcome. He said: "I think the Test matches were average but I wouldn't think you would be able to say the second half of the tour has been average for us. "In the one-dayers, we have been pretty good. We could have won both of the Twenty20 games instead of sharing them and we've won one one-dayer out of two so I think we are gong pretty well in the second part of the tour. "The Tests were disappointing but I wouldn't say it was a case of having to salvage anything from the second part of the tour. We are in pretty good shape. "It would be nice to win something away from home. The players are very focused and we can see a very good opportunity to take advantage of the situation we are in right now. "As I've been saying from day one of the tour, it has been about consistency and we have let ourselves down badly in that sense. "If we could put two good games together, it would be very good but in the big picture it would still only be two games back to back so we really need to work on our consistency." Both sides were forced to practice indoors at the National Academy at Loughborough because of the recent deluges of rain although the forecast is for improved weather on Saturda
