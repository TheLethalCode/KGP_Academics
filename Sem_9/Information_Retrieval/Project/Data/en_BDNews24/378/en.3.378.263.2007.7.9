 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Sony Ericsson Sunday launched four new phones designed to increase their ease of use. The four new entry-level phones will provide a number of facilities including camera, FM radio and a radio alarm clock. The sets have been made keeping in mind the subscribers of Bangladesh, Neeraj Bansal, head of market units for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, told bdnews24.com. "These sets are easy to use and the prices too are within reach," he said. The models, launched by the world's fourth-largest mobile phone maker at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, are K200i, K220i, J110i and J120i. The K200i has camera, a slideshow view and storage of up to 40 images. The initial market price is Tk 5,825. The K220i model has also camera with a single icon display, with the advantage of an integrated FM radio with RDS. The price is Tk 6,380. The J110i model has easy navigation. It has nine hours' talk time and space for up to 200 phone numbers. The market price is Tk 3,649. The J120i has a stereo headset and radio alarm clock. The price is Tk 3,999. The marketing manager for Sony Ericsson, Afzalul Hasan Khan, told bdnews24.com that the company has been in business in Bangladesh for the last five years. "Sony Ericsson is proceeding in a planned way to carve a niche in the huge market," he said. He also said, "Bangladesh is an important and prospective market for Sony Ericsson." The Japanese-Swedish joint venture is expected to have increased its market share to 8.9 percent last quarter from 8.4 percent in the first quarter, according to a Reuters poll. Sony Ericsson told Reuters in an interview last month it would leave the very low end of the market to its rivals, as it focuses on its popular Sony Walkman music phone and Cybershot camera phone brands. In 2006 Sony Ericsson shipped 74.8 million handsets and secured fourth rank in the global arena, preceded by Nokia, Motorola and Samsung  said Framingham, Massachusetts-based research outfit IDC. Its portfolio has long been considered replete with high-end devices, including several Walkman-branded phones and several converged mobile devices. "The success of its entry-level devices, including the J200, J300, and Z300, have brought more depth to Sony Ericsson's portfolio, extending its reach to more customers, particularly in emerging markets," IDC said. bdnews
