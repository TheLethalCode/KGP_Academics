<TITLE> Democracy excluding two top leaders wrong: Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)- Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury Saturday said that trying to practise democracy excluding the two top leaders would be wrong. Police obstructed Motia from entering Sudha Sadan when she went to meet party president Sheikh Hasina. She said that if democratic parties were made weak, militancy would become stronger. Motia said that though the Constitution is still in force, the Awami League president's movements were being controlled over the past month. She said, "I hope good sense will prevail upon the government. The restriction imposed on Sheikh Hasina has to be lifted." She said that the prevailing situation resembled a 'shackled' democracy. Though Motia was not allowed to enter Sudha Sadan, advocate Sahara Khatun and Kamrul Islam entered at around 12:30pm saying that they would have to talk with Hasina about the cases filed against her. bdnews
