 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)- A mobile court of magistrate Rokanuddowla Friday destroyed large numbers of toxic fish at the Wasa sewerage lagoon in Pagla. The mobile court Friday noon burnt about 200 kgs (5 maunds) of toxic fish with petrol. Later the burnt fish were buried. The destroyed fish included big size chital, ruhi, katla, mrigel, pangas, carp and chapila . Rokanuddowla told bdnews24.com there were about 16 lagoons of Wasa on 236 acres of land to rectify the sewer from different areas of the city. These lagoons are unfit for fish farming as toxic substances in the lagoons get into the body of fish farmed there. If these fish are consumed humans might be affected by different diseases including cholera, diarrhoea, jaundice and many long-term incurable diseases. But some local influential people have been farming fish in the lagoons since long. Every day they collect fish from the lagoons and supply them to different markets in the capital city. Fisheries adviser CS Karim on June 26 ordered the fish be destroyed after he came to know of matter. The directorate of fisheries with cooperation of mobile courts started destroying the fish of the lagoons. Rokanuddowla said until Friday fish of 11 out of 16 lagoons had been destroyed. He hoped the fish in the remaining lagoons would be destroyed in a couple of days. bdnews24.
