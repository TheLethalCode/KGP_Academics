<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  Doctors Saturday deferred chemotherapy on music icon Sabina Yasmin after she ran high temperature. Sabina, who has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma cancer, has to undergo six sessions of chemotherapy, the doctors said. Sabina was admitted to LabAid Hospital on June 12 with fever. She is now under watch of a medical board comprising medicine specialists Shirajul Haque, retired lieutenant colonel Mofazzal Hossain, Professor Khaja Nazimuddin and surgery specialist Prof Khademul Islam. LabAid's general manager (marketing) Al Imran Chowdhury said Sabina lost weight. Doctors found cyst in her lymphatic system. The biopsy report, carried out in Switzerland, said the cyst is a symptom of cancer. Sabina has long been suffering from diabetes too. Imran said Sabina might be able to return to normal life after six sessions of chemotherapy as her cancer was detected at an initial stage. Sabina's nephew Aagun, a playback singer, told bdnews24.com that they would observe her condition for one more week. "We'll decide if she has to be sent abroad for better treatment." bdnews24
