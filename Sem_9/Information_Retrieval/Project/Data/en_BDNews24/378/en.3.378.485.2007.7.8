 Dhaka, July 08 (bdnews24.com)A special tribunal deferred charge-framing in an arms case against former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar for a third time Sunday. Judge Syed Zahed Mansur of the Dhaka Metropolitan Special Tribunal9 postponed the date for charge-framing to July 15 for medical reasons. The former BNP minister is currently undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. Joint forces arrested Babar on May 28 at his Gulshan home and seized four firearms with rounds of ammunition. One of the firearms was unlicensed. Gulshan police sub-inspector Helaluddin filed the case against him for possessing illegal firearms and ammunition.
