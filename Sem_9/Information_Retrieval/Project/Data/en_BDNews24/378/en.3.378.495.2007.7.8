 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) Stocks slumped Sunday as banks, along with some heavyweights in the power and insurance sectors, plunged on profit taking. Cement stocks, except sector major Lafarge Surma, rose. Mutual funds also gained on hopes of good monthly earnings. "It's a good sign. Such a fluctuation is healthy for the market," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The DGEN or general index ended lower at 2189.95, down 8.77 points or 0.39 percent. The DSI or all-share price index shed 10.79 points or 0.59 percent to 1795.35. The DSE-20 blue chip index slumped 15.71 points or 0.83 percent to 1875.48. "Heavy profit-taking in banking stocks led the market to decline," said Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of Imtiyaz Husain Securities. Overall, however, gainers beat losers 104 to 91. Some 17 issues finished unchanged on the DSE. Turnover on the DSE slipped to Tk 1.47 billion from Thursday's Tk 1.61 billion. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange dropped amid falls in energy, banking and financial-institution stocks. Turnover also declined to Tk 229.20 million from Tk 230.53 million. Of the issues traded on the CSE, 51 gained, 49 fell and 10 held steady. On the DSE, Summit Power, Grameen1 mutual fund, AIMS 1st mutual fund, Heidelberg Cement and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh ruled the turnover table. Summit Power advanced 1.33 percent to Tk 945.5 on speculation of good earnings after it won government approval to establish four small power plants with a generation capacity of 100 MW. Summit registered Tk 79.44 million in turnover. Anticipation of attractive net asset value encouraged Grameen1 MF and AIMS 1st MF to finish higher. Grameen1 climbed 6.31 percent to Tk 52.2. AIMS 1st advanced 4.91 percent to Tk 5.12. Grameen1 MF and AIMS 1st MF scored Tk 73.49 million and Tk 70.45 million in turnover respectively. Heidelberg Cement gained 4.52 percent to Tk 1298 on higher demands. Power Grid ended 0.67 percent lower at Tk 592.5 due to profit taking. Saiham Textile, Mithun Knitwear and Meghna Cement topped the gainers. IBN Sina, Phoenix Insurance and Green Delta Insurance were the main losers. bdn
