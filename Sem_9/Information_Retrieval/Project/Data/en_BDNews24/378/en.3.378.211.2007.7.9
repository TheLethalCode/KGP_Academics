 PARIS, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares moved higher on Monday, following a rise in US and Asian shares after buoyant US jobs figures reassured investors on the health of the world's biggest economy, while Numico jumped on takeover talk. Miners were among the biggest gainers, advancing on a rally in metal prices and after an upbeat note from JPMorgan on the outlook for the commodities. Anglo American rose 1.1 percent, and BHP Billiton climbed 1.6 percent. At 0857 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.3 percent at 1,624.13 points. The benchmark index has gained 9.6 percent so far this year. "The job numbers were pretty good and they confirmed the view that the American economy is regaining momentum," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of research at Brewin Dolphin Securities, in London. "It has gone through a very weak phase, but now the fact that it's picking up steam will be good for the third- and fourth-quarter corporate results," he said. "The valuation for the equity market in general, and for the UK market in particular, is still very good." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index added 0.14 percent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.24 percent. In Amsterdam, Dutch food group Numico NV rose more than 8 percent to reach a six-year high on market talk of interest in the company from French food group Danone. A report in France's Journal des Finances on Monday also noted Danone was interested in Numico, while other articles over the weekend cited interest from PepsiCo. Danone declined to comment. Dutch chemical distributor Univar NV shot up 36 percent after receiving a cash takeover bid from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. Tate & Lyle gained 3.5 percent after Credit Suisse upgraded its rating on the British sugar and sweeteners maker to "outperform" from "neutral" and raised its price target to 640 pence from 630 pence. On the downside, Next dropped 1.2 percent after HSBC downgraded its rating on the clothing retailer to "underweight" from "neutral" and trimmed its price target to 2,050 pence from 2,300 pence. On the macroeconomic front, investors were digesting weaker-than-expected British factory gate inflation for June, while in Germany, Federal Statistics Office data showed the country's trade surplus widened by more than expected in May as imports fell more than exports. The Japanese yen slipped to a record low against the euro and to its weakest in a decade and a half versus sterling and the Australian dollar as investors sold the low-yielding currency for higher return asse
