She starts as overwhelming favourite against an opponent who has never before progressed beyond the third round of a grand slam, but the inexperienced 22-year-old was similarly discounted on Friday. Before the women's showpiece, men's champion Roger Federer must dispose of another in-form French player when Andy Roddick's conqueror, Richard Gasquet attempts to halt the top seed's pursuit of a record-equalling fifth consecutive Wimbledon crown.
