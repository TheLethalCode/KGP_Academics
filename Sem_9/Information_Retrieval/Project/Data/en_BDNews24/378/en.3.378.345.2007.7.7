 ISLAMABAD, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Members of Pakistani religious parties hoped to hold talks on Saturday with a radical cleric holed up in an Islamabad mosque and persuade him to send out children among his hundreds of besieged militant followers. Heavy gunfire and explosions rocked the city early on Saturday as the militant students in the fortified mosque and Islamic school compound battled security forces after their Taliban-supporting leader defied government orders to surrender. The fortified Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, has been under siege by hundreds of troops and police since Tuesday when months of tension boiled over into clashes between the militants and security forces. At least 20 people have been killed. "We want the government to end this action. We also want the Lal Masjid authorities to stop being so stubborn and hand over the children," said member of parliament Samia Raheel Qazi. The cleric leading the militants, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, rejects government accusations he is holding women and children as human shields. But said he would meet the delegation in his mosque. Ghazi said he and the followers would lay down guns but would never accept arrest. "I fully stand by my position, there's no question of arrests," Ghazi told Reuters early on Saturday, speaking over the crack of rifle fire. He said three students were killed on Friday. Smoke and the orange glow of fire rose from the mosque early on Saturday during a heavy exchange of fire. One member of the security forces was killed, said witnesses who saw the body, although authorities denied any casualties. Water, gas and power to the mosque have been cut and food was said to be getting scarce. About 1,200 students left the mosque after the clashes began but only a trickle of about 20 came out on Friday, among them a boy who said older students were forcing young ones to stay. Authorities say they have blasted holes in the compound's walls to enable people to flee. Security forces have also occupied another city madrasa affiliated with the Lal Masjid. TENSIONS RISE Tension between authorities and clerics at the mosque had been rising since January when students, most of whom in their 20s and 30s, launched a campaign to impose strict Islam and stamp out what they see as vice. They kidnapped people they accused of involvement in prostitution, intimidated shopkeepers selling Western videos, abducted policemen and threatened to unleash suicide bombers if they were suppressed. Moderate politicians and the media had urged President Pervez Musharraf to intervene to end the standoff. Musharraf has not commented publicly on the siege but has urged security agencies to allow time for parents to take children out. On Friday, gunmen fired from a roof-top under the flight path from Islamabad's military airport as Musharraf was flying off to inspect flood damage in the south. An intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the shots were an unsuccessful attempt on the president's life. But the government said there appeared to be no link between the shooting and Musharraf's flight. US ally Musharraf survived two assassination attempts by al Qaeda-linked militants in 2003. Adding to a sense of foreboding over risks posed to stability by militants in nuclear-armed Pakistan, a suicide bomber killed six soldiers on Friday in a northwestern region. Many Pakistanis have welcomed the government's move against a movement reminiscent of the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan, and symptomatic of the religious extremism seeping into cities from tribal border areas. Ghazi's elder brother and chief cleric, Abdul Aziz, was caught trying to flee disguised in a burqa and later called on followers to give up. Aziz said there were 850 students inside, Ghazi said 1,900.
