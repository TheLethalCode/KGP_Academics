 KOLKATA, India, Sat Jul 7, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people were marooned in India on Saturday as monsoon rains continued to ravage parts of the country, sparking fresh flooding. In Kolkata, the biggest city in eastern India, water was receding from some streets but in other areas of the city stagnant water was posing a serious health risk. "We are still concerned about waterlogging in some streets as it could trigger water-borne diseases," Sanchita Bakshi, a top health official said in Kolkata, capital of the communist-ruled state of West Bengal.

In the western state of Rajasthan, water breached a portion of a century-old dam, but authorities said they had the situation under control. A national highway was closed as a precautionary measure. "The villages are safe, but people were being moved to higher ground," Kiran Soni Gupta, a senior government official, said.
