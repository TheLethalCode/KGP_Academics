<TEXT>
 Edgbaston, July 8 (bdnews24.com/reuters)--- Paul Collingwood admitted England have much work to do to become a top one-day side after losing the NatWest Series decider to the West Indies at Trent Bridge. England crashed to a 93-run setback and were outplayed in all departments by the revitalised tourists who had been hammered 3-0 in the recent npower Test series. It was not the start Collingwood was looking for as England's new limited overs captain and he has urged his players to learn from the experience. He said: "I think we readily admit we've got a lot of work to do to become a top one-day side, simple as that. "It was a great win at Lord's in the first game but, as long as we learn from this series, that is how we will move forward. "This series will count for nothing unless we can do that, look at where we can improve, look at the skills we need to improve on individually, go away and work on them and hopefully come back better cricketers. "I knew it was going to be a tough series and the West Indies came out and played a lot of fantastic cricket and you have to give a lot of credit to them as well. "They've played some really aggressive cricket as well, especially on the bowling front, and hopefully our young guys watching that kind of cricket learnt a lot from that." England found it impossible to contain the Windies as they hammered 116 off the last 10 overs at Trent bridge and 102 during the same period at Edgbaston three days earlier. But Collingwood said: "It is more than just the last 10 overs we need to look at. As long as we go away as a group of players and learn, make sure we nail those kind of things next time around, and work on our skills individually. "When you lose matches, you learn from your mistakes more than when you are winning all the time. Hopefully we can do that and go away and improve as individuals and as a team." Collingwood admitted: "I've learnt a lot in the last two weeks as captain. It's been enjoyable. It's been an eye opener! "What has been great has been all the effort from all of the lads and, although we've lost, you can't take anything away from the effort and preparation. "Things aren't built overnight and we will keep on building this base and hopefully improve in the future.
