 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Session Initiation Protocol or SIP services will dominate the world's telecom markets by 2012, said a recent study of ABI Research. It predicts nearly 1.2 billion SIP-based VoIP users will be subscribing to several forms of messaging and video sharing driven by the interest in user-generated content. SIP is a standard protocol for initiating an interactive user session that involves multimedia elements such as video, voice, chatting, gaming, and virtual reality. "This will generate over $150 billion in service revenue annually with cumulative infrastructure capital expenditure of over $10 billion by that date," said New York-based ABI's report The Worldwide SIP Services Market. A move to all-IP networks is the chosen path for introducing new services, with next generation network or NGN being the ultimate goal. "The path to this all-IP goal is complicated: migrating existing services onto IP networks while retaining resources until they can be taken out of service is not a straightforward process," cautioned ABI Research analyst Ian Cox. He said the mobile operators' voice services are already optimized to reduce network traffic, and the move to VoIP is not an easy choice until the introduction of long term evolution (LTE) or high speed packet access (HSPA) technologies. One method that has gained some momentum is to use an IP overlay based on SIP. "This allows new services to be designed and launched using a well-supported standard that also opens the way to bring Web services, service delivery platforms, and ultimately IMS into the network." Cox further said, "Using SIP, telephony becomes another Web application, which can be integrated into other Internet services. It allows service providers to build converged voice and multimedia services." Additional services supported by SIP will include presence, click-to-dial, buddy lists, email and Web access which are assumed to be "core" services and will be included as standard in any service offering, and bundled with broadband access. A portion of the VoIP users will also be connected to a fixed-mobile convergence service. Technology majors like Cisco, Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, Microsoft, Nokia, IBM, Nortel, Wipro and others are heavily backing SIP as their preferred arsenal to conquer tomorrow's telecoms frontiers. bdn
