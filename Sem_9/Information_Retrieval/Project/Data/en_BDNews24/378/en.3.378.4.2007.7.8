 BANGALORE, India, Sun Jul 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian police said on Sunday they had seized CDs containing material about the Islamist conflicts in Chechnya and Iraq from the home of two Indian suspects in the car bomb plot in Britain. A senior police official said officers had found the CDs in the family home of Kafeel Ahmed, 27, and his brother Sabeel, 26, both arrested by British police in relation to the plot. "Some CDs are about the Islamic struggle in Chechnya and Iraq. We are examining the CDs for Jihadi content," said a police officer, closely associated with the investigations into the two men. The officer did not want his name made public. "Emails sent by the brothers are also being looked into for any terror linkage," said the official. "Their complicity in the terror link has not been established yet." A computer that police say was used by Kafeel and Sabeel was also seized by investigating officers from their home in a middle-class residential area of Bangalore, police said. Police have been questioning family members of the two men in the information technology hub, including their parents, both of whom are doctors. Kafeel, who studied engineering in India, suffered critical burns in the attack on Glasgow airport in Scotland where witnesses said he set both himself and the crashed jeep on fire. Sabeel, a doctor, was arrested in Liverpool eight days ago. A third Indian suspect, another doctor from Bangalore, was arrested in Australia and remains in detention. A total of eight people have been arrested in the plot, either from the Middle East or India. Seven were arrested in Britain and one in Australia. Indian police said authorities in Bangalore were also investigating whether the U.K. car bombing plot was conceived or planned in the southern Indian city. "All angles are being looked into. Investigations are continuing," Police Commissioner Achuta Rao said, adding British police had not sought information from the Bangalore police. The lawyer for Kafeel and Sabeel's parents described the elderly couple's questioning by Indian police as "routine". British intelligence services are working with international counterparts to establish the extent of the suspected involvement by Osama bin Laden's network or its Iraqi arm in the failed car bombin
