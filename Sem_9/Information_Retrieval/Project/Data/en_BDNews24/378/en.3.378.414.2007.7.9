 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday stayed for three months the proceedings of a narcotics case against former law minister Moudud Ahmed. The High Court vacation bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and AFM Abdur Rahman also asked the government to explain within four weeks why the case proceedings would not be quashed. Joint forces arrested Moudud, a BNP policymaker, in his home on April 13. Police filed a case with Gulshan Police Station the same day claiming to have seized nine bottles of foreign spirits from his home. On June 18, the Court of Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge framed charges against Moudud under section 25B of Special Powers Act on the allegation of selling alcohol. Moving Moudud's quashment petition, Advocate Azizul Haque argued in court that the charge was unfounded since there was no allegation of selling alcohol in the FIR, charge sheet or any other document of the case. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed argued that there were allegations of selling alcohol against the former lawmaker. Allegation was also there of possessing illegal alcohol against him which was a crime under Narcotics Control Ordinance. bdnew
