 BEIJING, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nearly 2,000 officials in a central Chinese province violated the country's one child policy, including a lawmaker who had four children by four mistresses, state media said on Sunday. For more than 25 years, the world's most populous country has limited most couples to one, or in some cases two children, as it sought to control its ballooning population, now at 1.3 billion.

Several officials were exposed when graft probes revealed they kept mistresses.

China credits family planning laws with preventing 400 million births and boosting prosperity in a country with a fifth of the world's population but only seven percent of its land. The family-planning policy has exacerbated a gender imbalance in China, where access to ultrasound tests and gender-selective abortions have resulted in 118 boys born for every 100 girls. Xinhua noted there were increasing reports of officials, tycoons and entertainment stars having more than one child, and blamed local authorities who feared issuing fines or were too lenient.
