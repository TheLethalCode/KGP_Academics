 LONDON, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown led a flower-laying ceremony at Kings Cross station on Saturday morning to mark the second anniversary of the July 7 London suicide bombings. Brown, along with London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Minister for London Tessa Jowell, laid wreaths at the station to mark the first of the four explosions in 2005. Survivors and relatives of victims laid their own floral tributes at the station, some in the shape of the number seven. The low-key event was at the request of families of those who were killed or seriously injured in the explosions on three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus. The bombings killed 52 people as well as the four Islamists who carried them out and a further 700 people were injured. It was the highest toll from a bombing in the UK since the death of 270 people in the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie disaster. In February, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced that a permanent memorial to the 52 dead would be installed in Hyde Park.
