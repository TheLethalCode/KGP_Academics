<TITLE> Hasina slams intelligence agents </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina Sunday said the role of an intelligence agency was not to break up political parties. "It cannot be accepted that intelligence agents in a civilised society will run the show, detain political leaders and make them say what they like to hear," Hasina said. An angry Hasina fired the barbs of blame on intelligence agents and, largely, the government in a briefing to reporters after she had visited music icon Sabina Yasmin in LabAid Hospital. Hasina categorically blamed the DGFI (Directorate General of Forces Intelligence) for "intimidating political leaders into divulging details". "I asked my colleagues to say what they have to say to save their lives," Hasina said. "Stop it," she asked the emergency government. "The roles of intelligence agencies are to protect the country and ensure security," she said. She said intelligence agents are not meant to engage in politics, form a new political party from behind the scenes by breaking up the old ones. Hasina said: "The present caretaker government was the result of our street struggle for months." "We were in the movement to win back people's power and ensure neutral election. Now no work is being done for the welfare of people," she said. She said a government that came to power without election could not address people's issues if they stay in power for long. "Such a government can't decrease people's problem, rather they increase," she said. "The country needs democracy. People's problem can never be solved without a democratic government." In her briefing, she raised the issues of price hike of everyday essentials, saying the government had failed to address the problem. "Rice sold at Tk 10 a kg and soybean at Tk 28 a litre when I was in office. If we could do that why this government could not do that? The prices have upped manifold but not the people's income." "Burglaries and muggings are on the rise because of unemployment. Security in public life is being hampered." "During my tenure we reduced the import duty on different items such as phone, fax and computer and created employments." "We were in the government for five years. After expiry of our term nobody could raise any allegation of corruption. But now they are hell-bent to brand us corrupt," she said. In her reaction to the proposed reforms to the 58-year-old party, Hasina said: "Is there anything to react to that? The party will decide it. Reform is a continuous process." "The Awami League made me the party president in my absence. They brought me in for the need of the party." She accused the government of diverting people's attention in the name of reforms. The outspoken leader also came down hard on the government for lodging case against 5,000 fertiliser-starved farmers in Nachole of Chapainawabagnj. bdnews
