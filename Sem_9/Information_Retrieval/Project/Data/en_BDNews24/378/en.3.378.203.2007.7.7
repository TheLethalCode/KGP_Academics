 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  Scope for cooperatives as an institutional structure is fading in the wake of withdrawal of assistance by donors and the government, speakers said at a discussion Saturday. The cooperatives are no more considered an important tool of social change in an era of foreign aid-dependent development projects, they said. They blamed the past governments for not giving enough policy support to the cooperatives, considering it an important tool of the economy. Their comments came at the discussion organised to commemorate the International Day of Cooperatives by Samabay Unnayan Forum at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. Prof Tofael Ahmed of the Public Administration Department of Chittagong University presented a paper, "Future of cooperatives in Bangladesh: Draft of a roadmap". Ahmed said the legal framework and bureaucratic control over the cooperatives have been tough while nongovernmental organisations and the private sector are getting privilege. "Gradually the government and the donors are lifting their support and financial assistance from cooperatives, which is discouraging," Ahmed said in his paper. He said currently the NGO activities have become the part of the country's development programmes, and an effort to establish such activities as alternatives to cooperatives are visible. He said in the country cooperatives movement has been seen as a government initiative instead of people's effort for years. Referring to the developed countries, he said, a report of the European Commission published in 2004 showed that in the European Union nations 300,000 cooperatives provided employment to 23,00000 people and more than 14 crore people are active member of these cooperatives. "This proves that the cooperatives are still relevant and have much prospect," he said. He demanded the government make the cooperatives-related laws contemporary. Economist Muzaffer Ahmed said cooperatives have a special space in the developed world as a prospective sector. But the sector has been pushed back in the developing world for political reasons. Muzaffar said the cooperatives are still very much pertinent to the country's development since there is a huge scope both for consumers and entrepreneurs to benefit in the fields of education, health, housing and agriculture. It could also stop the menace of middlemen between the producers and the users of goods. Former caretaker government adviser Dhiraj Kumar Nath said education and proper publicity about the cooperatives could encourage people. Cooperatives in Bangladesh mean a series of organised activities with a common goal and refer to economic enterprises for the benefit of service users. Cooperative societies had increased phenomenally following the establishment of Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development in the 1960s. Later, NGOs have started playing an important role, which cooperative societies did in development. bdnews
