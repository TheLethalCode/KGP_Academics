 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government has no other option than to enhance gas prices, energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury said Monday. The adviser briefing reporters in his office said the government is also worried at the pace of increasing international oil prices. The price of crude petroleum was a little over 72 dollars a barrel until Sunday and Bangladesh imports two consignments of petroleum products every month, he said. The adviser said the government's position was to increase or decrease oil prices matching the international market trends. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) lost Tk 165 crore only in June due to price hikes in the international market, he added. Price differences between the domestic and international markets for diesel stand at Tk 9.54 per litre and for kerosene Tk 9.86. Asked if the government plans to enhance fuel prices, the adviser said a number of aspects and options are being considered. On increasing gas prices, Chowdhury said the price of compressed natural gas (CNG) has to be increased to reduce the yawning gap between the prices of one litre of petroleum product and a cubic metre of CNG. A ministry official seeking anonymity said Petrobangla has been incurring losses every month as it has to buy gas from the foreign companies at an enhanced price and sell the same compulsively at a much lower rate. bdnews24.com/a
