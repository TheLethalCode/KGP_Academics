<TEXT>
 Colombo, July 8 (bdnews24.com) - It was a largely uneventful birthday for Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful who turned 23 on Saturday. The star batsman fresh from fantastic unbeaten 129 in the second Test, the value of which multiplied in importance considering the face-saving significance of it, spent some time encouraging the Bangladesh Under 19 team who are playing a three-day match against their Sri Lankan counterparts at the Colombo Colts Ground. With no training on Saturday and the captain and other players mostly passed the time resting at the hotel There was a dinner invitation for the team and the hosts learned there that it had coincided with Ashraful's birthday, according to tigercricket.com, an official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). "Another precious year is lost from life. That's how I look at it," joked Ashraful before saying, "No seriously, I am very thankful to God for everything He has given me. This birthday is special because I am celebrating it as the captain of the Bangladesh cricket team." Ashraful is a much sought after figure in Sri Lanka. He is recognized everywhere he goes from kids to elders and there is a genuine show of respect for his ability. "Sri Lankans love him. They remember him from his debut hundred here six years ago," said Samantha Algama, the media manager for Sri Lanka Cricket and an Ashraful fan. Meanwhile, batsman Mehrab Hossain (Jr.) bid his teenage life bye on Sunday turning 20. The left-handed Mehrab made his Test debut last week. The team has arranged a secret bash for both the captain and Mehrab and it is likely to happen once the Tigers reach Kandy on Sunday for the third and final Test. The team leaves Colombo for Kandy at 9:30am local time and it will be 3-4 hours bus ride. Batsman Tushar Imran arrived in Colombo on Saturday to bolster the Test side.
