<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday said mistrust was a major constraint for developing regional cooperation in South Asia. "Political mistrust among neighbours is a major obstacle to Saarc," Azizul said at a ceremony to mark the launch of a book at Sonargaon Hotel. Addressing the function as chief guest, the adviser said South Asia has long been neglected by the other regions of the world. "And very recently the region has received attention of others because of its individual performance in economic growth, poverty reduction and human resource development." Mistrust remains. "Every country in the region should cooperate for collective gains," the adviser said. "But India has a dominant role in terms of economy and technology." "All the countries in the region have to change their mindset to reap maximum benefits." On foreign direct investment, Azizul said FDI could not contribute significantly to GDP growth in many economic zones, except for Hong Kong and Singapore. Former adviser to the caretaker government Dr Akbar Ali Khan and Bangladesh Enterprise Institute president Farooq Sobhan said a lack of connectivity was a major bottleneck in South Asia. Titled "South Asia: Growth and Regional Integration", the book was edited jointly by Sadiq Ahmed, a director for the South Asian region of the World Bank and Ejaz Ghani. Khan however criticised the editors for ignoring the poverty issue in the book. Sadiq Ahmed said South Asia has to expand its knowledge economy to raise productivity. World Bank country director Xian Zhu and Prof Muzaffar Ahmed were present among others at the function. bd
