<TITLE> Confusion surfaces over retailing hours </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government issued no official circular even two days after the cabinet made a decision to allow shops and shopping malls to remain open until 8pm, creating confusion among retailers. Some businessmen are keeping their shops open until 8pm while others, unwilling to take any risk, are closing their shops by 7pm in keeping with an earlier directive. A meeting of the council of advisers made the decision Saturday easing the restrictions on shopping, but no timeline was given on when it would come into effect. The council of advisers decided to extend the shopping hours subject to conditions. Shop owners will be required to limit their use of power by using fluorescent or power-saving bulbs as well as limiting their use of air-conditioning. Energy and power adviser Tapan Chowdhury told reporters Monday: "The circular regarding retailing hours will be issued in a day or two. The file is awaiting the chief adviser's approval." The original government order, designed to save power, came into effect from Feb 25. Following the order all mega shops, shopping malls, markets and roadside shops closed by 7pm. However pharmacies, restaurants, kitchen markets, small local shops as well as emergency service providers were kept out of the purview of the decision. bdnews24.c
