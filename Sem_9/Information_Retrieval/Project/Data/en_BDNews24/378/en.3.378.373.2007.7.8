 LONDON, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies crushed England for the second time in a week as the hosts lost the one-day series 2-1 at Trent Bridge. The tourists capitalised expertly on some wild bowling, putting on 116 off the last 10 overs for a total of 289-5. Chris Gayle and Runako Morton both made 82, Dwayne Bravo 42 off 24 balls with Stuart Broad taking 0-71 in nine overs. Daren Powell with 4-40, including Kevin Pietersen for a duck, and Fidel Edwards with 3-30 were superb as England were bowled out for 196 to lose by 93 runs. The innings had reached the 45th over when Ravi Rampaul trapped Monty Panesar lbw. So it's back to the drawing-board for coach Peter Moores and captain Paul Collingwood as they assess two disappointing performances - with the prospect of a much tougher seven-match series against India in the offing. Gayle won the toss against an England side showing two changes from the team that lost the second match of the series at Edgbaston. The return of Panesar and Liam Plunkett - at the expense of Ryan Sidebottom and Michael Yardy - gave the hosts the same side who had succeeded in the series opener at Lord's. West Indies retained the same XI who had played in both previous matches. Anderson struck a blow for team morale in the third over to oust Devon Smith, edging a drive to Ian Bell at backward point. But England, who endured a moderate day in the field, soon found themselves under pressure. Alastair Cook, at short extra cover, could not cling on to a firmly struck drive from Gayle in the very next over, but it was Bell's drop of Gayle on 20 which was the major error. Anderson, in the middle of a spell of 1-17 from six overs, cramped the Jamaican left-hander for room and the ball looped straight towards the Warwickshire man at point. But Bell completely misread its flight and barely got his hands to the chance. A flurry of runs followed, including a straight six from Shivnarine Chanderpaul off Panesar. Chanderpaul's summer of plenty came to an end when he fell for 33, however. It was his lowest score in the seven matches of varying lengths he had played against England. Trying to pull the first ball of Plunkett's third over, he got a big top-edge and Pietersen took a good catch after having to run back almost to the boundary from his position at mid-wicket. After Plunkett had removed Marlon Samuels cheaply, West Indies were not ideally placed at 108-3 in the 23rd over. But as they had done at Edgbaston, they showed plenty of patience in electing to accrue runs quietly before a final onslaught. On a luckier day for England, Dimitri Mascarenhas may have seen the thin edge from Morton, then on four, snaffled by Matt Prior standing up to the stumps. Instead, Gayle and Morton stretched their partnership as far as the last ball of the 42nd over, by which time they had added 85. The final few overs, featuring repeated bowling changes, were a chaotic medley of wides, long-hops and full tosses, with Broad and Anderson each throwing a beamer into the mix. Morton hit two fours and a six off a Stuart Broad over, and the same bowler then conceded 19 off his ninth and final set of six. The running between the wickets was brilliant, England's fielding just as ragged as their bowling. The last 10 overs cost 116 runs. But it may well be asked why the admirably accurate Mascarenhas only bowled eight overs and Panesar six, with Collingwood bowling two of the last seven. Cook and Prior had not produced a half-century partnership in their four previous opening stands in limited-overs cricket and they failed again. Powell had Prior nibbling outside the off-stump, before adding his partner when Cook picked out backward point. The first ball faced by Pietersen was a vicious bouncer which produced four byes. But the trade-off for Powell was highly satisfactory - the next ball was driven by the batsman to the slip cordon. After a brilliant Edwards over featuring five dot balls and the wicket of an uncomfortable Bell for 27, Shah and Collingwood had to come up with something. They produced a 72-run stand in good time before Shah was caught behind for 51 attempting one of his inventive sweep shots off Dwayne Smith. That ended any lingering hopes of a heroic England win, and in any case four further wickets, including Collingwood for 44, fell in a heap. It left final pair Panesar and Anderson facing fields of six slips and a gully. Surprisingly, the duo put on 25 to eclipse much of the efforts of previous partnerships, but they couldn't even wallpaper over the cracks in England's battin
