 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) - A four-wicket haul from Champa powered the Bangladesh national women cricket team to a convincing 7-wicket win over Thailand in a practice match at Bangkok Pata School ground Saturday. After being put in to bowl first, Bangladesh restricted the hosts to 51 for nine in the stipulated 30 overs as no Thai player touched the double-digit figure. Champa was the pick of the attack with four for five runs and Chamely and Tithy chipped in with two wickets apiece for two and seven runs. In reply, Bangladesh reached home scoring 52 losing three wickets in 15.5 overs with Chamily topscoring with 24. Bangladesh, who defeated Thailand in the first practice match by 90 runs Friday, leave for Malaysia Monday to take part in the eight-nation ACC Women's Cricket tournament which begins in Johor Baru on Wednesday.
