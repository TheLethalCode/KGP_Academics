 Brahmanbaria, July 6 (bdnews24.com)- Zia Fertiliser Factory in Brahmanbaria resumed production from 3pm Friday after a closure of six days in a row due to mechanical problems. General manager of the factory Habibullah Chowdhury said production of gas in the ammonia plant stopped from June 28 because of compressor overheating. Production at the factory continued for two days with the ammonia reserve, but it had to be closed completely when the reserve ran out on June 30. After a six-day attempt, the mechanical problem was solved and production returned to normal Friday afternoon. The factory with a daily production capacity of 1,600 metric tons of urea suffered a loss of about Tk 4 crore in lost production, Chowdhury said. bdnews24.c
