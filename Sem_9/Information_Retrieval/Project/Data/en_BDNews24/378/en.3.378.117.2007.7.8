 ISLAMABAD Sat Jul 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani commandos raided the compound of a mosque on Sunday where militants are holding out, blasting holes in a perimeter wall in the hope hundreds of women and children can escape, the military said. The militants in the compound of the mosque and a girls' religious school, or madrasa, responded with heavy fire and the commander of the unit that mounted the attack was killed, said military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad. Hundreds of troops have been surrounding the Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, in Islamabad since Tuesday when clashes between armed students and security forces began after months of tension. President Pervez Musharraf said on Saturday the militants and their defiant cleric leader had no choice but to surrender. If not, they would be killed. Security forces have not mounted a full-scale assault on the compound because of fears for the safety of hundreds of women and children who the government says are being held as human shields. Instead, troops have been blasting holes in the wall to provide escape routes for those inside. Gunfire erupted shortly after 1 a.m. (4:00 p.m. on Saturday) and about 20 minutes later three big blasts sounded across the capital as the commandos blew up the wall of the madrasa. "We've already made four or five holes and tonight also two or three holes were made," Waheed said. "While these operations were being carried there was intense firing from the militants," he said. The unit commander was killed and one commando wounded. The death toll in the standoff since Tuesday is at least 21. The cleric leading the Lal Masjid's Taliban-style movement, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, said up to 80 people had been killed inside his compound. The government dismissed that. Ghazi has refused to surrender, saying he would prefer "martyrdom". He also rejected the accusations he was holding women and children as human shields. The Lal Masjid has been a hotbed of militancy for years, known for its support for the Taliban in Afghanistan and opposition to Musharraf's backing for the US led campaign against terrorism. Fifty to 60 hard-core militants were believed to be leading the fighting, officials said. Musharraf, in his first public comment on the confrontation, said the militants had no option but to surrender. "If they don't surrender, I'm saying it here, they will be killed," Musharraf told reporters. "We've shown great patience because we don't want people to be killed." Water, gas and power to the mosque were cut and food was said to be running short. Security forces have occupied another city madrasa linked to the Lal Masjid. Ghazi said he and his followers would lay down their weapons but would never accept arrest. "If compromise means bowing down it's unacceptable to my boys, my girls and me," he told ARY Television. About 1,200 students left the mosque after the clashes began but only about 20 have come out since Friday. Waheed said some had slipped out of the breaches troops were making. Officials said they did not know how many people remained inside but there could be up to 2,000. Many Pakistanis support the action against the hardliners whose behavior, including a vigilante campaign against perceived vice, raised concern about the spread of militant Islam. Islamist politicians have called for an end to the siege and for Ghazi to send out the women and childr
