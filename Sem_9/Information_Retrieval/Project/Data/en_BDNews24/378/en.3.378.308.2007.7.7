 Tokyo/Sydney, July 7 (BBC News) -- Sydney and Tokyo began a worldwide sequence of Live Earth concerts Saturday, aimed at raising awareness of climate change. About 150 acts will be seen in nine cities, with events now under way at London's Wembley Stadium and in Shanghai, Johannesburg and Hamburg. Among the biggest names taking part in Live Earth are Madonna and The Police. The event is organised by former US Vice-President Al Gore, who described it as the start of a three-year campaign to try to "heal the planet". Organisers say the gigs will reach an audience of two billion people via TV, radio and online broadcasts. But critics have said it was hypocritical for performers who fly around the world on tours to push the message of cutting down on carbon emissions. The Sydney event began with a traditional aboriginal welcome before Gore appeared on video screens to launch the worldwide initiative. Australian politician and former Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett also made an appearance, saying it was up to citizens of developed nations to push for action to reduce pollution. "Your voice matters, make it heard," he said. Reformed New Zealand group Crowded House were joined by many of the other Sydney performers at the end of their set, for a rendition of the 1991 hit Weather with You. Lead singer Neil Finn told fans they were "the groundswell" for action on the environment. The Tokyo event was opened by the band Genki Rockets at the Makuhari Messe hall, east of the Japanese capital. Gore appeared as a hologram in front of the crowd, saying: "Now is the time to begin to heal the planet." Among the performers in Tokyo was US metal group Linkin Park. "I don't have any delusions of grandeur that Linkin Park is saving the world," bassist Phoenix told BBC News. "But it's our goal to do what we can to make it possible for our kids to have a place to live, and, at the same time, hopefully clean up where we live in the process." Japanese singer Ayaka urged people to do what they could. "We can start helping by doing something small," she said. "I started to carry my own eco-bag so I don't have to use plastic grocery bags, and use my own chopsticks instead of disposable ones." The gig at London's Wembley Stadium will feature Madonna, Duran Duran and the Beastie Boys. Music from the concert is being broadcast live in the UK on BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Radio 2. However there has also been scepticism about the value of the concerts from some quarters. Critics say that flying rock stars in on aeroplanes and using a great deal of electricity to power several concerts sends out mixed messages about energy conservation. George Marshall of the Climate Outreach Information Network told the BBC: "Having the richest people in the world saying, 'Hey! We all need to cut back a bit!' is, let's face it, absurd." And John Buckley, managing director of Carbon Footprint, said pop stars such as Madonna should be leading by example and changing their own travelling habits, especially when on tour or with an entourage. "The difference between a private jet and taking a commercial flight could lead to a 50 per cent reduction [in emissions], which is pretty worthwhile," he told Reuters. Organisers have insisted they were keeping the concerts as green as possible, with proceeds being spent on power-efficient light bulbs and other measures to offset the shows' emissions. "We've booked this show with acts that were touring in the area at the time so we could keep the carbon imprint down," explained producer Kevin Wall.
