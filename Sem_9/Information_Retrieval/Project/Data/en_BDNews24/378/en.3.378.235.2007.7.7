<TITLE> Islamist militants killed Lebanon minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese investigators have concluded that al Qaeda-inspired militants killed a Christian Lebanese minister late last year, a Lebanese newspaper reported on Saturday. An-Nahar daily said results of the investigation into the Nov. 21 assassination of Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel would be made public soon and would show proof against Fatah al-Islam militants. It gave little other details and there was no comment on the report from the authorities or the group. Gemayel was gunned down while driving in a Christian suburb of Beirut. The country's ruling coalition, to whom Gemayel's Phalange Party belongs, accused Damascus of his killing. Syria denied any links. Lebanon has been hit by a wave of assassinations and bombings since late 2004. A UN investigation team, set up after the 2005 killing of ex-premier Rafik al-Hariri, is looking into the attacks. The UN Security Council set up last month a special court to try any indicted suspects. Lebanese troops are battling Fatah al-Islam militants at a refugee camp in north Lebanon since May 20. More than 200 people have been killed in the fighting at Nahr al-Bared. Lebanese investigators found a car suspected of being used in Gemayel's murder last month during a crackdown against militants across the north, security sources have said. The authorities had blamed Fatah al-Islam for a twin bus bombings in a Christian area near Beirut on February 13, killing three civilians. The group has denied any links. The anti-Syrian government says the group is nothing more than a tool of Syrian intelligence. Damascus and Fatah al-Islam denies this. The group says it agrees with the ideology of al Qaeda, though it has no organisational ties to it. Some of its members -- mainly Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis -- have fought in Iraq.
