 JAKARTA, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 14 people were killed and 47 injured on Saturday when a bus carrying school students plunged into a ravine near the Indonesian capital, police said. The bus rammed into several cars and motorcycles before plunging into the 20-metre (65-feet) deep ravine in Ciloto, about 60 km (37 miles) south of Jakarta, local police chief Syaiful Zachri said. "It appears that the bus had tried to overtake another vehicle and its brake failed," he told Reuters. Most of the dead were junior high school students who were on a school holiday tour, he said.
