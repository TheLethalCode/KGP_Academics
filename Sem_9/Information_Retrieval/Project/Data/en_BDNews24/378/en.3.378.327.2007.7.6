 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  Eight percent more Bangladeshis, some 36 percent of the population, are mired in extreme poverty than they were 15 years ago, a non-governmental organisation said Friday. It cited the survey of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 2005the latest year with statistics availableto report that the number of poor people rose by 44 lakh although the overall poverty rate dropped. Shushashoner Jonyo Procharavijan (SUPRO) or campaign for good governance presented these figures in an assessment report on the progress being made toward the UN-set Millennium Development Goals. Presenting the report in a news conference, SUPRO secretary Rezaul Karim Chowdhury said the poverty rate had dropped by seven percent in a span of 15 years to 2005. SUPRO said Bangladesh had made progress in education, health and gender equality but was lagging behind in reducing infant mortality rate, preventing AIDS and ensuring fresh air. It claimed donor countries were not living up to their aid commitments to poor countries. If the donors do not provide assistance in line with their commitment, developing countries will face further difficulties, the organisation said. Bangladesh's development budget is still greatly dependent on foreign aid, with as much as 49 percent of the annual outlay coming from abroad. SUPRO said as much as 13.5 percent of the national budget goes to pay interest on loans. bdnews24.c
