 PARIS/BERLIN, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France renewed its drive on Monday for a simpler management structure at Airbus parent EADS following tensions inside Europe's top aerospace group, but both Paris and Berlin denied reports a deal had been struck. French and German leaders are due to meet on July 16 to discuss the future of EADS, which has been plagued by management disputes and political tensions over Airbus's recent decision to cut 10,000 European jobs following aircraft output delays. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said when elected in May he wanted to re-examine a seven-year-old Franco-German pact that ensures power at EADS is shared between the two countries, but which is often blamed for making the group hard to manage. Weekend media reports said French and German shareholders in the company had reached a deal whereby German co-Chief Executive Thomas Enders would become the sole CEO of EADS, satisfying a condition reportedly laid down by Berlin for any deal. "No accord has been reached between the French and the German sides notably on the names and notably on the way the governance is organised," Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon told BFM radio in France. "Nothing that has been written in the press this past week is confirmed," he added. "What I can confirm is the desire on the part of Sarkozy to modify the governance at EADS ... instead of managing the company we have permanent international negotiations," he added. Asked if France was ready to see a German as CEO of EADS in exchange for having a Frenchman lead EADS unit Airbus, Martinon said: "Honestly, we've not got to that." In Berlin, a government spokesman said Germany supported a more efficient company structure for EADS but dismissed reports of a deal ahead of the July 16 meeting in Toulouse between Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. "Decisions (on the management structure) have not been reached to our knowledge," the spokesman said. When EADS was created in 2000 through a merger of the two countries' biggest aerospace firms, it was given dual French and German CEOs and chairmen -- a highly political structure which has been blamed for some of the firm's recent woes, including costly delays on the A380 superjumbo jet. The two co-CEOs -- Enders and Frenchman Louis Gallois who is also directly responsible for running Airbus -- issued a plea last month for EADS to be treated as a "normal company". Under a deal that dates back to the company's founding, the French government holds a direct 15 percent stake, while a further 7.5 percent is owned by media group Lagardere. German carmaker DaimlerChrysler owns a matching 22.5 percent of the voting rights, but recently cut its direct economic interest by placing a third of the stake with private and public banks, including German state bank KfW. EADS refused to comment on Monday, saying discussions about its management structure were an issue for its shareholde
