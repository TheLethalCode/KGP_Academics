<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders of shop owners in the city Saturday welcomed the government's move for allowing them to keep their outlets open for one more hour. A meeting of the council of advisers chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed took the decision Saturday. It means from now on the shoppers would be able to roam the city's shopping malls until 8:00pm. The caretaker government on Feb 25 asked the shop owners to shut their businesses by 7:00pm to save power for irrigation in rural areas. The traders have long been demanding extension of the deadline by at least an hour, claiming that their businesses are suffering immensely. "We thank the government for meeting our demand," Helal Uddin, president of Dhaka City Shop Owners Association, told bdnews24.com by phone. "People could manage hardly any time to shop after their offices or businesses are closed," he said. "The new decision will increase sales by 30 percent," he said. He also demanded the government cut tariffs on energy-saving bulbs. Separately, Bangladesh Shop Owners Association president Amir Hossain Khan also said their businesses would benefit from the relaxed timeframe. bdnew
