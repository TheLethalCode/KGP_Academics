<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Former BNP lawmaker retired major Akhteruzzaman Saturday unveiled a six-point reform proposal, including a national security council with the immediate-past army chief as chairman, to ensure 'efficient governance'. He supplied copies of the set of his proposals to reporters at the Jatiya Press Club Saturday. Later, Akhteruzzaman told bdnews24.com: "Thanks to the state of emergency imposed on Jan 11, it has been proved again that the cooperation of army in governance was necessary. "To free the society of corruption and terror, establish an accountable government, work as a permanent third force for coordinating between the President and the Prime Minister and resolve all conflicting situations, the linking role of the army is essential. That's why I am making the proposal." The former army officer proposed formation of a "joint chiefs of staff" command comprising the chiefs of the army, navy and air force and a 21 member independent security council. He proposed that the immediate-past army chief be appointed for three years as the head of the command. The command head will be the chairman of the 21-member security council. He also proposed making the chiefs of the three forces vice-chairmen. Representatives of BDR, RAB, police, Anticorruption Commission, National Board of Revenue and experts from different professions will be included as members of the security council. In his reform proposal, he suggested formation of a 55-member cabinet, 30 to 33 members of which would be politicians and 22 professionals. The political members of the cabinet would resign three months before the Jatiya Sangsad election. The 22 non-political members will run the governmenta plan that replaces the present caretaker government system. Among the non-political professionals are the most recently retired joint chiefs of staff, deputy joint chiefs of staff and the most recently retired three chief justices. According to Akhteruzzaman's plan, no-one will be able to stay as the prime minister for more than two terms. The chief of any political party would not be able to join the cabinet. The chiefs of political parties that have at least 5 percent representation in parliament would enjoy the status and benefits of a minister, he said. However, the president will be elected in line with the constitution, with a condition that former prime ministers, ministers, state ministers or deputy ministers could not join the presidency. bdnews24.
