<TITLE> North Korean leader Kim works the late shift </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-il likes to burn the midnight oil and wakes cadres in the predawn hours to give them advice on their work, the reclusive country's official media reported over the weekend. North Korea's official propaganda machine is full of extraordinary tales extolling a person it treats with god-like reverence, ranging from double rainbows appearing on his birthday to his piloting jet fighters even though it is thought he never travels by air. "Staying up all night is my habit," Kim was quoted as saying in the North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the South's Yonhap news agency reported. Kim surprised one unidentified worker with a 4 a.m. call to give him instructions on how to do his job, the paper said. "I again wake up a sleeping comrade," Kim said. The worker, worried about Kim's health, asks him to take a break, the report said. Kim told the worker the late hours do not bother him. "At this time, my work is in full swing," he reportedly said. During his reign over the North, the country has undergone a famine that killed at least 1 million people, experts said, and seen its already anaemic economy tumble downward due to mismanaged central control. There has been speculation in the South that Kim, 65, may be recovering from an illness. Pictures released of an event earlier this month show he has lost weight and his hair has thinned from a year ago.
