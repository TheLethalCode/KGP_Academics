 PRISTINA, Serbia, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo appealed to the United States on Monday to set a date for the province's independence from Serbia, saying Russia had blocked its path through the United Nations. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian prime minister, Agim Ceku, said a "new approach" was needed. He again hinted at a unilateral declaration of independence after eight years under U.N. stewardship. "Because of Russian resistance, the UN Security Council is unable to take a decision on Kosovo's status," Ceku said in his weekly address on Kosovo public radio. Ceku recalled comments by US President George W Bush in Albania on June 10, when he said the West would act "sooner rather than later" if Serb ally Russia continued to block Kosovo's secession at the United Nations.

Ceku was due to meet in Pristina on Monday with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried. Fried is expected to discuss Western plans to restart talks between Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians in a bid to overcome Russian opposition to independence. France has proposed six months of dialogue, and a draft UN resolution is expected to call for at least 150 days, diplomats say. More than a year of talks ended in March in stalemate. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated on Monday in Bishkek that Moscow would only support a solution acceptable to both Serbia and Kosovo. Serbia rejects independence for land cherished by many Serbs as their spiritual heartland. Almost a million Albanians were expelled during Serbia's 1998-99 war against Albanian rebe
