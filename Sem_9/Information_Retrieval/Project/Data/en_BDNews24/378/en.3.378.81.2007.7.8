 Dhaka July 8 (bdnews24.com)Music icon Sabina Yasmin underwent an immunotherapy session at Labaid Hospital Sunday, a day after doctors deferred chemotherapy on her. One of the doctors told bdnews24.com that she was feeling better after the therapy. Labaid's general manager (marketing) Al Imran Chowdhury quoting a doctor said Sabina's temperature was quite normal. He said the doctors might start chemotherapy on her in a day or two. After visiting Sabina, popular singer Shakila Zafar said she looked a lot better. "She has a lot of mental courage," she said. Sabina, who has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma cancer, has to undergo six sessions of chemotherapy, the doctors said. Sabina was admitted to Labaid Hospital on June 12 with fever. She is now under watch of a medical board comprising medicine specialists Sirajul Haque, retired lieutenant colonel Mofazzal Hossain, Professor Khaja Nazimuddin and surgery specialist Prof Khademul Islam. Doctors found cyst in her lymphatic system. The biopsy report, carried out in Switzerland, said the cyst is a symptom of cancer. Sabina has long been suffering from diabetes too. Imran had earlier said Sabina might be able to return to normal life after six sessions of chemotherapy as her cancer was detected at an initial stage. bdnews24.com
