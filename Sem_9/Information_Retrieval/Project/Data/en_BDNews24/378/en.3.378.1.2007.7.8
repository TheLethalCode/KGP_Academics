<TITLE> Human traffickers target divided families: rights activists </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 08 (bdnews24.com) Conflict in family life is a key factor in the trafficking of women and children, experts revealed Sunday. "Studies show the traffickers set their eyes on feuding families where they are more likely to succeed," human rights activist Mamtaz Rumi said in a discussion on the prevention of human trafficking organised by Mukti Nari and Shishu Unnayan Sangstha. Around 15,000 cases of trafficking are reported every year in Bangladesh and 80 percent of them are children. Ninety-three routes in 20 frontier districts are being used for the trafficking of women and children, participants said in the discussion. Former adviser to the caretaker government Sultana Kamal criticised the government for the plight of those being trafficked out of the country. "The state is responsible for the security and other rights of its citizens. But there has apparently been no effort to bring back home those women and children who have been trafficked," said Sultana Kamal, who is also the executive director of human rights and legal aid organisation Ain O Shalish Kendra. She also stressed collective national efforts to prevent such crimes. Kamal said trafficking could have been checked if there was a way for workers to work in neighbouring countries without visas. "We failed to negotiate with neighbouring countries to allow us to work without a visa," said Kamal. Members of Asean countries cooperate in this regard, she added. Mamtaz Rumi said about 10 lakh women and children have been trafficked from the country since 1971, while over 10,000 Bangladeshi women are estimated to work in brothels in Pakistan. bdnews2
