 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Industrialists and experts expressed disappointments after the government abandoned a WTO obligation to impose duties on imported products to safeguard local industry. The government wilted apparently under pressure from donors, the industrialists said. "We are a bit disappointed. We hoped that the government would keep its promise to protect local industry," Mir Nasir Hossain, president of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told bdnews24.com in a recent interview. Although the government posted a gazette on imposing a safeguard measure on the National Board of Revenue website, it withdrew the protection in a last-minute decision. The safeguard measure was designed to protect local industry. The rules, according to the document on the website, were expected to come into effect from July 1. The FBCCI president said: "The safeguard measure is a globally accepted norm. This would have protected local industry from stiff competition." "What we feared earlier is going to happen now," he said. To make things worse, the government hiked import duties on raw materials and capital machinery in the budget for fiscal 2007-08. The government raised import duties on raw materials and capital machinery to 10 percent from 5 percent a year ago. It however kept duties on finished products unchanged at 25 percent. According to the rules, a safeguard authority, headed by Bangladesh Tariff Commission chairman, was meant to be in place to investigate the import of industrial commodities and impose safeguard duties on those items that threaten domestic industry. "Introduction of the rules would have allowed us to comply with a WTO obligation," said a senior official with Bangladesh Tariff Commission, seeking anonymity. "This U-turn deprives domestic industry of a chance to exploit advantages under the WTO arrangement," the official said. Neighbouring countries such as India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have safeguard rules, the official added. "It's totally ridiculous. The government posted it on the website on July 1 after the president had approved the budget. And then the government withdrew it. We are confused about the legal procedure of withdrawing rules," said Manzur Ahmed, adviser to the FBCCI. Ahmed said the safeguard measure is an inherent right of every nation and criticised the pressure of WB and IMF on the government. "How do the WB and IMF give such uneducated advice?" "The present duty structure will open the flood gate of import and suppress local industrial growth," Ahmed said. Zaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, described the budgetary steps to raise import duties on raw materials as regressive and premature. "The government has forced domestic industry into competition, fully aware of its bad effect. Should the government go for such experimentation when the economy goes sluggish?" he said. "The government should have continued duty protection to boost the economy." bd
