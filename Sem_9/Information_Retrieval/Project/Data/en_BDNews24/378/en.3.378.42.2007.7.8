 Munshiganj, July 08 (bdnews24.com)Former communications minister Barrister Nazmul Huda appeared in a Munshiganj court Sunday on three counts of corruption. Three officials of the Roads and Highways Department have separately filed cases against the BNP leader, charging him with corruption. Judge Md Wahiduzzaman fixed July 22 to hear the cases and sent him back to jail. The cases were not heard Sunday as there had been no bail appeal for Huda. Huda arrived in court from Dhaka Central Jail by microbus at about 1.45pm. Munshiganj court inspector Omar Faruque said investigations into the cases were ongoing. Executive engineer of the Roads and Highways Department Peer Ahmed filed a corruption case involving Tk 16.6 crore with Sadar Police Station on June 10. The following day, another official, Tayebur Rahman, filed a second case with Sreenagar Police Station on charges of extorting Tk 4.53 crore. The superintending engineer of the department's headquarters, Arifur Rahman, filed a third corruption case involving Tk 4 crore with Sadar Police Station. Joint forces arrested Huda at his home on Feb 4. bdnews24
