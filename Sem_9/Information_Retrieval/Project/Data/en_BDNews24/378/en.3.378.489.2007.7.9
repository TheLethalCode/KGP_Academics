<TITLE> Basis of Hasina complaints unclear: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Communications adviser MA Matin Monday said the government was unaware of what prompted Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina to complain against intelligence agencies. "The government doesn't know the basis of her complaints," the former chief of the DGFI (Directorate General of Forces Intelligence) told reporters, a day after Hasina accused intelligence agents of "intimidating political leaders into divulging details" in custody. The AL president said the role of an intelligence agency was not to break up political parties. "It cannot be accepted that intelligence agents in a civilised society will run the show, detain political leaders and make them say what they like to hear," Hasina said. Matin said: "There was a difference between complaints and the reality. Anyone can complain, but the government is not aware of its grounds." "I said it before and I'm saying it again that the government has nothing to do with forming or breaking up political parties." Pressed to comment on if the government had ever tried to distance itself from political parties, he said: "Not at all. The parties themselves are making problems in the name of reorganising. "We are not staying away from Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. I hope they would help us." "The government did not impose the state of emergency, the government came after the emergency was already in force," the adviser said. But the emergency should not continue for long, he said. Matin also commented on law and order and said: "The situation has improved thanks to anticorruption taskforces. We spared none. We won't spare anybody in future either." bdnews
