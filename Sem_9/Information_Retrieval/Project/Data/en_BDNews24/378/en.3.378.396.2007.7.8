 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) - The caretaker government Sunday has appointed Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed chairman of the National Sports Council (NSC) and its executive committee. The Ministry of Youth and Sports in a circular said, "This order is in public interest and takes into effect immediately." "It is a wrong perception, even self-contradictory to view that a man holds both prime post of the sports ministry and the NSC," sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury said at a reception to veteran sports journalists at the NSC conference room Sunday. After return of democracy in 1990 by removing a military ruler, the government appointed the sports minister NSC chairman and it continued till 2006. Before 1990, the military personnel in the rank of major general or brigadier ran the NSC as its chairman with major general AHM Ershad holding the post from 1976 to 1978. Tapan Chowdhury said changing the NSC chairmanship is the first step to reform the sports arena and the government is determined to free this arena from the grip of so-called organisers, who took this opportunity as a source of bread and butter. "Action has already been taken in this regard and we hope it would be completed in August," said the sports adviser who sought cooperation from all. He said the government is now focusing on extending the trailing facilities instead of infrastructural development. Chowdhury said they would form a management committee involving the representatives of finance, planning, revenue and sports ministries so that the NSC can implement their programme in line with their plan. Replying to a query he said that the executive committee of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would be reformed in the third week of this month. Asked whether they had any plan to reform the Bangladesh Football Federation, the sports adviser said that the time would say.
