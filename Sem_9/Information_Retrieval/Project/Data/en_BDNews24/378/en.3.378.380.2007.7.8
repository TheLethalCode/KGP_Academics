 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines should list on the stock market once it emerges as a public limited company, experts told a seminar Sunday. "Only making Biman a public limited company will not do, it has to be privatised too," former Bangladesh Bank governor Farash Uddin said. . The national airline wanted to take Air New Zealand on board as its business partner in 2000, but trade unions foiled the move, he said. "Biman shares will be floated in the market after it is made a public limited company and its liabilities are met by the government," Biman managing director MA Momen said. The seminar, "Structural reorganisation of Biman", was organised by Bangladesh Economic Society with economist Q Kholiquzzaman in the chair. "The national airline has been wrecked by widespread corruption and excessive overhead expenditure incurred during the past governments. "And the governments also used the trade unions to serve their ends. Any reforms to the organisation need to take all these issues into account," Momen said The Biman MD said in the past a $45 million plane was purchased at a whopping $75 million, forcing the national flag carrier to pay off debts for years. Biman also counts some Tk 400 crore a year in fuel costs as it buys fuel in the local market at abnormally high prices, he said. "While buying planes for the airline in future, we have to seriously consider the type of aircraft most suitable and profitable for us," said acting civil aviation secretary Altaf Ali. "Biman is a virtual goldmine. It may be possible to revive its fortunes with skilled management and long-term plans like many airlines have done. One has to have the goodwill to do that," said Abul Barakat, who teaches economics at Dhaka University. "To turn Biman into a profitable organisation, its management will have to have experienced and successful aviation businessmen. "Bureaucrats don't seem to have any understanding of business," said Shahidul Haque, representative of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He said Biman should be privatised and its management should be transparent.. bdnews24.co
