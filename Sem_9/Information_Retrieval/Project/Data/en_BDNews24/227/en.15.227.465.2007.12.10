<TITLE> Risky Rangs Bhaban rescue falters </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Rajuk has so far failed to rescue labourers trapped inside the wreckage of the Rangs Bhaban, the city developer's executive engineer Manwarul Islam said Monday. As Rajuk attempted search and recovery of trapped workers Monday morning, a portion of the basement ceiling crumbled prompting the rescue workers to stop their work. "Strictly speaking, under the circumstances the rescue operations in the highly risky Bhaban should begin with putting up safety supports in each floor, starting in the basement first," the chief engineer said. Putting up weight-bearing supports in each floor would avert any more accidents or casualties, Manwar maintained. All rescue operations were suspended Sunday after the building was declared 'highly risky'. Fire service and civil defence trainer Debashish Bardhan told bdnews24.com that rescue activities would start again with assistance from a construction company to put up sufficient supports in each floor. The ceiling of the 17th floor caved in Saturday night killing at least three people and trapping a number of workers under the rubble. The Supreme Court in a verdict on Aug 3 ordered the top 16 storeys of Rangs Bhabanthe corporate headquarters of Rangs Groupto be dismantled, ruling that these were illegally raised. The demolition began a day after the verdict, engaging hundreds of workers for job. There is a ban on construction of any high-rise above six storeys in the locality of Rangs Bhaban, as it happens to be contiguous to Tejgaon airport. Starting in 1989, the controversial 22-storey Bhaban took 10 years to complete. bdnews24.co
