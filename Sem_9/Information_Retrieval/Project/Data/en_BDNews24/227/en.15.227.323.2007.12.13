 BELGRADE, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian police have arrested a man believed to be helping top war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic during a crackdown on drug smugglers. Ljuban Ecim, who stands on a European Union list of 35 people facing visa bans for providing help to suspects wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal, was arrested along with four other people, police said on Thursday. Police did not provide more details of the arrests. Ecim faces charges of smuggling and corruption in Bosnia, and NATO and European Union peacekeepers have raided his home several times in the last few years, searching for evidence that could lead to the arrest of Karadzic. Ecim was a senior security official and close associate of Karadzic. When the EU and the US banned Ecim from entering their territories they described him as a point man for Karadzic's financial support network. Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs' wartime leader, is twice indicted for genocide along with his military chief Ratko Mladic over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of some 8,000 Muslims, and the Sarajevo siege, in which about 11,000 people were killed. There are a total four ethnic Serb suspects still on the run from the UN tribunal, including Karadzic and Mladic. Serbia and Bosnia have been told they must arrest and deliver them in order to progress towards EU membership.
