 DUBLIN, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newspaper publisher Independent News & Media said on Wednesday it still expected high single digit percentage growth in Irish advertising revenues in 2007, despite a slowing economy in its home market. "What we've reaffirmed are projections for high single-digit growth in advertising revenue in the full-year 2007 for the Irish market," a spokesman for Dublin-based Independent News & Media said. British regional newspaper company Johnston Press earlier said advertising revenue at its Irish operations fell 1.2 percent in the five months to the end of November due to a slowing property market and the resulting economic slowdown. Shares in Independent News, which also operates in Britain, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and India, fell as much as 4.8 percent following the trading update from Johnston. Ireland accounted for about 25 percent of Independent News' revenues in 2006. The group's stock was 3.9 percent lower at 2.10 euros by 1039 GMT, having earlier fallen as low as 2.08 cents. Goodbody analyst Philip O'Sullivan said the slowdown in Ireland was the primary reason why he expected operating profit growth at Independent News to slow to 2.1 percent in 2008 from the 5.4 percent anticipated for 2007. "While we will monitor advertising trends in the coming months to see if our FY08 (2008) estimates require revising, for now we are comfortable with our expectation that ongoing restructuring will hold operating margins reasonably constant ... in its home market next year," he wrote in a research note. O'Sullivan also pointed out that Johnston's assessment of market trends in Britain, where Independent News publishes The Independent newspaper, were more upbeat. "In all, news that the moderation in the Irish property market is impacting on Johnston's advertising revenues is unsurprising and, indeed, we note that INM (Independent News) cautioned on this at the time of its interim results in September," he added. Independent News is due to publish a trading statement of its own on Dec.
