 LONDON, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The home of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was burgled while he was steering his team to a vital Champions League win at Olympique Marseille on Tuesday, a police source said. Gerrard, who inspired his men to a 4-0 victory that booked Liverpool into the knockout stages, is the latest player to be burgled while playing for the Merseyside club. Gerrard's wife Alex Curran was in the house at the time. Merseyside Police would not confirm it was Gerrard's house, but said they were investigating a confrontational burglary in Formby, Merseyside. "Officers were called to a house at about 9:30 p.m. last night following a call from a female resident that four men had broken into the house and stolen items of jewellery," a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday. Curran and another woman, who was in the house at the time, were shaken by the incident, but were not injured. The men, who were unarmed, wore hoods and balaclavas, the spokeswoman added. It is not clear how they broke in. Earlier this year, the home of Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina was burgled as he helped the club reach last season's Champions League final. Current and former team mates Jerzy Dudek, Daniel Agger, Peter Crouch and Florent Sinama-Pongolle, as well as Everton's Andy van der Meyde, were all burgled last year. Last month, Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt suffered a break-in at his luxury home in Woolton while he was on international duty with the Dutch national team
