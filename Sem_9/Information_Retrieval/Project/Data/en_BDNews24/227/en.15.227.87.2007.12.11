 Jakarta, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indonesian woman has died of bird flu, taking the country's death toll from the virus to 92, a health official said on Tuesday, the highest number globally. The 28-year-old woman from Tangerang, southwest of Jakarta, died on Monday after being treated in a hospital in the capital, said Suharda Ningrum, an official at the health ministry's bird flu centre. It was not clear whether the woman had been in contact with sick fowl, but her neighbours kept chickens, the official said. Contact with sick fowl is the most common way of contracting bird flu, which is endemic in bird populations in most parts of Indonesia. Many Indonesians keep backyard chickens for meat and eggs or to supplement income. Indonesia, which has had the most number of human deaths from the H5N1 virus globally, has had 114 confirmed human cases of the disease. Excluding the latest fatality, there have been 207 deaths globally and 337 confirmed cases since 2003, according to World Health Organisation data. Experts fear the constantly mutating virus could change into a form easily transmitted from person to person and sweep the world
