 COLOMBO, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed 10 Tamil Tigers in fighting near a 'border' that separates government and rebel-held terrain in northern Sri Lanka, the military said on Wednesday. The fighting took place as Japanese special peace envoy Yasushi Akashi visited the army-held Jaffna to attend a conference to promote multi religious cooperation for peace in Sri Lanka. The fighting in the northern Jaffna peninsula, northern district of Vavuniya and north western district of Mannar were the latest engagements in a renewed civil war amid near daily air raids, bombings and land and sea battles. "There were two incidents today in Jaffna, troops killed five terrorists," said military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, adding no army personnel were hurt. The military said troops also killed five rebels on Tuesday in Vavuniya. Four soldiers were wounded in the fighting. The Tigers, who are seeking to carve out an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment on the fighting. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened and analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. More than 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fighters since early 2006 alone, taking the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,0
