 PARIS, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Without deep reform France will be unable to boost growth and fund its social security safety net, President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Wednesday when he unveiled measures to trim French bureaucracy. Sarkozy told senior ministers and officials the almost 100 measures would cut the number of civil servants but those who remained would have better pay, conditions and career prospects. France spends 1,000 billion euros ($1,500 billion) a year on its public administration, Sarkozy said. That would fall to 850 billion if France spent the same share of national wealth on running itself as Germany, its main trading partner. "Without a reduction in the weight of our public spending, we won't be able to find the point of growth that we are missing," Sarkozy said. "We won't be able to maintain our social solidarity system ... we won't be able to finance investments in the future." France needs decent growth if it is to fulfil pledges to the European Union to balance its budget and reduce its debt. During this year's election campaign, Sarkozy said his reforms aimed to boost France's long-term growth average by around 1 percentage point. Sarkozy repeated his plan to replace only one retiring civil servant in two. "I want to tell civil servants they can have confidence in the reform of the state. They will be the big winners of this reform. There will be fewer of them, better paid, their working conditions improved and career prospects richer," he said. One proposal is to streamline the issuing of identity cards, passports and drivers' licences by making the documents available at local town halls rather than government offices. On taking office in May Sarkozy said he would merge the tax levying and collection services, and unemployment benefit and employment exchanges to boost efficiency and savings. This week the Defence Ministry said it planned to house all military commands in a single new site in southwestern Paris and sell off their prime real estate in the centre of the capital. France has come under fire from its European Union partners for slipping in its promises to bring the budget into balance by 2010. Sarkozy has argued France will probably need two extra years to allow time for difficult reforms. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said France had many improvements to make in terms of efficiency and the government's growth forecasts were "very optimistic". "His (Sarkozy's) speeches are speeches about reforms ... with lots of initiatives, lots of proposals," Almunia told reporters in Paris. "The reforms that have been adopted were easy reforms."
