 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The telecoms regulator has extended the time for mobile phone registration by two more months from Dec 16, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chief said Wednesday. "We are extending the time by another two months," BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said. "We have noticed that the rural subscribers find it hard to fill out registration forms. We will make the form easier so that the subscribers can easily fill it up. We have talked to the mobile phone companies about it," said Alam, a retired major general. The original Oct 16 deadline was stretched to Dec 16, according to the watchdog. The BTRC initiated the move in a bid to coordinate information of the subscribers across the country. "The rate of registration was far less than what we had expected, especially the registration of Grameenphone, one of the major mobile phone vendors," Alam added. bdnews
