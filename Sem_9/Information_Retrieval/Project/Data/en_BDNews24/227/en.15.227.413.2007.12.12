 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  Mashrafee Bin Mortaza plans to meet Grant Robinson, the batsman who injured his left eyebrow facing a bouncer from Bangladesh's pace spearhead during the newest Test nation's first tour of New Zealand in 2001. The Tigers left for New Zealand Wednesday afternoon to play a three-ODI and a two-Test series against the Black Caps. "I want to meet him (Robinson) for a few days. I'm eager to know how he is doing," Mashrafee told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "I believe I will get the opportunity to meet Robinson during the tour and would like to seek help from the New Zealand board to find him out," said the fast bowler. Robinson, the opener of the New Zealand District Association XI, had left the field shocked and bloodied after being struck in the face from a top edge while trying to hook Mashrafee in the warm-up match at Victoria Park, Wanganui, on Dec 7, 2001. Robinson was rushed to Wanganui Hospital for a preliminary scan that revealed a broken eye socket among other peripheral damages and was then taken to Palmerston North Hospital for urgent surgery. After being misinformed that Robinson might lose his eye, Mashrafee spent a sleepless night. "After learning that Robinson might lose his eye, I couldn't go to bed in the night as I felt guilty. I, however, later knew he was well," said the 24-year old pacer, recalling that he was also gloomy on the field after the incident. Later, Mashrafee with team manager Afzalur Rahman Sinha met Robinson to apologise for the incident. The opener's reply was, "It's a part of cricket." Remembering the incident, Bangladesh's former captain Habibul Bashar said, "It was such a gory scene that anyone would get scared since a part of the wicket was soaked with Robinson's blood." bdne
