 BRUSSELS, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO allies "deeply regret" Russia's long-expected decision to suspend its participation in a key European arms treaty on Wednesday but will continue to meet their obligations under it, the alliance said. "NATO allies ... want to resolve the current impasse and preserve the benefits of this landmark treaty. They have therefore chosen not to respond in kind at this stage," NATO said in a statement. It said NATO allies would meet treaty obligations regarding exchange of military information at a scheduled meeting in Vienna on Friday which Russia is widely expected to skip. Moscow froze compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty limiting post-Cold War arms levels in a long-running row over the stationing of Russian forces in Georgia and Moldova which Moscow says are merely peacekeepers. Analysts doubt the Russian suspension will spark a new arms race and see it as Moscow's way of registering discontent over NATO's eastward expansion. The NATO statement appealed to Russia to rescind its decision and to respond to proposals put forward by allies, notably the United States, aimed at resolving the stand-off. "NATO allies strongly urge the Russian Federation to respond to these efforts," it added.
