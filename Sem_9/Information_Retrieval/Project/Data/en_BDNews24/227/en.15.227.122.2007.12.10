 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Four Rajshahi University teachers jailed for inciting campus unrest were released from prison three hours after president Iajuddin Ahmed Monday approved mercy petitions filed by their wives. Management teacher Moloy Kumar Bhowmik and mass communication teachers Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun were released from Rajshahi Central Jail at 3:30pm. Relatives, colleagues and over 100 students thronged the main gate of the Rajshahi Central Jail at Shahed Bazar in the city expecting their release on news that the president had pardoned the teachers. A Rajshahi court on Dec 4 sentenced the four to two years in jail for inciting student agitation in late August. President Iajuddin Ahmed pardoned the four teachers serving jail sentences, said an official at the president's office said Monday. The secretary to the president Md Serajul Islam, told bdnews24.com that the president at 12:35pm Monday approved the clemency petitions filed by the wives of the teachers. In an instant reaction to the presidential mercy, law adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters that following their arrests and sentencing, the four teachers, by law, may not keep their teaching jobs . However, he added, the president might make a special exception to allow them to retain their posts. Asked whether the jailed teachers were innocent, Mainul said: "The court will decide that matter, not the president." Earlier in the day, Mainul told bdnews24.com by telephone that steps were underway to release the four DU teachers also detained over the unrest that raged on for days through educational institutions across the country in late August. "The appeals of the jailed RU teachers for pardon have been forwarded to the president's office after taking care of the legal process involved. I hope the president will grant the pardon officially in a day or two," Mainul said. "The government doesn't at all intend to detain university teachers. Since there have been cases filed against them, the government will have to legally clear them after they appeal to the government for absolving them of the charges pressed," the law adviser said. "Education adviser Ayub Quadri is taking measures for the release of the detained Dhaka University teachers as well. I hope he'll soon resolve the matter properly and acceptably." The four detained Dhaka University teachers are DUTA president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harunur Rashid and applied physics and electronics department Chairperson professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. bdnews24.
