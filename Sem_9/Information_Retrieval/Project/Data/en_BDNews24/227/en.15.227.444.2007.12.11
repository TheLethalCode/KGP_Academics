 KARACHI, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani pacer Mohammad Asif has undergone successful keyhole surgery in Australia to fix a chronic elbow problem that forced him to miss the ongoing series in India. A Pakistan cricket Board official said the surgery was carried out by a well known Australian specialist in Sydney on Monday. "The initial reports are that it was not a major operation and it has been successful," Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer, told Reuters on Tuesday. "But Asif could recover up to three months before he resumes playing cricket," he said, adding that a specialist would soon determine how long the full rehabilitation period will be. "We fear he would require to rest for three months, which means he is certainly out of next month's home series against Zimbabwe," he said. Naghmi said Asif would also face a race against time to be 100 percent fit for the home series against Australia tentatively scheduled for March 9. The Australians are due to send a delebation to Pakistan in January after general elections to assess the security situation ahead of their tour, which includes three tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match. Asif has this year had to sit out four one-day games against South Africa and was ruled out of the Indian tour
