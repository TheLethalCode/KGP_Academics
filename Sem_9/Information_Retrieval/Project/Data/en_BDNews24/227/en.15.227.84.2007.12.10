<TITLE> Likely next Russian leader is longtime Putin man </TITLE>

 MOSCOW, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Reserved and softly-spoken, Dmitry Medvedev seems an unlikely figure to lead the vast, unruly Russian state. Behind him, however, stands firmly the true power in the land -- his popular mentor, Vladimir Putin. The land of autocratic Tsars, of Stalin and of the gravel- voiced Boris Yeltsin will now have to get used to a diminutive 42-year-old former law professor from St. Petersburg who prefers technical competence to ideology. He is, for now at least, not likely to eclipse the man many believe brought order to Russia. In a briefing last month, he praised Putin as a "super-popular leader" and deflected questions about Russia's political direction, saying: "No-one knows the future apart from those above us," as he raised his eyes to the ceiling. Putin announced on Monday that the two main pro-Kremlin parties would back Medvedev as his successor, making Medvedev the clear favourite to win a presidential election next March. The constitution bars Putin from standing again. Medvedev graduated in 1987 from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, the same institution Putin attended before he joined the KGB. The two worked together in the 1990s when Putin was deputy head of the mayor's office in Russia's second city. Putin took Medvedev with him to Moscow in 1999 when he was named prime minister and then acting president. He first made Medvedev deputy head of the presidential administration, then chairman of the world's largest gas company, the $345 billion colossus Gazprom . Often dubbed a state within a state, Gazprom's huge clout within Russia and its vast influence abroad gave Medvedev the ideal vehicle for showing his management mettle. Although Medvedev has a softer, more pro-market image than other Putin allies, Kremlin analysts say his beliefs and policies are moulded in his master's image. Putin made clear when announcing his choice that Medvedev would toe the Kremlin line closely, saying Russia now had a chance to form "an administration that will carry out the same policies that have brought us results for the past eight years." Medvedev, who projects an image of sober reliability and technical competence rather than charisma or style, has already had ample opportunity to demonstrate his loyalty to Putin. LOYAL LIEUTENANT As Gazprom chairman, Medvedev imposed big gas price rises on Russia's former Soviet neighbours and masterminded a campaign to force Royal Dutch Shell to sell a controlling stake in a giant natural gas project to Gazprom at a knockdown price. In a rare appearance before business leaders at the start of this year in Davos, Switzerland -- regarded at at the time as a kind of coming-out ceremony with the West -- Medvedev made clear he had little time for criticism of Russia's political system. "I believe that what we have in Russia is real democracy," he said, before adding that he backed the Kremlin's aim of creating big state champions, particularly in the energy sector. Medvedev has met foreign journalists on a number of occasions this year -- a relative rarity in a country where Western media have little access to top officials. Medvedev's position at Gazprom also gave him access to the gas giant's large stable of media properties, which include the NTV television station, five radio stations, magazines and the daily newspaper Izvestia. In 2005, Putin put him in charge of Russia's "national priority projects" -- huge government investment programmes in agriculture, health, education and housing. Shortly afterwards, he was named a First Deputy Prime Minister, a move which immediately set tongues wagging about his presidential prospects. He and a fellow longtime Putin colleague, former spy Sergei Ivanov, were often cited as likely Putin successors although both denied any interest in the job. State media gave frequent airtime to Medvedev touring Russia, inspecting progress in schools, farms, clinics and towns. Critics said the national projects were little more than electoral vehicles, though over time, his opinion poll ratings steadily climbed. They remain well behind those of Putin. Commentators said that in office, Medvedev adopted some of Putin's trademark mannerisms and clipped style of diction. Like his master, Medvedev wears turtleneck sweaters and jackets at the weekend and uses some of Putin's body language. Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev was born on Sept. 14, 1965 in the then Soviet city of Leningrad, today St. Petersburg. The only child of two university professors, he is married with one s
