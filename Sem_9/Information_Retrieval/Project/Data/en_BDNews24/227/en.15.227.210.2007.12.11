 TBILISI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili will face six rivals in a presidential election on Jan. 5, the electoral commission said on Tuesday. Saakashvili, 39, stepped down in November to run in the election after crushing opposition protests with riot police and closing Georgia's biggest opposition television station, Imedi. "The Central Election Commission has completed registration of the candidates. Seven candidates will participate in the election," Gizo Mchedlidze, the commission's secretary, told journalists. After pressure from Western governments, a Georgian court last week lifted an injunction that barred Imedi from operating. The station, operated by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., promised to be on air by Wednesday. Apart from News Corp, Imedi's biggest shareholder is businessman Badri Patarkatsishvili, who will run in the presidential poll and was one of the leaders of the protests against Saakashvili's rule. Georgia's prosecutor-general wants to question Patarkatsishvili on charges of plotting a coup, which he denies. Patarkatsishvili is out of the country but has promised to return this week on condition he receives personal immunity. According to Georgian law, presidential candidates have immunity until the announcement of the election's result. Georgian opposition parties did not nominate a single candidate against Saakashvili. The Labour Party's Shalva Natelashvili, New Rights party's David Gamkrelidze, Future party's Gia Maisashvili, Irina Sarishvili of the Imedi political movement and wine producer Levan Gachechiladze, representing a coalition of opposition groups, will all run.
