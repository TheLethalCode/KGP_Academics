<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal wrapped up their Group H campaign with a low-key 2-1 win over Steaua Bucharest at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday to finish second behind Sevilla, who won 3-0 at Slavia Prague. There was an oddly subdued atmosphere on a chilly night in north London, with little at stake as Arsenal were already sure of advancing to the Champions League knockout stage while Steaua were certain to be eliminated at the bottom of the group. The only outstanding issue was who would finish in first place and Sevilla duly took top spot with 15 points following their victory. Arsenal finished second on 13, with Slavia, third on five points, going into the UEFA Cup and Steaua eliminated with just one point. Arsenal gave their fans something to cheer soon after the start when they deservedly scored in the eighth minute after dominating from the kickoff. Bacary Sagna continued a good move, centring low for Abou Diaby, who fired past goalkeeper Robinson Zapata high into the net for his second goal of the season and his first in Europe. The first half was virtually one-way traffic towards the Steaua goal with Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, back in the side for the first time in almost four months, a virtual spectator. Robin van Persie, back after a two-month injury lay-off, provided the ball for Arsenal's second three minutes before halftime, finding Nicklas Bendtner who slid the ball home past Zapata to make it 2-0. Steaua pulled a goal back after 68 minutes when Florin Lovin crossed for substitute Dorel Zaharia, who headed past Lehmann to set up a lively finale. Steaua went close when Zaharia forced Lehmann to make a rare save, while Theo Walcott missed a good chance to score a third for Arsenal just before the end. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told reporters afterwards: "It was a good first half and it was good to have Robin van Persie back. It will be an interesting last 16.
