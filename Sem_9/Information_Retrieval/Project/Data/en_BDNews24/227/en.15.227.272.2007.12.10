 MANILA, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo criticised the two houses of Congress on Monday for delays in the passage of legislation awarding 8 billion pesos ($192.4 million) compensation to rights abuse victims.

She said 45 cases were referred to courts. On Monday, rights advocates and left-wing groups marched on the streets in Manila and Davao City, on the southern island of Mindanao, to call on Arroyo to step down for her government's dismal record in protecting human rights.

A U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings said in February the military was responsible for many of the deaths. The army has denied the allegations, blaming many of the murders and abductions on internal purges within the communist New People's Army rebe
