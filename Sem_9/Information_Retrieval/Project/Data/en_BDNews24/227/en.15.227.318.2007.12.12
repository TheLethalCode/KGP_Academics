<TITLE> Algiers blast shows aid workers seen as targets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tuesday's bomb attack outside United Nations offices in Algiers is a sign that while aid groups may be desperate to be seen as neutral, relief workers are increasingly seen by attackers as a fair target. UN officials said the blast -- one of two bombings in the Algerian capital that day by suspected al Qaeda militants -- was a clear attack on the organisation. The bomb detonated in a street between the main UN office and local headquarters of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). With at least 10 staff dead, it was the worst attack on aid workers in more than a year. The United Nations is frequently associated with the actions of the permanent members of the Security Council including the United States, and UN aid agencies have sometimes borne the brunt of anger against UN peacekeeping missions, for example in the democratic Republic of Congo. Aid groups including those in the UN system say they strive to be neutral and help the victims of poverty, natural disaster and conflict. But attacks, including by Islamist militants, have soared since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. "We have seen an increase in attacks that we feel are politically motivated since 2003," Abby Stoddard, a New York-based research associate of London's Overseas Development Institute. "They are seen very much as part of wider Western projects. The UN is particularly at risk because of they are a political as well as humanitarian body." The Algiers blast was a grim echo of the 2003 bomb attack on the U.N.'s Baghdad headquarters that killed 22 people. That attack and others in Iraq helped make 2003 the bloodiest year for aid workers, with 87 dead. This year 47 have been killed even before this blast, below last year's total of 85. But more areas such as Iraq have become almost entirely off-limits. Tuesday's attack is likely to make agencies more concerned about staff safety across the Middle East and North Africa. The United Nations has already ordered a security review. TOO SIMILAR? "I don't know that there is much they can do against this," said Stoddard. "It's a very worrying move." In Iraq, some aid workers say agencies did not do enough to separate and distinguish themselves from the U.S.-led coalition after the invasion. Many agencies set up in Kuwait before the war began and effectively followed the invaders up the road to Baghdad. Attacks on them began shortly after. "I think the mistake was to send in so many people so fast on the back of an invasion force who looked just like us," former UN aid chief Jan Egeland told Reuters in September. In Afghanistan, the dividing line between humanitarian agencies and rebuilding programme carried out by NATO forces and the Afghan government can be hard to define. But it is not only a militant threat. Experts say the most dangerous areas of the world for relief work are regions such as Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan's Darfur region, where stealing from aid workers is described as almost an industry. In Sri Lanka, where 17 local staff from Paris-based group Action Contre la Faim (ACF) were gunned down last year, many aid workers privately point the finger at the government for repeated abductions and killings of mainly ethnic Tamil relief workers. Officials deny the charges, blaming Tamil rebels. "Put simply, good people doing good things no longer provides the protection it used to," said CARE International head of security Bob Macpherson in June. "Now, good people doing good things are seen as fairly soft targets."
