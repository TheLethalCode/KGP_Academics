 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Tuesday amended the Public Procurement Regulations 2003 provisionally to ease the process of food procurement. The amendment includes negotiation permission with bidders, reduction of work-order awarding time and raising the procurement ceiling against letter of credit. "The amendment is made to save time and cost of food import," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters after chairing the advisory committee meeting on economic affairs at the planning ministry. The facilities will be given for the import of 5 lakh tonnes of rice, Azizul said, "Once the ceiling is imported, the provision will be withdrawn". Bangladesh is facing a food shortage due to two consecutive floods in August and September and the recent deadly cyclone 'Sidr'. According to government estimates, some 20 lakh tonnes of rice has been damaged by these natural disasters. Members of the advisory council were present at the meeting. The provision for negotiation with the bidders was included so that the government could negotiate with the second or third lowest bidders in case of the lowest bidder's failure to provide the required quantity, the adviser said. Under the PPR 2003, a minimum of 42 days is needed between floating of tender and awarding work order. The time has been reduced to only 15 days, which will be 10 days instead of 28 days for repeat tenders due to the amendment. A person, who imports more than 10,000 tonnes of rice, is allowed to import 15 percent more under the present system. "Now a fruitful discussion between the government and the importer will allow the latter to procure an extra quantity equivalent to his/her LC order," Azizul told reporters. "The move will encourage importers to procure more," he added. Replying to a query, the adviser said that five lakh tonnes of rice would be imported from India. "It is a government decision, there is no doubt," he said. "Now it is a matter of operational process." bd
