 JERUSALEM, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meet on Wednesday for the first formal peace talks in seven years, part of a US-led drive for a Palestinian statehood deal before President George W Bush leaves office. Announced at a conference last month in Annapolis, Maryland, the talks arae going ahead despite calls by some Palestinians for a boycott over Israeli plans to build new houses on occupied land in the Jerusalem area. Israeli construction at the same settlement near Bethlehem -- known to Israelis as Har Homa and Palestinians as Abu Ghneim -- derailed previous peace talks in 1997. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie will lead the negotiations, taking place in Jerusalem. The talks will be the first since the Annapolis conference, where Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to try to reach a deal on Palestinian statehood by the end of 2008. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said the two sides would discuss setting up negotiating sub-groups and the pace of talks, focusing on procedural issues rather than substance. A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of annonymity, said the road ahead would be difficult. "There will be negotiations but it's a very complicated thing," he said. Some Palestinian officials had considered boycotting the meeting after Israel issued a tender for about 300 new homes near Jerusalem on land it annexed during the 1967 Middle East war -- an annexation that is not recognised internationally. Palestinian leaders decided to attend the talks and to focus on pressing Israel to freeze its settlement building. "The essential point on our agenda today is the cessation of all settlement activities," Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said. "We hope the Israeli government will revoke those tenders and not start building because that will really undermine efforts to advance the peace process," he added. Israel says the building plan is legal but the tender provoked Palestinian outrage and rare censure from Washington and other international sponsors of the peace process. Olmert pledged at Annapolis to meet past obligations that include ending settlement activity, but he did not say when this would be done.
