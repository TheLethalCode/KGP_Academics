 BANGALORE, India, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian paceman Ishant Sharma could be an asset in the test series in Australia, Pakistan coach and former Australian fast bowler Geoff Lawson said on Tuesday after the teenager took his maiden five-wicket haul. "It's nice to see a bowler hit the deck hard and he could be handy in Australia," Lawson told a news conference. "He has pace and bounce," he added of the 19-year-old, who took four wickets in a 6.1-over burst on the penultimate day of the final test for figures of five for 118. India, who lead the three-match series 1-0, have an overall advantage of 220 runs after ending the day on 131 for two in their second innings. Sharma impressed with his lively pace after getting the opportunity to play his second test following injuries to senior bowlers. India will name their test squad for the Australia tour, which starts later this month, on Wednesday. "Everyone helped me, the new-ball partner and the bowling coach and when you bowl well then it's a great satisfaction," Sharma told a news conference. "It is not an easy track to bowl on. After some time I changed my line and tried as hard as possible. "I was hit for a few boundaries but I never get discouraged so you have to keep a big heart to bowl at this level. You need patience on such sort of pitches, which I kept," he said
