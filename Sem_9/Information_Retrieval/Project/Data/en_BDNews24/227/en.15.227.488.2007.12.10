 BAGHDAD, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US-Iranian committee set up to find ways to quell violence in Iraq will meet next week, Iraq's foreign minister said on Monday, in the latest contact between the bitter foes. The US and Iranian ambassadors have met in Baghdad three times since May, ending a diplomatic freeze lasting almost 30 years but agreeing on little of substance apart from setting up the committee after their second meeting. Underscoring the continuing violence in Iraq despite recent security improvements, rocket and mortar attacks killed seven inmates at an Interior Ministry jail and started a large fire at an oil refinery in Baghdad, security officials said. Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told a news conference that both sides had agreed to hold the talks in Baghdad on Dec. 18. Washington accuses Iran of arming, funding and training Shia militias in Iraq. Tehran rejects this and blames violence, in which tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed, on the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. "This will be a technical meeting, a follow-up to the last meeting of security experts, not at the level of the ambassadors but (deputy chiefs of missions) and security experts," Zebari said, adding more ambassadorial talks could be held later. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad confirmed the date of the next meeting with Iranian officials and said senior diplomat Marcie Ries would head its delegation. Tehran had no immediate comment. Following the pattern of previous talks, next week's meeting will focus solely on Iraq's security, with Iran's disputed nuclear ambitions again not on the agenda. The first three meetings were held as the U.S. military launched a security crackdown, backed up by 30,000 extra troops, aimed at dragging Iraq back from the brink of sectarian civil war between majority Shi'ites and minority Sunni Arabs. Attacks across Iraq have fallen 60 percent since the extra troops were fully deployed in mid-June, the military says. While the U.S. military remains wary, U.S. officials have softened their rhetoric towards Iran in recent weeks, noting several positive developments in Iranian influence in Iraq. In Baghdad, several mortar rounds hit the Interior Ministry detention facility early on Monday morning, killing seven inmates and wounding another 21 in their cells, a senior security official told Reuters. The jail mainly houses suspected insurgents. Most of the thousands held in Iraqi jails are Sunni Arabs accused of attacks on civilians, the U.S. military and Iraqi security forces. The security official said the wounded were still regarded as suspects and were being treated at the jail. A thick plume of black smoke billowed over southern Baghdad after a Katyusha rocket hit a storage tank at the domestic refinery at Doura early on Monday. Oil Ministry spokesman Assim Jihad said the fire had been isolated and was under control. Washington has accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, although US intelligence services said this month that Tehran had stopped its nuclear weapons programme four years ago. Iran says its programme is for purely peaceful mea
