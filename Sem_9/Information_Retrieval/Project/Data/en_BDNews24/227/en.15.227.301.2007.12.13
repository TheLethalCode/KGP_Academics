<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  Environment adviser CS Karim Wednesday brushed aside media reports on Bangladesh backing away from negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. Speaking at a discussion with senior journalists of the Bangla-language daily Prothom Alo, the adviser has said Bangladesh is leading the least developed countries at the conference. "Bangladesh will highlight the destruction left by Cyclone Sidr, at the conference," he said. Karim feared natural disasters would be more frequent because of climate change. He said Bangladesh would seek help from developed countries to deal with the fallout of future natural disasters. The government made region-based plans to rebuild farms to make up for the losses caused by the Nov 15 Sidr. "Farmers will be provided with seeds and other help after a proper assessment," he said. Some nongovernmental organisations have already been assigned to rebuild certain areas battered by the cyclone. "And the government will take care of other areas." Karim said the government would provide all-out cooperation to save the Sundarbans that "saved many lives during the storm surges". "The forest broke the wind speed." bd
