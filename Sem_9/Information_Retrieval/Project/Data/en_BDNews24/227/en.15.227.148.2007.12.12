 TOKYO, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten-man Boca Juniors overcame Tunisia's Etoile Sahel 1-0 to reach the final of the Club World Cup on Wednesday. The Argentine giants, who had defender Fabian Vargas dismissed in the 65th minute, face the winners of Thursday's semi-final between AC Milan and Japan's Urawa Reds in the final on Sunday. Midfielder Neri Cardozo scored the game's only goal in the 37th minute, smashing in a left-foot shot from close range after a clever ball from Rodrigo Palacio. Etoile were given a let-off just after the interval when former Liverpool defender Gabriel Paletta headed over the bar with goalkeeper Aymen Balbouli caught out of position. Boca were reduced to 10 men when Colombian Vargas was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a dangerous tackle on Etoile substitute Mahdi Ben Dhifallah. They could still have added to their lead, captain Martin Palermo coming close before substitute Alvaro Gonzalez was denied a clear penalty by Danish referee Claus Bo Larsen
