 BARCELONA, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Group E winners Barcelona preserved their perfect record at home this season when they came from a goal down to beat VfB Stuttgart 3-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League on Wednesday. Already eliminated Stuttgart took a shock lead in their final Group E match when Brazilian midfielder Antonio da Silva scored with a superbly struck free kick in the third minute. But Barca fought back strongly, Mexican forward Giovani dos Santos equalising before halftime and Samuel Eto'o making it 2-1 just before the hour mark to announce his return to European competition after over three months out with a thigh injury. Ronaldinho wrapped up the victory 10 minutes later to make it 11 home wins out of 11 in all competitions for the Catalans this season. Barca, who had clinched first place in the group with a 2-2 draw at Olympique Lyon two weeks ago, finished top with 14 points, four clear of the Ligue 1 side who claimed the other place in the last 16 with a 3-0 win at Rangers. "On paper it was not an important game, but both teams took it seriously and I was particularly pleased to see Samuel score," Barca president Joan Laporta told Canal Plus television. "It is vital for the team that he is back after so long out and it was a very significant goal for the team." NEW-LOOK TEAM With nothing at stake, Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard fielded a shadow side against the Germans featuring several second-string players including goalkeeper Albert Jorquera and highly-rated youngster Giovani. The new-look team found themselves a goal down in the third minute when Da Silva ballooned a free kick over the wall and into the top corner. Barca responded by laying siege to the Stuttgart area but, although they manufactured a host of scoring chances, they were frustrated by a string of great saves from Raphael Schaefer. Eto'o, Xavi and Giovani all had goal-bound efforts blocked by Schaefer and it was not until nine minutes before the break that the Catalans managed to find a way past him. Ronaldinho dispossessed full back Arthur Boka on the right flank and curled a shot towards the far post that deflected off the body of Giovani and span into the net. Eto'o put Barca in front early in the second half when he cut between the Stuttgart centre backs and fired home with his left foot after Xavi had surged his way up field during a neatly worked counter attack. Ronaldinho rounded off the scoring after 67 minutes by sliding into the area to steer a low shot past Schaefer after Silvinho had cut the ball in from the left
