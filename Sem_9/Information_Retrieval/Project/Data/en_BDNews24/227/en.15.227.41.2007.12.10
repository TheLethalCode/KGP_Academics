 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com) - Oman's visiting minister of manpower Juma bin Ali bin Juma Al Juma Monday announced that his government has withdrawn the ban on visas for skilled professionals from Bangladesh. Oman had stopped issuing visas for Bangladeshi skilled manpower over the last 12 years. At a joint press conference with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, the Omani minister told reporters that his country was now open to all Bangladeshis and would import more skilled professionals from Bangladesh. "Oman is more open than before to all Bangladeshis. We need professionals like doctors, engineers, technicians and others. Come to our free economy," Al Juma said. "All Bangladeshis will be treated equally, like Omanis, as per Oman's labour laws." The press conference was preceded by bilateral talks between the adviser and the minister, who arrived in Dhaka on a four-day visit Sunday. This is the first visit of an Omani manpower minister since establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 25 years ago. "There was no formal ban. Informally, no visas were issued for skilled manpower. Semi-skilled visas have been issued over the last 12 years. Now it is going to be open to all," Iftekhar told reporters. "The minister has handed over a list of sectors in which Oman needs manpower. We hope we can provide the same," said the foreign adviser. He added that Oman was going to sign a deal with Bangladesh on boosting economic ties and recruitment of workers. 162,000 Bangladeshis live in Oman, a country with a total population of 3.2 million. In 2007, 15,700 unskilled or semi-skilled workers went to work in Oman from Bangladesh. bdnews
