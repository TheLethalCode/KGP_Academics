<TITLE> Bond extends affair with Aston Martin in new film </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Superspy James Bond extends his long love affair with British luxury car maker Aston Martin in the next 007 movie, the company said. Daniel Craig, who plays the action hero for the second time in the as yet untitled "Bond 22", will reunite with the car maker's flagship DBS model. In the 2006 box office hit "Casino Royale", the same model featured in a record-breaking stunt when the car was rolled seven times in a staged crash. Craig has just started rehearsals for "Bond 22", which is directed by Marc Foster and hits cinemas in November 2008. Ulrich Bez, Aston Martin chief executive officer, said he was proud of the "long association with James Bond", which stretches back to 1964 when Sean Connery wound through the Swiss hills with the original Aston Martin DB5 in "Goldfinger".
