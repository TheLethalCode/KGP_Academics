 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Bank has invited proposals from "innovative, experienced and promising" IT entrepreneurs for fund assistance to set up software projects, the central bank said in a recent statement. In line with the new provisions, the minimum amount of project cost will be Tk 50 lakh and the maximum will be Tk 5 crore, according to a circular issued by the central bank on Dec 6. The latest decision by the central bank removed two-year restrictions on financing from the equity and entrepreneurship fund (EEF). Fund disbursement was suspended on Aug 9, 2005 after irregularities surfaced in loans sanctioning. The central bank will provide 49 percent of funds through banks and the entrepreneurs will bear the rest of the total project cost. The EEF was launched in 1999, aiming to promote the agro-based industry and IT sectors. bdn
