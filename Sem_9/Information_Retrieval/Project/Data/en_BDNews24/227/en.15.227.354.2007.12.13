<TITLE> US climate talks "meaningless" if Bali fails: EU </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union said on Thursday it would be "meaningless" to attend climate meetings hosted by the United States if UN talks in Bali seeking to launch talks on a new climate pact ended in failure. "It's true that if we would have a failure in Bali it would be meaningless to have a major economies' meeting" in the United States, Humberto Rosa, Portugal's Secretary of State for Environment, told a news conference on the penultimate day of the talks. Portugal holds the rotating EU presidency and Rosa is the EU's chief negotiator in Bali. The EU and the United States are accusing each other of holding up a deal in Bali. The United States wants major greenhouse gas emitters to meet next month in Hawaii.
