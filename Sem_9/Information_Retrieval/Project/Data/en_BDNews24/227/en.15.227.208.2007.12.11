<TITLE> South Korea's Roh to see coast hit by oil spill </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAEAN, South Korea, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday will see first hand the clean-up of a western coastline turned black by the country's worst spill while reports said insurance losses may not be as bad as expected. Thousands of soldiers, police and volunteers have been working for days to remove 10,500 tonnes of oil that started leaking from a Hong Kong-registered tanker last Friday after a crane mounted on a Samsung-owned barge punched holes in its hull. The government has declared the Taean area, about 150 km (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, a disaster area after oil washed up on 70 km of its sandy coastline, killed life in oyster beds and fish farms and left a nature reserve a foul-smelling, blackened mess. The cost to Samsung Heavy Industries and Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance is likely to be limited because the responsibility for compensation lies initially with the owners of the tanker, reports by Goodmorning Shinhan Securities and Prudential Investment and Securities said. The maximum for which Samsung Heavy will be liable is $5 million, Prudential said. The news came as a relief for Samsung Heavy, which owned the crane and the barge, as well as Samsung Fire, which the maritime ministry said was the insurer. Shares in both companies, which had tumbled in trading in Seoul, were up on Tuesday. More than 385 fish farms and six major public beaches have been directly affected by the spill and damage is expected to grow, the home ministry said. The government has yet to put a price tag on the estimated damage. The owners and managers of the tanker Hebei Spirit on Tuesday called on the owners of the barge to take on a greater role in the clean-up. Roh's visit comes as local media criticised his government for underestimating the scale of the spill and being slow to respond. ($1=923.
