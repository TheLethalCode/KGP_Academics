 BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union joined the United States on Monday in expressing concern about new Israeli settlement activity and urged Israel to stick to its commitments in Middle East peace efforts. "I am very concerned," EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told reporters when asked about Israel's plan to build 300 homes and other units on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Fayyad said continued settlement activity was inconsistent with commitments made in Annapolis and said lifting of movement restrictions and an ending to the blockade of the Gaza Strip were essential for economic progress. He praised the European Union's "steadfast" support for the Palestinians and said the Palestinian Authority would seek a total $5.6 billion assistance at a donors' conference next week in Paris to finance an economic development plan for 2008-10.
