 SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Flash flooding after torrential rains from Tropical Storm Olga killed at least seven people in the Dominican Republic and forced 30,000 to flee their homes, government officials said on Wednesday. Olga was also blamed for mudslides that killed a man in Puerto Rico. The storm weakened on Wednesday as it exited Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. But flooding remained a deadly threat as Olga moved west across the Caribbean, forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. At 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT), the storm's center was about 75 miles (120 km) south of Guantanamo, Cuba. Olga was moving rapidly west at 23 mph (37 kph) on a course that would keep the center south of Cuba and take it over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula by Saturday. Olga's top sustained winds dropped to 40 mph (65 kph), barely strong enough to be called a tropical storm, and forecasters expected it to dissipate by Thursday. But the storm was expected to drench the southeast Bahamas and eastern Cuba, while dumping several more inches of rain on Hispaniola, where totals could reach 10 inches (25 cm), forecasters said. In the Dominican Republic, heavy rains sent the Yaque del Norte River over its banks in the northern city of Santiago, killing a boy, two women and four men. About 30,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes and police had to move hundreds of prisoners from a flooded jail. The rushing waters submerged and flipped cars, and sent panicked residents to the treetops and rooftops. Helicopter crews went out at daybreak to search for stranded victims. Several other communities were cut off by rising rivers that flooded bridges and highways, and scores of people were missing in the mountainous country, where at least 89 people died in floods from Tropical Storm Noel in October. In Puerto Rico, mud and rocks rained onto a highway west of San Juan early on Wednesday, injuring a motorist and killing his passenger. Police said the victim, a 23-year-old man, was "trapped between the mudslide and the avalanche of rocks." Several roadways in that island's central mountains were closed because of fallen rocks and debris. Olga, the 15th named storm of the year, formed in the Virgin Islands on Monday, 10 days after the official end of the six-month Atlantic-Caribbean hurricane season. Tropical storms feed on warm seas, so December storms are unusual. Olga was the 17th named storm to form in the region in the month of December since record-keeping began in 1851, the hurricane center forecasters said.
