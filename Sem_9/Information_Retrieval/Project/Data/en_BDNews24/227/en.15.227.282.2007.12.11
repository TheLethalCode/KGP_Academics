 PARIS, Dec 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of a powerful Paris transport union backed away from a strike call on Tuesday after other unions refused to join in, highlighting a split in tactics over fighting President Nicolas Sarkozy's pension reform. The CGT union for the capital's RATP transport network had called a 24-hour strike on Wednesday to try and force concessions in negotiations over plans to trim pension benefits. An array of unions caused widespread disruption to the Paris metro, bus and tram services in strikes in October and November, which only ended after workers agreed to give talks a chance. Complaining that the negotiations weren't going anywhere, the CGT union called for a fresh stoppage, but had a belated change of heart and decided instead to stage protests that were not designed to disrupt the transport system. "We were received on Friday and we made some progress that has led us to call for a different kind of day of action," said Jacques Eliez, general secretary of the CGT-RATP. "We're not in the situation of blocking traffic." Despite the announcement, the RATP warned that its network might suffer slight disruption on Wednesday, with 80 percent of metros guaranteed to run and 90 percent of buses and trams. The CGT is the most powerful French union and its members working for the SNCF national railway are still planning a strike on Thursday along with the much smaller CFE-CGC union to protest over separate pension talks there. But the more radical SUD union refused to join in either the RATP or SNCF strikes. NIGHTMARES "Those who already did nine or ten days of rolling strikes last month, may not be very motivated," Annick Coupe, a SUD spokeswoman told Le Monde newspaper. Divisions between the various unions over the pension reform have undermined France's traditionally strong labour movement, which is seen as the main barrier to Sarkozy's efforts to push ahead with tough economic reforms. SUD blames the CGT for the fracture because it agreed in November to sit down at the negotiating table. SUD also disapproves of 24-hour strikes, arguing that only the threat of a non-stop strike can wield influence. Only around 8 percent of French workers belong to a union and the numbers have dwindled in recent years. The CGT is facing a difficult balancing act between pleasing its hardline rail members, who could defect to SUD, and more moderate members in the private sector whose pensions are not affected by the reform. The pensions battle is a test of Sarkozy's ability to deal with the unions, who have scuppered previous reform efforts. He has public opinion behind him and has stood firm on the key proposal in the reform -- to make employees work 40 years before drawing a full pension, against 37.5 years at present. Labour minister Xavier Bertrand said on Tuesday another round of strikes would not move the talks forward. "One day of strikes is one day of nightmares too many," he told RMC rad
