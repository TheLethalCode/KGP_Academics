 SYDNEY, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disappointment at the US Federal Reserve's modest 25 basis point cut in interest rates dented Asian stocks on Wednesday, but expectations of further Fed action helped limit losses and boosted demand for government bonds. Base metals fell with zinc hitting its downside limit in Shanghai while oil slipped towards $89 a barrel as investors fret that slower economic growth will hurt demand. Gold steadied above $800 an ounce after Tuesday's fall. Major European share markets were set to open between 1 and 1.5 percent lower according to financial bookmakers, tracking declines in Asia and on Wall Street after the Fed move. The US central bank lowered its benchmark funds rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent on Tuesday, disappointing many who had expected a bolder half-point move to help cushion the world's biggest economy from a deep housing slump and tight lending conditions. "The concern is still there that the US will go into recession and people are looking at the Fed to bail them out by dropping the rates enough," said Steven Robinson, a fund manager at Alleron Investment Management in Australia. Asian stocks fell sharply at first but later pared losses as investors bet there will be more Fed cuts in the months ahead. The majority of Wall Street dealers expect another rate cut in January, a Reuters poll found. "There's a sense that the Fed could move again in January, which is giving the market some support," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities. Tokyo's Nikkei average ended down 0.7 percent, after falling as much as 2.1 percent, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks shed about 1.6 percent by 0611 GMT. The Asia Pacific index is down 8.5 percent from the Nov. 1 peak, but still up 36.2 percent this year, outstripping an 11.6 percent rise for MSCI's key world stock index Already buoyed by flight to safety, safe-haven government bonds rose further as the market priced in easier monetary policies, pushing yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB dropped 6.5 basis points to 1.515 percent. US Treasuries paused in Asia after posting their biggest rally in more than three years on Tuesday after the Fed decision. Financial stocks were off their lows with some ending slightly firmer as hopes of more rate cuts helped brighten the sector's outlook. Australia's top investment bank Macquarie Group and South Korea's Shinhan Financial Group both fell more than 1 percent but Kookmin Bank ended flat, while National Australia Bank climbed 0.6 percent. South Korean stocks were helped by rumours, later confirmed, that the government was buying local shares in the market. Exporters or firms with large exposure to the US economy also pared early losses but still remained pressured on lingering worries about the health of the region's top export destination. The yen held on to most of the gains made overnight but was off its best levels as stock markets bounced off their lows. The dollar popped back above 111 yen but was still off Tuesday's high above 112 yen, while the euro rose above 163 yen still some distance away from the previous session's peak near 165 yen. Investors tend to sell the low-yielding yen to fund purchases of riskier assets and reverse those trades in times of heightened risk aversion. Tohru Sasaki, chief foreign exchange strategist for Japan at JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo, said stock markets were likely to stay volatile as the year winds down and could prompt a further unwind of carry trades. "In broad terms, there are still huge carry trades," Sasaki said. "If markets are volatile and stock markets decline, there is more room for the yen to appreciate." Against the greenback, the euro edged up to $1.4680 steadying from Tuesday's fall to around $1.4639 on the back of the small US rate c
