<TITLE> AL won't join president's Victory Day celebrations: Suranjit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has decided not to attend the president's Victory Day and Eid-ul Azha programmes, a top leader said Tuesday. "It has been decided at our central working committee meeting that we will not go to the Bangabhaban to join the functions," AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta told reporters at his Jigatola home. "We made it clear that we would not join any political and social function, also attended by war criminals. Even if the function is held at the Bangabhaban, we will stick to our decision," he said. Suranjit alleged discriminations in presidential invitations and said: "Some people were invited and some were not." Suranjit said he was invited not as an Awami League leader but as a senior lawyer. On why only this time the AL made such a decision while its leaders attended functions with the "war criminals", he said: "The present context is clearly different. Different statements by the war criminals have united all pro-liberation forces against them." "All the sector commanders of the liberation war are now united. Both the groups of BNP are united on the demand for trial of war criminals." bdnews
