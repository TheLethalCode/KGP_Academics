<TITLE> Crime groups "buy" Bulgarian politicians: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SOFIA, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Organised crime groups in Bulgaria are "buying" politicians, magistrates and civil servants to legalise businesses and extend control over lucrative markets, an independent anti-graft organisation said on Wednesday. The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) said criminal groups spent an estimated 150 million to 200 million levs ($113 million to $150 million) to buy votes in October's municipal elections alone. "Such a widespread, mass campaign of vote-buying has never taken place in Bulgaria," CSD's Tihomir Bezlov said during a presentation of the report. The CSD was set up in 1989 and is Bulgaria's most respected anti-graft organisation. Its study is the first thorough, independent analysis of the roots and development of organised crime in Bulgaria since communism collapsed some 18 years ago. The European Union, which Bulgaria joined in January, has threatened to withhold funds destined for Sofia if it does not improve its record on fighting crime and corruption. The CSD said emerging Bulgarian oligarchs, mainly former secret police officers, are trying to increase their influence over politicians in the Balkan country. "The oligarchic structures have begun to redistribute national wealth and legalise their businesses through politicians and funding of all political parties," Bezlov said. "It is possible to identify an average of about 20 deputies within the last two parliament's mandates who have actively advocated legislation in the interest of economic structures linked to organised crime," the report said. Reports about vote-buying scams forced parliament to amend the law to punish people who sell their votes with up to one year in prison. Even more widespread was the bribing of prosecutors to stop them from pressing charges. The report also noted payoffs to mayors, municipal councillors and other local civil servants to influence real estate deals. Investment in construction and land have become the top market for organised crime since 2001 when Bulgaria began its property boom, the document said. Crime groups' profits from trade in drugs, stolen cars and trafficking of women are estimated at between 1.0 billion and 2.2 billion euros a year, the report showed. The CSD report was funded by the EU and the United States. The United States and some EU ambassadors to Sofia, who attended the presentation of the CSD report, urged Bulgaria to end a climate of impunity and demonstrate the political will to fight crime. Bulgaria has failed to jail a single criminal for any of the 151 gangland killings in the country since 2000. Nor has it found any high-ranking official guilty of corruption.
