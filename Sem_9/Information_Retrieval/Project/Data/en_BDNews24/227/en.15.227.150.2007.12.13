 LONDON, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 6,600 security industry employees in Britain do not have the right to work here, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said on Thursday. Smith told parliament she had ordered checks by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) and the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) on the status of 39,885 workers from Europe who received security licences. As a result, she said: "BIA believes that 6,653 do not have the right to work in this country. In 4,447 other cases, the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has proved the right to work." Her statement followed accusations her department had covered up a blunder over security clearances for illegal migrant workers. It emerged last month that thousands of them could have been cleared to work as security guards -- some even at government facilities. The SIA will write to all of those individuals to advise them that it is "minded to revoke their licence", Smith said. In addition, she said, the BIA will screen the individuals against the police national computer to target any who may pose a risk to the public. The opposition Conservative spokesman for home affairs, David Davis, said Smith had failed to explain how the system went "so badly wrong" and it was unclear whether any of those illegal immigrants in work had had their licences revoked yet. An operation by the Borders and Immigration Agency in April this year found that 44 people employed by one security company did not have the right to work in Britain. Of those, 12 had been employed to guard London Metropolitan Police facilities including one where modified cars, such as the prime minister's, were taken for repairs. Smith said on Thursday that it was employers' responsibility to ensure that their staff were entitled to work in Britain. She stressed that a security licence only meant they had undergone training as well as identity and criminality checks. She said new government powers which come into force in February would make it easier to fine employers breaking the rules and added the SIA was tightening its licensing procedure.
