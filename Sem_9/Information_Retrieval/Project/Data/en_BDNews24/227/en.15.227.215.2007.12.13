<TITLE> Rangs Bhaban rescue operations restart </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Work on retrieving bodies from under the rubble of the Rangs Bhaban in the city resumed Thursday, a fire fighter said. Fire service deputy director (operations) Sheikh Mizanur Rahman said the rescue operations restarted at around 9:30am, with efforts to salvage the four visible corpses from the debris. Rahman said city developers RAJUK did not provide them with a list of the persons missing in the accident when the roofs caved in during the dismantling of the building. Police inspector (traffic) Kazi Murad Hossain said, "We didn't block the road in front shutting down traffic movement despite RAJUK's request, as it would have caused serious traffic gridlock in the city." The police are not allowing anyone to enter the 'highly risky' building, a bdnews24.com correspondent present at the scene said. Experts stopped the fire fighters making recovery efforts on the sixth floor Wednesday afternoon. None could figure out the number of trapped and dead workers inside the crumbling building where four dead bodies are visibly lying. The demolition of the high rise started on Aug 4 in line with a court order. Five floors of the 22 storeys have been dismantled. The ceilings of the 17th floor down to the third caved in Saturday, killing at least four workers and injuring 50. The reason of the crash is yet to be found out. bdnews2
