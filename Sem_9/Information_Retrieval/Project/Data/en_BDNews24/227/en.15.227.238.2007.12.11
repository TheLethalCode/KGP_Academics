<TITLE> Poland's Tusk, Germany's Merkel try to mend fences </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland may hold talks with Germany and Russia about a contentious planned gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, new Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday as he sought to ease tensions with Germany. Tusk was on his first official visit to Germany since taking office last month. There is a lot of work to do on improving ties as the neighbours are at odds on a number of issues from the gas pipeline to World War Two restitution claims. Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were at pains to say they would try to resolve their differences in a more cooperative spirit than had been the case with Tusk's conservative predecessor Jaroslaw Kaczynski. "Germany has a big interest in having good relations with our neighbour and EU partner Poland," said Merkel. "We want to solve the problems we have." A major area of dispute is a planned gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany but bypassing Poland and the Baltic states. The Russian-led Nord Stream consortium, including Russia's Gazprom and German companies BASF and E.ON, will build it. Poland and the ex-Soviet Baltic states, whose relations with Russia are tense, fear they could be cut off from Russian supplies. Tusk has in the past criticised the project but on Tuesday he struck a more conciliatory tone. "I do not exclude that we will be able to run three-way talks about this (Nord Stream) project," Tusk said at a joint press conference with Merkel. "I obviously think about Russia in that context and Chancellor Merkel expressed her readiness to join these talks," he added, saying it was both a political and business matter and that both sides wanted to solve their disagreement. The two leaders also said they would talk about German plans to set up a museum to document the suffering some Germans experienced after World War Two when they were expelled from parts of eastern Europe. Poland is wary about what it sees as German attempts to portray Germans as victims of a conflict they started and opposes such a museum being located in Berlin. "Poland has expressed an interest in having more information so we will send a German delegation to Warsaw to show them our plans," said Merkel. Merkel described as "interesting" Tusk's idea of building a World War Two museum in his native port city of Gdansk in northern Poland. He has suggested that Germans, Poles and other forced emigrants from around Europe could participate.
