 KIEV, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's parliament reconvened on Thursday a day after the opposition prevented the chamber from sitting, but there was no indication when it would reconsider a proposal to restore Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister. Parliament is deadlocked over pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko's bid to restore Tymoshenko, his ally in the 2004 "Orange Revolution." Tymoshenko was put forward a second time on Wednesday by Yushchenko, but her nomination fell short of endorsement earlier in the week by a single vote in the 450-seat assembly.

Tymoshenko's allies said they feared the opposition would try to prevent the vote again if there was an attempt to return to Tymoshenko's nomination. At least one senior member of the Regions Party, the largest single group in parliament, suggested the opposition might agree to an "orange" candidate other than Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko's allies ruled out any such deal. Tymoshenko roused crowds in 2004 by denouncing a rigged election, overturned by a court ruling after Yanukovich was initially declared the winner. As premier, she spooked investors by calling for a major review of privatisations and was dismissed after her government split into rival camps.
