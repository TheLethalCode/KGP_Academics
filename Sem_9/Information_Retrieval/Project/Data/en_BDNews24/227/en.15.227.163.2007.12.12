<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  A rights activist Wednesday filed a writ petition with the High Court, demanding that the government pay Tk 5 lakh in compensations for the family of every person killed in the Rangs Bhaban cave-in. The HC bench of justices ABM Khairul Huq and Abdul Awal heard the writ petition. An order on the petition is expected to come on Thursday. Advocate Manjil Morshed, president of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, filed the petition. He appealed to the court seeking an order on the government and Rajuk to take steps to recover the bodies of the victims in 24 hours and use modern equipment to demolish the building. Some floors of the building crashed down on the night of Dec 8, killing at least four construction workers. He also sought an order to form an investigation committee to find the reason for the incident and take legal steps against the guilty. bdnew
