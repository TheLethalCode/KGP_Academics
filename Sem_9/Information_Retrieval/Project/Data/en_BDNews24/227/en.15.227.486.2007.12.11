 PARIS, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libya was in talks to become the first foreign state to buy France's latest fighter jet, a French official said on Tuesday, fuelling criticism of President Nicolas Sarkozy for putting business before human rights. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is visiting France for the first time in 34 years, seeking to bolster his international standing after decades as an outcast of the West. He dined at Sarkozy's official residence on Monday, after which both leaders oversaw the signing of a series of contracts and framework agreements, including one on entering exclusive talks on the purchase of arms from France. "We want to work with the Libyans since there is no more arms embargo. Libya has gone back to being a client like any other," Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon told LCI television. Sarkozy said on Monday the deals to be signed with Libya totalled more than 10 billion euros ($14.66 billion), providing jobs for French workers. Sources said several of the deals were still being negotiated. An official at Sarkozy's office said Libya expressed a "strong intention" to buy 14 Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighter jets, as well as 35 helicopters, six ships, armoured vehicles and air defence radar. Such a deal would be the first foreign order of Rafales since the jet went on the market eight years ago. The official said the defence hardware deal was worth some 4.5 billion euros. RIGHTS CRITICISM Sarkozy's own junior minister for human rights has said Paris should not do business with Gaddafi without seeking guarantees on the rights situation in Libya. "Quiet, we're selling," left-wing daily Liberation said in a front-page headline over a picture of Rama Yade, the minister who voiced concern at Gaddafi's visit. The opposition also stepped up their attacks. "You want to tell me that to make up for the (French trade deficit) we should bow down before such and such? Why not the North Korean president if he bought our contracts?" Francois Hollande, leader of the opposition Socialists, told RTL radio. Tripoli's ties with the West have improved since it scrapped a weapons of mass destruction programme in 2003, agreed payment for families of victims of bombings of US and French airliners, and released six detained foreign medics in July. Libya is opening up to Western investment in oil and infrastructure, and France is not the first major power to seek to do business there. But foreign visits by Gaddafi are rare, and his visit has stirred unease in France. An IFOP poll for magazine Paris Match released on Monday found 61 percent of respondents did not approve of the visit. "What would we say to the leaders of Iran if we did not reach out to the Libyan leader who chose to turn his back on nuclear weapons and terrorism?" Sarkozy said on Monday, adding that he urged Gaddafi to do more on human rights. Gaddafi is staying in the presidential guest residence and is travelling with his traditional Bedouin Arab tent, which Martinon said would be pitched in the residence's gard
