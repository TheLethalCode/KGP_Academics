 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday appealed the High Court orders halting the trial of the extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against Sheikh Hasina and the transfer of a court to Sangsad Bhaban to try the former prime minister. Chamber judge Md Hasan Amin sent the government appeal to the full bench of the Supreme Court for hearing on Tuesday. The court, however, did not halt Sunday's High Court order that halted proceedings of the case for three months. A two-member High Court panel of justice ABM Khairul Haque and justice Abdul Awal halted the case proceedings and relocation of the Court of Dhaka Metropolitan District and Sessions Judgethe trial court for Hasinato Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. It also asked the government to explain why the court relocation order would not be declared illegal. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq and barrister Shafiq Ahmed appeared for the former prime minister. The state was represented by the additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. Salahuddin said the government had the right to shift court in consultation with the Supreme Court for security reasons. On Nov 29, an acting secretary to the law ministry ordered the court be shifted to the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban area and the trial of the case conducted there. A writ petition was filed on behalf of Sheikh Hasina Sunday morning challenging the government order. The case accuses Hasina of taking about Tk3 crore during her 1996-2001 term in return for allowing him to build a power plant. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case. All of them rejected the charges, and the Awami League has said the charges are aimed at tarnishing the image of the party chief. Hasina believes the charges are designed to prevent her from contesting next polls. bdnew
