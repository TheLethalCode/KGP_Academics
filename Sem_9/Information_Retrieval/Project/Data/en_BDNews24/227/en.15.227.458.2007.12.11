Zafrullah was released at about 7.45pm, a senior prisons official said. Lalbagh police arrested him near the Dhaka Central Jail at about 8pm. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said: "Zafrullah was released at about 7.45pm on bail in an extortion case filed with Gulshan Police Station. I heard Lalbagh police arrested him later. I know nothing more." Contacted by bdnews24.com, sub inspector Anwar Hossain of Lalbag Police Station said: "No case was filed yet."
