 HARARE, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party on Thursday endorsed President Robert Mugabe as its candidate in the 2008 presidential election, opening the door for the veteran 83-year-old leader to extend his rule for another five years. "This congress is requested to declare Comrade Mugabe as candidate for 2008 presidential election," Emmerson Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF secretary for legal affairs, said moments before the motio was accepted by acclamation. It was followed by cheers from faithful delegates at the party congress in Harare. All 10 ZANU-PF provinces backed the endorsement.
