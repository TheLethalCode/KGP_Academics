 LONDON, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Lyon and Fenerbahce filled the last two Champions League knockout places on Wednesday, after emphatic wins over Rangers and CSKA Moscow. Rangers started the night with every hope of emulating Glasgow rivals Celtic and reaching the last 16 after beating French champions Olympique Lyon 3-0 away early in the group stage. But Lyon responded in kind at Ibrox on Wednesday, Sidney Govou scoring in the 16th minute, followed by Karim Benzema in the 85th and 88th. Lyon go through second from Group E behind already-qualified Barcelona, who beat VfB Stuttgart 3-1. Rangers are condemned to the UEFA Cup, their misery compounded by a red card for Jean-Claude Darcheville in the dying moments of the match for a dangerous challenge on Swedish midfielder Kim Kallstrom. Fenerbahce, roared on by a deafening crowd, won 3-1 and always looked the stronger side against CSKA who were already confirmed bottom of Group G. It was the Russians who went ahead, however, after Edu put the ball in his own net in an embarrassing mix-up with goalkeeper Volkan Demirel after 30 minutes. It took only two minutes for the home side to reply, Brazilian playmaker Alex firing a 25-metre scorcher left-footed past a stranded Igor Akinfeyev. Alex set up Fenerbahce's second on the stroke of halftime passing to Ugur Boral, who angled a low shot neatly from the right.The industrious Ugur headed a third in the last minute. HOPES DASHED Fenerbahce join Inter Milan from the group in the draw for the first knockout round on Dec. 21. Their win dashed the hopes of PSV Eindhoven, who lost 1-0 to Inter at home after Edison Mendez was sent off in the 28th minute. Julio Cruz scored for the Italians in the 64th. PSV will now join the draw for the last 32 of the UEFA Cup. Sevilla and Arsenal had already qualified from Group H. Sevilla's 2-0 away win over Slavia Prague ensured they topped the group. Arsenal beat Steaua Bucharest 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium and Slavia go through to the UEFA Cup. Group F was decided before Wednesday's games. Manchester United, who topped the group, drew 1-1 with Roma who came second. United went ahead through Spanish defender Gerard Piquet in the 34th minute and the home side equalised in the 71st when Brazilian midfielder Mancini curled the ball into the top corner of the net. Portugal's Sporting, who will be playing UEFA cup football in the new year, beat Dynamo Kiev 3-0. The Ukrainians finished their campaign without a point
