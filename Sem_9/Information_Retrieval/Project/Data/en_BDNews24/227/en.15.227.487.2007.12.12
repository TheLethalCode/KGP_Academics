 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - From the volatile tribal northwest to the wealthy farm land of Punjab, Pakistan's main opposition leaders geared up their election machinery on Wednesday to challenge President Pervez Musharraf. After a vote boycott drive disintegrated, both former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, back from years in exile, organised public meetings as a campaign clouded by worries of vote rigging and media curbs gathered momentum. With the main opposition parties adding some credibility to the election by agreeing to run, political leaders were oiling their party machinery before the campaign picks up pace after the publication of candidates lists on Sunday. Bhutto held a rally in the northwestern town of Nowshera near Peshawar, capital of the North West Frontier Province where in some tribal areas militants are battling government forces. Sharif planned public meetings in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, which returns about half the members of parliament and is his traditional stronghold of support. "These meetings are kind of warm-up matches," said Ahsan Iqbal, spokesman for Sharif's party. The election is essentially a three-way contest between the two main opposition parties and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which backs Musharraf and plays up the strong growth Pakistan has enjoyed under its rule. The election comes amid opposition fears there is too little time before the Jan. 8 election for a free and fair vote and that the result will be biased in favour of parties loyal to Musharraf, raising the prospect of a contested result. The Pakistani media, curbed under emergency rule imposed by Musharraf last month, said authorities were trying to restrict election coverage with a warning not to violate a ban on live broadcasts, or risk three years in jail. "It's not only a warning but a threat to all TV channels and an attempt to silence the free media," the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists said in a statement. Any contested result would lead to the prospect of more instability in the nuclear-armed U.S. ally. CONSIDERING COALITIONS The PML, formed to give Musharraf a political base after his 1999 coup, could fare badly as his popularity has slumped this year amid his efforts to replace a Supreme Court chief seen as hostile to his government. The election is crucial for Musharraf, who has promised that this weekend he will lift emergency rule. A poor showing in the election could mean a hostile parliament that might even move to impeach Musharraf, who stepped down as army chief last month, over accusations he acted unconstitutionally in securing a new term as president. Sharif's trip to Punjab came in what could be a hard campaign between the pro-Musharraf PML and Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). Musharraf's party was cobbled together from the remnants of Sharif's party after he was ousted in 1999. Bhutto, whose main strength is in the Sindh province in the south, said she expected her Pakistan People's Party will have to enter into a coalition to create a ruling majority, the Washington Times reported on Wednesday. Bhutto said joining with the party of Sharif would be possible but ruled out an alliance with those controlled by Musharraf or Muslim clerics, the newspaper reported. "No one will accept a (pro-Musharraf PML) victory," she said. Sharif has been barred from running because of criminal convictions he says were politically motivated. He has said he has no plans for an electoral alliance with Bhutto. Qazi Hussain Ahmed, head of the Jamaat-e-Islamic, a small but influential Islamic party which has a support base in the northwest, urged parties to boycott the vote. "These elections will not be free and fair and that's why we ask them to join our boycott," he told a news conferen
