<TITLE> EU clears 2008 budget with more pro-growth funds </TITLE>

 STRASBOURG, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union lawmakers approved the bloc's 2008 budget on Thursday, earmarking more funds than ever for pro-growth measures and securing cash for the flagship Galileo satellite navigation system. The European Parliament set spending at 120.3 billion euro ($176.7 billion), 5.7 percent more nominally than in 2007. But relative to the bloc's economic output, the budget shrinks from 0.99 percent this year to 0.96 percent, one of the lowest rates in history, reflecting the EU's 27 government growing austerity towards the bloc, diplomats say. The executive European Commission said it would be the first time ever that the largest share of the budget will go to measures boosting economic growth and regional aid rather than to the EU's costly farm subsidies. "With the largest share going to competitiveness, the 2008 budget is a concrete result of the Union's determination to put long-term economic development at the heart of the EU spending," said EU Budget Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaite. The budget earmarks 940 million euros for planned satellite navigation system Galileo aimed at competing with the US Global Positioning System (GPS). The funds will help plug a 2.4 billion euro hole in funding for the project after private companies proved reluctant to foot the bill. Germany and some other countries have agreed to boost Galileo financing from EU collective funds after securing a pledge that their firms would benefit from contracts. About 45 percent of the total budget will be spent on aid for poor regions, education, training, innovation, research and development as well as other measures to boost growth. Agricultural spending, including controversial subsidies for farmers, account for 40 percent. Many EU members, led by Britain, want to scale down the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but major beneficiary France opposes the plans. Farm spending will be reviewed in 2008-11, along with Britain's criticised rebate from Brussels coffers. Spending on foreign aid and external policy initiatives will grow by 10.4 percent to 8.1 billion euros, including 300 million in aid for the Palestinians, 1.4 billion for the Western Balkans countries and 2.3 billion for the world's developing regio
