 BAGHDAD, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq will never allow the United States to keep permanent military bases on its soil, the government's national security adviser has said.

On Tuesday, a suicide bomber blew up a car bomb at a checkpoint in a heavily guarded affluent west Baghdad neighbourhood near the homes of former interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and the leader of a small Sunni Arab party. Two people were killed and 12 wounded in the attack. Neither politician was at their homes at the time.
