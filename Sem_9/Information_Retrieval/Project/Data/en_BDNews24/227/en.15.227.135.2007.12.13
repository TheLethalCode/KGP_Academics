 WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five associates of an anti-Castro exile suspected of bombing a Cuban airliner 30 years ago have pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for their refusal to testify against him, the Justice Department said on Thursday. Each faces up to 10 years in prison for refusing to testify to a grand jury as the government pursued immigration fraud charges against Luis Posada Carriles, a former CIA operative who has a long history of violent opposition to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Posada Carriles, 79, is wanted in Cuba and Venezuela, where he is accused of masterminding the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people. He entered the United States illegally in 2005 and sought asylum. A judge dismissed the immigration case in June but the government is appealing. Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have criticized Washington for having a double standard on terrorism, saying Posada Carriles should be charged with terrorism and murder, not immigration crimes. The five associates were granted immunity from prosecution and ordered to testify by a US judge in El Paso but refused to do so, the Justice Department said. Ruben Lopez-Castro and Jose Pujol pleaded guilty on Wednesday and Ernesto Abreu pleaded guilty on Dec. 3, the Justice Department said. Osvaldo Mitat and Santiago Alvarez pleaded guilty on Nov. 16, the Justice Department said.
