 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  A five-day mobile phone fair took off in the city Tuesday. FBCCI administrator Syed Manzur Elahi inaugurated the fair at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. Bangladesh Mobile Phone Dealers Association (BMBA) and the FBCCI have jointly organised the Fair. The fair began Monday but it was formally inaugurated a day later. Former president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association (BGMEA) Annisul Huq, former FBCCI director MA Rouf Chowdhury, adviser to BMBA Syed Marghub Morshed and Nizamuddin Jitu, an engineer, spoke at the opening function. Elahi said the cell phone market had spread rapidly in Bangladesh in a short time, with the growth in the sector clocking 138 percent in 2005. In 2006, it was 90 percent and growth is projected to cross 100 percent this year, he said. He said the development of telecommunications infrastructure however had not increased to the desired level. "We will have to give more emphasis on the development and expansion of the telecommunications sector." Elahi said two major mobile companies are set to enter the capital market soon and hoped that it would have a positive impact on the market if all mobile companies listed on the bourse. bdnews24
