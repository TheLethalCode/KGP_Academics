<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday halted the High Court stay order on trial of the extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The apex court simultaneously froze the High Court order that halted the relocation of Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court to the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises to try the detained Awami League chief. The six-strong full bench of the Appellate Division led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin handed down the twin orders on an appeal by the government. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq, the chief counsel for Hasina, said after the verdict that the trial would now be held in the special court. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed, who stood for the state, said to the court during hearing, "The law has given the government the power to transfer the court." He said the Supreme Court had set precedence on the matter. Barrister Huq replied, "We will have to look at the matter from a different perspective after the separation of the judiciary. The government does not have the power to order the relocation of the court." Shafique Ahmed, another lawyer of Hasina, later said, "The Supreme Court order has surprised us. The order did not reflect the independence of the judiciary." He said they did not get adequate scope during hearing. The government on Dec 10 went to the Supreme Court after the High Court halted the case proceedings and the transfer of the court the previous day. The High Court also asked the government to explain why the order on relocation of the court was not illegal. On Nov 26, the acting secretary to the law ministry ordered the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court the trial court to hold trial on the Sangsad Bhaban premises citing security reasons. The case filed on June 13 involves charges of extortion from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, who accused Hasina of taking about Tk 3 crore during her 1996-2001 term in return for allowing him to build a power plant. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case. All of them rejected the charges, and the Awami League said the charges were aimed at smearing the party chief. Hasina believes the charges are designed to prevent her from contesting next polls. Hasina and Selim are in jail now. Rehana, who lives in London, is shown to be a fugitive from justice. bdnews2
