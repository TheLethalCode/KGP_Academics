 BEIJING, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China swiped aside US complaints about a major oil deal with Iran on Tuesday, saying the agreement was no other government's business. Sinopec, China's biggest oil refiner and petrochemicals producer, signed a deal over the weekend to invest $2 billion in Iran's Yadavaran oil field.

Iran is China's third biggest supplier of imported crude oil, behind Angola and Saudi Arabia. China's exports to Iran are also booming. In the first 10 months of this year they leapt to $5.9 billion in value, up 68.4 percent on the same time last year. Yet Beijing is reluctant to risk confrontation with Washington over Iran.
