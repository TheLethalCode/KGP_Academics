 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday accepted charges to begin trial against four senior teachers and 15 students of Dhaka University in a case that accuses them of breaching the emergency rules during campus violence in August. Chief metropolitan magistrate and speedy trial tribunal judge Habibur Rahman Siddiqui set Dec 19 for recording statements of the witnesses after reading out details of the charges to the five of the accused in the dock. Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik and Moniruzzaman Sardar Rubel, a student, pleaded not guilty of the charges. They sought justice from the court. Fourteen students, who are facing charges of violating the emergency rules, remain fugitive. Wednesday's charge-framing came a day after another court framed charges against the same people on same grounds amid arguments by defence counsels that the process was illegal since separate cases could not be filed on same charges. "I can vouch that the charges brought against me are totally baseless. Since the judiciary has now been made a separate entity, we'll expect that all legal proceedings will be held openly, all laws weren't enacted for the public good though," said Pro Anwar Hossain towards the end of the hearing. "About 400 of us DU teachers signed the statement issued on August 21 embodying our stance during the students' demonstration. Historically speaking, the Dhaka University teachers have always stood by their students in past mass protests, whenever such situations arose and we've never incited our students to resort to any violence or belligerent strategies." The defendants' lawyers said none of the witnesses stated that the accused were involved in inciting the students. The law adviser's assurance apparently fell flat as the detained teachers were now facing trial in the court, they said. A defending lawyer challenged the prosecution that filing of the case took place 34 hours after the incidents mentioned in the case details, which is unacceptable in a court of law. The accused face charges of leading processions on the campus, giving inflammatory statements to instigate students, obstructing government activities and being part of arson attacks on Aug 21. The hearing over, the wives, children and other relatives spoke to the detained. Sanjeev Hossain, Prof Hossain's son, told bdnews24.com that they would not appeal to the government for mercy or leniency in the case, nor would they appeal for bail. On August 23, Rezaul Karim Khan of Shahbagh Police Station filed the case. bdnews24.com/pb/j
