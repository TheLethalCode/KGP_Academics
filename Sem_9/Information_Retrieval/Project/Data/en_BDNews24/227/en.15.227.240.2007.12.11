 LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - British prosecutors charged two men on Tuesday with inciting murder and said they had links to a banned terrorist group fighting for Baluchistan's independence from Pakistan. Iranian student Faiz Baluch, 25, and Pakistani journalist Hyrbyair Marri, 39, were charged at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court with inciting others to "commit an act of terrorism outside the UK... which would constitute murder." Marri, a father of four, is also charged with possession of a CS gas canister which the prosecution said was a weapon "designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing". The prosecution said both men had links to the outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA), which is fighting for an independent state in an area of Pakistan that borders Iran and Afghanistan. Britain banned the BLA in July and the court was told the group had been responsible for 145 deaths in 2006. The men were arrested in raids by counter-terrorism police last week when computers, DVDs and documents were seized. Marri's defence lawyer, James Nichol, told the court his client was from a distinguished family in the region and had been an elected representative on the provincial assembly, campaigning on behalf of the people of Baluchistan. British human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who staged a demonstration outside the court with a small group of supporters, said the men were peaceful activists.
