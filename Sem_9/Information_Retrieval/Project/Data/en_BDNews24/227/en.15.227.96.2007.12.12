 NANJING, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nanjing retiree Xiang Yansong was 11 when invading Japanese soldiers shot his sick brother dead during their brutal occupation of China's wartime capital. Seventy years on, a tearful Xiang is still waiting for an apology. "Some Japanese just refuse to admit the truth. Why deny the truth, if you have done wrong, just admit it," the 81-year-old said, his voice choking with sobs. "Every time we come up to this anniversary, our tears cannot stop flowing." On Thursday China marks the 70th anniversary of the start of the Nanjing massacre, also known as the "Rape of Nanking". Chinese historians say Japanese troops killed 300,000 men, women and children in the weeks that followed the city's fall, raping and torturing many of the victims. An Allied war tribunal put the Nanjing death toll at about 142,000, but some Japanese historians say even that number is exaggerated, or deny the massacre ever happened. While Beijing and Tokyo are enjoying a fragile thaw in ties after years of history-related tension, Japan's continuing refusal to acknowledge wartime atrocities remains a sticking point for older Chinese haunted by their memories, and for younger generations who say Tokyo has not properly atoned. Every anniversary, sirens wail across Nanjing, a grim reminder for most residents born long after the bombing raids. SEETHING ANGER "The Japanese are the ones who did all the wrong. Every time I see them, I seethe with anger," said massacre survivor Zhang Huixia at a brief ceremony on Wednesday honouring victims killed at Nanjing's Dong Ping Gate. Zhang was 10 when she hid from Japanese soldiers in an empty house. "When I see them on television, I wish I could slice their flesh up. Perhaps after that I will feel better." As Japanese and Chinese historians work together to narrow differences in historical perceptions, a number of films and books marking the 70th anniversary of Nanjing have reopened wounds and provoked howls of condemnation in both countries. Earlier this month, China published an eight-volume collection of books profiling 13,000 massacre victims and the Japanese unit deemed responsible for their death. The coming release of a Japanese nationalist-backed film, "The Truth About Nanjing" by director Saturo Mizushima, has been condemned by the Chinese government for denying the massacre. "I feel it is wrong to cover up historical facts and not give respect to these victims. This is as good as not respecting the value of human life," said Zhu Chengshan, curator of the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall. To commemorate the anniversary, Zhu will open a 25,000 sq metre extension on Thursday which will add documents, twisted sculptures and a display of victim remains unearthed during its construction. "This is the 70th anniversary for the victims of the Nanjing Massacre. I feel the future generations should not forget this part of history... Also, we hope such historical tragedies will not be repeated and hope that there is eternal peace in this worl
