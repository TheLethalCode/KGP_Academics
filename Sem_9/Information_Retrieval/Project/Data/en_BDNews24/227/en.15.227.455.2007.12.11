<TITLE> Indian diplomat plays down Bangladesh concern on dam construction </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Tuesday expressed concern over the construction of dams and reservoirs in upper riparian India and Nepal as such constructions would reduce the flow of water in lower riparian Bangladesh. On the other hand, an Indian diplomat, Deb Mukharji, allaying Bangladesh's concern, said: "Nothing much has happened about the construction of reservoirs." He termed the inter-linking of rivers a "dead issue". "As a lower riparian country, Bangladesh voices concern over the construction of reservoirs and dams in India and Nepal over the river Shaptakosi," Iftekhar told the 16th Indo-Bangladesh Dialogue in Dhaka. The adviser said that dam construction in India and Nepal would certainly reduce the availability of water in Bangladesh. "Possible diversion of water from Tipaimukh is a matter of concern, not just to the Bangladeshis, but also to many Indians," he said. The Centre for Policy Dialogue and India International Centre jointly organised the dialogue co-chaired by economist Rehman Sobhan and former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Deb Mukharji at BRAC Centre in the city. "Personally I don't see any problem here in Bangladesh with regard to construction of dams or reservoirs in India and Nepal," Mukharji told bdnews24.com while reacting to the adviser's concern following the inauguration of the dialogue. "At the moment, nothing much has happened. We (India and Nepal) signed a treaty about 12 years ago on (construction of dams and reservoirs) on the Mahakali (river). That has not advanced much," the former Indian envoy told this correspondent. He said, "'I am sure that any lower riparian country will be concerned with what is happening in the upstream countries." Replying a question on inter-linking of rivers by India for diversion of water from the major common rivers, Mukharji said: "That is a dead issue. It is no longer valid." He said the mega-project might be a concern for South India. "It does not concern Bangladesh," he added. Bangladesh has 54 common rivers originating in either Nepal or India. As upper riparian countries, India and Nepal have taken initiatives to store water in Nepal. In addition, India alone has adopted a plan to divert water from the rivers of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges that meet more than 90 percent water demand in Bangladesh. India is also constructing a dam called 'Tipaimukh Bandh' in the upstream of the two Bangladeshi rivers Surma and Kushiyara in Sylhet. If waters from the common rivers were diverted in the upstream regions, Bangladesh would face droughts and desertification, resulting in an adverse impact on its agro-based economy. According to media reports, former Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam in a national address a few years ago said that India should implement the inter-linking of rivers project "on a war footing". Bangladesh has been protesting the Indian moves. But India always denies implementation of the projects. bdn
