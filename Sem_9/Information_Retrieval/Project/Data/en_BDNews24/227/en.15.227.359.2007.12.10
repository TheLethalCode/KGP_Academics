 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League Central Working Committee Monday demanded that the government free Sheikh Hasina by withdrawing all cases against her before Dec 16. Terming the cases against the Awami League president baseless, the ALCWC vowed to get her released through legal battles. The meeting held in the office of the AL president in Dhanmondi also demanded withdrawal of an arrest warrant against Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, now abroad, and an order for attachment of her property. Neither acting AL president Zillur Rahman nor acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam briefed reporters on the outcome of the meeting. The reporters were given copies of the resolution taken by the ALCWC. The meeting chaired by Zillur also demanded the release of the detained Dhaka University teachers and students. The ALCWC urged the government to lift the ban on political activities in the country. The committee also urged the Election Commission not to register Jamaat-e-Islami as political party as "it uses religion for politics". The meeting finalised the programmes to mark Martyred Intellectual Day on Dec 14 and Victory Day on Dec 16. An AL leader attending the meeting told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named, that the AL would not attend the government's Victory Day programmes since "the government discriminated against political parties and leaders in inviting them". "Besides, the AL will not join the programme which will be attended by the anti-Liberation forces such as Jamaat-e-Islami," he said. bdnews2
