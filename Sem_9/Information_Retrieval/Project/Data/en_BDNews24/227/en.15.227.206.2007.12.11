<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division Tuesday did not stay the High Court order that lifted the ban on FBCCI polls. Chamber judge Md Hasan Amin Tuesday heard an appeal against the High Court order filed by Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association member Mahbub Minhaz, but did not make any order. Nor did he send the appeal to a regular bench of the Appellate Division for further hearing. Mahbub appealed to the court seeking a stay order on the High Court verdict, but the court said it would not give a stay order "at this stage". The High Court on Dec 6 retracted its stay order on the polls of the country's apex trade body, Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and declared illegal the verdict of the FBCCI arbitration council. The council also cancelled the voting rights of five BGMEA members. The HC delivered the verdict after hearing the case filed by Faisal Samad and Annisul Huq of BGMEA. On Sept 25, the FBCCI arbitration council ruled that the BGMEA election was held in violation of court orders, meaning the results were illegal and void. The BGMEA later filed a case challenging the FBCCI verdict resulting in the court staying the FBCCI elections on Sept 30 and ordering the federation to explain why its verdict would not be ruled illegal. bdnew
