 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Tigers left Wednesday for New Zealand by a Thai Airways fight to play a three-ODI and two-Test series against the Kiwis, with the skipper saying they were eyeing to do well in the limited-overs games. "The target is to play good cricket in one-day series against them and if we can do it, then the things will certainly reflect in the Test series," captain Mohammad Ashraful told reporters at Zia International Airport. "Our bowling attack is reasonably good and we can rationally expect one or two one-day wins against New Zealand if the batsmen can put a good score on the board as they had done in the recent past," said the 22-year-old batsman. Barring a two-wicket in a warm-up match in the prelude to the World Cup in West Indies, Bangladesh have been comprehensively beaten by the Black Caps in all eight one-day internationals the two teams have played. Besides, the newest Test nation also suffered humiliating innings defeats in all of the four Tests it has played against the Tasmanians. Ashraful said he was not worried over the Test series at the moment as they wanted to leave an impact in the one-day series. He admitted the tour was going to be a tough one for them in New Zealand conditions where the weather is chilly, the wickets bouncy and the ball swings, but added that they were confident of doing better this time around in Tests against the Kiwis. It is the first assignment for new coach Jamie Siddons, who has not had enough time to prepare the side, but his new training regime specially for the New Zealand tour pleased the cricketers. Bangladesh start their campaign on Dec 16 with a warm-up one-dayer against Northern Districts in Hamilton's Seddon Park, which also hosts the second match between the same rivals on Dec 18. The third warm-up game against Auckland takes place at the Eden Park Outer Oval in Auckland on Dec 21. The tourists will play a charity Twenty20 match against New Zealand XI, led by Stephen Fleming, to raise funds for the Sidr Survivors at Seddon Park on Dec 23. The ODI series opener will be held on Dec 26 at Eden Park in Auckland while the second and the third matches are scheduled for December 28 and 31 at McLean Park in Napier and Queenstown Events Centre in Queenstown. The first Test begins on Jan 4 at the University Oval in Dunedin while the second and final Test is from January 12-16 at Basin Reserve in Wellington. b
