 La Paz, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivia's opposition leaders said on Monday they would try to block leftist President Evo Morales' new constitution, which was forged amid violent protests and an opposition boycott. Ex-President Jorge Quiroga, leader of the rightist Podemos party, called the new constitution illegal and said his party would use its veto power in the Senate to keep it from being ratified in a national referendum. And five governors from the relatively wealthy Bolivian lowlands strongly opposed to Morales said they would protest by trying to make their regions autonomous from the central government. The constitution, approved over the weekend in an assembly boycotted by the rightist opposition, has deepened rifts between Morales, who says he seeks change for the country's poor, indigenous majority and his detractors who say he wants to grab more power through the new law. "We are going to fight along with the regions, civil society, university students, together with all Bolivians. We're not going to accept that apprentices of (Venezuelan President) Hugo Chavez come here to repeat his bad example," Quiroga said. Constitutional reforms proposed by Chavez in Venezuela were voted down in a recent referendum in that country. Morales is a close Chavez ally, and another ally, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, is also moving forward with a constitutional overhaul. Allowing the president to run for a second consecutive term, more autonomy for regional governments and Indian communities and changes in electoral rules for both houses of Congress were among the more than 400 articles the assembly approved over the weekend. The governors of the departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija and Cochabamba said they will not recognize the new constitution because it was approved illegally in a meeting called at the last minute and under an opposition boycott. A new constitution was a key campaign promise of Morales, who is the first Indian president in South America's poorest country. An assembly dominated by Morales allies was elected and began drafting a new constitution more than a year ago. But the work was marred by months of bickering over internal procedure and then by violent protests. The new constitution also allows for the expropriation of unproductive private property. But one article, which defines the size of land holdings the government can take over if they are unproductive, still has to be approved in a national referendum. Then two-thirds of the assembly must ratify the entire text before it goes to another national vote, late next year
