 LONDON, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Long regarded as the world's worst business address, Africa is attracting an upsurge in foreign investment drawn by high commodity prices, more peace and democracy, lower corruption and good economic growth. Resource-rich former war zones such as Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique have become amongst some of the fastest growing economies on earth, some even outstripping China -- albeit from very low bases. The International Monetary Fund estimates Angolan growth at over 30 percent in 2007, mainly due to soaring oil revenues. The African Development Bank (AfDB) says a handful of economies are still contracting but it sees overall African growth at 6.5-7.0 percent next year. This remains some way behind China's 10-11 percent but is within striking distance of Asia's other major emerging economy, India, which has averaged 8.6 percent growth in recent years. More stable African countries such as Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania are also seen making improvements and having benefited from recent debt relief. And with worries of a global downturn in the developed world, investors say there is renewed interest in the world's poorest continent. "In some ways, we are where India was in the early 1990s," AfDB President Donald Kaberuka told Reuters. "We are at the point where Africa is no longer an object of just pity and aid." Africa remains exposed to a global economic downturn -- particularly if this hits demand for the commodities it produces such as copper. But some economists say it is more insulated than other emerging markets such as eastern Europe. "I think the attitude of investors has completely changed in the last few years," said Stuart Culverhouse, chief economist at London emerging markets brokerage Exotix. "Part of it is a change in fundamentals -- good economic growth, debt relief -- and also perhaps that as some of the other emerging markets have become more mainstream, people are looking elsewhere." Local African consumer demand is seen almost inevitably rising, as is demand for African products from the growing economies of Asia, particularly China -- which is now a huge player in many of the continent's economies. China's biggest lender IBBC is buying 20 percent of South Africa's Standard Bank , while Ghana and Gabon have launched international bonds and Angola and Rwanda intend launching new stock markets. NO LONGER HOPELESS The AfDB estimates foreign direct investment into Africa at $46-47 billion a year, although it says that assessing Chinese inflows in particular is extremely difficult. At an investment conference in London last month organised by Russian investment bank Renaissance Capital, which is trying to become the leading investment bank in Africa, Africa was touted as the world's biggest opportunity. Speakers sketched a rosy picture of a continent that for decades suffered from falling prices for its commodities and rising costs of its imports from Europe and North America, but which was now reaping the benefits of high commodity prices and low import costs from Asia. Most African countries have seen their currencies strengthen against the dollar, somewhat mitigating soaring oil prices -- although high fuel and rising global food prices are a worry. Corruption remains a huge concern. Anti-corruption pressure groups, companies and officials say it is broadly falling although some countries including Angola lag behind. The number of wars has dwindled drastically in the last decade. Several conference speakers complained about how Western media and aid agencies focused attention on Africa's disasters and remaining wars. This risked making outsiders think the whole continent was like Zimbabwe, which is mired in economic crisis, or Sudan's conflict-torn Darfur, and painted Africa as dangerous, corrupt and needing salvation from outside. Increasingly, however, both campaigners and government donors such as Britain's Department for International Development have moved to calling for more straightforward investment to help reduce poverty. Soaring commodities prices have been a big draw. Gold has doubled in the last four years and oil has quadrupled since 2002, while copper has jumped from $1,500 a tonne in 2004 to $6,600 now. But some investors remain doubtful. One European fund manager told Reuters he believed most of the money from Africa's new commodity boom would end up in Swiss bank accounts. In some countries, despite double-digit growth, not enough seems to get through to the poor. While the last decade has seen the end of many wars, some experts fear climate change in particular might spark more. Others warn Africa's markets are simply too shallow and new to withstand much investor interest. "It wouldn't take much before someone like Fidelity (Investments) owns the entire country," said another investment expert, referring to one of the world's largest fund manag
