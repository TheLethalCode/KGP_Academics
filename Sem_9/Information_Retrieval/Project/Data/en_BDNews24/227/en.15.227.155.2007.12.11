<TITLE> Row over 2020 emissions goal sours Bali climate talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union took a veiled swipe at the United States at climate talks in Bali on Tuesday over Washington's efforts to remove tough 2020 emissions guidelines for rich nations from a draft text. The UN-led talks have become dominated by disputes over whether a final text, or Bali roadmap, should omit any reference that rich nations should axe greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Any watering down or outright removal of this non-binding range would anger developing nations, who are demanding rich nations do more to cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. The row overshadowed Tuesday's 10th anniversary celebrations of the Kyoto Protocol, which delegates at the Bali talks are seeking to replace or expand from 2013. "Of course it is crucial for the European Union, and not only for the European Union," EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas told reporters in Bali. "In order to gather an effective fight against climate change we need this range of reductions for developed countries by 2020," he said. The Bali talks aim to bind all nations to greenhouse gas curbs from 2013 but poor nations want rich countries to do more before they agree. Negotiators are working hard on a formula to draw in the developing world, particularly India and China. The annual two-week talks are expected to wrap up by late Friday and negotiations usually go right up to the last minute. "Good progress has been made but it's not a done deal yet," the head of the U.N.'s Climate Change Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, told a separate meeting of finance ministers. "It's probably going to take a couple of sleepless nights to bring all countries, rich and poor, on board." Environment groups are concerned U.S.-led efforts at the Bali talks could lead to the removal of any reference to 2020 guidelines. The United States says including the guidelines would prejudge the outcome of negotiations. "We need to put a guard rail around the negotiations for the next two years," said Hans Verolme of the WWF environmental group. He said the 25-40 percent range was needed for industrial nations to show they were committed to taking the lead. AUSTRALIA VAGUE Australia's new Climate Change and Water Minister, Penny Wong, refused to confirm if Australia supported the inclusion of what she called an interim emissions reduction target of 25-40 percent by 2020 in the draft text. The government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who arrived in Bali on Tuesday to make his debut on the world stage, has commissioned an analysis of various ranges of emissions targets. He ratified the Kyoto Protocol last week. De Boer said there had been good progress on an adaptation fund to help poor nations cope with the worst impacts of rising seas, droughts, floods and disease. There was agreement by governments on the management of the fund, which has $36 million so far. De Boer has said that could rise to $1.6 billion by 2012. The United Nations has said time was running short and all countries should aim for a 2009 deadline to decide on a successor to Kyoto, building on momentum for a global response after U.N. reports of the dire consequences of inaction. Carbon markets and investors in coal-fired power stations and wind farms also need to know the long-term rules as early as possible. Indonesia's president told finance ministers meeting in Bali that they were not doing enough to find the money to fight global warming. It is the first such meeting of finance officials on the fringes of annual UN climate talks. "Ministers of finance can and should play a much larger and more active role in responding to climate change, both domestically and internationally," said President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. "This is much too important to leave to environment ministers," said Nicholas Stern, a former World Bank chief economist who wrote a report saying the costs of fighting climate change would be far smaller than those of ignoring the problem. "This is about low-carbon growth, not low growth," he sa
