 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The World Bank Tuesday agreed to give Bangladesh a $62.6 million credit to increase agricultural productivity and farm income. Productivity and farm income would be increased through the improved performance of the national agriculture technology system, the WB said in a statement. The estimated cost of the project is $84.6 million, of which the International Development Association, concessionary arm of the WB, is to provide $62.6 million. International Fund for Agriculture Development will provide $19.4 million while the government will contribute $2.6 million to the project. Shaheedul Haque, additional secretary of the Economic Relations Division and Paul Sidhu, task team leader of the WB, led their respective sides at the two-day negotiations that began in Dhaka Monday. The WB intends to use Adaptable Programme Lending to support this government initiative. APL is a flexible instrument with a long-term approach and will be used for the next 15 years in three phases, each five years in duration with clearly defined performance targets. The proposed National Agriculture Technology Project is designed to promote the generation, dissemination, adoption and use of appropriate agricultural technologies through a number of policy reforms, institutional development and investment to support agricultural research, extension and supply chain development. The NATP will have three componentsagriculture research support, agriculture extension support and development of supply chains. "The idea of linking research, extension, farmers and market would remain the centre focus of the project," said Shaheedul Haque. The credit from IDA has a 40-year maturity time with a 10-year grace period; and it carries a service charge of 0.75 percent only. bd
