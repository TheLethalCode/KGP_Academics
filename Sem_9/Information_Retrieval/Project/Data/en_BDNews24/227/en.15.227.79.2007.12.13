 Dhaka, Dec13 (bdnews24.com) -- The Chittagong Stock Exchange is awaiting the Securities and Exchange Commission's nod to launch derivatives on the capital market. At a seminar in Dhaka Wednesday, CSE officials encouraged initiatives to raise awareness of derivatives products among general investors. Derivatives are tools to minimise investment risks. They allow investors to transfer risk by selling off uncertain investments through a forward contract, in which settlement takes place on a specific date in future at a price agreed today. CSE president Nasiruddin Ahmed Chowdhury said that derivatives enhance the ability to differentiate risk and allocate it to those investors most able and willing to take it. Such products would definitely boost investors' confidence as well as add depth to the market, he added. "The Bangladesh Capital Market will have a new dimension in the near future after adding derivatives to the existing equity products." Chowdhury said that the CSE had submitted a draft regulatory and operational framework to the SEC for launching derivatives, as the introduction of such products in the market may need some reforms in existing policy, rules and regulations. CSE's head of compliance Atiquzzaman, in a presentation to the seminar, said that derivatives are a must for risk management. CEO of the bourse AB Siddique said that the capital market was ready and the time has come to develop the market to meet international standards. Derivative products are the most popular investment instruments for institutional as well as individual investors in developed countries, and are taking off in neighbouring countries like India and Pakistan. bdne
