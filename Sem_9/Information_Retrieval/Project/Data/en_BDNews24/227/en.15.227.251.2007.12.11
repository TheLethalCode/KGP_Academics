<TITLE> HRW: Egypt may have made up case against Islamists </TITLE>

 CAIRO, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's domestic security apparatus may have fabricated a case against 22 men detained in 2006 whose arrests appear to be part of a larger pattern of abuse, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday. Egypt arrested the men last year, accusing them of being part of a militant Islamist group called the Victorious Sect that authorities said was planning attacks on tourist targets, a gas pipeline and Muslim and Christian religious leaders. U.S.-based rights watchdog Human Rights Watch said in a report on the case that it was "deeply sceptical" about the allegations, especially because state security prosecutors ultimately decided not to refer the men to court with formal charges. Twelve have been released. "Beyond coerced confessions, there appears to be no compelling evidence to support the government's dramatic claims," it said. "It appears that SSI (State Security Investigations) may have fabricated the allegations made against at least some and possibly all of them. The very name given to the group, the Victorious Sect, may have been invented by SSI officers." An interior ministry spokesman declined immediate comment on the report. The ministry had initially released a statement that the group was headed by a 22-year-old humanities student known by the nickname "Abu Musab", and had released pictures of the men holding boards bearing their names. The ministry statement had said the group had downloaded from the Internet information on how to make explosives and poisons but did not say they had succeeded in making them. It also accused them of trying to buy land for a training base. The interior ministry statement had said the men had "deviant extremist ideas far from true Islam and a mistaken and perverse response to international and regional events". TARGETING DEVOUT YOUNG MEN? Human Rights Watch said the men, 10 of whom are believed to remain in state security custody despite release orders from prosecutors, were severely tortured while in detention, citing reports by lawyers, prison mates and family members of the men. The forms of torture cited included electric shocks, beatings, being burned by cigarettes and being handcuffed and suspended by the arms. One prison mate was quoted as saying security men lit some of the men's beards on fire with matches. Human Rights Watch said the group of 22 appeared to have been targeted because they seemed particularly religious. "The Victorious Sect arrests appear to be part of a larger pattern of SSI abuse, often involving the arbitrary detention of Salafists and other young religious men," Human Rights Watch said. Salafists follow a conservative purist brand of Islam. "SSI routinely summons Salafists and other religiously devout young men for questioning, and sometimes arrests, interrogates and tortures them based on little or no real evidence," it added. Egypt says it opposes torture and prosecutes officers if it has evidence of misconduct. It says allegations of systematic torture were exaggerated to tarnish the image of the police. An Egyptian anti-torture group, the Nadim Centre, accused the government on Monday of officially sanctioning the use of torture and said state violence had escalated. Nadim said it believed torture was sanctioned because of identical methods of abuse it said were used in various prisons and police statio
