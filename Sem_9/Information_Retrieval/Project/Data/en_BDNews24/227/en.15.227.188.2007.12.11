 Seoul, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The start of a new inter-Korean train service on Tuesday could be a last hurrah in cooperation because the man poised to be the South's next president is likely to put such projects on a new and more arduous set of tracks. Lee Myung-bak, a conservative ex-businessman determined to take a tougher line with North Korea, has a commanding lead in opinion polls for the Dec. 19 election. Lee wants to rein in the engagement policy of outgoing President Roh Moo Hyun, who has been criticised for giving away billions in aid to his impoverished neighbour for little in return, and tie the South's largesse more closely to Pyongyang's progress in ending its nuclear arms programme. "Under this current government, the engagement policy is the embracement policy," said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korea Studies at Korea University. Despite international furore over missile tests, the nuclear arms programme and abysmal human rights records, the South has kept up a steady flow of aid to the North during 10 years of liberal presidents, who have viewed it as a small price for keeping the peninsula peaceful and drawing the North nearer. "Lee Myung-bak will emphasise stick and carrots," Nam said. But analysts say Lee will distance himself from some fellow conservatives who want to isolate the North and probably continue rice and fertiliser aid to the destitute state. The food aid helps stabilise North Korea and so calms investors, who fear the hundreds of billions of dollars it would cost to quickly absorb the North would wreck the South's economy. Roh has spent his final weeks in office pushing a bold agenda of cooperation with the North that could net Pyongyang an estimated $10 billion in aid. Roh and the North's leader Kim Jong-il agreed in October to the regular freight train service. Chung Dong-young, the ruling party candidate who served in the Roh government as its point man for North Korea, is trailing badly in the polls having found little support to expand an easy flow of aid to the prickly neighbour. Pyongyang, which several months ago in its official media accused Lee and his Grand National Party of being "traitors to the nation", has toned down its attacks on the front-runner in recent weeks, perhaps accepting the inevitable, analysts said. "Inter-Korean relations may go through an adjustment period of between six months to a year," Cheong Seong-chang, director of the inter-Korean relations programme at Sejong Institute. "After that, relations are likely to improve, even if it is at a slow pace. Both Koreas know that they need each other for development." Lee, a former top executive with the Hyundai Group which has spearheaded investment in the North, has outlined a detailed infrastructure development plan for the North based on progress in international nuclear disarmament talks. If the North scraps its atomic ambitions, Lee said he will set up a $40 billion international investment fund, which is about double the size of the North's yearly economic output. "When it comes to North Korea, I will be thorough yet flexible," Lee said on his Internet site
