 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday permitted the government to appeal against bails for Tarique Rahman in two extortion cases and Arafat Rahman Coco in a separate extortion case. A six-member Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin gave the government permission to file regular appeals against earlier High Court bail orders in the cases. On Dec 2, the High Court granted bail to Tarique, former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son, in two extortion cases. The court also granted bail to younger son Coco on Dec 3 in a separate extortion case. The two extortion cases were filed against Tarique in April.

Businessman Khairul Bashar filed the other case on April 9, charging him with extorting Tk 10.31 crore through coercion and threats. Khaleda's younger son is implicated in a Tk 1.2 crore extortion case filed on May 16, by Abu Ahmed Zayedan, a former business partner of Coco. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed represented the state in hearing. Barristers Rafique-ul Haque and Mahbubuddin Khokon represented Tarique and Coco, respectively. bdnews24.co
