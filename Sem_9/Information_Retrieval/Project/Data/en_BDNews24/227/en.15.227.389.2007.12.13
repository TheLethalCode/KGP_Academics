<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday declared the detention of Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil illegal and asked authorities to free him immediately if there was no case against him. Justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury made the ruling after Jalil's wife Rehana Jalil filed a writ petition with their bench challenging the detention. Barrister ABM Siddiqur Rahman Khan, a counsel for the AL leader, told bdnews24.com that there was no case against Jalil. "There is only a general diary against him under emergency powers rules. So there is no obstacle to his freedom," he said. Jalil was arrested on May 28. On June 5, he was sent to jail with one-month detention, which was extended later. Rehana filed the writ petition with the High Court on Sept 25. On Sept 26, the court issued a rule nisi asking it to explain why the detention of Jalil would not be declared illegal. Deputy attorney general Syeda Afsar Jahan moved court on behalf of the government. bdnew
