<TITLE> India won't allow private import of rice: diplomat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)--Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty Thursday said that India would not allow the private sector to import 5 lakh tonnes of rice from India. Bangladesh, however, wants that the rice import be made by the private sector through open tender. Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee during his visit to Bangladesh this month announced that India would export 5 lakh tons of rice to Bangladesh only. He said that his country had slapped a ban on the export of coarse rice as it would not have a surplus this year. But it relaxed the ban as a goodwill gesture following the devastating cyclone Sidr that hit Bangladesh on Nov 15. "India wants the rice (5 lakh ton) to be imported through the government agencies, not by the private sector," Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty told reporters following the conclusion of the Indo-Bangla dialogue at BRAC Inn centre in the city. The Indian envoy said that the price of imported rice would be much higher if the private sector was allowed in the process. He said that the Indian exporting agency would add the transport cost to the price of the rice and ship it to Bangladesh without any profit. "We will come to know about the channel of rice import in a couple of days", he said. Chakravarty said that the price of one tonne of coarse rice in India was below US $425. The Indian rice is considered very important as Bangladesh fears a possible food shortage after March. Standing crops in 15 Southern districts have been damaged by cyclone Sidr. Again, two severe floods in 2007 caused serious agricultural damage in the country. bdn
