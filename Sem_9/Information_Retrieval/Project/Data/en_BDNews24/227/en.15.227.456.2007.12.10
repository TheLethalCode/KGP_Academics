 Canberra, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australians overwhelmingly like American culture, arts and freedoms, but have growing concerns about the country's lack of gun control and social equality, a survey released on Monday said. The report by the respected United States Studies Centre at Sydney University found that while Australians had become more knowledgeable about the US they were losing faith in policy makers' ability to tackle social and economic issues there. "It is not clear that knowing more about the Americans, and about the American system of government and way of life, has made Australians better disposed towards the Americans," Professor Murray Goot who led the survey told Australian television. "On the contrary, there's some evidence that knowing more has made them rather less favourably disposed to the United States." The two nations are strong allies, with the Australia-US military alliance at the centre of Australia's strategic planning, and with American television and music dominating popular media in Australia. The US Studies Centre findings were from the second part of a survey of Australian attitudes towards the United States, released on Monday. Part one of the survey released in October found more than two thirds of Australians had unfavourable views of US President George W Bush and US involvement in Iraq. It said 69 percent of those polled wanted Australia and the US to set targets to cut carbon emissions. The second part of the survey polled 1,213 people, finding 89 percent had favourable views about American science and technology, with 70 percent support for American art, literature and personal freedoms. But 85 percent of respondents expressed unfavourable views about gun controls in the United States, with 62 percent holding unfavourable views on social equality and 61 percent unhappy about race relations in the US Australia's former conservative government significantly toughened gun laws in 1996 to make it harded for people to buy and own guns after a lone gunman killed 35 people at a popular tourist site on the southern island state of Tasmania. The survey found 77 percent of people were worried about the impact on Australia of US foreign policy decisions, while 71 percent were concerned about the impact of American fast food. The US Studies Centre compared the results with similar surveys going back to 1986, finding a decline in confidence in the US to deal with its social and economic problems. US Studies Centre chief executive Alan Dupont said only 44 percent of Australians in 2007 believed the US would deal wisely with its on social and economic problems, compared to 56 percent in 1986
