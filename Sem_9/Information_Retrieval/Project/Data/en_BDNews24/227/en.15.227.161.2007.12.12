 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The wife of Dhaka University teacher Prof Anwar Hossain Tuesday said vice-chancellor SMA Faiz had asked the families of four detained teachers to consider appeals for bail from the High Court to clear the way for their freedom. Ayesha Akhter told bdnews24.com late Tuesday night by phone: "The VC said the (detained) teachers may get bail from the High Court on appeal." She quoted the VC as saying he had been advised by the government to do so. The development came a day before Wednesday's hearings into the cases against the four teachers, which take place at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. The CMM's court Tuesday framed charges against Dhaka University Teachers Association president Prof Sadrul Amin, general secretary Prof Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Prof Nimchandra Bhowmik. They are charged with inciting the August unrest on campus. Ayesha said: "We don't want to seek bail and we informed the VC about it." "We got to know it from DUTA that the teachers would be released from prison in dignity. And we hope the government will free them with no strings attached." Ayesha said she went to the VC's home along with Nargis Akhter, wife of Prof Harun-or-Rashid. Acting DUTA general secretary Dr Mamun Ahmed, who also joined the meeting, told bdnews24.com: "We have discussed the issue of bail and case disposal." "We are trying to find the best way for the teachers to get out of prison with honour," he said. Acting DUTA president Prof Tajmeri SA Islam was also present at the meeting. bdnews
