<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 index of Britain's leading shares slipped into negative territory by midday on Tuesday as banks and commodities dragged but Xstrata advanced on bid speculation. At 1212 GMT the index was 21 points or 0.32 percent lower at 6,546.9 during a lacklustre session, with many traders looking ahead to the US interest rate decision due later in the day. A quarter-point cut to 4.25 percent is expected by many from the Federal Reserve, which would take its total monetary easing since September to a full percentage point. "I'll be astonished if there isn't another quarter percent cut there," said Tony Craze, a stockbroker at Dawntraders.co.uk. "If we weren't to see one...I could see us coming in for a bit of choppy water in the next day or two." "All the signals are that we may see another rate cut here (in UK) as early as January... depending on how the retailers do. Next year is going to be a tricky year -- probably even tougher than this year has been." On the downside, volatile stock Northern Rock dipped 3.1 percent. The Bank of England rejected a report on Monday that it would prefer to see the stricken bank nationalised. Northern Rock is also expected to drop out of the FTSE 100 later this month, with analysts predicting that the lender will lead as many as eight companies into the FTSE 250 after the quarterly rejig. Using the closing prices from today, index compiler FTSE will formally announce the changes to the FTSE UK index series after the market close on Wednesday. The index changes will be implemented at the start of business on Dec. 24. Another bank featured on the downside was Lloyds TSB, easing 0.2 percent after Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs all cut their price targets on the stock. And with base metal prices falling, miners also lost ground, with Rio Tinto falling 2.9 percent and BHP Billiton down 0.9 percent. Overnight, Rio challenged BHP to make a formal bid to create a mega-mining house or walk away from what could be the second-biggest takeover ever. Heavyweight oil shares weighed as U.S. crude hovered around $88 a barrel. BP lost 0.2 percent, while rival Royal Dutch Shell slipped 0.7 percent. Property stocks also dipped, with Hammerson down 2.6 percent and British Land 2.5 percent lower. Traders said the falls were a result of credit concerns, profit taking and news on Monday that New Star Asset Management's flagship UK commercial property fund was underperforming.. XSTRATA OPEN TO BIDS? Xstrata added 1.8 percent after the Financial Times said the the world's sixth-biggest mining company was open to talks with potential suitors, including Vale and Anglo American. Lehman also raised its price target on Xstrata to 4,300 pence from 4,000 pence. All companies concerned declined comment. Anglo shares eased 1.2 percent. "There is going to be more consolidation in the sector," said Dawntraders.co.uk's Craze. "I wouldn't be at all surprised, there's no smoke without fire." In other stocks, Barratt Developments added 2.1 percent on U.S. rate cut hopes and after Credit Suisse raised its rating on the stock to "outperform" from "neutral". Among companies reporting, Cadbury Schweppes was up 0.4 percent after it said confectionery sales and margins in 2007 will beat its targets due to a recovery in its UK chocolate sales, helped by a drum-playing gorilla advert, and strong growth in US gum. Hotels and restaurants group Whitbread reversed earlier gains to edge down 0.6 percent however, after it said trading at its coffee shops and budget hotels was in line with expectations but its pub restaurants had seen slow sales growth. "Whitbread in particular, they came out with some very good numbers, and that's the way I'll play the market -- looking to buy what I see rather than what I believe might happen. Those numbers were pretty impressive," said Cra
