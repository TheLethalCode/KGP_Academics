 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Wednesday formally charged former communications minister Anwar Hossain Manju, wife Tasmima Hossain and Manju's cousin Mahmud Hossain with taking Tk 1 crore in bribe from a businessman during his term. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka Golam Rabbani accepted the charges, as ACC official Abu Sayeed argued in the court that his investigation found their involvement with the offence. The case involves receiving Tk 1 crore in bribe from Amin Ahmed Bhuiyan, owner of Al Amin Construction when Manju was the communications minister. According to the charge details, the Awami League government in 1996 decided to construct a 648-metre bridge over the river Dharla in Kurigram. The firm got the work, and Manju allegedly sent a man asking company owner Amin Ahmed to see him. On Feb 17, 2000, Amin met Manju at his Dhanmondi home and Manju demanded Tk 1 crore. The complainant alleged that Manju threatened to cancel the work order if he did not pay the money. Manju allegedly asked him to send the money through a pay-order to Aziz Textile Mills. Amin gave the money on Feb 20, 2000 through the pay order to Aziz Textile Mills, owned by Manju, wife, cousin, and daughter Seema Chowdhury. The investigating officer, however, dropped the name of Seema Chowdhury off the chargesheet. ACC assistant director Faiyaz Alam filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station on July 25. The accused are on the run. On June 26, a Dhaka court sentenced Manju to five years in jail and fined him Tk 10,000 in a narcotics case. bdnew
