 UNITED NATIONS, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One employee of the UN refugee agency was killed and another was missing after a car bomb in Algiers on Tuesday, a UN spokesman said, adding that they were in the less damaged of two UN offices hit by the blast. Spokesman Farhan Haq said the office of the United Nations Development Program across the street from the UNHCR office sustained greater damage but information was still being collected on casualties in that office. The bomb was one of two that killed at least forty-seven people in Algiers on Tuesday, a security source said. Haq said the rest of the UNHCR staff were accounted for, including some with injuries. He also said the United Nations, including several agencies such as UNICEF and the UNDP, have a total of 19 international staff and 115 local staff working in Algeria, not necessarily all based at the offices hit by the bomb. Haq said there was no information yet on whether the U.N. offices were the main target of the bomb atta
