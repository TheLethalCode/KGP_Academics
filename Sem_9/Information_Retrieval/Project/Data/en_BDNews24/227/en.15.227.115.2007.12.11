 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices dropped below $88 a barrel on Monday on forecasts that warm weather in the United States would slash demand for heating fuels, adding to a weak outlook for the nation's energy use amid an economic slowdown. Prices had been in positive territory earlier in the day after news that fog on the Houston Ship Channel was slowing crude imports and amid widespread expectations the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates Tuesday to revive economic growth in the world's biggest oil consumer. US crude futures fell 48 cents to $87.80 a barrel by 1820 GMT, while London Brent crude fell 66 cents to $87.98 a barrel. "Crude's gains have moderated this morning because of milder weather," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron trading in Chicago. US heating demand will be about 13 percent below normal in the week ending Dec. 15 as temperatures rise above average in the key heating regions, the National Weather Service forecast in a weekly report on Monday. Top US weather forecasters have said this winter is likely to average warmer than normal. U.S. oil prices have been in a tailspin since hitting a peak $99.29 on Nov. 21 amid signs of a weakening U.S. economy. Leading U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley said in a research note Monday the U.S. economy is likely headed to a recession, pulled down by ongoing tightening in credit markets that is curbing business spending. Energy traders are concerned that an economic slowdown could sharply cut into demand for fuel. The US Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point after better-than-expected US employment data on Friday reduced the likelihood of an aggressive 50 basis-point reduction. Oil prices had been in positive territory earlier Monday after the US Coast Guard said dense fog had delayed 41 ships from entering the Houston Ship Channel, a 53-mile-long (85 kilometers) waterway leading to the busiest US petrochemical port. Also stemming oil's slide, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to leave its output levels unchanged, despite calls from consuming nations for more oil to meet winter demand. "OPEC rolled over quotas as we expected; this was constructive, as OPEC demonstrated its intent to continue to tightly manage its crude supply," Mike Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale, said in a research note. US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said on Monday that he had hoped OPEC would raise production at the meeting to stem falling inventory levels. Stockpiles of crude oil in top oil consumer the United States dropped last week to their lowest since early 20
