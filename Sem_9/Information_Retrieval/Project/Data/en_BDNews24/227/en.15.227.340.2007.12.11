 LONDON, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Patients' lives could be put at risk under new plans to use ambulances with just one person to respond to emergencies, paramedics and doctors said on Tuesday.

The government has claimed the changes and the way response times were measured would save lives but Fox disputed that. "We are already hearing of solo responders transporting patients but that is not right as you cannot manage the patient if you are driving," Fox, who is also a solo-responder driver, told the BBC.

His comments were echoed by Unison and the British Emergency Medicine Association. In a statement, Health Minister Ben Bradshaw, said that introducing more single response teams would "free up resources for other calls and help to optimise performance". "Fast response vehicles can often get to the scene faster than traditional ambulances and can provide assessment and care until a further response arrives," he sa
