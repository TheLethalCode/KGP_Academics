 Manila, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Philippine soldiers, backed by armoured vehicles, were deployed around a Manila court on Tuesday as two dozen rogue troops who attempted a bizarre coup last month were brought for trial in a previous case. The rogue troops, a senator and an army general were brought to the courthouse in handcuffs and police prevented reporters from attending proceedings. At the previous appearance on Nov. 29, the group had broken out of the court, marched to the nearby Peninsula Manila and taken over the luxury hotel for six hours, demanding the overthrow of the government. No one responded to the call and the group surrendered after elite SWAT troops launched an assault on the Peninsula, using armoured vehicles to crash into the plush lobby and firing tear gas shells and shots in the air. "We will not allow them to do that again," said Major-General Fernando Mesa, military commander in the capital Manila, as he supervised the security arrangements at the court. "There's nothing to worry about. We're here to make sure they will behave and will never attempt to flee from the court and try another rebellion." President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who returned to Manila on Tuesday after a 10-day visit to France, Spain, Britain and Kuwait, said there was no danger to her government. "It is clear that the actions of these few desperate men reveal just how out of touch they are with the hopes and dreams of the average Filipino," Arroyo said in an arrival statement. "In the end, the rule of law prevailed. The transgressors will not hold our nation hostage with impunity. They will be punished with the full force of the law." The group is on trial for a previous coup attempt in 2003, which also ended in a surrender. In that year, the rogue forces took over a luxury service apartment block in the capital. Mesa said the situation in the capital had stabilised even though police were still looking for 20 people, including seven former soldiers, who escaped from the Peninsula. A convoy of army and police vehicles took the rogue troops back to jail after hour-long proceedings in court. The group has also been charged with rebellion for the Nov. 29 coup, but hearings have not yet begun
