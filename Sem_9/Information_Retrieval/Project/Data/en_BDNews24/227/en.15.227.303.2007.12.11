 ALGIERS, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least forty-seven people were killed when two bombs exploded in Algiers on Tuesday, a security source said, the second attack in eight months on the north African OPEC member country. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but commentators said it appeared the work of al Qaeda's north Africa wing, which claimed a similar bombing in downtown Algiers in April and other blasts east of the capital over the summer that have worried foreign investors.

Some attacks or attempted attacks have occurred on the 11th of the month in what Algerians interpret as a form of homage to the September 11 attacks on the United States. Western nations have expressed concern at militant islamist activity through the north African region and dependents of several western firms operating in Algeria have been repatriated over the past 12 months due to security worries. Anis Rahmani editor of Ennahar daily and a security specialist told Reuters: "Al Qaeda wanted to send a strong message that it is still capable despite the lost of several top leaders.
