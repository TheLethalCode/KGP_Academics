 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar Bin Mohammad Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud sticks to his offer to buy out the 94 percent shares in the state-run Rupali Bank at $458 million, said the prince's senior adviser Thursday. "Despite news reports to the contrary, Prince Bandar stands by his offer," Sir Frank Peters told bdnews24.com. He made the comments following newspaper reports that the prince has been served with a legal notice asking him to deposit $458 million by Dec 26 as per the Privatisation Commission's tender participation rules. "The headline in a national daily newspaper that read 'Saudi prince now wants to pay $185, not $458' is inaccurate and a misrepresentation of the terms of the offer made by Prince Bandar and somewhat mischievous," Peters said in an email to bdnews24.com. The Saudi prince won two separate bids to take over the government's 93.26 percent stakes in the bank at $458 million. The rest of the shares remain in as public issues. Earlier this week, the Privatisation Commission found that the prince was proposing $185 millionmuch lower than his earlier offer of $458 millionfor the shares. Prince Bandar made the new offer in a letter to army chief General Moeen U Ahmed this week. The terms elucidated in these communications were crystal clear and in no way an alteration to or distortion of the terms offered by Prince Bandar in his tender submission, the letter said. Peters said his client wanted to clarify certain misconceptions, adding that according to the government's own accounting, the bank has $270 million liabilities of bad debt. "The GOB has offered bonds to help compensate, but HRH Prince Bandar has refused to accept these because of the greater burden of added accumulated payable interest it would place on the GOB and because of the questionable value of the bonds on the international market," he said. "In the better interests of both parties and as a fair and equitable gesture, His Royal Highness has offered to take on the price of the $270-million debt within the price of his offer, thus alleviating the burden of the heavy interest to be paid to HRH and the Rupali Bank at the maturity of these bonds. Negotiations are continuing." "Let there be no misunderstanding," the prince's senior adviser said, adding the offer of $456 million for the 93.26 percent shares by Prince Bandar still firmly stood. "With the co-operation of the Government of Bangladesh, take-over of Rupali Bank will be imminent," he said. "Prince Bandar is confident of a quick resolution to the outstanding issues, for the benefit of both parties and the people of Bangladesh," Sir Peters pointed out. He also said Prince Bandar and members of his family were appalled by the fact his strictly private communications to the offices of the government had been made public through the media, which he said was not for the first time. "This action carries no honour and is not good for the overall image of Bangladesh among potential international investors." "It is not the practice of HRH Prince Bandar or members of his team to conduct business negotiations through the media," Sir Peters added. b
