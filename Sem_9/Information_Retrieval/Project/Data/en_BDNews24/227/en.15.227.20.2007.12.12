<TITLE> Italy's Berlusconi attacks paper over graft story </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday accused a left-wing newspaper and a "red army" of prosecutors of inventing charges that he tried to bribe a senator and a state television official. The media magnate dismissed a report that said he offered jobs and cash to a senator from the ruling centre-left coalition to bring down the government and asked the head of RAI state TV's soap opera department to offer roles to four actresses. "This alleged scoop by La Repubblica is pure invention. I have absolutely nothing to worry about," Berlusconi said on a satellite TV channel set up to promote his conservative political party which he recently renamed "People of Freedom". Berlusconi, Italy's richest man, also owns three private TV channels via his Mediaset business. He formed Italy's biggest party, previously named Forza Italia, to launch his political career in 1994 and served as prime minister from 2001-2006. "As soon as there is a whiff of an election campaign, the 'red army' of prosecutors gets mobilised," said Berlusconi, who has pushed for new elections since narrowly losing to centre-left leader Romano Prodi last year, a result he disputes. The 71-year-old businessman's lawyer said Berlusconi had not been notified of any investigation by the court in Naples cited by La Repubblica and that the story was "false". The court did not want to comment but said it might issue a statement later. The front-page story by La Repubblica accused Berlusconi of trying to get RAI's Agostino Sacca to hire actresses including one whose unspecified connections with a centre-left politician could be used to Berlusconi's advantage. It said he offered Senator Nino Randazzo -- who represents Italians in Australia -- a foreign ministry job in Berlusconi's "next government" to swap sides or stage a "little absence" in a crucial vote. This would deprive Prodi of his tiny majority in the upper house and trigger a government collapse. Randazzo confirmed he was approached by Berlusconi to help bring down Prodi -- and declined -- but said "we didn't talk about money so I don't see any corruption in penal terms". Berlusconi said that he had "courted senators and offered candidacies or government posts to deserving people", but said this was common practice and "completely correct". Berlusconi has faced various bribery and fraud trials in his career but has been acquitted or seen the statute of limitations apply. Berlusconi himself said he had faced 96 different cases since entering politics.
