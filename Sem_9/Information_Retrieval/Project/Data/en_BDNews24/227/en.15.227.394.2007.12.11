<TEXT>
 BERNE, Switzerland, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The use of technology in deciding goal-line debates will be back on the agenda this weekend when FIFA's executive committee meets to assess trials being carried out at the Club World Cup in Tokyo. In a statement released on Tuesday, world soccer's governing body said "the latest results and conclusions regarding goal-line technology will be one of the main topics" of Saturday's meeting in the Japanese capital. The executive committee meeting, taking place the day before the Club World Cup final, will also reconsider controversial proposals to ban international football matches at high altitude stadiums. FIFA introduced a ban on matches played more than 2,500 metres above sea level in May but lifted the ruling a month later following strong protests in South America and a visit to FIFA headquarters by Bolivian president Evo Morales. The executive committee is now set to look at the matter as part of a more wide-ranging debate on football being played in all form of extreme conditions, basing its decisions on a report drawn up at a medical experts' conference in Zurich last month. FIFA's top body is also due to discuss a proposal by its legal department aimed at resolving an eligibility row between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland football associations. The proposal, which would allow players from across the island to freely choose which national team they play for, has been strongly criticised by the Northern Irish association who argue that the best young players from the north will be tempted south if the plan is adopted
