 BEIJING, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Shanghai property tycoon Zhou Zhengyi on Monday appealed his 16-year sentence for graft, citing lack of evidence, state media reported. Zhou, a former snack shop owner who rose to become one of China's richest men, also requested a Shanghai court annul a court order to confiscate illegal earnings, Xinhua news agency quoted a court spokesman as saying. The appeal cited a lack of evidence and no basis in law for the charges of misappropriation of funds, bribery and forging value-added tax (VAT) receipts, said Xinhua. Zhou, who only a year ago completed a three-year jail term for stock market fraud and falsifying documents, was found guilty last month of five charges including misappropriation of funds, bribery and forging VAT receipts. The court at that time described the verdict as lenient and said it took into account the fact Zhou had confessed to some of his crimes and returned much of the embezzled amount. Zhou, 46, once named China's 11th richest man with a net worth estimated at $320 million, was detained last year in a crackdown that followed the ousting of Shanghai's former Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu. Chen himself faces a criminal investigation for his part in a 3.7 billion yuan ($500 million) social security fund scandal. Dozens of other officials and executives have been jailed or investigated in connection with the case. (US$=7.40 yu
