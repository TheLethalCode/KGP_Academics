 ISMAILIA, Egypt, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police confiscated 500 kg (1,100 lb) of explosives in northern Sinai on Wednesday which were probably destined for Gaza, a security official said. Police found the TNT in 12 plastic bags hidden in mountains near to Rafah on Egypt's borders with the Gaza Strip. They said smugglers were likely trying to move the explosives across the nearby border. The Egyptian authorities publicise their activities to stop smuggling and illegal crossings at the Gaza border following repeated Israeli complaints that they were not doing enough to prevent arms and explosives from reaching Palestinian militants. Gaza has been under the control of the Islamist movement Hamas since June, when it drove out political rivals Fatah -- who are favoured by Israel, Egypt and the United States. Egypt says it is doing its best to patrol the border with the personnel it is allowed to deploy there under the 1979 peace treaty and a subsequent agreement with Israel.
