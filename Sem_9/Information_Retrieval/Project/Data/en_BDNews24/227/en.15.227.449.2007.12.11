 Singapore, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares bounced and the dollar firmed on Tuesday following confidence-boosting cash injections into struggling financial firms and in anticipation of a US interest rate cut. Markets fully price in a quarter point cut in the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate later on Tuesday, but recent positive US economic data dashed expectations of a more aggressive move, lifting the dollar and pressuring government bonds. Stock market investors took heart from Monday's news of cash injections into Swiss bank UBS and bond insurer MBIA Inc, both of which are struggling with the fallout of the US subprime mortgage market crisis. "These moves have created a sense of reassurance in the market about the subprime issue, and this along with expectations of a US rate cut, will support stocks," said Masayoshi Yano, senior manager of investment information at Tokai Tokyo Securities. By 0200 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had climbed 0.7 percent, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks gained 0.8 percent, tracking similar Wall Street gains and erasing Monday's losses. The MSCI index is about 8 percent away from its Nov. 1 record high, and has rallied nearly 39 percent this year, triple the 13 percent rise for MSCI's key world stock index Across the region, Hong Kong shares led gainers, up nearly 1 percent. BANKS IN VOGUE Investors snapped up financial stocks across the region, pushing MSCI's index for the sector up 1 percent, encouraged by news that some big cash-rich players found the battered sector attractive. UBS on Monday reported a $10 billion writedown, making it the biggest casualty of the subprime crisis among European banks, but also reported an emergency injection of funds from Singapore and the Middle East. Similarly, MBIA said buyout firm Warburg Pincus has agreed to invest $1 billion in the company. "The market is beginning to realise that there are investors with money who are willing to take risks, so players are not responding as negatively as before to news of subprime-related losses," a Japanese trading house senior dealer said. "I think the market focus is returning to risk appetite." Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ rose 1.7 percent, South Korea's Woori Finance Holdings gained 3.4 percent and Australia's top investment bank Macquarie Group gained 3.1 percent. The Federal Reserve is due to announce its rate decision at 1915 GMT, with a quarter point cut in its benchmark rate to 4.25 percent now seen as a done deal. RECEDING FEARS Government bonds, which usually benefit from rate cuts, extended their overnight retreat as market players further unwound bets on an aggressive half-point cut after surprisingly firm data from the troubled US housing market Japan's benchmark 10-year bond yield hit a one-month high at 1.580 percent, tracking overnight falls in US Treasuries. Receding fears of imminent US recession and expectations of aggressive Fed cuts helped the dollar, which hit a one-month high against the yen at 111.95, before retreating to 111.75, still way above a 2- low of 107.22 yen hit last month. The euro was steady against the dollar at around $1.4715 and a touch firmer against the yen Traders said the dollar likely to hold steady until the Fed decision with high yielding currencies, such as the Australian dollar and the sterling most likely to benefit from recovering risk appetite at the expense of low-yielding yen. Oil prices stabilised just above $88 after a dip on Monday as forecasts of mild winter in the United States suggested softer demand for heating fuels. Gold which is seen as an inflation hedge and benefits from costly oil and weak dollar, gave up some of Monday's strong gains, but held above the psychological level of $800 per ounce
