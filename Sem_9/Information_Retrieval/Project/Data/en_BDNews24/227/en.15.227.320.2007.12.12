<TITLE> European shares fall after Fed dashes US rate hopes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European share indexes fell on Wednesday, led by banks and cyclical stocks, as concern grew that the US Federal Reserve's rate cut on Tuesday may not be enough to prevent further damage to the world's largest economy. By 1100 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.9 percent at 1,526.41 points. The depth of the sell-off was not as profound by midday as declining shares outnumbered advancers by about 5 to 1, compared with 35 to 1 in early trade. Reflecting a retrenchment in investor risk appetite, banks drove the decline in the broader market, followed by autos and miners, while the few sectors to register a rise included defensives such as food producer Nestle and utilities E.ON and RWE. "The clear message is the Fed is a lot more sanguine than the markets are at the moment," said Andrew Lynch, a portfolio manager at Schroders. "It's obviously difficult to determine who is actually right but there is certainly a case to be made that maybe things are not as bad as the markets have worked themselves up to." The Fed cut its benchmark funds rate by an expected quarter-point to 4.25 percent, but did not deliver the steep cut to the discount rate -- the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed -- that many had hoped would bring relief to tight conditions in the credit markets. Banks bore the brunt of investor dissatisfaction with the Fed's action. Royal Bank of Scotland was the top weighted loser, falling 4.1 percent, while UBS shed 3.4 percent and Barclays fell 3.8 percent. U.S. stock futures suggested a recovery on Wall Street later after the three benchmark indexes fell by more than 2 percent on Tuesday. Other stocks in the red included German auto manufacturer Daimler, which fell by nearly 3 percent, ranking it among the top five weighted losers. Rio Tinto fell 2.6 percent after the company said it saw nothing new in comments from BHP Billiton, which said it was considering its next move in its attempt to take over its smaller rival. BHP shares fell 2.8 percent. A 1.5 percent fall in the price of copper after the Fed flagged its concern about U.S. economic growth weighed on the mining sector, with Antofagasta down 4.3 percent, Anglo American down 1.5 percent and Kazakhmys down 3.3 percent. "Clearly the major risk is that the Fed is forced to cut rates once again ... The other opportunity will be that the Fed may cut the discount rate more aggressively, and another possibility will be for the Fed to inject more liquidity," said Carole Laulhere, a currency strategist at Societe Generale. A Fed source said on Wednesday the central bank was actively considering all the tools it has available to address liquidity issues, while newspapers reported action could come as early as this session. But the prospect of prompt Fed intervention did nothing to stem the slide across Europe, where all major indexes fell. London's FTSE 100 index was down 0.9 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX lost 0.6 percent and the Paris CAC 40 fell 1.3 percent. Mining group Xstrata's comments that it had held preliminary talks about possible mergers but the discussions had resulted in no proposals pushed shares in the company down by 1.6 percent. Xstrata hit a lifetime high last week as speculation of a possible bid for the company surfaced. Spanish retailer Inditex, owner of fashion retailer Zara, weighed on the broader retail sector. Shares in the company fell by nearly 5 percent after nine-month net profit beat expectations but sales fell slightly short, raising concern about the company's future growth. Swedish rival H&M fell 1.9 percent, Britain's Next dropped 1.8 percent and France's PPR -- owner of the Gucci label -- fell 1 percent. Among gainers was Swiss food group Nestle which rose 0.7 percent, while British confectionery group Cadbury gained 1.4 percent. Shares in German drug and chemical maker Bayer rose 1.2 percent after JP Morgan upgraded its price target on the stock, while chemicals group BASF rose 0.8 percent despite an EU anti-cartel fine that left the company with a fractionally higher penalty. The biggest percentage gainer was Portuguese energy firm Galp, which rose 3.3 percent after a UBS research report said the company could still find significant oil reserves in Braz
