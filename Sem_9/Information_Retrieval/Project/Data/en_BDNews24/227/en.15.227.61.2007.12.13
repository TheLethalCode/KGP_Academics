 TEL AVIV, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chief of Israel's armed forces said on Wednesday intensified strikes against Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip were stemming some rocket salvoes but he believed a big offensive would be needed. Lieutenant-General Gabi Ashkenazi, appointed after last year's costly Lebanon war with a mandate to overhaul the military, said Israel would also prepare to attack distant targets -- a possible allusion to arch-foes Iran and Syria. Addressing a Tel Aviv security conference, Ashkenazi said that almost daily raids on Gaza, including one on Tuesday that killed five militants, had brought "a reduction in the ground threat and the firing of rockets" but no sign of cessation. "We will come to the point where we will have to carry out the big operation," he said. Israeli officials have with increasingly frequency threatened to invade Gaza, where Hamas Islamists seized control in June after routing forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who favours coexistence with the Jewish state. Weighed against calls for a sweep are Israeli assessments that the military death toll would be in the double or even triple figures -- with Palestinian fatalities several times that -- and warnings by Abbas's administration that peace talks revived at last month's Annapolis conference would be at risk. Ashkenazi said Israel's armed forces have been training for various forms of combat, including against guerrillas, after suffering setbacks in the 2006 summer offensive against Lebanese Hezbollah strongholds. Although Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah claimed victory after the 34-day war, Ashkenazi said that Israel's "deterrence" -- its ability to project military supremacy in a largely hostile region -- had "increased greatly". Israeli warplanes bombed northern Syria on Sept. 6, an attack which some independent analysts believe targeted a nascent nuclear reactor. Israel has not given details on the operation and Syria has said it had no such facility. The mysterious raid stoked speculation that Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, could similarly strike the nuclear facilities of Iran, whose president has called for the Jewish state to be "wiped off the map". "In the coming years the need to strike at significant long -range targets will become far more important, therefore the capability to act both defensively and offensively against various threats will be upgraded greatly with a strong emphasis on long-range capability," Ashkenazi said, without naming specific countri
