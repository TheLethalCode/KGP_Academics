<TITLE> EU close to full unity on Kosovo: ministers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union is close to full unity in support for Kosovo's drive for independence, with only Cyprus insisting that sovereignty for the Serbian province must be backed by a UN resolution, ministers said on Monday. Kosovo Albanian leaders said they will immediately start talks with their Western backers on steps leading to a declaration of independence, which a senior official said would be "much earlier than May". "There is virtual unity on Kosovo," Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told reporters ahead of EU talks in Brussels as a Dec. 10 date set by Western powers as a deadline for international mediation efforts was reached. "Apart from Cyprus, which has enormous problems with this ... all other countries are going in this direction," said Luxembourg's Jean Asselborn. Skender Hyseni, spokesman of Kosovo's "unity team" in the breakaway territory's negotiations with Serbia, said talks with Western powers would start on steps leading to a declaration of independence and subsequent international recognition. Asked to clarify recent speculation on the timing of a declaration, Hyseni said it would be "much earlier than May". Leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority are widely expected to proclaim sovereignty from late January onwards. Serbia, backed by Russia, vehemently opposes independence. Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stepped up warnings of the potential fallout on Monday, saying that a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) could set off a chain reaction of problems around the world. "I want to stress that UDI of Kosovo and recognition of such independence will not remain without consequences," Lavrov said on the day mediation between Belgrade and Pristina expired. "It will create a chain reaction throughout the Balkans and other areas of the world," he told to reporters in Nicosia after talks with Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos. Major powers in the United Nations Security Council are due to debate Kosovo on Dec. 19, but Moscow has already said it will call for more negotiations -- something the United States and the vast majority of EU states think is pointless. DOUBTERS Cyprus and to a lesser extent Greece have led a group of doubters within the bloc that at one time numbered half a dozen states concerned either because of their proximity to the Balkans or because of separatist movements on their territory. In a report to U.N. Secretary-General Ban ki-moon last Friday, mediators from the United States, European Union and Russia said four months of talks had found no compromise on whether Kosovo should be independent or just self-ruled. Confirmation of the failure of mediation came nearly nine years after NATO bombing pushed Serb forces out of Kosovo because of their ruthless tactics against an insurgency. The province has been under U.N. administration since then. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said NATO might have to reinforce its 16,000-strong KFOR peace force to deal with any outbreaks of violence if tensions spiked between Kosovo's 90 percent ethnic Albanians and its Serb minority. "That is something we might have to address and contingency plans have been put in place," Miliband told BBC Radio. EUROPEAN FUTURE EU mediator Wolfgang Ischinger was due to brief the EU ministers on the talks between the Kosovo Albanians and Serbia, which offered only broad autonomy within the Serbian state. Leaders of the 27-nation bloc are expected to declare at a summit on Friday that negotiations have been exhausted and that the future of both Serbia and Kosovo lies in the European Union, diplomats said. Western diplomats say Russia has to recognize it is virtually isolated. "The question for the Russians is have they changed their position? They've had the further negotiating effort they wanted and there was no agreement," one senior Western envoy said. "If there is no Russian change, then the idea is to change the status of Kosovo on the basis of existing (Security Council) resolutions," the envoy said. That would effectively take the issue away from the United Nations. The EU would then take over police and justice functions from the United Nations and appoint a civilian representative in a supervisory role, while NATO troops remained in pla
