 BANGALORE, India, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India won their three-test series against Pakistan on Wednesday after the visitors held on for a draw on the final day of the third and final test. India captain and leg-spinner Kumble took five for 60 off 14 overs after setting Pakistan an unlikely victory target of 374 from 48 overs. When bad light stopped play, the visitors were clinging on at 167 for seven. India won the opening game by six wickets in New Delhi and the second test in Kolkata was drawn. It was India's first series win against Pakistan at home since 1979-80. Kumble may rue his decision to delay the declaration until an hour before tea. Saurav Ganguly made 91 before Dinesh Karthik's 52 off 67 balls ended Pakistan's hopes of a series-leveling victory as India closed their second innings at 284 for six. "We gave ourselves a good opportunity. It was important for us to ensure that we gOt the score which we are absolutely sure about winning the series," Kumble told a news conference. "If the weather had held up we would have finished the game. Forty-five overs were enough." Kumble, leading in his first test series, dismissed opener Yasir Hameed (39) and stand-in captain Younis Khan for nought in the space of three balls in his home city to stun Pakistan. The tall leg-spinner then had opener Salman Butt caught behind for a dour 58-ball eight to put the visitors under pressure. Faisal Iqbal (51) and in-form Misbah-ul-Haq (37) kept India at bay with a 71-run fourth-wicket stand before wickets fell in a heap. MEDIUM PACE Kumble had Iqbal miscue a pull to mid-on and next man Kamran Akmal was bowled by the next ball in an unplayable spell, bowled at medium-pace. "I realised I needed to do that this morning. There was no spin, no bounce and no pace off the wicket. The only option was to get people out when the ball kept low," Kumble said. Part-time spinner Yuvraj joined in the act when he dismissed Misbah and debutant Yasir Arafat in successive overs. Cheered on by screaming crowds, part-time spinner Yuvraj had Misbah and debutant Yasir Arafat (0) bowled in successive overs before the fading light ended hopes of a victory. Earlier, Ganguly, playing his 99th test, missed a rare double hundred and a century in a match when he flashed at fast bowler Mohammad Sami and Iqbal took the catch at gully after India had resumed on 131 for two. Ganguly, adjudged player of the match as well as the series, fell in the middle of a collapse when paceman Mohammad Sami struck twice after leg-spinner Danish Kaneria trapped Rahul Dravid lbw for 42. Ganguly, who scored a century in the drawn second test in Kolkata, also passed 1,000 runs for the calendar year. Sami had Yuvraj Singh edge to the wicketkeeper for two. But Karthik shared in a 100-run stand for the sixth wicket, first with Vangipurappu Laxman (14 retired hurt) and subsequently Irfan Pathan (21 not out). Karthik, who hit Kaneria for a six and two fours in an over, smashed eight fours and a six before edging paceman Yasir Arafat behind to prompt the declaration. The series win completed a double for India, who won the one-day rubber 3-2
