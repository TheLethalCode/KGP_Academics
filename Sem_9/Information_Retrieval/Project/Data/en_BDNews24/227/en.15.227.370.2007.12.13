 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  A select group of 2,000 officers of Dhaka Metropolitan Police will undergo a specialised training course after the Eid to be able to conduct themselves in more public-friendly ways, DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed told bdnews24.com recently. The DMP commissioner said the special training programme has been designed with an aim to effect mental and attitudinal changes among the trainees so that they can discharge their duties more humanely and justly. The ten-day event is scheduled to take off after the Eid-ul Azha, Naim said. "Allegations are there that people are not received well when they approach the police at a police station or other police posts for assistance. The situation has changed since 'service delivery officers' were posted at the police stations of the metropolis," he claimed. "People now are able to file a case or receive attention of police officers, when necessary. But this training has been envisaged to ensure 100 percent pro-people service delivery by the police officers." The DMP chief said the trained officers would compulsively visit the spots of occurrences immediately after a case is filed and initiate the process of justice delivery. "The officers undergoing the training will receive helpful lessons in psychology and be provided with a set of situation-specific directives so that they may use them to be able to handle difficult cases methodically," the commissioner said. He said police officers of all ranks from sub-inspectors to commissioners will be divided into 20 100-strong trainee batches, who will be afforded the special lessons offered by senior police officers and specialists. "We've almost completed the preparations for the event. The booklet printing is also on. "We have had to postpone the training until after the Eid vacation, considering heavy deployment of the police force before the festival, around the Victory Day celebrations and Eid shopping," Naim said. The DMP commissioner claimed that the training programme would hopefully put an end to public harassment by the police as it would change they psyche. bdnew
