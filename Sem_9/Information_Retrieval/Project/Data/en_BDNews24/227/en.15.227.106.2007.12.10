 Rajshahi, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Relatives, colleagues and students Monday thronged the main gate of the Rajshahi Central Jail on news that the president had pardoned the four detained Rajshahi University teachers. Scores of teachers and students from different departments of the university also crowded the jail gate in the city's Shaheb Bazar. The relatives and others, however, refused to comment to journalists before the release of the teachers. Nothing could be known from the jail sources until midday about whether the detained teachers are going to be freed Monday. On Dec 4, a Rajshahi court sentenced management teacher Moloy Kumar Bhowmik and mass communication teachers Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun to two years in jail for inciting student agitation in late August. President Iajuddin Ahmed Monday afternoon approved the mercy petitions filed by the wives of the teachers, clearing the way for their release. Moloy Kumar Bhowmik's sister Kalpana Bhowmik and Abdullah Al Mamun's wife Udisha Islam were staying at the jail gate. Prof Faekuzzaman and Rabiul Islam of the Islamic history and culture department, Rabiul Islam, Khademul Islam, Moshiur Rahman and Mostaque Ahmed of the mass communication department, Hasibul Alam Prodhan of the law department and Rezaul Karim of Language department have been staying there. More than 100 students were also staying in the jail gate. bdnews
