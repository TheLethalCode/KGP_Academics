 MANILA, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines declared a truce with communist rebels over the Christmas period, unilaterally suspending army offensives for about three weeks, an official said on Thursday. Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita, a retired general, told reporters the ceasefire would take effect from midnight of Dec. 16 and last until Jan. 6, much longer than the two 24-hour truces last year. Ermita said he had sent a letter to the defence and military establishments informing them the president had approved their proposal for an extended truce this year as part of government's confidence measures to lure the rebels back to peace talks. "We hope the communist New People's Army (NPA) rebels would reciprocate our unilateral action so the country could expect a peaceful yuletide season this year," Ermita said. Since 1986, the government has traditionally observed a holiday ceasefire with communist rebels as the mainly Roman Catholic country celebrates one of the world's longest Christmas seasons. Christmas holidays in the Philippines start with dawn masses from Dec. 16 and end on Jan. 6. The rebels, waging a protracted guerrilla warfare since the late 1960s, are active in 69 of 81 provinces. The conflict has killed about 40,000 people and stunted economic growth in the country. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has ordered the military to wipe out the communist insurgency before she steps down in 2010. "If we are to become a first world country, we have to put a stop to their ideological nonsense and their criminal acts once and for all," Arroyo told officials on the central island of Masbate on Thursday. "The communist rebels have spent years as a low-level threat. It is time for their disruption and violation of human rights to be put to rest so that the nation can move ahead."
