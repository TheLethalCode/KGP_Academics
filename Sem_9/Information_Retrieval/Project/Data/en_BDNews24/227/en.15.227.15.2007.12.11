 NAIROBI, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somalia's new prime minister urged donors, aid workers and Somalis on Tuesday to be patient in their desire to see an improvement in the country's humanitarian crisis, described by the UN as Africa's worst. Nur Hassan Hussein was speaking in Nairobi where U.N. officials showed him videotaped testimony from Somali children sent fleeing to squalid makeshift camps by fighting between government forces and Islamist insurgents. Hussein was also told by UN officials that growing human rights abuses had led to an "atmosphere of terror" in Somalia where deep mistrust between the government and aid agencies has hampered efforts to get food to hundreds of thousands of people. "The expectations from the international community -- including the humanitarian community and the Somali community -- (are) very high," Hussein told donors and UN officials who met to discuss an appeal for $406 million in aid to Somalia for 2008. "We hope to meet these expectations. We hope these expectations will not bring frustrations, because if we as a government cannot deliver, that can happen," he said. Aid officials have long complained that red tape, rampant piracy and a proliferation of roadblocks run by gun-toting militias demanding "taxes" from passing truck drivers are hobbling their operations. "ATMOSPHERE OF THREAT" "There has been the continued rise in tangible threats, both administrative and mercenary, such as roadblocks, as well as security, such as roadside bombs, explosive devices," said Eric Laroche, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. "But our problems are more than just physical blockages. There is a very challenging atmosphere of threat, intimidation, coloured by negative statements from the authorities we should be cooperating with," he said. Many aid officials hope that Hussein, in charge of the Somali Red Crescent for 16 years before being appointed premier last month, will push the government to address these obstacles. But critics say the transitional government is more concerned about political infighting that has all but paralysed it since its formation in 2004. Hussein himself suffered a setback when five senior officials quit cabinet barely 24 hours after he appointed them, claiming bias against their clans. Many aid officials are concerned that political turmoil coupled with Somalia's perennial problems -- hunger, violence, cycles of floods and droughts -- will be met with donor fatigue. The Horn of Africa country has been largely cut off from the rest of the world since 1991 when warlords toppled military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the rule of law broke down. As Hussein attended the function in neighbouring Kenya, a roadside bomb planted by suspected insurgents killed two policeman and a civilian in Mogadishu, witnesses said. In a separate incident, unknown gunmen killed a soldier patrolling a southern neighbourhood of the city. A local official said three civilians and six militiamen were killed later on Tuesday in clan fighting in the central Middle Shabelle's district of Adale. Hundreds of residents had fled the area, he said.
