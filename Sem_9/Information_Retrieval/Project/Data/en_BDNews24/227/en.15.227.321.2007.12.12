 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association Tuesday opposed the proposed overhaul of the European Union's trade discount system saying that it would hit the country's knitwear industry hard. "The new generalised system of preferences, if approved, will throw the country's flourishing knitwear and backward linkage industries into uncertainty," BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque said in a news briefing. The new EU GSP has proposed 30 percent value addition for a product to get the benefit. "We want EU to reconsider the draft of the proposed GSP and include at least 45 percent value addition provision instead of a proposed 30 percent," Hoque said. BKMEA also decided to write letters to EU embassies in Dhaka and Bangladesh embassies in the EU countries within two to three days. "If necessary, we'll go to the headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels to talk about the issue," Hoque added. The EU GSP is the preferential trade regime the EU has been granting to developing countries for the last 30 years. It is worth more than $100 billion in trade flows and is by far the most important preferential trading regime in the world, providing more market access for developing countries than the preferential access schemes of the US, Japan and Canada combined. BKMEA expressed concern over a continued rise in the prices of locally produced yarn. "We are asking the government to take necessary steps to control the local yarn market," Hoque said. Yarn sells at $2.9 per kg in Bangladesh, but the price is $2.4 in India, he said referring to the prices of the current week. bd
