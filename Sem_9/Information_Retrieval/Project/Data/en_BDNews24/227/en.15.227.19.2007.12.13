 Dhaka, Dec 6(bdnews24.com)BNP leaders Thursday demanded freedom for their detained chairperson Khaleda Zia for what they termed the sake of development, prosperity and democracy. They said that it was necessary to free Khaleda to build unity and respect her popularity. The leaders said that it was not possible to establish democracy and development of the country 'without Khaleda's popularity'. The BNP leaders were speaking at meeting organised by Bangladesh Photojournalists Association. BNP leader Gayeshwar Chandra Roy chaired the meeting, also attended by supporters of a faction led by Khaleda-appointed secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. Nazrul Islam Khan, joint secretary-general of the Delwar-led faction, said: "We have tried many ways without her (Khaleda). Nothing really worked. The government will have to understand that nothing is possible without popularity." "It's important to go ahead with the popular leaders for effective development of the country," he added. He said, "We want democracy. We want to support the government to achieve democracy. But everything we want to do together with our leader." "It is proved that none of us is a great leader without Shaheed Ziaur Rahman, Khaleda Zia and sheaf of paddy symbol." Roy called for the immediate release of the two detained former prime ministers, saying: "Nothing could be done without political leadership. The people are on their side. We have to accept the reality." National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud said: "The Pakistani junta wanted to destroy the nation by killing our intellectuals on the eve of the liberation. We were able to overcome the vacuum only because we were united as a nation." He said that the present political situation was not conducive to democracy. bdnews24.c
