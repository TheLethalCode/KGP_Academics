 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Freed BRAC aid worker Noor Islam returned home Thursday from war-ravaged Afghanistan where he had been held hostage while running operations for the microcredit lender. Noor described his plights to reporters during his 82-day captivity after arriving at Zia International Airport. He, however, could say nothing about who had kidnapped him and why. The NGO staff reached the airport at 10:39am by an Emirates flight. BRAC director Nazmul Hossain welcomed him at the airport. BRAC programme head Jalal Uddin Ahmed and public relations and communications department director Anwarul Haque and his relatives also were present there. Noor was working for Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) as an area manager when he was abducted in Logar province, south of Kabul, on Sept 15. The kidnappers took away 30,000 Afghan currencies from him. He was freed on Dec 7 and had been under the supervision of the Afghan authorities since. Noor said on Sept 15 morning five to six armed people entered the BRAC office. They took him away, blindfolded and hands and legs tied, within a few minutes. He did not know where he had been kept for so many days. "They would only free my hands and legs during prayers. I had prayed even blindfolded," Noor said. "I reckoned that they had kept me in the cave of a hill. But they did not misbehave with me." "I could not understand their language. I didn't understand if they asked me for money. I don't understand any languages other than Bangla and English." On how he had passed the days, he said, "I passed my days the same way a kidnapped person passes his days." Noor, however, declined to say anything when he was asked whether other BRAC officials working in Afghanistan were safe. The world's largest non-governmental organisation has been working in Afghanistan since 2002 including in areas of small loan, education, health and empowerment of women. It is also involved with development activities such as construction of roads, academic institutions and hospitals. Of 4,700 BRAC employees working in Afghanistan, some 210 are Bangladeshis. bdnews24.co
