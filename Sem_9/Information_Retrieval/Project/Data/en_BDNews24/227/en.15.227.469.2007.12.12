 SYDNEY, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia opening batsman Matthew Hayden and all-rounder Andrew Symonds are doubtful for Friday's first Chappell-Hadlee one-day match against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval. Hayden missed Tuesday's Twenty20 victory over New Zealand in Perth because of a knee problem while Symonds, who was named man-of-the-match after smashing an unbeaten 85, aggravated an ankle problem during the game. Both players travelled to Adelaide with the Australian team on Wednesday but a decision has not yet been made on whether they will play. Neither injury is serious but, with Australia due to play a four-match test series against India, the selectors could err on the side of caution especially with Symonds who injured the same ankle against Sri Lanka last month. Australian batsman Mike Hussey told reporters on Wednesday that Symonds was hoping to play. "I know he'll be getting physio over the next couple of days at training, but he seemed pretty confident this morning, he wasn't too worried at all," Hussey said. Another Australian, middle-order batsman Brad Hodge, suffered a bizarre back injury in the warm-up to Tuesday's match in Perth, which forced him to pull out at the last minute. Hodge had not been selected for the one-day series but the injury has cast a doubt over his chances of making it back to international cricket this season. "Hodgey was desperately disappointed and pretty sore, it was an amazing injury, so innocuous, but he was disappointed not to be playing because it was such a fun night," Hussey said. "I was standing a couple of metres away from him, he almost just went down to pick something up and something seized up in the lower part of his back.
