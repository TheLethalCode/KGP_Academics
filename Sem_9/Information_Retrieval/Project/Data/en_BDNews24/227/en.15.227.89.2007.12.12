 Beirut, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected car bomb in a Christian town east of Beirut killed a senior military officer on Wednesday who was a leading contender to take over as army chief after the incumbent commander becomes president. A military statement said Brigadier General Francois al-Hajj, head of operations, and a number of his bodyguards were killed in the blast in Baabda, the site of Lebanon's presidential palace on the outskirts of the capital. Security sources said five had been killed and the explosion was caused by a car bomb that detonated as Hajj's convoy drove by. Several people were also wounded, although originally security sources put that figure in the dozens. Hajj was in his early 50s and seen as one of two leading contenders for the army chief post, traditionally reserved for a Maronite Christian, after General Michel Suleiman becomes president in Lebanon's long-delayed presidential election. Hajj also played a leading role in the army's onslaught against al Qaeda-inspired militants at the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon earlier this year in which 168 soldiers and around 230 militants died. The 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) blast, less than a week before politicians are scheduled to elect Suleiman as president, hurled Hajj's car and two bodies some 50 yards away and set several other vehicles ablaze. Several buildings nearby were damaged. Scores of soldiers cordoned off the area as firefighters and rescue workers put out the fires and rushed the wounded to nearby hospitals. POLITICAL DEADLOCK Baabda, a leafy and wealthy suburb, is the capital of the Christian Mount Lebanon province. It houses several embassies and diplomat residences. The army command and the Defence Ministry are located in nearby Yarze village. On Monday, Lebanon's parliament speaker postponed a presidential election to Dec. 17, the eighth delay of a vote repeatedly put off over differences between the anti-Syrian governing coalition and the opposition backed by Damascus. The feuding camps agreed last week on Suleiman, a Maronite Christian, as a consensus candidate for the post, which has been vacant since the term of Emile Lahoud ended on Nov. 23. Electing Suleiman would ease Lebanon's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. His nomination followed intense French-led mediation to resolve the crisis. Arab and Western states are concerned a prolonged vacuum in the presidency could further destabilise Lebanon, which has seen sporadic deadly sectarian clashes this year. Several anti-Syrian figures have also been assassinated in Lebanon since the slaying of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri in February 2005. Most recently Christian lawmaker Antoine Ghanem was killed in a car bomb attack in September. Leading Lebanese anti-Syrian figures blame the blast on Damascus, a charge it denies.
