 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan is likely to tender his resignation in a few days following a battle of words with the sports adviser over the activities of the federation. "I'd like to talk it (resignation) over with my colleagues first at the meeting on Wednesday and then I will let the FIFA know," Sultan told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The BFF boss refuting Monday's widespread speculation that he had tendered his resignation said he was ready to resign if the concerned authority asked him to do so. "I am not feeling well in this situation," Sultan said without elaborating. The BFF president is seemingly under pressure to step down after an altercation with the sports adviser over the media. While announcing the names of the national sports awardees on December 6, sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury expressed his dissatisfaction over the activities of the BFF executive committee whose tenure expired in April last. The following day, the BFF president countering the adviser's comments posed the question to a couple of satellite channels whether the adviser had the right to talk about the football federation. Exchange of words between them went on for two days via the media. Besides, ex-footballers and organisers time and again have demanded of the BFF an extraordinary meeting to explain the formation of district and divisional football associations (DFA) in line with FIFA guidelines before holding DFA elections. Sultan, however, was a bit worried over FIFA's future steps regarding Bangladesh. "I am a bit worried about how the FIFA will be taking my resignation," said Sultan adding that he was seeking a right way so that the FIFA did not impose any condition on Bangladesh. BFF general secretary Anwarul Islam Helal also resigned citing personal reasons in the first week of August. Bdn
