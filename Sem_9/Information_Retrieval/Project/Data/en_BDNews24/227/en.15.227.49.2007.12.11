 KABUL, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan and NATO were close to fully capturing the Taliban stronghold of Musa Qala on Tuesday, but there was still a threat from isolated insurgent fighters and bomb attacks, a British army spokesman said. Afghan troops moved in towards the centre of Musa Qala on Monday and conflicting claims emerged on whether the town had been captured. British troops closest to the fighting insisted the operation to seize the Taliban stronghold in the heart of the world's main opium producing belt was not yet complete. The only sizeable town held by the Taliban, Musa Qala in the north of Helmand province, is symbolic for both sides in the conflict and its capture would be a major military boost for the Afghan government and its Western backers. "It's not going to be long," said the British army's spokesman in Helmand, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Eaton. Asked about reports that Taliban fighters had fled the town, he said: "There are conflicting reports ... I wouldn't be at all surprised if they have slipped away during the night, but it's highly likely there will be small isolated groups of fighters and there is a substantial bomb threat." Thousands of Afghan, British and U.S. troops surrounded Musa Qala in an operation that began on Friday. Hundreds of Taliban had pledged to defend the town, but faced air strikes, artillery and steady assault from the Afghan and foreign forces. Two British soldiers have been killed in the fighting and hundreds of civilians have fled the area. It is ISAF's policy not to release Taliban casualty figures. TALIBAN COUNTER-ATTACK The Taliban struck back near the town of Sangin, further south in Helmand, a mainly barren desert area sliced through by lush, fertile farming land on the banks of the Helmand River and its tributaries. "The enemies of peace and stability and terrorists could not stand against the Afghan and NATO troops and considered their defeat for sure," an Afghan Defence Ministry statement said. "After defeat in Musa Qala, the enemies put pressure on Sangin district and began a fierce offensive using heavy weapons there, in the last two days the brave soldiers from Afghan National Army defied the enemy offensive in that district." Tens of Taliban had been killed or wounded around Sangin and the insurgents had retreated, the ministry said. British troops pulled out of Musa Qala in October last year after coming under sustained Taliban attacks and left the town under the control of tribal elders who pledged to keep the insurgents out; a deal criticised by US military commanders. The Taliban then seized Musa Qala in February, embarrassing NATO commanders who had pledged to take it back. During their rule of Musa Qala, the Taliban executed a number of people accused of spying for the government or foreign forces. Musa Qala also became the major centre for heroin production in a province that produces nearly half the world's supply of its raw material, opium, Afghan and international officials s
