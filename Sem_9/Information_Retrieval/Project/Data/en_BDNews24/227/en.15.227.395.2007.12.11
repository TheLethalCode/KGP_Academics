 MAKHACHKALA, Russia, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A regional supreme court judge in Russia's troubled north Caucasus republic of Dagestan was shot dead on his doorstep on Tuesday, the spokesman for the local interior ministry said. The judge, named as Kurban Pashayev, was shot at his home in the capital Makhachkala, the spokesman said. His attackers escaped. "Around 10 bullet shells were found at the scene," he said. Two wars in Chechnya since 1994 have affected the entire north Caucasus region and violence has spilled over into its neighbours Dagestan and Ingushetia.
