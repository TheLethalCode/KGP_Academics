 KAOAKOLA, Sirajganj, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)Seventy-year-old Mohammad Sheikh has no idea what fight is on in Bali for steps to arrest the increasing temperature. He seems unaware of what is happening actually in the glaciers or what would be the fate of his land after hundreds of years. But he knows something is going on inside to make him more vulnerableto climate change. "I can understand something is going on very secretly. Something is changing incessantly," Sheikh told the bdnews24.com correspondent aboard a crowded boat, which was taking him to his "third home" at Kaoakola in the north. "You see the area we are crossing now by the boat was once a fertile land," he said. "I don't know why the all-pervasive river has gobbled it over the past few decades." On Monday, Sheikh said he was forced to change his home three times because his previous two are now in the middle of the river Jamuna in Sirajganj district. "We're very poor. We can't afford it," he said. Two decades ago he had 60 bighas of land but now he is a day labourer. Their family graveyard is gone. "I lost everything, my parents' graves." "The river and floods have taken away everything." Sheikh is one of thousands of people who have been displaced by frequent floods over the past few decades losing their arable land, homes, and they have been forced to change their profession. Mohammad Nuruzzaman, 50, is another victim of climate change in the impoverished region because of increasing temperature in disaster-prone Bangladesh, a delta nation of 150 million people. He runs a family of seven but now struggling to feed his family as floods in recent years have displaced him. "I was a happy farmer but now I struggle to feed my family," he said standing in front of his bamboo-and-straw hut at Kaoakola. He has lost his land to the river and now lives off fishing. "I don't know what sins I have. Why is Allah punishing me this way," he said. The United Nations Development Programme in a report late November said that Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations in the world because of the impacts of climate change. The report said more than 70 million Bangladeshis could be affected by global warming-related flooding in coming years. The report said such floods and storms would break down many poor nations' agricultural system, worsen drinking water crisis, trigger mass displacement and increase spreads of diseases. Experts say frequency of floods has increased in recent years in Bangladesh while a Nov.15 cyclone battered the country's southern coastal region. The Tropical Cyclone Sidr has left more than 3,200 people dead while millions have been homeless. Two spells of floods this year have destroyed crops and infrastructure in parts of Bangladesh. The experts say frequency, depth and duration of floods would increase in the country in future because of climate change-related impacts. "There's no question that countries like Bangladesh is increasingly becoming vulnerable to natural disasters inclined to climate change," said Qazi Kholiquzzaman, one of the Bangladeshi contributors to the UN-sponsored report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. The report says human beings are responsible for climate change. "Bangladesh is being and will be one of the worst victims if measures are not taken to stand against the effects of the climate change." Asked if the government is doing enough, Kholiquzzaman said "very little". "But the process is on. The government needs assistance from the developed world for taking up adaptation measures," he said. The government also acknowledges more has to be done. "We've taken some steps to face the challenges. But we need to do more, we need technical support from the rich nations, who are mostly responsible four our woes," said environment adviser CS Karim. bd
