 PARIS, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in an interview published on Wednesday he would be prepared to go to Tehran to discuss cooperation on nuclear energy if Tehran let U.N. atomic inspectors "carry out their checks". In an interview with weekly magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, Sarkozy said there was a real risk of war, and Israel rather than the United States was the country most likely to launch a military attack on the Islamic republic. "The danger of a war exists. If Iran lets the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) conduct its checks, I would be willing to come to Tehran and examine a collaboration on civilian nuclear energy," Sarkozy said. The IAEA and Iran have agreed a timeframe to resolve the outstanding questions about Iran's nuclear programme, which Iran says is aimed solely at generating electricity but which the West says is aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Sarkozy did not elaborate on what Iran needed to do, but he said that all countries agreed that Iran's atomic programme was not entirely peaceful. "Everyone agrees that what the Iranians are doing has no civilian explanation," he said in the interview, which was posted on Le Nouvel Observateur's Web site. He was reacting to a joint report by the U.S. intelligence agencies published earlier this month, which said Iran had halted it nuclear weapons programme in 2003. The report is likely to hamper efforts by the United States, Britain and France to obtain a third round of U.N. sanctions against Tehran over its failure to heed repeated U.N. demands that it suspend uranium enrichment, which can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or, potentially, atom bombs. Sarkozy did not specify what kind of nuclear collaboration he was prepared to consider with Iran, but he has repeatedly said he believes France should use its expertise in nuclear power to help the development of poorer countries. "We must not refuse civilian nuclear energy to countries that respect the rules," Sarkozy said, adding that he believed in "firmness and dialogue" with Tehran. "I have the trust of the Israelis and the Americans on this issue. The Americans are not warmongers here," he said. "The problem for us is not so much the risk that the Americans launch a military intervention but that the Israelis consider that their security is truly threatened," he added.
