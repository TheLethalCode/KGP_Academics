<TITLE> BFF election on 2003 constitution basis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has taken a U-turn in deciding to hold its election on the basis of its 2003 constitution. "All district and divisional football associations (DFAs) in line with FIFA guidelines have yet to be formed because of time constraints, and we have decided to hold the BFF election on the basis of 2003 constitution," BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu told reporters after an emergency executive committee meeting Wednesday. "We will seek permission from FIFA to complete the election as it had earlier instructed us to form DFAs and then take initiatives to hold the BFF election," said Malu. The four-year stint of the BFF committee expired April last, but FIFA extended their time for one year to April 30, 2008 and asked them to hold the BFF election after forming DFAs keeping the government officials out of the committees. It is widely believed that the BFF officials failed to convince FIFA regarding the necessity of government officials in the DFA committees. Besides, ex-footballers, organisers and councilors demanded a clear explanation of the DFA before inducting it into the BFF constitution. Malu, however, said they would not shift from forming DFAs, but wanted to hold the election in line with the 2003 constitution this time. Replying to a query, Malu said, "The organisers at the district level have sought more time to understand the DFA as they find it a new concept."
