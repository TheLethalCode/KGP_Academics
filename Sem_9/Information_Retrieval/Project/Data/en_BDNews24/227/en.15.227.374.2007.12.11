 BRASILIA, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brasilia governor Jose Roberto Arruda said on Monday he wanted the Brazilian capital to host the opening game at the 2014 World Cup and hit out at Sao Paulo, describing the financial centre as arrogant. Sao Paulo is expected to stage the prestigious opening game when Brazil hosts the tournament while Rio de Janeiro has emerged as favourite to stage the final. Brasilia is one of 16 other cities who are bidding for the right to stage games. Brazil, awarded the 2014 World Cup by soccer's governing body FIFA in October after being the only candidates, plan to use between 10 and 12 venue cities. "Sao Paulo is sometimes like the older brother who had everything going for him, he has money, he studied, but he hasn't got patience with the other brothers who haven't had such a good life," Arruda told reporters. "It's a certain show of arrogance. "We want the opening game to be here because Brazil is not just Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo." Arruda promised that Brasilia would do its homework and that investments in transport would be a priority. The city plans to stage matches at the Mane Garrincha stadium, which would be almost completely rebuilt. The last international to be staged at the Mane Garrincha was a World Cup qualifier against Chile in 2005
