 BALI, Indonesia, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh is leading negotiations on the Bali Roadmap on behalf of the least developed countries, delegates to the UN Climate Change Conference said Thursday. On Bangladesh's role in the Bali talks, environment adviser CS Karim said Bangladesh is one of the trusted and efficient contributors to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations processes. "Bangladesh's presentation organised in the LDC room was satisfactory," one of the delegates said, responding to reports that Bangladesh backed away from the Bali negotiations. "A significant number of foreign participants were present during the presentation. After a brief presentation, questions and answer session took place preceded by a video presentation," the delegate told bdnews24.com. "Apart from asking for clarifications and more information about Bangladesh preparedness for adaptations, a few of the foreign participants expressed sympathy for cyclone victims and solidarity in our efforts to cope with the challenges," said a government official who is attending the conference in Indonesia. The conference is taking place at the Bali International Convention Centre and brings together representatives of over 180 countries together with observers from intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations, and the media. The two-week period includes the sessions of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC, its subsidiary bodies and the Meeting of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol. In the negotiations when all efforts fail, the last resort that the COP president falls back on is, the president forms a small group named "Friends of the Chair" which tries to settle all unresolved issues through intense negotiations. "We feel proud that Bangladesh has been inducted as one of the members of that group to help the COP 13 president," the delegate said. CS Karim told bdnews24.com by phone: "This embodies a significant recognition of Bangladesh as one of the trusted and efficient contributors to the UNFCCC negotiations processes."
