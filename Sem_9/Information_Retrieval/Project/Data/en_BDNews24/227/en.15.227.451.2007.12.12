<TITLE> Azizul raps researchers on political bias </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday accused the country's researchers of political bias and failure in doing good work. "The mindset of the researchers has to be changed," Azizul told a discussion on "Research and Policy Divide: Meeting the Policy Research Challenge in Bangladesh". The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies organised the discussion in the city. He said the recommendations made by the researchers have a little connection with the reality and policy demand. "The government has allocated Tk 350 crore for research in agriculture this fiscal year. Six months have gone by but I am yet to get any guideline from the researchers," he said. He took a dig at the researchers, saying they hugely suffer from political bias. "Our society is highly politicised and often we find recommendations, which are politically biased," he said. He said the BIDS was suffering from the crisis of reputation in recent years as some of its senior and good researchers left the organisation. "I don't know the reasons why they leave. It may be due to poor salary or for any other thing," the adviser said. He recommended the BIDS communicate with him if it faces any problem. BIDS director general Quazi Shahabuddin chaired the discussion. As some participants raised questions about the donors' notion and their style of interference, the adviser said the donors are human beings, not angel or devil. "Their mindset could be changed through discussions," Azizul said, adding that the researchers could play an important role to make a change. He criticised the policy makers and the donors for not allowing the researchers considerable time to finish a research. The adviser said he thought it was an administrative problem rather than the financial one. bd
