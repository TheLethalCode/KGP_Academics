<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)Imarat Nirman Sramik Union, a building construction workers union, Tuesday demanded Tk 4 lakh in compensations to each family of those killed in the Rangs Bhaban cave-in. The organisation's general secretary Md Abdur Razzak read out a written statement on the demand at a press conference at the union's Topkhana Road office. Organisation leaders demanded immediate payment of Tk 1 lakh from the government and another Tk 3 lakh from contracting firm "Six Star" to each family. In 2006, the owners of Phoenix Building in Tejgaon also reached a compromise with the workers by paying Tk 3 lakh to the families of each victim, the statement said. Abdur Razzak said Rajuk was at fault for the disaster, the organisation alleged. An experienced Rajuk engineer should have been deployed on the site during demolition of a huge building like Rangs Bhaban, it said. The work of demolishing the Rangs Building started on August 4 after a court order. Four deaths have so far been confirmed while nearly 50 workers have been injured in the accident. The cause of the incident could not be confirmed. bdnews
