<TITLE> Sri Lanka says northern fighting kills 4 rebels </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Colombo, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed four Tamil Tiger rebels in clashes in the north of the island on Monday, while weekend fighting killed 30 people, the military said. Fighting in Sri Lanka's renewed civil war has been intense in recent months, with near-daily air raids, bombings and land and sea battles. "A confrontation in Vavuniya on Monday morning killed four terrorists," said a spokesman at the Media Centre for National Security. The military also said weekend fighting in the north killed 29 Tamil Tiger rebels and one soldier, while 10 soldiers were wounded. The separatist Tigers, who are seeking to carve out an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened. Analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. The military has vowed to wipe out the Tigers militarily, and is seeking to drive the rebels out of northern strongholds, after evicting them from vast swathes of jungle terrain they controlled in the east earlier this year. More than 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) since early 2006 alone, taking the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,000. Military analysts say there is no clear winner on the horizon, and fear the war could grind on for years
