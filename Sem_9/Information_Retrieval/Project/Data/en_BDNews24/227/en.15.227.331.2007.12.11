 LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket has taken the first step on the long road to inclusion in the Olympic programme by winning provisional recognition status. Cricket and sport climbing were awarded the status for their work with youths, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Monday. The earliest cricket could be seen at the Games is 2020. As it will not have spent the mandatory two-year provisional status by the time the 2008 Beijing Olympics are over, its case will be reviewed following the 2012 London Games. The Olympic programme is determined seven years ahead of every Games. "Both (sports) showed a lot of activity and work with youth," IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies told reporters after the first day of an executive board meeting. Other fully recognised sports include rugby, golf, squash, bridge and tug-of-war. Provisionally recognised sports include sumo wrestling. BOXING REFORMS The IOC also said it would release the final tranche of funds withheld from the International Amateur Boxing Association over scoring and judging irregularities. About $415,000 will be handed over after the IOC said changes to the judging and scoring system were successfully implemented in the recent world championships. "This is in recognition of reforms that have been taken on board," Davies said. About $1.1 million in Olympic revenue was withheld after the 2004 Athens Games. Davies said the recent boxing world championships showed past irregularities had been rectified. A total of 31 athletes nominated by their National Olympic Committees will vie for four spots on the IOC athletes commission during elections in Beijing. Among those hoping to win a spot on the commission that deals with the issues of athletes and pushes their cause during Games time are tennis players Justine Henin and Amelie Mauresmo, track and field athletes Wilson Kipketer and Paul Tergat and swimmer Grant Hackett
