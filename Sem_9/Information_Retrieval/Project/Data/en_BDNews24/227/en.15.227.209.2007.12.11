 ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The participation of Pakistan's two main parties in a January election will either force the government to make it fair or try to rig it so much it will be obvious, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto said on Tuesday. Bhutto, who heads what is believed to be Pakistan's biggest party, said she welcomed a decision by another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, that his party would contest the Jan. 8 general election and not boycott it. "When the country's two major parties take part the government will be forced either to hold free and fair elections ... or it will be compelled to do more rigging and that will expose them," Bhutto told reporters. Sharif had been pressing for a boycott but could not convince Bhutto. The two leaders, both recently back from years in exile, failed to agree on whether to insist that judges President Pervez Musharraf sacked when he declared emergency rule on Nov. 3 be reinstated before the election. Sharif said on Monday he had decided his party would contest after failing to secure unanimous opposition support for a boycott, which would have robbed the vote of credibility and prolonged uncertainty in the nuclear-armed U.S. ally. Bhutto, speaking to reporters upon returning to Pakistan from a private visit to Dubai, said she was ready to lead her Pakistan People's Party into the vote. But the opposition had to prepare its response if the vote was rigged, she said. "We should start preparations now. What are we going to do on Jan. 9 if elections on Jan. 8 are not fair and free?," she asked. "If we start preparation now, it will again put pressure on the government to hold fair elections." Only two parties have vowed to boycott: the small party of former cricket star Imran Khan and the small but influential Jamaat-e-Islami religious party. MUSHARRAF'S BACKERS The other main party contesting the election is the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) which backs Musharraf and ruled until last month when a caretaker administration packed with its supporters took over to oversee the polls. It still wields power in most district administrations. Bhutto has called for a neutral caretaker government and election commission and she also wants to see local government leaders suspended for the duration of the poll. The PML was cobbled together after Musharraf overthrew Sharif in 1999 to furnish the then-military president with a political base and analysts expect it to fare badly in January as Musharraf's popularity has slumped in recent months. Sharif's party will challenge Musharraf's backers for votes in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province which returns about half the members of parliament. Bhutto's main area of strength is Sindh province in the south but she could pick up more seats in Punjab if Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), and the PML split the anti-Bhutto vote, analysts say. Analysts expect a hung parliament with none of the three main parties winning a majority. Musharraf will need support in the new parliament if he is not to face a hostile National Assembly, government and prime minister. A hostile parliament could even move to impeach Musharraf, who stepped down as army chief last month, over accusations he acted unconstitutionally in securing a new term as preside
