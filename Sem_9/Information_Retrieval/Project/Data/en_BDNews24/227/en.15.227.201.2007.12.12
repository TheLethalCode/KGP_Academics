<TITLE> Those corrupt won't be spared for giving relief: ACC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chief Wednesday said they would spare nobody even those donating to the government's relief fund. "Those who are donating relief have not been given any 'undertaking' that no action will be taken against them in future. It (anticorruption drive) does not have any relation with relief," ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury warned. "The Anticorruption Commission is working on its own terms in line with the law. It is free to work," the country's top graft-buster said at a view-exchange meeting in Chashara in Narayanganj. On the proposed Truth Commission, the ACC boss said: "It won't be acceptable if the Truth Commission is formed to release any group." He said he did not know details about the commission. "There have been no talks with the Anticorruption Commission on the matter," added Hasan Mashhud, a former caretaker government adviser. He stressed waging a social movement against corruption. "Corruption can not be stopped through intimidation. It requires everybody to be aware of the social evil. Every citizen needs to sustain the mentality that 'we will not tolerate corruption, we won't resort to corruption'." The ACC chief said the people who are paid hefty salary were more vulnerable to corruption than those who get less. "The fish's head rots first. So the man who is at the helm must be transparent." There had been no such headway in curbing corruption in Bangladesh as in Singapore and Malaysia because of 'political failure', said Hasan Mashhud, also a former army chief. He also shared views at a meeting in Narsingdi at the town hall. He said everyone, particularly young people, has to come forward to resist corruption. bdnews
