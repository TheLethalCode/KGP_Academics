 KABUL, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan and US-led coalition troops killed several Taliban fighters in an air strike and a raid near the southern Afghan rebel stronghold of Musa Qala, the target of a big NATO offensive, the US military said on Monday. Musa Qala in Helmand province is symbolic for both sides in the conflict in Afghanistan as the only sizeable town controlled by the Taliban. Its capture would be a major military boost for the Afghan government and its Western backers. Mainly British troops from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have surrounded Musa Qala and are engaged, in the words of a British army spokesman, in "kicking the door in" for Afghan soldiers to capture the town. But mainly US troops from the separate coalition force are also active in the area, targeting Taliban fighters. Coalition forces killed "several militants" in a "precision strike" targeting a Taliban weapons supplier in the Musa Qala district on Sunday, the U.S. military said. Afghan and coalition forces then raided compounds targeting people associated with the weapons supplier and killed several more militants, detained 10 more and wounded two civilians. A coalition spokesman said the action was not connected to the ISAF operation in the area. Thousands of ISAF and Afghan troops are involved in the three-day-old operation to capture Musa Qala from several hundred Taliban holed up in the town. Two British soldiers have been killed in the fighting and hundreds of civilians have fled the area. It is ISAF's policy not to release Taliban casualty figures. As Afghan and ISAF forces moved in closer to the town, the Taliban counter-attacked near the town of Sangin, further south in Helmand, but inflicted no casualties. "It's a classic military tactic," said British army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard Eaton. "You get attacked and in order to confuse and unsettle the people attacking you, you counter-attack them somewhere else. It was something we had anticipated, we were ready for it." A Taliban spokesman said at the weekend that insurgents had killed more than 30 NATO and Afghan troops and said four Taliban fighters had been killed. Qari Mohammad Yousuf said the insurgents were dug-in in fortified bunkers in Musa Qala and warned of heavy casualties if NATO and Afghan troops attempted a final assault on the town. After coming under sustained Taliban attacks, British troops pulled out of Musa Qala in October last year in a truce criticised by US commanders that handed control of the town to tribal elders. The Taliban then seized Musa Qala in Februa
