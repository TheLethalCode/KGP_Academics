 CAMP BASTION, Afghanistan, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Gordon Brown made his first visit to Afghanistan since becoming prime minister on Monday and told troops the battle against the Taliban was vital to defeat terrorism. Britain has some 7,700 troops in Afghanistan, the largest foreign force after the United States, and has borne the brunt of some of the fiercest fighting in the country as its soldiers combat Taliban insurgents in the southern province of Helmand.
