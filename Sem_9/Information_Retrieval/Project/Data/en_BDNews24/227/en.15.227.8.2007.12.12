 BASRA, Iraq, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Forty people were killed and more than 125 wounded when three car bombs exploded in quick succession in a southern Iraqi Shia city on Wednesday, police said. The attack in Amara city was one of the deadliest in Iraq in months and came as tensions are running high across oil-producing southern Iraq, where rival Shi'ite factions are struggling for influence as British forces across the region draw down. One police official said 40 people had been killed in Amara. A health official said 39 were killed and more than 125 wounded. The bombs exploded along a main street in Amara, the capital of Maysan province. The police official said "hospitals were stretched to the limit" because of the number of wounded. Most people were killed in the second and third blasts, police said. Many onlookers had gathered after the first blast in a parking lot and were killed or wounded when the subsequent car bombs exploded. Largely Shia southern Iraq including Maysan has escaped much of the sectarian violence that has plagued Baghdad and other parts of Iraq, and car bomb attacks are rare. But southern Iraq is also witnessing a turf war between rival Shi'ite groups, including supporters of cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mehdi Army militia, and its chief rival the powerful Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. The British military, which turned responsibility for security in Maysan over to Iraqi authorities in April, confirmed a bomb had exploded in the city but had no further details. The attacks came three days after British Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid a brief visit to British forces in neighbouring Basra province. Britain is expected to hand control of security next week to Iraqi forces in Basra. That will end Britain's security responsibility of the four southern provinces it once controlled. One witness in Amara, 365 km (230 miles) southeast of Baghdad, said the bomb in the parking lot exploded first, followed soon after by the one at the market. Iraq's Furat Television said two men suspected of involvement in the blasts had been detained. Maysan is home to the Marsh Arabs and has large oil fields. A year ago, clashes broke out between militiamen and police in Amara, prompting the dispatch of hundreds of Iraqi troops. Adding to the tensions in southern Iraq in recent months has been the assassination of two provincial governors. Senior police officials have also been killed. Analysts fear Shia factions will intensify their battle for political supremacy as Britain further cuts troop levels. However, there has not yet been an upsurge of intra-Shia violence in Basra city, which is the most important hub in southern Iraq and where most of Iraq's oil exports pass throu
