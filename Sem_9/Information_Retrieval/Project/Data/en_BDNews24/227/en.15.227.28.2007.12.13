 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday ordered a probe into the Rangs Building collapse without city developer Rajuk and action against the people behind the accident that killed at least four workers. The High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Abdul Awal gave the order after president of the Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh advocate Manjil Morshid petitioned the court Wednesday. The petition sought a court directive on Tk 5 lakh compensation for the family of each of the workers who died in the incident and the government and Rajuk to retrieve bodies from the debris and arrange their burial within 24 hours. The court asked why the inaction of the authorities to retrieve and bury bodies five days into the incident would not be declared illegal. It also asked them to explain why an order should not be issued for ensuring the safety of the workers by putting in place modern equipment. The public works secretary, inspector general of police, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner, chairman, secretary and chief engineer of Rajuk, and the officer in charge of Tejgaon Police Station have been asked to come up with their reply in three weeks Advocate Manjil told the court during hearing that the bodies of the victims had been rotting for five days and yet the government and Rajuk took no effective steps. The ceiling of the 17th floor caved on Dec 8, killing at least five people and trapping a number of workers under the rubble. The Supreme Court in a verdict on Aug 3 ordered the top 16 storeys of the corporate headquarters of Rangs Group to be dismantled, ruling that these were illegally raised. The demolition began a day after the verdict, engaging hundreds of workers for job. bdnews24
