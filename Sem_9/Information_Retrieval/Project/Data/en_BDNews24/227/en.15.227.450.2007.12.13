 TOKYO, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Thursday he hoped Japan would assume a bigger role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, including possibly taking part in a NATO-led security mission. De Hoop Scheffer also stressed the importance of a separate naval mission in the region, adding NATO was closely watching whether Japan would resume its participation, halted by domestic political conflict. "I would hope that Japan ... has not yet reached the limits of its possibilities in the political sense of participating in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan," he told a think-tank forum, referring to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) fighting Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers. "I would hope that in the coming years, we could see interesting debate in Japan about what Japan could do more in Afghanistan under the banner of the United Nations, under the banner of ISAF." NATO commanders have complained ISAF's 43,000 troops fighting under its command are not enough to realise security in so large a country. Tokyo has said its troops cannot take part in ISAF, given Japan's pacifist constitution which renounces war as a means of resolving international disputes. Analysts have also said participation by Japan's military, which has not fired a shot in combat since World War Two, would not be realistic. The Japanese navy took part in a separate U.S.-led mission that provides fuel and water to ships policing the Indian Ocean in search of terrorists and drug smugglers, but pulled out last month after opposition parties blocked an extension of its participation. De Hoop Scheffer said it was up to Japan to decide whether to resume its part in the naval mission, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), but added the mission was vital for stabilising Afghanistan. "Apart from ISAF in Afghanistan, we do profit much from OEF. This is basically hunting al Qaeda and terrorists," he said. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has vowed to pass legislation to allow resumption of the naval mission, and the ruling bloc is expected to push through an extension of the current parliament session this week to enable it. The bill is sure to be voted down in the opposition-controlled upper house, but Fukuda's ruling coalition is expected to use its two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house to override it. The main opposition Democratic Party is against the Indian Ocean mission as it lacks a UN mandate, calling it "America's war", and its leader, Ichiro Ozawa, has said Tokyo should instead aid the UN-mandated ISAF, but many members of his party question the legitimacy of participating in IS
