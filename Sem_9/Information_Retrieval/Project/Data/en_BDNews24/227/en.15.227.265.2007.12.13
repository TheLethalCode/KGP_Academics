The Hindraf rally was one of two mass protests last month. A separate crowd of around 10,000 people had also turned out on the streets of the capital early last month to demand fairer elections, amid expectations of a snap poll by March next year. The opposition has accused Abdullah of using public order as an excuse to crack down on peaceful dissent. "We condemn these arrests," said Lim Guan Eng, head of the opposition Democratic Action Party. "It is a desperate act of last resort and if the government has any evidence, it should charge them in an open court.
