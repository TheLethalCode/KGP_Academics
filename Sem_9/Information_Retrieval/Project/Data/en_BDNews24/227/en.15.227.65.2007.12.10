<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Vandort scored an unbeaten 106, his fourth test hundred, to help Sri Lanka reach 200 for two at lunch on the third day of the second test against England on Tuesday. Vandort shared an unbroken 178-run third-wicket partnership with his captain Mahela Jayawardene, who finished the first session on 82 not out. Sri Lanka, who resumed on 105 for two, now trail England by 151 runs. Vandort was particularly strong through the off side, driving sweetly through the covers during an innings that spanned 195 deliveries and included 16 boundaries. The closest England came to breaking through were a couple of streaky edges through the slips by Vandort off the quick bowlers. Slow left-armer Monty Panesar also spun the ball sharply on a dry pitch, especially when bowling over the wicket into the rough. Sri Lanka won the first test in the three-test series by 88 runs
