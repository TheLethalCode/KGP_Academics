 JOHANNESBURG, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A green group headed by former UN chief Kofi Annan has given $13 million in grants to help small businesses in Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya to reduce prices of supplies to farms in a bid to boost farming output. The small retailers would sell supplies such as seeds, tools and fertiliser to 1.6 million rural households that could benefit 8.8 million farmers and their families in the three countries.

AGRA, which works in tandem with African governments, said all the three country programmes aim to increase rural smallholder incomes by 30 percent and reduce the price of inputs by 15 percent in three years. They also intend to halve the average distance farmers need to travel to purchase farm supplies. Malawi and Tanzania each received $4.3 million, while Kenya was awarded $4.4 million in the grants awarded under AGRA's Agro-dealer Development Program (ADP). The group said it was common for rural farmers to travel great distances to buy seed or fertiliser, and at the end of their journey they frequently found stores lacked the items they needed or were selling them at unaffordable prices.
