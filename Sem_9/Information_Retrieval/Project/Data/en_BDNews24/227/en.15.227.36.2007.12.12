<TITLE> Finland needs to attract immigrants: president </TITLE>

 HELSINKI, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finland needs to attract more immigrants to meet the economic challenge posed by its ageing population, President Tarja Halonen said. Halonen said the Nordic country had not yet worked out how it would adapt when Finns born after World War Two retired. In 2010 there will be fewer people coming into Finland's labour force than retiring. By 2025 Finland's old-age dependency ratio -- the proportion of pensioners to workers -- is projected to reach 41 percent, the highest in Western Europe. "We can't speak about people as a piece of the labour force, but we have to speak about them as people who might think about moving to Finland," president Halonen told Reuters in an interview late on Tuesday. Finland, with a harsh climate and a language spoken by few, is trying to convince people to stay working for longer and is also starting to think how it could attract immigrants. The population of Finland is around 5.3 million and there are around 122,000 foreigners, mainly from Russia and Estonia. Halonen said Finland's assets were good education and welfare systems. Finnish 15-year-olds scored first in science in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study and second in reading and mathematics. "Because we don't have that many natural resources -- we've invested in people, in education," she said. Halonen said Finland should simplify its regulations for working permits to make it easier for those who come to study or work. "All judicial and practical barriers should be taken away, this is our target and this is also the European Union's target," she said. A study released last week said Finnish employers discriminated against applicants with a foreign name, even if they spoke fluent Finnish. Finland's school system attracted international media coverage last month when a 19-year-old high school student shot six fellow students, two staff members and himself at a high school in southern Finland.
