 ALGIERS, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda's latest Algeria attack shows the group is able to strike high-profile targets to devastating effect, but analysts say Africa's second largest country is not about to slip back into the mayhem of the 1990s. Any repetition of Tuesday's blasts, which killed at least 30 people at U.N. offices and the Constitutional Court, would hurt investor confidence and may slow Algeria's attempt to rebuild its economy following an undeclared civil war in the 1990s. But al Qaeda's ambition to topple the state in an Iraq-style strategy of bombing ordinary life to a standstill and provoking a mass Islamist uprising looks far-fetched, analysts say. Operational constraints facing the guerrillas, and a changed political, diplomatic and financial landscape mean the balance of power today rests more than ever with the government. Algeria's security services have killed 10 senior al Qaeda commanders in recent months, curbing its ability to mount regular attacks to about one every one to two months, said Wolfram Lacher, an analyst at Control Risks consultancy. "Financial, logistical and recruitment constraints indicate the group is unlikely to accelerate its campaign," he said. Nayla Berrahal, a security analyst at Ennahar daily, said: "Qaeda is not in good shape, despite its ability to hit targets in the capital. Looking at the details, you'll notice attacks were not up but actually down in the past months." UNDEMOCRATIC It was very different in the 1990s, when tens of thousands of Islamist rebels took up arms with tacit support from a segment of the population following the army's cancellation of elections an Islamist party was poised to win. Up to 200,000 people were killed in the ensuing violence. Algeria's cash-strapped government, dependent on foreign lenders and embroiled in a dirty war with Islamists, became a virtual pariah to European nations which considered its cancellation of the polls undemocratic. Some European governments, citing human rights concerns, folded their hands when Algeria asked them to track down Algerian Islamist fighters who sought refuge on their territory. British reluctance to act against Islamist groups in London at the time remains an unhappy memory for Algerian officials. That changed after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York. Western nations rushed to seek counter-terror advice from Algeria and deepen diplomatic relations. At the same time, rising oil and gas prices handed Algeria a windfall. Today Algeria has almost $100 billion in reserves, giving it the financial independence it has long craved. "The balance of power between the state and the armed groups has changed dramatically," said Azzedine Layachi, an Algerian political scientist at St. John's University in New York. "The rebellion in the 1990s was massive and ugly, and the state was not prepared. Today, these kinds of actions do not threaten the state or the country's stability." Algeria's strategic role as a key gas supplier was amplified with the emergence of energy security as a global priority. Its oilfields are safely in the Sahara. "Unlike oil and gas producing regions in Nigeria or Iraq, Algeria's key gas and oil fields are far from major population centers," wrote Geoff porter, a North Africa expert at Eurasia consultants. DISCREET DIALOGUE Talk of al Qaeda's decline may look odd in the aftermath of Tuesday. Its targeting was astute: Hitting the U.N. office, an international symbol, guaranteed headlines around the world. The bomber who attacked the U.N. offices was identified by security sources as veteran Algerian Islamist fighter Bechla Rabeh, who was in his 60s -- proof that al Qaeda does not have to rely on brainwashed or drugged youths for cannon fodder. But internal political changes since the 1990s have changed the Islamist landscape. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, elected in 1999, has worked to reduce the army's traditionally strong influence over day to day government and offered amnesty to Islamist guerrillas willing to disarm. The amnesty helped reduce the size of the insurgency to under 1,000 from up to 40,000. The state has maintained a discreet dialogue with Islamist ex-guerrillas who disarmed in the late 1990s and are now making inroads into the political and cultural mainstream. These influential former fighters oppose al Qaeda's advocacy of violence and share the disgust of ordinary Algerians at the civilian casualties caused by al Qaeda attacks. Madani Mezrag, one of the most influential of these former fighters, told Reuters: "It's very sad. The Algerian people are fed up. For how long should they wait to live in peace?" Not everything is fine. Algeria has not been able to reform its Soviet-style economy and provide work for a society hit by deep unemployment, lack of housing and rising food prices. A lingering social malaise fed by widespread post-traumatic stress caused by the 1990s violence pushes thousands of unemployed youths to try to migrate illegally every year. "If there's more violence it would affect the social situation. While the oil and gas have not so far helped the social conditions," said Layachi.
