 ABUJA, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian police are a danger to public safety because they consider extra-judicial killings an acceptable policing method and raping women as a fringe benefit, a report by a Nigerian civil rights group said. The Network on Police Reform in Nigeria (NOPRIN) said it had monitored 400 police stations in 13 states for a year and found that killings, torture, extortion and rape had become routine because the authorities shielded policemen from the law.

NOPRIN said it had found rapes by policemen were on the increase. It quoted a policeman interviewed in Lagos as saying he considered that raping sex workers was "one of the fringe benefits attached to night patrol". The group said low pay and poverty among junior officers were major contributing factors to such behaviour but did not excuse it. It accused the government of turning a
