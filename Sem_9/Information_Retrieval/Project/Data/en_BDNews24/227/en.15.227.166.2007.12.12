<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-19 team Wednesday made a fine start against the Sri Lankan counterparts, handing a 13-run defeat to the visitors in the opener of five-match series at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium. The home side restricted the visitors to 221 for seven in 50 overs after posting a fighting total of 234 all out in the stipulated 50 overs after being asked to bat first. Pacer Rubel Hossain struck first sending opener Thirimanna (7) back in the very second over with scoreboard on 10, but the visitors revived the initial setback to add 82 runs for the second wicket between Chandimal (39) and Munaweera (39). Captain Suhrawardi Shuvo broke the second-wicket stand, and Sri Lanka slipped to 132 for five before R Silva (51 not out) and S Pathirana (42) put up some resistance that took the side to 199 for seven in 46.1 overs. But, by then, the visitors lost their way and managed only 22 runs in the remaining overs in the face of some tight bowling from the home side. Earlier, Bangladesh had a blow in the first delivery of the day losing opener Rony Talukdar (0), but opener Mohammad Mithun handled the situation easily before he was the fourth Bangladesh batsman out for 59 off 78 that studded eight fours and two sixes. Middle orders Suhrawardi (49), Mahmudul Hasan (44) and Marshal Ayub (38) chipped in with handy scores to help Bangladesh go beyond the 200-mark. Pathirana captured five wickets for 52.
