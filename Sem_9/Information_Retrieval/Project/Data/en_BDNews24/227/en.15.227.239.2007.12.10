 Kabul, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-led coalition forces killed several Taliban militants in an air strike in the southern Afghan province of Helmand where troops are trying to recapture a big rebel stronghold, the coalition said. Sunday's raid was aimed at a Taliban weapons supplier in Musa Qala district where Afghan and foreign forces have been engaged in fighting insurgents and foreign fighters since Friday. "Coalition forces conducted a precision strike targeting a Taliban weapons smuggler known to equip extremist forces with various types of weapons and explosives including anti-aircraft weaponry", the statement said. "Reports also indicate the individual is linked with attacks on Coalition forces aircraft", the statement added. Musa Qala is symbolic for both sides in the conflict in Afghanistan as the only sizeable town controlled by the Taliban. The fighting is expected to last several days with both sides saying they had inflicted casualties. A Taliban spokesman said at the weekend that insurgents had killed more than 30 NATO and Afghan troops and said four Taliban fighters had been killed. Qari Mohammad Yousuf said the insurgents were dug-in in fortified bunkers in Musa Qala and warned of heavy casualties if NATO and Afghan troops attempted a final assault on the town. After coming under sustained Taliban attacks, British troops pulled out of Musa Qala in October last year in a truce criticised by US commanders that handed control of the town to tribal elders. The Taliban then seized Musa Qala in February
