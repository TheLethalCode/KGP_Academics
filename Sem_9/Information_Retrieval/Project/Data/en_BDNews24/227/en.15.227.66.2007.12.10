The Australians are going into the match without their captain Ricky Ponting and opening batsman Matthew Hayden but insist those selections do not reflect their approach to the abbreviated game. Fast bowler Nathan Bracken told reporters the inclusion of players like Brad Hodge and Ashley Noffke could give the team a real edge because they would be keen to earn permanent places in the side. "In the last 12 to 18 months every guy who has played for Australia has wanted to take the opportunity as best they can and put their hand up," Bracken said. "For these guys such as Ashley Noffke and Brad Hodge it is an opportunity to put their hand up again and show ... they are good enough to be the next in line." Tuesday's Twenty20 match in Perth is the curtain-raiser to the three game Chappell-Hadlee series, played over the more traditional one-day format of 50 overs a side. New Zealand hold the trophy after completing a 3-0 cleansweep in the most recent series in February and Bracken said the Australians were desperate to avenge those defeats. "We just want it back at the moment, that is our main goal," Bracken said
