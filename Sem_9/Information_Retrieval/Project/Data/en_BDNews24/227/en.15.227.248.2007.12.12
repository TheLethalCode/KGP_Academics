<TITLE> Air France crash jet going too fast: Canada probe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TORONTO, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Air France jet that crashed at Toronto's international airport in a thunderstorm in August 2005 came in too high and too fast, and ran out of space on a slippery runway, an official Canadian investigation concluded on Wednesday. The Canadian Transportation Safety Board also said the crew of the plane failed to calculate how much runway they needed to safely land the Airbus A340, which caught fire after overshooting the runway. All 297 passengers and 12 crew members on board escaped down emergency chutes. No one died. "The aircraft approached Toronto in a severe and rapidly changing thunderstorm with shifting winds and limited visibility," said Wendy Tadros, head of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. "It came in too high and too fast. Touching down almost halfway along the wet and slippery runway, it simply ran out of room," she told a news conference. The board made seven recommendations on how to prevent such accidents in future, focusing on the need for better training and how to calculate safe landing distances.
