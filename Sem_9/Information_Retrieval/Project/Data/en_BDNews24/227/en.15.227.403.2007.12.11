<TITLE> Finance ministers meet in Bali on climate costs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jimbaran, Indonesia, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finance ministers met in Bali on Tuesday to debate how to fund the fight against climate change, the first such meeting on the fringes of annual UN climate talks. The ministers, from about 20 nations, would debate issues ranging from the potential for carbon markets to help cut industrial emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to incentives for people to put solar panels on the roof at home. At the main talks, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was to arrive in his debut on the world stage a week after his new Labor government ratified the UN's Kyoto Protocol, isolating the United States as the only developed nation outside the pact. And Kyoto marks its 10th birthday on Tuesday -- it was agreed in the Japanese city of the same name on Dec. 11, 1997. UN backers of the pact plan to celebrate with a birthday cake. Rudd is expected to formally hand over documents ratifying the Kyoto Protocol to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday. The United States called on the meeting on Monday to drop any reference to scientific evidence that rich nations need to axe greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. That goal was part of a report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which collected the Nobel Peace Prize on Monday with former US Vice President Al Gore in Oslo. Gore said it was "time to make peace with the planet". The United Nations hopes the climate talks will agree to launch two years of negotiations on a new global pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which binds 36 industrial nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. Under that plan, the United States would join in, along with developing nations led by China and India which have no 2008-12 goals under Kyoto. A deal would be agreed in Copenhagen in 2009. But some developing countries are wary of committing to curb their rising emissions, reckoning they need to burn more energy to lift millions out of poverty. -- For Reuters latest environment blogs click on: http://blogs.reuters.com/environment
