Earlier in the day, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told Rajapaksa Japan would approve 1.9 billion yen ($17 million) in grants-in-aid to Sri Lanka next week, Kyodo news agency said. "I conveyed to the president Japan's intention to cooperate for peace in Sri Lanka as well as economic development," Fukuda told reporters.
