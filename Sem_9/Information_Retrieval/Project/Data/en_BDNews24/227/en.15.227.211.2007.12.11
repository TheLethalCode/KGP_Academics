<TEXT>
 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Grey market telephony is seriously threatening the South Asian telecoms sector, causing huge losses in revenue, regulators said Tuesday. Asif Inam, a director of the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, speaking at the Ninth South Asian Telecommunications Regulators' Council session in Dhaka, said the grey market telephony is a source of concern for the huge losses incurred to the state coffers and revenue losses to licensed operators. Presenting a paper regarding grey market telephony, he said 'grey routes' have no prescribed or authorised path. They bypass the legal gateways. Grey market operators therefore do not pay interconnection charges, access promotion charges, universal service fund charges, or even license fees in many cases. Chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com that regulators in South Asian countries are very concerned about grey market telephony. "BTRC has already begun a drive against this type of telephony activity," he said. Asif Inam told bdnews24.com that the grey market is a common problem for the South Asian countries. Cheap technology and lack of comprehensive monitoring or tracking systems are the encouraging factors for grey traffic, he said. Total revenue loss is $43.6 million per year in Pakistan due to grey market telephony, he added. The Ninth SATRC meeting began in Dhaka Monday, hosted by BTRC and organised by the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity, a regional organisation for communication and information technology. Telecoms representative of South Asian countries took part in it, while Iran joined the council as observer. bdne
