 BOGOTA, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten people burned to death when Colombian thieves boarded a bus, doused passengers with gasoline and set the vehicle ablaze after the driver and others resisted the robbery, authorities said on Thursday. Two of the robbers were among those who died and another eleven people were injured in the assault on Wednesday night in Boyaca north of the capital Bogota, provincial police said. "Three suspects ... who were traveling as passengers, tried to rob the others by threatening to start a fire. There was a struggle and the fire ignited," a police spokeswoman said. Violence from Colombia's four-decade conflict has ebbed under President Alvaro Uribe who has sent troops to push back rebels and secure towns and highways once plagued by kidnappings. But robberies and crime are still common in Colombia's major cities. Gladis Aldana, a passenger who survived the attack by jumping from a bus window, said one of the thieves tossed a lit match into the fuel-soaked vehicle. "They threw gasoline over people," she told Caracol radio. "Most of the victims were at the back of the bus and could not get out."
