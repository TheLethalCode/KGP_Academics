 KABUL, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan army troops reached the centre of the Taliban stronghold of Musa Qala on Monday, but it was too early to say if the southern Afghan town had been fully captured, a spokesman for NATO-led forces said. As the only sizeable town in Taliban hands, Musa Qala in Helmand province is symbolic for both sides in the conflict and its capture would be a major military boost for the Afghan government and its Western backers. "The Afghan National Army has reached the centre of Musa Qala," said International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) spokesman Major Charles Anthony. "I have not said it has been captured though." Taliban forces had fled Musa Qala toward mountains in the north, a resident said. Thousands of Afghan, British and US troops surrounded Musa Qala in an operation to retake it that began on Friday. A British army spokesman said forces were pushing into the town, but it had not yet been captured. As well a Taliban military stronghold, Musa Qala has also become the major Afghan centre for heroin production in a province that produces nearly half the world's supply of its raw-material, opium, Afghan and international officials say. NATO forces in Afghanistan have struggled to consolidate battlefield victories in the past due to the weakness of Afghan forces, particularly the police, who have been unable to enforce security and foster development and the rule of law. BROWN PLEDGES SUPPORT Gordon Brown, on his first visit to Afghanistan since he became British prime minister in June, said Britain would do all it could to support development in Musa Qala. "I think you'll see in the next few days that this action will be effective, that it will work and that it will bring long-term and lasting results," Brown told a news conference in the Afghan capital, Kabul. "When that action is completed, we will give support for the economic and social development of the area," he said. Afghan and U.S.-led coalition troops earlier killed several Taliban fighters in an air strike and a raid near the town. Mainly U.S. troops from the coalition force, separate from ISAF, are also active in the area, targeting Taliban fighters. Coalition forces killed "several militants" in a "precision strike" targeting a Taliban weapons supplier in the Musa Qala district on Sunday, the U.S. military said. Afghan and coalition forces then raided compounds targeting people associated with the weapons supplier and killed several militants, detained 10 more and wounded two civilians. A coalition spokesman said the action was not connected to the ISAF operation in the area. An Afghan army helicopter crashed in the Sayedabad district of Wardak province southwest of the capital Kabul on Monday, killing four soldiers, an army commander at the scene told Reuters. He said it was most likely a technical problem, but the Taliban said they had shot down the aircraft. Two British soldiers have been killed in the fighting and hundreds of civilians have fled the area. It is ISAF's policy not to release Taliban casualty figures. As Afghan and ISAF forces moved in closer to the town, the Taliban counter-attacked near the town of Sangin, further south in Helmand, but inflicted no casualties. After coming under sustained Taliban attacks, British troops pulled out of Musa Qala in October last year in a truce criticised by U.S. commanders that handed control of the town to tribal elders. The Taliban then seized Musa Qala in Februa
