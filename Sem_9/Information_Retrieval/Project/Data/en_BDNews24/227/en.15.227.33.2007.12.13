<TITLE> Mistrust will make Bangladesh a loser: Indian MP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  An Indian MP Thursday said Bangladesh would be a loser if it did not trust India, as its next-door neighbour was emerging as a global "superpower". MAK Swain, the lawmaker of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party from Balasore (Orissa), said India wanted to first become a "regional superpower", for which it needed to maintain good relations with its neighbours. "There is a feeling in Bangladesh that India is secretly doing something which can go against the interests of Bangladesh. We have to leave our past ghost. Please trust us," the lawmaker told the concluding session of the 16th Indo-Bangla dialogue at BRAC Inn Centre. He said the anti-Indian feeling was fanned by the Farakka barrage. "Every Indian believes that India would be a superpower, therefore she should emerge as a regional power first by maintaining good relations with her neighbours," he said. Talking to bdnews24.com, Swain said, "Not India, Bangladesh will be the loser if she does not cooperate (with India) and show a tit-for-tat attitude." Experts from Bangladesh and India at the three-day dialogue, co-organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue and Indian International Centre, identified "mistrust" as the major problem in Bangladesh-India relations. "Still there is mistrust (between Bangladesh and India) both in public and private sectors. We need to move forward," energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury told the dialogue. "We don't want to talk about what happened in the past." The dialogue made 81 recommendations on energy, water resources, trade, environment and disaster management, and transport sectors to exploit the possibilities for the interests of Bangladesh and India. The dialogue recommended that Bangladesh should go for nuclear power generation to meet its growing energy demand as nuclear power is no more considered a security threat. "Issues such as gas supply through pipelines from a third country needs to be seen from a broader perspective of reciprocal initiatives, taking cognisance of concerns and interests of partner countries," CPD and ICC said in a joint report. "The Ganges water treaty addresses the sharing of water between Bangladesh and India with respect to one river. Agreement on other 53 rivers is an issue that needs to be addressed," the report said. Co-chaired by CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan and former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Deb Mukharji, the dialogue was attended by a number of diplomats, bureaucrats, politicians and other professionals. bdn
