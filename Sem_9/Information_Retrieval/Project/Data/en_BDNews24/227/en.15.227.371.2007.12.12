 COLOMBO, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's openers survived a tricky final session after fine batting from Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene and Prasanna Jayawardene had put the hosts in charge on day four of the second test. Michael Vaughan (28no) and Alastair Cook (19no) took England to 48 without loss when bad light stopped play after the Sri Lankans had amassed 548 for nine declared for a first-innings lead of 197. Vaughan again showed his touch from the first innings and helped England reduce the deficit to 149 runs with Sri Lanka eyeing a final-day push for victory and a decisive 2-0 series lead. Mahela Jayawardene fell five runs short of a double century in the morning session, finishing with 195 from 422 balls with 16 fours and a six, after Sri Lanka resumed on 379 for four. He top-edged a slog-sweep off Monty Panesar and was caught at slip by Paul Collingwood. Wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene then scored 79 from 161 balls with six fours before edging a catch behind off Steve Harmison. Jayawardene then added 108 for the ninth wicket with Dilhara Fernando, who scored a career-best 36 not out. England's weary bowlers, forced to toil for 186.5 overs in the field, fought back in the morning session with three wickets. Harmison struck first as Jehan Mubarak (nine) took evasive action and fended off a short delivery to Ian Bell at gully. After Jayawardene was dismissed by Panesar, Stuart Broad also claimed his first test wicket as Chaminda Vaas gloved an attempted pull and was caught at slip. Panesar claimed his second wicket after lunch as Lasith Malinga was trapped lbw for nine. Ryan Sidebottom claimed 3 for 100 from 36 overs and Harmison 3 for 111 from 41.5 overs. Sri Lanka won the first test in Kandy by 88 runs. The third and final test starts in Galle on Tuesday
