 LONDON, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal suffered their first Premier League defeat of the season on Sunday to allow Manchester United and Chelsea to maintain the pressure at the top of the standings. In Italy, champions Inter marched five points clear in Serie A after a 4-0 thumping of Torino. ENGLAND The last two unbeaten records in the Premier League both disappeared in surprising circumstances over the weekend as leaders Arsenal lost 2-1 at Middlesbrough and Liverpool were beaten 3-1 by Reading. Arsenal looked way off their best as they lost to a Boro side who had not won in their last 11 matches and the Gunners now lead only by a point from Manchester United, who thumped bottom side Derby County 4-1. Chelsea are two points further back on 34 points after a 2-0 win over Sunderland while Liverpool, who face a huge Champions League game in Marseille on Tuesday, are on 30 along with Portsmouth and Manchester City. The top four are thrown together in two big games next Sunday when Arsenal play Chelsea and Liverpool host Manchester United. SPAIN Champions Real Madrid remain four points clear of Barcelona at the top of the Primera Liga after a goal from Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy earned them a gritty 1-0 win away to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. Barcelona had to work hard to come from a goal down to beat Deportivo Coruna 2-1 at home and preserve their 100 percent record at the Nou Camp on Sunday. But coach Frank Rijkaard will have been encouraged by the fact that Ronaldinho scored a penalty on his return to the starting line-up and that striker Samuel Eto'o came through unscathed after his first match in over three months. Atletico Madrid moved up to third spot, a point behind Barca, after a 1-0 win over neighbours Getafe in a bad-tempered match at the Calderon in which two players from each side were sent off in the space of 12 second-half minutes. Villarreal slipped to fourth after suffering their second defeat in a row. They went down 1-0 at home to struggling Real Betis who replaced Hector Cuper with reserve team boss Paco Chaparro after last weekend's defeat at home to Atletico. ITALY Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic converted a penalty and Julio Cruz, Luis Jimenez and Ivan Cordoba also got on the scoreboard, as champions Inter Milan crushed Torino 4-0 to move five points clear at the top of Serie A. Spanish forward Diego Tristan quickly cancelled out Daniele De Rossi's early opener to give Livorno a 1-1 home draw with second-placed AS Roma. Former European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved found the net from outside the box in the closing stages to earn third-placed Juventus a 1-0 win over Atalanta in Turin. Fabio Quagliarella scored twice and laid on a goal for strike partner Antonio Di Natale to help fourth-placed Udinese defeat his former club Sampdoria 3-2. Empoli moved off the bottom of the table after a 4-1 home win over Cagliari, with all their goals coming from 21-year-old forward Nicola Pozzi. GERMANY The top three in Germany all dropped points, leaving Bayer Leverkusen to get right back into the race for Champions League places with a fifth successive Bundesliga win. Bayern Munich were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Duisburg yet neither Werder Bremen nor Hamburg SV could take advantage. Werder were beaten 4-3 at Hanover 96, after seeing a great fightback from 3-1 down to 3-3 come to nothing when Mike Hanke completed his hat-trick. Hamburg, like Bayern, looked jaded as they were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Energie Cottbus. Leverkusen continued their excellent run with a 3-0 win at home to Hansa Rostock on Sunday, the goals coming courtesy of Simon Rolfes, Paul Freier and Theofanis Gekas. With one round to go before the long mid-season break, Bayern Munich lead with 35 points from 16 games. Werder are second on 33, Hamburg have 31 and Leverkusen are fourth a point further back. FRANCE Olympique Lyon warmed up for their decisive Champions League Group E tie at Rangers in poor fashion by losing 1-0 at modest Caen on Saturday. Lyon, who looked sluggish in the first half and clumsy in the second, have to win in Glasgow on Wednesday to make the last 16 while Rangers need only a draw to advance. The six-times French champions, who conceded their fourth league defeat this season, still top the standings on 37 points from 17 games but second-placed Nancy, held to a 0-0 home draw by Valenciennes, closed the gap on the leaders to four points. Olympique Marseille prepared for their Champions League Group A decider against Liverpool on Tuesday with a 2-0 home win over Monaco. Marseille, recovering from a dismal start, climb three places up to 13th in the 20-strong table. NETHERLANDS Ajax Amsterdam, who beat Willem II Tilburg 3-2 on Saturday, stayed a point clear at the top of the Dutch league as PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord dropped points. PSV were stunned at home on Friday by Roda JC Kerkrade, who built up a comfortable 4-0 lead in 64 minutes before an own goal by Jean Paul Saeijs and a strike from Danny Koevermans gave the leaders consolation goals. Feyenoord lost the opportunity to draw level on points with Ajax as they were held to a 0-0 draw by lowly VVV Venlo. Kennedy Bakircioglu, Luis Suarez and Jan Vertonghen scored first-half goals for Ajax at Tilburg, who had Kevin Bobson and Arjen Swinkels on target
