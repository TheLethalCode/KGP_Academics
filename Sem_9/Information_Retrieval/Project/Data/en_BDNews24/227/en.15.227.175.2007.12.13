 COLOMBO, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troops killed 18 Tamil Tigers rebels in northern Sri Lanka and two rebel suicide bombers wounded six civilians, the military said on Thursday in its account of the latest engagements of a civil war. The military said the death toll was from six separate confrontations in Jaffna, Vavuniya and Mannar on Wednesday. Four other rebels were wounded and one policeman killed by rebel fire in Vavuniya. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are seeking to carve out an independent state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment on the fighting. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened. Analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. A military spokesman described an incident in which two rebel suicide bombers were killed and six civilians wounded in a house on Thursday. "The army on information received from a civilian, proceeded to search a house in Point Pedro in Jaffna and two LTTE terrorists who had been hiding in the ceiling blew themselves up, killing them instantaneously and injuring six occupants," the spokesman said. More than 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the Tamil Tigers since early 2006 alone, taking the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,000.
