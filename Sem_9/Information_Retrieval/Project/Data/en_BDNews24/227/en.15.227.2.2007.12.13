<TEXT>
 TORONTO, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Canadian teenager who was said to have clashed with her father about whether she should wear a traditional Muslim head scarf died of injuries late on Monday, and her father told police he had killed her. Aqsa Parvez, 16, was found without a pulse in her home in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga earlier on Monday. She was resuscitated by paramedics, treated at two hospitals, and later succumbed to her injuries, police said on Tuesday. Her father, 57-year-old Muhammad Parvez, has been charged with murder and was remanded back into custody after his first court appearance early on Tuesday. "There was a 911 call placed by a man who indicated that he had just killed his daughter," Jodi Dawson, a constable with Peel Regional Police, told Reuters. "Everything else is evidentiary in nature and the investigation is in its preliminary stages at this point." The victim's brother, Waqas Parvez, 26, was arrested and charged with obstructing police. The story was on the front pages of Canadian newspapers on Tuesday. The newspapers quoted friends and schoolmates of the victim as saying she argued with her father over wearing a hijab, the traditional head scarf worn by Muslim females. Photos of the teen retrieved from a social networking Web site show her in Western dress with her long dark hair loose. "She was always scared of her dad, she was always scared of her brother," the Toronto Star quoted a classmate as saying. Others were quoted as saying the girl wore traditional Muslim dress when leaving the house in the morning, but would change into other clothes in school washrooms. Dawson said investigators will likely speak to the victim's schoolmates. The father will return for a bail hearing on Wednesday.
