 PARIS, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were down by midday on Tuesday after rallying for four days as banking and commodity shares trimmed recent gains, while data showed German investor sentiment dropped to a near 15-year low. Investors were also cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's rate decision due after the European market close. At 1125 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,544.13 points, after hitting a five-week closing high on Monday. Europe's benchmark index, up 4.1 percent on the year, is on track to record its worst yearly performance since 2002. The ZEW research institute said on Tuesday German investor sentiment fell in December to its lowest level in nearly 15 years, spooked by worries over the outlook for the US economy and trouble in the financial markets. "The German ZEW business expectations data looks seriously weak and sounds an early warning signal to deeper downturn ahead in Germany and the Eurozone," Bear Stearns said in a note. "German business expectations are falling into a black hole as confidence continues to implode. The ECB remains caught in a monetary trap. The Eurozone inflation numbers are signalling higher rates, but much slower growth momentum is crying out for lower rates ahead." Banks were among the biggest negative weights on the market, with HSBC down 0.9 percent, UniCredit down 1.4 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland down 1.6 percent. UBS, which unveiled a $10 billion writedown related to the U.S. subprime mortgage market and a huge injection of funds from Singapore and the Middle East on Monday, dropped 1.8 percent. Banking shares have been hammered over the past few months by fears financial institutions have not yet revealed the full impact of the debacle in the subprime lending market. The DJStoxx bank index is down nearly 13 percent on the year. Mining shares dipped on Tuesday along with key base metal prices and after recent hefty gains. Rio Tinto dropped 2.9 percent, Anglo American shed 1.3 percent and BHP Billiton dipped 1.4 percent. Xstrata bucked the trend, rising 1.6 percent after the Financial Times said the company was open to talks with potential suitors, including Vale of Brazil and Anglo American. Xstrata declined to comment. EYES ON FED Investors' focus was firmly on the Fed, which will announce its interest rate decision at 1915 GMT. Financial markets are betting the Fed will cut the benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent, but some analysts think a half-point cut is not out of the question. "The Fed is expected to cut rates by 0.25 percent, but there is a camp who believes that there's a possibility of a bigger move lower. Such a move would probably lead to a rally higher for equity prices, but people would then worry about why the Fed has made such an aggressive move and growth concerns might creep in and just reverse indices," Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads wrote in a note. A US discount rate cut in August sparked a recovery in European stock markets from an annual low when credit markets seized up as a result of the meltdown in US subprime lending. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.2 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.3 percent. Italian defence and aerospace company Finmeccanica surged 4.3 percent after raising its earnings forecast for 2007. Thomas Cook rose nearly 7 percent after saying year operating profit would be around 12 percent above expectations and announced a 375 million euro share buyback programme. France's Lafarge, the world's largest cement group, gained 2 percent as brokerages upgrade their price target on the stock following Lafarge's acquisition of Egypt's Orascom Cement for 8.8 billion euros on Mond
