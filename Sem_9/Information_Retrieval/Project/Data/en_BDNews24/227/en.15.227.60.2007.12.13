<TITLE> German train drivers union can't rule out new strikes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Germany's train drivers' union suggested on Thursday there could be more strikes before Christmas, despite his previous assurances that there would be no industrial action during wage negotiations. The GDL union has staged walkouts since July, crippling commuter and goods services, and agreed this month to re-enter negotiations with rail operator Deutsche Bahn. The sides have said they hope to reach a wage deal by the end of January. On his way to a meeting with Deutsche Bahn, the head of the GDL indicated more strikes were possible. "It is obviously not something we can rule out," Manfred Schell told Reuters when asked if the union could strike before Christmas. The GDL's 62-hour strike on passenger and freight routes in November cost the economy 75 million euros ($110.2 million) a day, according to an economic think-tank. Schell is meeting Deutsche Bahn chief executive Hartmut Mehdorn who said on Wednesday he was "very sceptical" about reaching a wage deal with the 34,000-member union by the end of January. Mehdorn said he was pessimistic because of GDL's wage demands, which the company has dismissed as excessive. GDL initially asked for salary increases of up to 31 percent, but has since signalled it would accept a deal in the 10-15 percent range. The union says its members are underpaid compared to drivers elsewhere in Europe. In its latest proposal, Deutsche Bahn offered the drivers an 8 percent increase which could rise to as much as 13 percent if they agreed to work longer hours.
