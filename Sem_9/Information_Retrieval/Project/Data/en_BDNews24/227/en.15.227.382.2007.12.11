<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  After meeting with ex-footballers and organisers Tuesday, the Bangladesh Football Federation president SA Sultan said there were problems in implementing the FIFA directives to form district and divisional football associations (DFAs). "The reality is that there would be legal and technical problems if we continue with ongoing procedures of forming DFAs," Sultan told reporters emerging from the meeting at the BFF House Tuesday. "I want to make one thing clear that the BFF has so far done everything under the directives of FIFA. "However, considering the socio-economic condition of the country, I have realised that there are many problems in implementing the FIFA directives to form the DFAs," said the BFF boss, who is apparently under pressure after a battle of words with the sports adviser over the federation's activities. "Today's discussion was a productive one and with some constructive suggestions which I intend to take to FIFA," promised Sultan, adding that there was still time to clear any misunderstandings with FIFA. BFF ex-general secretary Harunur Rashid on behalf of the organisers and players said that they were happy about the president's admission. "FIFA's design for DFAs is not viable in a country like ours due to lack of infrastructure," said Harun, adding that had this open discussion taken place at the initial stage, things would have not become so complicated.
