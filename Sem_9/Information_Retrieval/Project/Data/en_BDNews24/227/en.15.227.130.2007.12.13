 PARIS, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell by more than 1.5 percent around midday on Thursday, with banking shares tumbling as the initial euphoria of joint action by major central banks to ease the credit squeeze faded away. Investors were cautious ahead of fourth-quarter results by US investment bank Lehman Brothers, due at around 1300 GMT, that could shed light on the scope of the current credit crisis. Writedowns from HBOS and Northern Rock, as well as warnings from Bank of America and Wachovia on Wednesday, rekindled investor fear that financial institutions have not yet unveiled the full impact of the credit crisis on their books. HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, dropped 7.1 percent after saying it would take a 180 million pound ($367.7 million) hit on the value of assets due to the credit crunch, which will also hurt margins. Troubled Northern Rock shed 4.9 percent after saying it had taken a 281 million pound ($574 million) hit, or two-thirds of its market value, from its exposure to the crisis. At 1145 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.63 percent at 1,521.36 points. Europe's benchmark index, which is up a mere 2.6 percent on the year, rallied on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would team up with other European central banks to ease tight conditions in credit markets. The Fed said it will set up a temporary short-term lending facility, while the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank also announced measures to alleviate credit market strains. The equity market rally spurred by the announcement was short-lived, with banking shares ending lower on Wall Street and Asian stocks dropping overnight. "Risk aversion is back in play overnight as the market has started to doubt that yesterday's announcement of co-ordinated central bank action will resolve the ongoing credit crisis," ABN AMRO analysts wrote in a note. "The measures are effective in helping alleviate some of the second round credit tightening that has been occurring recently where even high quality corporate and mortgage borrowers were either paying or being threatened with higher funding costs," they wrote. "However, it does not solve the problem of banks being forced to take SIV assets onto balance sheets, lowering their risk-weighted capital measures and thus reducing their ability to expand financing activities generally. Banks will still be reluctant and more discerning in conducting lending for the foreseeable future." Among the worst hit banks on Thursday, Barclays was down 4.4 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland down 4.7 percent and BNP Paribas down 2.6 percent, and Societe Generale down 3.1 percent. The DJ Stoxx European bank index has lost 15 percent so far this year, while Barclays is down 27 percent on the year, RBS down 34 percent, BNP Paribas down 9 percent and SocGen down 21 percent. Mining shares also dropped on Thursday along with base metal prices. Rio Tinto shed 3.2 percent, BHP Billiton fell 3.6 percent and Xstrata dropped 2.1 percent. Germany's DAX index was down 0.9 percent, the UK's FTSE 100 index down 1.7 percent and France's CAC 40 down 1.8 percent. In the pharmaceutical sector, Novartis AG rose 1 percent after saying it will slash 2.5 percent of its global workforce, aiming for annual savings of $1.6 billion in 2010. Irish-based drug maker Elan was down 3.5 percent after Biogen Idec Inc, co-developer of their Tysabri multiple sclerosis treatment, announced it will remain an independent company having previously put itself up for sale. UK gas producer BG Group gained 4.5 percent as traders cited continued market talk of a possible bid and a Merrill Lynch price target increase. Shares in Inditex, owner of the Zara clothing chain, extended the previous session's drop, falling 4.7 percent, as investors digested Wednesday's disappointing 9-month sales report while JP Morgan downgraded its rating on the retail
