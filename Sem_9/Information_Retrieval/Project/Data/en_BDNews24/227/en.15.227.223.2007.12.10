 JHAUKHEL, Nepal, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sitting by a pond, ducks quacking alongside him in this serene Nepali village, former Maoist guerrilla Suman Pariyar softly strums his guitar. Close by, wheat fields sway in the shadow of snow-capped mountains and pigs jostle unmindful of Pariyar's female comrade working the land for a potato crop. This is "Area No 2", a model of "revolutionary" rural development that young Maoists are promoting in hopes that Nepali villagers will emulate them to emerge from their impoverished existence. "We have to show that the Maoists can not only fight the war," said Deap Shikha, the head of the farm near the temple town of Bhaktapur. "They are equally committed to agriculture and development. This way we can cut costs and produce more." Swapping guns for spades and shovels, about 200 Maoist activists spent a week digging ponds for fish and ducks, and building tin-roofed sheds for poultry and pens for pigs. Maoists say they leased the land for the farm. The young activists who run the farm -- and tend its 500 chicks, 100 ducks and 17 pigs -- laid down their arms under a 2006 peace deal, but mainstream political parties and rights groups still accuse them of kidnapping, extortion and land grabs. Newspapers frequently carry reports of Maoists intimidating people and stealing crops from farmers. Analysts say the idea of farming could have been to keep the former fighters engaged and win a "good guy" image. TRYING TO IMPRESS "This is just to engage the young activists who were earlier involved in the war and to try to impress the villagers," Lok Raj Baral, chief of an independent think tank, the Nepal Centre for Strategic Studies, told Reuters. As part of their social efforts, the Maoists have vowed to set up a drug rehabilitation centre in Kathmandu, and to earn revenue for their party by expanding farming activities. During the decade-long conflict that killed more than 13,000 people, the Maoists ran schools, clinics and farms in areas they controlled, and even built a road. Now, they say, they want to focus on social and economic activities to win people over ahead of elections to a constituent assembly supposed to decide the fate of Nepal's centuries-old Hindu monarchy. The Maoists quit the interim government in September, unwilling to wait for the future assembly's verdict. They have now threatened to launch street protests to press their demands. They say they can bring down the multiparty government if it fails to turn Nepal, wedged between giants China and India, into a republic before the vote, now expected to take place by April. Some politicians say the Maoists were afraid of losing the vote. "We want to give the message to the people that political change also means social and economic prosperity," said Shovit, a former rebel sitting tending a piglet at the model farm under a fluttering Maoist hammer-and-sickle fl
