 TOYOTA, Japan, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Urawa Reds beat Iranian side Sepahan 3-1 at the Club World Cup on Monday to set up a dream semi-final with AC Milan. However, the Reds' victory over a poor Sepahan side is unlikely to cause Milan's expensively assembled squad to lose sleep ahead of Thursday's clash in Yokohama. Striker Yuichiro Nagai put Urawa in front, pouncing on Takahito Soma's low cross to score from point-blank range after 32 minutes. Brazilian forward Washington made it 2-0 nine minutes into the second half, finishing in style from an acute angle, before Hadi Aghily's own goal killed off the match. Sepahan were looking to avenge defeat by Urawa in last month's Asian Champions League final but they rarely threatened before a late consolation from substitute Mahmoud Karimi. South American champions Boca Juniors take on Tunisia's Etoile Sahel in the first semi-final of the seven-team tournament in Tokyo on Wednesday
