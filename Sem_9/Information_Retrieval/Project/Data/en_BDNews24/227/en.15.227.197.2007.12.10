 COLOMBO, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed 13 Tamil Tiger rebels in clashes in the north of the island on Monday, and weekend fighting killed 30 people, the military said. Fighting in Sri Lanka's renewed civil war has been intense in recent months, with near-daily air raids, bombings and land and sea battles. "A total of nine LTTE terrorists were killed in two confrontations in Welioya," said a spokesman at the Media Centre for National Security, adding a separate confrontation in Vavuniya killed four rebels in the morning. The military also said weekend fighting in the north killed 29 Tamil Tiger rebels and one soldier, while 10 soldiers were wounded. The separatist Tigers, who are seeking to carve out an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened. Analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. More than 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) since early 2006, taking the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,0
