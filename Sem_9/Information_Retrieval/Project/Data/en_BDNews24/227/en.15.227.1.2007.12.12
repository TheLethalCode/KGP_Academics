 BASRA, Iraq, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from a triple car bomb attack in southern Iraq's Amara city on Wednesday climbed to 40 with dozens wounded, a police source said. A health official said 39 were killed and more than 125 were wounded. The police source said hospitals iDozens of people were killed and more than 100 wounded when three car bombs exploded in quick succession in a southern Iraqi Shia city on Wednesday, police and hospital officials said. The attack in Amara city was one of the deadliest in Iraq in months, and came as tensions are running high across oil-rich southern Iraq as rival Shia factions battle for influence as British forces across the region draw down. A doctor at the emergency unit of the biggest hospital in Amara said 26 bodies and 100 wounded had been brought in. The bombs exploded along a main street in the city, the capital of Maysan province.

One witness in Amara, 365 km (230 miles) southeast of Baghdad, said the bomb in the parking lot exploded first, followed soon after by the one at the market. Iraq's Furat Television said two men suspected of involvement in the blasts had been detained. Adding to the tensions in southern Iraq in recent months has been the assassination of two provincial governors. Senior police officials have also been killed. Britain is expected to hand over control of security next week in neighboring Basra province to Iraqi forces. That will end Britain's security control of four southern provinces it once had responsibility for. Analysts fear Shi'ite factions will intensify their battle for political supremacy as Britain further cuts troop levels. However, there has not yet been an upsurge of intra-Shi'ite violence in Basra city, which is the most important hub in southern Iraq and where most of Iraq's oil exports pass throu
