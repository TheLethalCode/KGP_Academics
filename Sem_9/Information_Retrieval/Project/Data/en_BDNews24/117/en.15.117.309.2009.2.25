 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina held a meeting with chiefs of army, navy and air force Wednesday to discuss the events at the BDR headquarters after heavy gunfire erupted in and around the compound from morning. At least one civilian was confirmed dead, and sources said a number of top BDR officers were killed inside the compound. The BDR personnel in a letter alleged that they had been "long oppressed by army officers" and "stripped of basic rights". They handed a letter to the people gathered outside the sprawling compound around 2pm and ask them to give it to the media. Army troops massed on the streets surrounding the BDR compound from about 10.30am. bdnews24.com senior reporter Liton Haider reported a patrolling army helicopter shooting into the compound at one point. Soldiers were taking up positions and arms on the streets, but making no move to take the compound. Army officers were urging the BDR personnel by loudspeaker to calm down and surrender their arms. Gunfire broke out shortly after 9am and continued without break until 2pm. It went on sporadically through the afternoon. Sources inside the headquarters told bdnews24.com BDR personnel began firing during the director general's address at the annual Darbar. They were seen carrying heavy arms and taking position at the main entrance to the Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters on Dhanmondi Road 2 in the morning. bdnews24.com's Rohan Ziad reported that the personnel fired shots out of the compound at civilians on at least two occasions, once around 10:30am and a second time around 11:15am. A bullet-hit rickshaw puller brought to Dhaka Medical College Hospital died on arrival at DMCH. Traffic movement remained suspended on the roads around the BDR compound since troops took position. An Inter Services Public Relations press release issued after the incident asked the BDR personnel to surrender their arms immediately and return to barracks. The prime minister will speak to the BDR personnel and hear their complaints and grievances, it said. If anyone is found taking the law in their hands violating the order, stringent punitive measures will be taken against them, the ISPR release warned. bdnews24.com/lh/sit/
