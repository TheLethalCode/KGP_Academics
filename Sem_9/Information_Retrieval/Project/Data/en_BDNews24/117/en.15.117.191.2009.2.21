<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  Arts and literature are no longer the preserve of the rich, even the man on the street contributes, says prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Production and arts are intricately linked, she said after handing Ekushey Padak to 13 distinguished persons for contributions to their fields of work at Osmany Auditorium Friday. Arts and literature should reach out to the masses, and in pursuit of those the ordinary people should not be left out. She stressed on cultivating the mother language and people-focused culture in the right way. "Bengali language is being corrupted. Speaking Bengali with English accent has to be stopped," the prime minister said in a repeat of her statements at the launch of the Ekushey Book Fair. "Bengali has to be spoken like Bengali. Rural dialect is far better than Bengali with English accent." Knowledge, said the prime minister, could also be sourced from the downtrodden. "There's a lot to learn from the labourers, the rickshaw-pullers." Work of arts must make sense to the people, she said. She sought support to preserve and develop Bengali language, culture and creativity, and said her administration will protect the languages of ethnic communities. Ekushey Padak is one of the highest civilian awards, introduced in memory of the martyrs of the Language Movement on Feb. 21, 1952. Each award recipient got a gold medal, Tk 40,000 by cheque and a citation. "The immortal Ekushey is the manifestation of our patriotism, national spirit and coordinated efforts. Ekush (21st February) means never-ending inspiration to establish self-determination and justice." The history of the Bengali nation would have been different had it not been for Ekushey, she said. "Shaheed Minar is not a mere installation of bricks. It is our shelter. "Once our enemies wanted to rage it down to rubble. "They thought we would move away from the spirit of Ekushey. But they were mistaken." She also said the government would re-start work on the International Mother Language Institute. "We launched it in presence of (former) UN secretary-general Kofi Anan. But the BNP-led coalition government suspended work," the prime minister said. The award-winners are Dr Borhan Uddin Khan Jahangir (education), Dr Syed Anwar Hossain (research), late Mahbub Ul Alam Chowdhury (Language Movement), late Ashraf Uz-Zaman (journalism), Begum Bilkis Nasir Uddin (music), late Manik Chandra Saha (journalism), late Humayun Kabir Balu (journalism), Selina Hossain (literature), Shamsuzzaman Khan (research), Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman (poverty reduction), Dr Muhammad Rafi Khan (social work), Monsur Ul Karim (fine arts) and Ramendu Majumdar (theatre). Hasina handed over awards to nine of the 13 winners while the relatives of the other five, awarded posthumously, received theirs. Cabinet members, MPs, high civilian and military officials, diplomats and other distinguished personalities attended the function broadcast live by state-run BTV and Betar from 11am. b
