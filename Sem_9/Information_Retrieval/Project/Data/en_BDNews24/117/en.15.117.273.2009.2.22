<TITLE> Aid may even remain unused: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The finance minister has again dismissed the possibility of foreign assistance declining because of the ongoing global financial meltdown and said some of the funds may remain unused, instead. "[Rather] we may not be able to use the full amount of assistance from donor countries and organisations due to our inefficiency," AMA Muhith told reporters after a team of the International Business Forum of Bangladesh met him Sunday. The power changeover could pose problems for the planning ministry to prepare development projects, eventually barring the full use of foreign assistances in the current fiscal year, he observed. "That does not necessarily mean that foreign assistance will come down." Muhith was optimistic that the main opposition BNP will have representatives in the taskforce to determine ways to avoid negative impacts of ongoing global economic meltdown. "The taskforce will be formed very soon," he said, "drawing on all stakeholders." The Awami League-led grand alliance government had promised the taskforce "comprising the representatives from the government and opposition, businessmen and experts". bdn
