 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com) - The caretaker government's ordinances are being tabled as bills in parliament after cabinet approval, the prime minister said on Tuesday in reply to concerns raised by opposition MPs. "There is no reason for concern," Sheikh Hasina told the House. "The laws have not lapsed as the bills have retroactive effect," she said after opposition MPs led by BNP staged two walk outs before and after Maghrib prayers. BNP said the government was trying to pass ordinances that had "expired" on Tuesday. "According to the Constitution, 122 ordinances placed on Jan 25 should have been passed within 30 days after their first placement in parliament," said BNP MP MK Anwar. "Therefore, the 111 ordinances not passed expired at 3pm today," he said. "There is no mechanism in the Constitution to resuscitate them," Anwar told reporters after walking out of the House. "The government has taken a move pass the lapsed ordinances. This is in violation of the Constitution," he said. Hasina told the House after the walkouts: "These ordinances are being tabled via cabinet approval as bills. And then if parliament gives the nod, they will be passed." "Parliament stands above all. The people's representatives sit here. What is being done here is for the interests of the people." Aiming at the BNP lawmakers, the prime minister asked, "Are they walking out of parliament for any good cause?" Censuring the BNP, she said, "Those who try and teach us about the Constitution, supported an unconstitutional government in the past." "Did they forget their past?" Hasina went on to blame the previous BNP-led four-party government for the previous two years of emergency rule. "Their corruption, oppression and anti-constitutional activities led to the announcement of emergency in the country," she said. "One-eleven would not have happened if the then-president (Iajuddin Ahmed) was not made the chief adviser," said Hasina. She also said BNP was opposing a law for prevention of money-laundering "as its MPs were involved with laundering money." bdnews24.c
