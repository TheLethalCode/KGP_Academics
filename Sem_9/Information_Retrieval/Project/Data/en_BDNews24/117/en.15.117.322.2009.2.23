 KINGSTON, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor, who has officiated in a record 126 tests, will retire from international matches in March. Bucknor, 62, told the Jamaica Gleaner that the third test between South Africa and Australia in Cape Town would be his last international. "I have notified the ICC that the South Africa v Australia series will be my last test series. The third test, my last test," said the Jamaican. Bucknor, who hails from Montego Bay, said he felt physically able to continue but felt it was the right time to stand down. "The body is feeling quite good and I know I could go on for two or three years. However, something inside me is telling me it is time to go," he added. The umpire, who was the first to officiate 100 tests, said he hopes to work with the West Indies Cricket Board on developing new umpiring talent in the Caribbean. "I still would like to continue making a contribution," he said. Bucknor has stood in 179 one day internationals, including five consecutive World Cup
