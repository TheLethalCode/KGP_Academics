 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  A nine-hour high drama ended late Wednesday afternoon after prime minister Sheikh Hasina declared general pardon for revolting BDR men and pledged to meet their demands in phases, a state minister said. The BDR mutineers had agreed to surrender their arms after a meeting with the prime minister at her official residence, state minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak told reporters. A bdnews24.com correspondent at the gate of Jamuna saw at least 14 BDR personnel in uniform, accompanied by government negotiators, entering the state guesthouse Jamuna at around 3:40pm, as gunshots continued inside the BDR headquarters. At least one civilian was confirmed dead and 7 were wounded as heavy gunfire erupted in and around Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters in the morning. A number of top BDR officers were killed inside the compound, sources said. Gunfire broke out in the compound around 9:30am. Sources inside the headquarters told bdnews24.com BDR personnel began firing during the director general's address at the annual Darbar. The BDR personnel sent out a letter to the media, claiming their personnel have been long-oppressed by army officers. The prime minister also met with the chiefs of army, navy and air force shortly after 2pm over the mutiny. BDR men fired shots out of the compound at civilians on at least two occasions in the morning. A bullet-hit rickshaw puller brought to Dhaka Medical College Hospital died on arrival there. bdn
