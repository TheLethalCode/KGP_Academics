 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Some 2700 voters are set to elect a new executive committee of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association in the biennial elections Tuesday. Voting will be held from 8am to 4pm at the BGMEA offices in Dhaka and Chittagong to elect 27 directors. Dhaka will elect 20 and Chittagong seven. The Sammilita Parishad group led by Abdus Salam Murshedi, managing director of Envoy Group, and the Forum group, headed by M Shahadat Hossain Kiran, MD, Dekko Group, are running the polls. If elected president, Murshedi, a former national footballer, told bdnews24.com he would recommend first the formation of a steering committee comprising entrepreneurs, experts and relevant ministries to lead the industry safely through the global economic recession. "We'll recommend raising a Tk 2,000 crore special fund to provide support in the form of loans at a negligible 2-5 percent interest to any industry afflicted by the recession or any impediment." Kiran said he would try to cope with the fallouts of the global financial crunch that may afflict the sector and then help it prosper further. "We'll also try to persuade our government to assist us actively the way the US government has undertaken bailout schemes." Murshedi said they will try to enhance the current Tk 500 crore small and medium enterprises loan fund to Tk 5,000 crore to facilitate more entrepreneurships in distress. Kiran favoured launching training institutes to provide skills training to the unskilled and gradually fill out the current shortfall of workers, which should be about 25 percent. b
