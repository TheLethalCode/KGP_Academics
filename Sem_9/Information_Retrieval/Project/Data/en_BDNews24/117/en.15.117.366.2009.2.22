 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia was holding a meeting of BNP's parliamentary party Sunday afternoon to decide if the main opposition party will be re-joining the House in the current session, said a senior party leader. "BNP would like to play its role effectively in parliament, which so far has been impeded by the government. In today's meeting, we'll decide the issue finally," Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP told bdnews24.com in the morning. He hinted that his party is keen to re-join "during this session", so that they may have their say on the ordinances promulgated during the caretaker government's rule. The meeting, beginning around 4.30pm, was being chaired by Khaleda at her parliament office, said opposition chief whip Joynal Abdin Faruq. "We will discuss the speaker's proposal on seat allocation," said Faruq. Speaker Abdul Hamid held a meeting with the chief whips of the ruling and opposition parties at the end of last week, said Faruq. "Hamid proposed some changes to the seating arrangements." The speaker has reportedly offered another front row seat to the opposition for the next parliamentary session. Outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar allotted BNP parliamentarians nine seats in the first row and ten in the second. The new speaker redistributed the seats, giving BNP four seats each in the frontmost and second rows "in line with their party strength". The opposition MPs have since refrained from attending parliament. bdnew
