<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)An alliance of leftist parties has demanded and an end to 'political interference' by the country's military intelligence agency, along with white papers on all actions of the past caretaker government. "White papers need to be published to ascertain the transparency of the caretaker government," said coordinator of the Gonotantrik Bam Morcha, Badrul Alam, at a press conference Sunday. He called for particular investigation into state-ordered detentions during the extra-constitutional two-year term of the military-backed interim government. Alam also demanded the dissolution of the "political wing" of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). Criticising the new Awami League-led government that won a landslide in the Dec 29 polls, he said, "The huge victory has made the grand alliance unstable." "Within one and a half months, the hopes of the people have turned to despair." Alam also demanded that the government refrain from signing agreements that are "against the interests of the country", referring to much-debated TIFA and transit proposals with the US and India respectively, and a possible South Asian anti-terror task force. Other leaders of the leftist parties were also present at the press conference. bdnew
