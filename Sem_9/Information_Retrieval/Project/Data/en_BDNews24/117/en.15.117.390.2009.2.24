 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Elections to BGMEA's executive committee were held Tuesday, with voting suspended for an hour as two campaign groups locked in a dispute. Head of the election board Anisuzzaman said the polls in Dhaka and Chittagong saw more than 90 percent turnout. "It is the highest number of votes cast in BGMEA's history. Dhaka saw 90.67 percent votes cast and Chittagong 90.47 percent," he told bdnews24.com. As many as 1,934 voters in Dhaka out of a possible 2,122 and 539 voters out of 556 cast their ballots, Anisuzzaman added. Vote counting began just before 6.30pm. ""If no recount is required, we will announce the results later tonight," he added. The biennial elections of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, to elect 27 directors of its executive committee, began at 8am. But voting at the Dhaka office stopped for an hour from around 9.30 am as members of two panels argued over alleged interference by FBCCI president Annisul Huq. "Polling agents of the Sammilito Parishad raised complaints against Annisul Huq for campaigning on behalf of BGMEA's incumbent president Anwar-ul-Alan Chowdhury Parvez of the Forum Group," Anisuzzaman told bdnews24.com earlier in the day. The complainants feared the campaigning might raise question about the neutrality of the polls, said Anisuzzaman, who is also chairman of Bangladesh Teri Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters Association, . Abdus Salam Murshedi, candidate for president from the Sammilita Parishad group, said: "It's not right for the head of the country's top trade body to be involved." On the allegation Annisul Huq said: "I didn't come here as the FBCCI president. I came here as a voter and president of the Forum group. "There is no such law in the world that I am not allowed to cast vote because I head a separate organisation," he said. Parvez agreed. Both Huq and Parvez were seen to campaign at the entrance of the polling centre. M Shahadat Hossain Kiran, candidate for president from the Forum group, said "Misunderstanding sometimes take place. However, it has been resolved." bd
