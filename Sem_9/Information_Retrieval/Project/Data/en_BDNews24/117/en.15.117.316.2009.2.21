The victory not only ensured Adelaide a place in next week's championship decider in Melbourne, it also gave them a place in next season's lucrative Asian Champions Cup. The result capped a remarkable turnaround for the club after they were thrashed 6-0 over two legs by Melbourne, prompting coach Aurelio Vidmar to launch an astonishing verbal attack on the club and the South Australian capital city, which he later retracted.

"Our performances have been certainly well below par and I thought tonight was a good sign of what we've done for the majority of the season.
