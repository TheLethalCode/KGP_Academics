 WELLINGTON, April 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's bowlers have been challenged by captain Daniel Vettori to respond the same way the batsmen did in the second test in Napier when the third and final encounter against India begins on Friday. New Zealand are down 1-0 in the series after they lost the first match in Hamilton by 10 wickets. In both innings the hosts were bowled out for 279 and Vettori asked his batsmen to bat time in Napier. Jesse Ryder (201), Ross Taylor (151) and Brendon McCullum (115) responded with centuries in New Zealand's 619 for nine declared, when they batted for almost two days in match that ultimately ended in a draw. "We have proved that we can bat for a long period of time against their bowlers," Vettori told reporters on Thursday. "Now our bowlers have to take wickets. "We did that in the first innings in Napier on a very flat wicket so if we can get that same result there then I have confidence." The wicket at the Basin Reserve in Wellington appeared brown and dry, which surprised Vettori. "I've never seen a Basin wicket like this in my life ... I can't get a read on it," the left arm spinner said. "You usually expect the Basin wicket to have something in it, then in days two and three it settles down into a really good batting days, and then later on you get some inconsistent bounce. "Jeetan (Patel) said he played on a wicket similar to it in his last game for Wellington and he said it had a bit of bounce and it didn't do too much." Vettori, who said he would probably bowl if he won the toss, confirmed that all-rounder James Franklin would remain in the side and bat at number six. The hosts will need to determine whether to retain the twin spin attack with Vettori and Patel, or to include either swing bowlers Tim Southee or Kyle Mills at the expense of Patel. Injured batsman Daniel Flynn batted in the nets on Thursday and a team spokesman said a decision on whether he would play would be made before the toss on Friday. While India could seal their first series win in New Zealand since 1968, they would not even contemplate playing for the draw, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said. "It's important to win the game. What we have done in the test series so far has not much importance," Dhoni said. "Once you have the mindset of going for the draw then you are not aggressive enough to win a test match. "The priority will be to approach the game the same way we have the first and second test." Dhoni, who missed the second test when he injured his back before play on the first day, said he was improving but a decision on whether he played would be made before the toss. New Zealand (from) - Daniel Vettori (captain), Tim McIntosh, Martin Guptill, Daniel Flynn, Ross Taylor, Jesse Ryder, James Franklin, Brendon McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jeetan Patel, Chris Martin. India (probable) - Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel
