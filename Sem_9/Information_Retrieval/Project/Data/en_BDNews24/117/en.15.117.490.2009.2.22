<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Members of parliament must not address the House as they do political rallies and need to educate themselves on national issues, the visiting Indian Lok Sabha speaker has said. "Talking in parliament and addressing rallies in public places are quite different," said Somnath Chatterjee at the launch of a four-day orientation programme of newly-elected MPs at Hotel Sonargaon Sunday. Every institution, he said, had its own rules, and parliament had rules of procedure which the MPs must follow. Chatterjee, who came to Dhaka to train the newly-elected MPs of Bangladesh, said frequent commotion in the House was not good for any country. The MPs must respect and honour others' opinion, the speaker said ansd proposed constituting forums to educate the MPs on national issues. "All MPs need not talk on every issue. Please, study first and then talk on any issue in parliament. It is not expected that everybody will be expert on every issue." "If you speak after study, it will have some impacts on the government," he said. On the Indian experience, Chatterjee said, "We have formed parliamentary forums on women, children, climate change and water management. There are many public-importance issue which people don't know. "We invite the experts to the forums to deliver speeches. The MPs get educated about the issues," he said. He has been elected MP for a 10th consecutive time since 1971. In Bangladesh, MPs allegedly talk in parliament without doing homework and mislead people with wrong information. Besides, MPs attack each other with provocative speeches. leading to commotion and often boycott of the House. "It is not good to deliver provocative speeches in parliament. Frequent tension is not good," said Chaterjee who criticised Indian media who, he said , displayed parliamentary commotions well but downplayed the positive developments in the House. "You have to maintain friendly relations among the MPs. You must have mutual respect". The USAID and Washington-based National Democratic Institute co-organised the first ever orientation workshop for the MPs. Among the 296 MPs of the ninth parliament, 162 MPs have been elected for the first time, who know little about how parliament works. "I hope this orientation workshop will make the newly-elected MPs understand the parliamentary procedures," said speaker Abdul Hamid who chaired the opening session.
