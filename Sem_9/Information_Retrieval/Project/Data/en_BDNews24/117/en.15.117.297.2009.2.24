 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Counting in elections to the BGMEA's executive committee was going on late into the night Tuesday after the biennial voting was suspended for an hour over a dispute between two campaign groups. Head of the election board Anisuzzaman said vote counting began just before 6:30pm. ""If no recount is required, we will announce the results later this evening," he added. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association went to the polls at 8am in its Dhaka and Chittagong offices to elect 27 directors of the executive committee. More than 90 percent turnout was seen in the voting that ended an hour after schedule at 5pm, said Anisuzzaman. "It is the highest number of votes in BGMEA's history. Dhaka received 90.67 percent votes and Chittagong 90.47 percent," Anisuzzaman told bdnews24.com. As many as 1934 voters in Dhaka out of a possible 2122 and 539 voters out of 556 cast their ballots, he added. The BGMEA office in Dhaka will elect 20 directors and the Chittagong office seven. But voting at the Dhaka office stopped for an hour from around 9:30am as members of two panels argued over alleged interference by FBCCI president Annisul Huq, also former BGMEA chief. "The polling agents of the Sammilita Parishad panel raised complaints against Annisul Huq for campaigning on behalf of BGMEA's incumbent president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury of the Forum Group," Anisuzzaman, also chairman of Bangladesh Teri Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com. The complainants feared the campaigning might raise question about the neutrality of the polls, he said. Abdus Salam Murshedi, president candidate from the Sammilita Parishad group, said: "It's not right for the head of [one of the] country's top trade body to get involved." On the allegation, Huq said: "I didn't come here as the FBCCI president. I came here as a voter and president of the Forum group. "There is no such law in the world that says I am not allowed to cast vote because I head a separate organisation," he said. Chowdhury agreed. Both Huq and he campaigned at the entrance to the polling centre. M Shahadat Hossain Kiran, candidate for president from the Forum group, said "Misunderstanding sometimes takes place. However, it has been resolved." bdnew
