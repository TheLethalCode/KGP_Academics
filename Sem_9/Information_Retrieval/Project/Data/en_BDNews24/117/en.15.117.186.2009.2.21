 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  The home minister Saturday called for setting up community-based committees against terrorism and militancy. Sahara Khatun said her ministry would give specific directives soon to form the local committees. Local committees need to be formed in every community to combat terrorism, extortion and violence, Sahara Khatun said at an International Mother Language Day programme in South Manikdi, Dhaka. "Extremists would be evicted from society only if you don't allow them to enter your locality." She said local government will support the community-based committees. "I believe we will definitely be successful with our joint efforts. We will have to be successful in this battle," she said. The minister also sought support from people. bdnews
