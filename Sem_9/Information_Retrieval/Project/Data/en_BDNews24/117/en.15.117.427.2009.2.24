 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid to make the training camp for the 2010 South Asian Games continual, the Bangladesh Olympic Association on Tuesday urged the National Sports Council not to rent the dormitory of the National Women's Complex until the extravaganza. The BOA made the appeal during its executive committee meeting with General Moeen U Ahmed in the chair. The army chief is also chairman of the National Sports Council. "We all have to start the work with the facilities we have at the moment. We must do well in the Games. We have to also encourage the athletes," the BOA statement quoted Moeen as saying. The meeting emphasised the need for increasing the standard of the accommodation for the athletes taking part in the training. Bangladesh will host the SA Games which is scheduled for Feb 29 to Mar 9 in 2010. The Games includes 23 disciplines -- football, archery, athletics, boxing, handball, hockey, kabaddi, karate, shooting, squash, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, weightlifting, wushu, wrestling, golf, badminton, basketball, judo, volleyball, cycling and cricket (under-21). bd
