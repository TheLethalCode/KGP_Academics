 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stressed regional cooperation to solve the power crisis in Bangladesh, one of her top advisers said Thursday. Sheikh Hasina, also energy minister, had a meeting with senior ministry officials and discussed ways to quicken the pace of work towards finding new sources of power. "The Prime Minister laid emphasis on regional cooperation and asked us to explore 'power trade' opportunities with Nepal, Bhutan and India," adviser Dr Toufique-E-Elahi Chowdhury told journalists after the meeting. The adviser said the World Bank had already done some work in this regard and talked with Nepal and India. He said a Bank mission would arrive here on April 5 to discuss the issue with Dhaka officials. The adviser said the prime minister also suggested looking into the prospects of joint venture hydroelectric projects with Myanmar. The adviser said the prime minister discussed the short-, medium- and long-term steps to solve the long-running power shortage. "We are getting many offers from foreign investors. Our job would be to ensure best utilisation of such opportunity. "Only yesterday, China National Petroleum Corporation, the largest oil company in China, expressed interest in investing here." The adviser said the prime minister recommended use of solar power in offices, courts, schools and colleges as she referred to many alternative sources of energy. The prime minister also ordered quicker implementation of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) assisted 150-mw plant which would get gas from the Bhola field. A 125-mw plant fuelled by Barapukuria coal was also discussed. "The plants that are being pursued now could generate 3000 megawatts in 3-4 years. For some of these, tenders are being called," the adviser said, adding the prime minister instructed officials to speed up the work.
