 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government will buy helicopters and aircraft to guard the unprotected sea boundary, the planning minister has told parliament. "International tenders have been invited to purchase helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft to expedite maritime patrol and set up a 'three-dimensional navy'," A K Khandaker, who is authorised to answer defence questions in parliament, said Sunday. Helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, sniper rifles and other equipment will also be purchased for the army, he said. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina oversees the defence ministry. Khandaker said the government would spend Tk 120 crore this fiscal year on the purchase of the missiles. The process is underway and a final approval of the government is awaited, the minister said. Nilfamari-1 MP Zafar Iqbal Siddiqui (Jatiya Party) asked the question in writing to the defence minister. The minister said the government had almost finalised an agreement on procuring ship- destroying missiles for a navy frigate. But the minister did not name the country where the missiles are being bought from. In written questions, MPs cannot make supplementary questions for additional information. Defence experts have urged the government to strengthen the navy following the intrusion of Myanmar and Indian vessels into Bangladesh's sea boundaries in November and December last year. bdn
