 London, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man died after collapsing during anti-capitalist protests on Wednesday on the eve of a G20 summit in London, police said. Police said they found the man in London's financial district in a street by the Bank of England where he had fallen down and stopped breathing at around 7:30 p.m. (1830 GMT). It was not immediately clear what caused the man's death. A police source said it was likely the man died from a medical condition, although that would not be confirmed until after a post-mortem. Officers moved the man behind a police cordon and attempted to resuscitate him before he was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police said they had to move the man after protesters hurled bottles at them. Reuters photographers said they saw police with the man lying on the ground while protesters ran past them.
