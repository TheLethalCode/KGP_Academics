<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  The siege at the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters in the capital meant all of Wednesday's scheduled events in the sports arena had to be either suspended or cancelled. The Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis suspended all three matches of the Premier Cricket League as well as the First Division Cricket League at the half way point of the fixtures at different venues. The CCDM has decided to hold the suspended matches on Thursday from where the games left. The scheduled press conference to announce the title sponsor for Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh next month was also cancelled and the organisers in a statement said that a fresh date would be announced later. The Bangladesh Golf Federation also postponed a scheduled reception for the golfers, who emerged winners in the All India Amateur Golf Championship in Kolkata and City Bank-Dhaka Bank Bangladesh Open, citing unavoidable circumstances. The fresh schedule of the reception would be informed soon, said a press release. Only two matches of the KFC Pizza Hut 5th Mini Handball Tournament (Girls') were held with Moghbazar Ispahani Girls School and Banani Biddya Niketan beating Viquarunnisa School & College and Summer Field respectively. But the Bangladesh Handball Federation in a statement later said that the tournament would remain suspended until further notice. bd
