<TITLE> Gold eyes new high above $1,000 </TITLE>

 LONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold may surge to a new record above $1,000 over the next few months, analysts say, as investors flock to bullion, seeking safety from financial market turmoil and a potential inflationary spiral. Spot gold has rallied around $130 an ounce in the last month and climbed to an 11-month high of $1,005.40 on Friday, not far from the record $1,030.80 it hit in March 2008. Prices consolidated on Monday, but the upward trend remains strong. UBS strategist John Reade said gold buying for investment was the driver behind recent gains, even as jewelry sales lag. "We have an average forecast of $1,075 for the first half of this year, which implies we should get to a new high," said UBS strategist John Reade. "To average that in the first half of the year, you could make a case for gold going up to $1,200, perhaps more," he said. "(Investment demand is) the only thing in the market at the moment." Investment in gold-backed exchange traded funds (ETFs) has soared as investors buy gold as an alternative to more volatile assets. Holdings of the largest gold ETF, New York's SPDR Gold Trust, have risen almost 250 tonnes since January 1, versus around 3 tonnes in the same period of 2008. ETFs issue securities backed by physical bullion, giving investors exposure to the underlying price of gold without taking delivery of the asset itself. Gold's appeal as a haven means it is likely to further outperform other assets such as equities and oil, analysts say. While industrial commodities are suffering from falling demand as the recession bites and equity markets are wilting in the face of banking sector volatility and a spate of worrying corporate results, gold has shone. According to Reuters data, its ratio versus the S&P 500 index hit its highest level since 1990 last week at 1.3, and against oil its highest since 1998 at 26.0. "There is a little bit of panic out there," said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance. "Equities are setting new lows and gold is the place to run to." JEWELLERY DEMAND SOFT While jewellery demand is soft as prices climb, investment demand, fueled by risk aversion, is set to fuel upward momentum. "People are saying equities are still too risky, bonds are shaky -- (gold) is just very, very attractive at the moment," said Citi analyst David Thurtell. "It has always had a safe-haven bid and interest rates are very low, so the opportunity cost of investing in gold is low." The metal has benefited from currency market volatility and waning confidence in paper money. Gold hit records last week when priced in sterling, the euro, Australian and Canadian dollars, the rand and the rupee. The prospect of rising inflation is being closely watched, as banks around the world have slashed interest rates and governments have lined up huge amounts of cash for injection into the financial system. "The fear is that if we get any kind of recovery in this market, we have a global economy which is completely awash with cash and inflation is obviously the risk," said Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen. Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation, which erodes the value of paper assets. Some say gold also offers protection during times of deflation. "While gold is usually an anti-inflationary hedge, it can work as an anti-deflationary hedge, too," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York-Mellon. "As deflation pushes all prices lower, you want to hold something that retains its value. Gold's usual main external driver, the dollar, is also being eyed for any sign of weakness, although it has had little of its traditional influence over the metal in recent months. A stronger dollar usually weighs on gold, which is often bought as an alternative investment to the U.S. currency. However, with both assets currently benefiting from risk aversion, they are rising in tandem. Nonetheless, any sign of fresh weakness in the dollar is likely to further boost g
