<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government will push ordinances to curb money laundering and terrorism through parliament, the law minister has said. "Money laundering and anti-terrorism ordinances of the caretaker government will be passed into laws. There is no compulsion of getting the 54 ordinances passed into law in this session," Shafiq Ahmed said. He spoke to journalists after a meeting with Canadian high commissioner Robert McDougall at the secretariat Sunday. The government has moved to bring back money laundered abroad and the US is helping Bangladesh out to return the stolen funds, he added. The Awami League-led government has decided to pass 54 out of 122 ordinances of the emergency government in parliament. State minister for law Quamrul Islam and representatives of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) attended the meeting. "The Canadian government has proposed extension of the tenure of the legal aid project run by the law ministry, Ahmed said on the outcome of the meeting. "Besides, they wanted to help implement the alternative dispute resolutions and strengthen the human-rights commission," the minister said. On the demand of lower court judges for resignation of the acting law secretary, Ahmed said, "It is very indecent. They gave their word that they would not announce any programme against the law secretary until the case was settled. "It is not fair." On whether the judges would be penalised, he said, "With the judiciary separated from the executive, the law ministry has nothing to do in the matter. "The Supreme Court can take steps against them if the court considers it proper." The judges under Judicial Service Association announced Friday to wear black badges and stage a pen-down strike if acting law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal was not removed within 10 days. The judges have been demanding his resignation for several months. b
