 KARACHI, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Younis Khan notched his first triple century on Tuesday and was hoping to further frustrate Sri Lanka on the final day of the first test when he chases Brian Lara's world record 400 not out. With the test certain to end in a draw, the stage has been set for Younis, unbeaten on 306, to take advantage of the flat batting pitch as he nears the personal milestone. "We plan to bat for another 40 odd overs and if I am close (to West Indian Lara's record) I will ask my team mates and coach. If they say go I will go for it," said Younis. "I am someone who is not particularly into records and I prefer to look at things more from a team perspective," the 31-yerar-old told a news conference. Younis is the third Pakistani to get a triple ton after Hanif Mohammad (337) and Inzamam-ul-Haq (329) but he said his knock of 267 against India in 2005 was more important. "I rate that innings higher because it allowed us to win the test and draw the series in India. It is more memorable for me. Although I am happy I achieved 300 today at my age," he said. Younis's blistering strokeplay steered Pakistan to safety on Tuesday after the visitors amassed 644 for seven declared. "I value this innings because someone needed to play a big innings in this match and I'm happy I did it as captain," he said
