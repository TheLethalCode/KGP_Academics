<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for law Kamrul Islam said Thursday children of freedom fighters or "competent people" will replace the civil servants who admitted stealing public money to the Truth Commission for clemency. The people who have received clemency are guilty and they have to pay penalty, he told bdnews24.com. The law minister, Shafiq Ahmed, has already expressed his views on the issue but no formal decision has been made, Kamrul said. "We want to bring transparency and accountability in every sector. As they have committed corruption once, they will do it again," the state minister said. Action will be taken against them to maintain discipline in public offices, he added. He said the vacant posts at sub-register's offices would be filled out soon. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina in parliament Wednesday revealed a list of 448 people who confessed to corruption before the commission last year in exchange for clemency. The law minister said the day before that government would take measures against public servants who had confessed to graft. "No corrupt government employees or officials will be allowed to remain in public service," Shafiq said Tuesday. "A committee to probe the charges will be formed and departmental measures will be taken against those who confessed to corruption in exchange for clemency," said the minister. The commission awarded certificates of clemency to 448 people after Truth Commission hearings last year, 351 of them being government employees. The rules of the commission do not allow any legal measures against those who received clemency, said the minister. "But there are no rules against departmental measures. There is no legal bar to terminating their jobs," he said. The commission, formed under the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance 2007 and headed by justice Habibur Rahman Khan, began its five-month run on Aug 3 last year under the past caretaker regime. The commission wound up its operations on Dec. 31 after hearing 491 pleas for clemency. bdne
