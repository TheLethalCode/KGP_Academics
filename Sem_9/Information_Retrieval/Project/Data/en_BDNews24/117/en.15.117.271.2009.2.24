 Washington, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Monday welcomed as a good step the release of a group of political prisoners in Myanmar but repeated a call for all of them be freed, including pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi. On Saturday, 16 political detainees were freed from Yangon's Insein prison and three from a prison in northern Kachin state, an exiled group said. "It's a step. We obviously welcome the release of any political prisoners but we call on the Burmese (Myanmar) to release all political prisoners," said State Department spokesman Robert Wood. Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, who began her latest detention in May 2003, is among those jailed in Myanmar for their political or religious beliefs. The Myanmar regime announced the release of more than 6,000 inmates last Friday after U.N. human rights rapporteur Tomas Ojea Quintana ended a visit during which he called for the progressive release of "prisoners of conscience." The month-old Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are reviewing U.S. policy toward Myanmar. Wood said it was hoping to find new and better ways to change Myanmar's behavior, particularly on political prisoners. "It's something the secretary cares very deeply about, and she's frustrated, as we all are that, you know, things have not progressed the way we'd have liked to have seen them progress," said Wood. The Bush administration relied on sanctions as a key tool to put pressure on Myanmar, but Wood said this had not worked. "There are other aspects of previous government's approach to Burma and the international community's approach to Burma in general that haven't worked," he said. "We need to find a way to make our policy effective. And we're going to be looking for ways to try to do that, and we're going to do that in consultation with our allies, the U.N. and others, because nothing has really moved," Wood added. Clinton has just returned from a week-long trip to Asia. While in Tokyo she said the United States should take a fresh look at policy toward Myanmar.
