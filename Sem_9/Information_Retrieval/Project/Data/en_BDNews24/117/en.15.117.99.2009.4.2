 KHARTOUM, Thu Apr 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new US special envoy told Sudan on Thursday he had come to "look, learn and listen" and hoped for its friendship and cooperation, indicating a shift in tone by Washington under President Barack Obama. "I come here with my hands open. It will be up to the Sudanese government to determine how they want to continue with the relationship.

"The United States and Sudan want to be partners, and so we are looking for opportunities for us to build stronger bilateral relations."
