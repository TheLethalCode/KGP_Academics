 MOGADISHU, Tue Feb 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 13 people were killed and scores wounded on Tuesday in the Somali capital as Islamist rebels attacked police and African Union peacekeepers in the heaviest fighting in Mogadishu for weeks. Both sides fired heavy machine guns and artillery, witnesses said, and the insurgents unleashed volleys of mortar bombs at the hill-top Villa Somalia presidential palace. "A mother and her baby died after a shell landed on their house," resident Abdirizak Mohamed told Reuters. "Their flesh was so mangled we did not know what to carry." At least 11 other civilians were killed and workers at the city's main hospital said about 45 wounded had been admitted. "More injured people are being brought to us as the fighting is still going on," said one doctor, Dahir Dheere. More than 16,000 civilians have been killed in the two-year-old insurgency, one million people have been driven from their homes, more than a third of the population depend on aid, and large parts of Mogadishu lie empty and destroyed. The latest violence broke out after hardline Islamist group al Shabaab said they would mount more attacks on the AU troops after killing at least 11 Burundian soldiers on Sunday. Burundi buried those peacekeepers on Tuesday and declared five days of national mourning. The opposition in the small central African country has called for its soldiers to be withdrawn from harm's way in Somalia. Eritrea, which the United States has accused of funnelling weapons to Somalia's Islamists in the past, also called for the AU peace mission, AMISOM, to be pulled out. "It is imperative to get rid of any force deployed in Somalia under the pretext of 'peacekeeping mission'," Eritrea's foreign ministry said on its website, www.shabait.com. SHABAAB THREAT Asmara also criticised the new Somali government of President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, a moderate Islamist, accusing him of betraying the struggle to liberate his homeland. "Any government formed ... be it on the part of regional and international organisations or goodwill parties, can never constitute legal representation of the Somali people," it said. Al Shabaab gained support as one of many insurgent groups waging war against Ethiopian troops propping up the anarchic country's previous government. An Ethiopian withdrawal in January placated some Somalis, but al Shabaab has now turned its fire on AMISOM and the new government. Experts hope the inclusion of many moderate Islamists in the new Somali administration may marginalise hardliners like the group, which is on Washington's list of terrorist organisations and is known to have foreign fighters in its ranks. But analysts are split over al Shabaab's strength. Some say it could overrun the government, while others say it has only a few thousand fighters and has used the media and high profile strikes to project a more powerful image, despite waning support among traditionally moderate Somali Muslims. In a recording posted online on Monday, al Qaeda's second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahri urged Somalis not to fall for a "secular constitution" and said militants there would fight the "U.S.-made government"
