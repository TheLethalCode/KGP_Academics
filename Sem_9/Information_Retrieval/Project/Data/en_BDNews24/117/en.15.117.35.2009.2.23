 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed district-level and a ministerial committee to recommend withdrawal of cases lodged to settle political scores. People can apply to district magistrates by April 15 to withdraw cases filed to persecute them, the home ministry said Sunday. The state minister for law will head the ministry-level committee on which the state minister for home will sit as vice president. The committee will have the home secretary, additional home secretary, a representative from the law ministry, who is not below a joints secretary in rank, as the members and deputy secretary to the home ministry (law) as member secretary. The district-level committees will include district magistrate as the president, superintendent of police (deputy police commissioner in metropolitan cities) and public prosecutor as members and additional district magistrate as member secretary. The district magistrate will send the application to the public prosecutor in certain cases, to metropolitan public prosecutorseeking opinions on the application within seven days after he accepts it. The prosecutor then will send the application to the magistrate within 15 working days. Again, the magistrate will put the application in the district committee meeting within seven days for review. If the committee believes the application should be sent to the ministerial committee, it will have to send the recommendations, first information report and charge sheets to the home ministry in 45 working days on receipt of application. The ministerial committee will then prepare a list of cases for withdrawal after scrutiny. The law minister said Tuesday a review committee on repealing political cases was moving to cancel cases filed under previous governments to harass politicians. "If any political leaders think cases were filed to politically persecute them they can apply to special scrutiny panels for quashing the cases," Shafiq Ahmed said after the first meeting of the review committee. b
