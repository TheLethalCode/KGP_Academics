 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Representatives of 13 countries will meet in an international conference in Dhaka this week to discuss security in South Asia, which has emerged as "the epicentre of global terrorism", say the conference organisers. "Militancy and terrorism have become serious problems for Bangladesh and other South Asian nations," Maj. Gen. (retd) Muniruzzaman, president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, said at a press conference Sunday. Six South Asian countries, the USA, Canada, Germany, Norway, Spain, Australia, and Singapore will participate in the two-day event in the backdrop of Bangladesh's campaign for a regional task force to deal with terror and militancy. Foreign minister Dipu Moni will launch the conference on 'Counter terrorism strategy for South Asia' on Tuesday at the Radisson Hotel. The Mumbai terrorist attack highlighted the necessity for effective and coordinated security measures in the region, Muniruzzaman told the press conference. "This is a first-time initiative by any Bangladeshi organisation to host a major international conference on terrorism-related issues," he said. Some of the participating countries will send security specialists, he said, others will send government representatives. The South Asian countries will present 12 papers, and experts from Singapore, Spain and Norway will present three more. The topics will include militancy and terrorism in Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, Maoist insurgency in India and Nepal and activities of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen in Bangladesh, a release circulated at the press conference said. Alongside presentations, the conference will also have sideline meetings and consultations between country delegations and experts, the release said. The South Asian Regional Research Forum, a network on security and strategic issues launched by BIPSS in Dhaka last October, will also join in the conference. The proceedings will be published as a book, which will be sent to South Asian governments, the organisers said. bdnews2
