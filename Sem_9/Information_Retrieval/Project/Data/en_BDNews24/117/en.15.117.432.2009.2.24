<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has set an example that democracy and Islam can go together, said departing German MP Sebastian Edathy on Tuesday. Bangladesh has been successful in restoring democracy through proper elections, he said Tuesday before leaving Dhaka. "I think Bangladesh can be a role model  as we don't have too many countries on this planet with a majority of people with Muslim faith but also working as democracies," Edathy told reporters at Zia International Airport. "And I think Bangladesh can be one of the countries where we can say that Islam and democracy go together very well." "And we need this also as a signal for a global situation that we have for international partnership," said Edathy, head of a German MP delegation that arrived in Bangladesh on Feb 20. The delegation of the 'Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the States of South Asia of the German Bundestag' comprises members of the government coalition as well as of the opposition in a bid to renew and strengthen ties between the parliaments of Germany and Bangladesh. During their four-day stay the German MPs met prime minister Sheikh Hasina, leader of the opposition Khaelda Zia, speaker Abdul Hamid and foreign minister Dipu Moni. "We met the leader of the opposition and she told us  that her party decided to rejoin [parliament]  these are good signals," said Edathy. The German MPs also had meetings with Bangladesh parliamentarians, representatives of civil society and the Bangladesh-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They also visited Chittagong port and the Western Marine Shipyards. bdn
