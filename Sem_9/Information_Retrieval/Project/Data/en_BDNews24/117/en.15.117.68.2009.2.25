<TITLE> Holocaust-denying bishop flies back to Britain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Roman Catholic bishop who caused an international uproar by denying the scale of the Holocaust arrived back in his native Britain on Wednesday after the Argentine government ordered him out. Bishop Richard Williamson emerged with other passengers through the regular exit gate an hour after his flight from Buenos Aires touched down at London's Heathrow airport. Flanked by a group of armed police and private security guards, Williamson declined to answer questions from waiting reporters and camera crews before he was ushered out of the airport and into a waiting black car. An ultra-traditionalist who headed a seminary near Buenos Aires until earlier this month, Williamson has said he believes that no more than 300,000 Jews died in Germany's Nazi concentration camps, rather than the 6 million figure that is widely accepted. The Argentine government last week gave the bishop 10 days to leave the country or be expelled, citing irregularities in his immigration application and condemning his remarks on the Holocaust as "deeply offensive to Argentine society, the Jewish people and humanity." Argentina is home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities outside of Israel. Britain's interior ministry declined to comment on the case. Holocaust denial is not a specific offence in Britain. Pope Benedict angered Jewish leaders and many Catholics last month when he lifted excommunications on Williamson and three other traditionalists to try to heal a 20-year-old schism within the Church that began in 1988 when they were ordained without Vatican permission. The Vatican ordered Williamson to retract his comments, but the bishop responded that he needed more time to review evidence regarding the Holocaust. World Jewish organizations and German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the pope for rehabilitating Williamson, who belongs to the ultra-traditional Society of Saint Pius X. Holocaust denial is a crime in Germany and state prosecutors in the southern city of Regensburg are investigating Williamson for incitement. German neo-Nazi websites and blogs have published pieces supporting Williamson's stand.
