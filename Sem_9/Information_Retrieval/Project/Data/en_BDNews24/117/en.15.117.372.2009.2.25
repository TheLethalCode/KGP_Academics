<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Younis Khan hit 313 and Kamran Akmal chipped in with an unbeaten century to help Pakistan achieve a record total as the first test against Sri Lanka ended in a predictable draw on Wednesday. The hosts declared at a mammoth 765 for six on the fifth day before Sri Lanka finished on 144 for five, a lead of 23. Pakistan's first innings surpassed the 708 they made against England at the Oval in 1987. Home captain Younis, who was hoping to eclipse Brian Lara's record test innings of 400 when he started the day on 306 not out, added seven runs before he was bowled by a ball from paceman Dilhara Fernando that nipped back into him. Younis batted for 768 minutes and 568 balls in a marathon effort that included 27 fours and four sixes. Wicketkeeper Akmal, who had resumed on 27, compiled his sixth test century as he cracked 158 not out from 184 balls with eight fours and five sixes. Yasir Arafat (50 not out) also notched his maiden test half-century before the declaration came. Sri Lanka then slid to 45 for three in their second innings, seamer Umar Gul removing Malinda Warnapura for two and Tillekaratne Dilshan for eight while debutant Tharanga Paranavitana was run out for nine. Kumar Sangakarra steadied the ship with 65 before he was trapped lbw by leg-spinner Danish Kaneria. Sri Lanka's early troubles were a sharp contrast to the first four days when a flat track gave up 1,218 runs for the loss of 12 wickets. The second and final test in Lahore starts on Sunday.
