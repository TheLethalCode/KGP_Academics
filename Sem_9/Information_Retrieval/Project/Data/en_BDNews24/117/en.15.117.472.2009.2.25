 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University vacated two female students' halls, close to the Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters at Azimpur Wednesday. "I'm not feeling easy with over 800 students inside the dormitories," vice chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique told bdnews24.com as an armed rebellion by BDR men unfolded at their Peelkhana complex. The university authorities began shifting students of Bangladesh-Kuwait Friendship Hall and the Fazilatunnisa Mujib Hall from around 5:45pm. "We were forced to break the rear boundary wall of Fazilatunnisa Hall, to make a safe path for students of both the halls to come out," said the VC. He said the students were being shifted to two other women's halls and the Teacher-Student Centre. The decision came from a meeting of the university's provost committee, chaired by the VC. Earlier in the day, authorities also vacated the Institute of Social Welfare, also close to the BDR HQ where gunfire broke out from around 9.30am and continued through the day. bdnews
