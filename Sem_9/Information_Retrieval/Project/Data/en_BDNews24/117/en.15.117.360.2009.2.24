 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com) BNP-led opposition MPs with drew three motions for disapproval on Tuesday. It marked the first time that the opposition has withdrawn such motions in parliament. The MPs, who have opposed ratification of all ordinances made by the interim government, withdrew a motion of disapproval against a law on the president's privileges. The opposition MPs also withdrew disapproval motions on The Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 and The Income Tax (Second Amendment) Ordinance 2008. The 26 MPs of the BNP-led opposition had earlier submitted notices for disapproval on the President's (Remuneration and Privileges) (Amendment) Ordinance, 2007 and the two income tax ordinances. Speaker Abdul Hamid gave floor to Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury to speak against the ordinance. But the senior BNP MP said, "We withdraw the disapproval motions as a constitutionally elected president has taken over now." "We submitted the motions as we had an unconstitutional president who had violated the constitution." The BNP accuses former president Iajuddin Ahmed of breaching the constitution. Zillur Rahman has now replaced him, after being elected earlier in the month. The attending MPs applauded Chowdhury's speech. But Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian asked whether all the BNP MPs have withdrawn the disapproval motions. The speaker said, "Since none of the opposition MPs had objected to Chowdhury's statement, I think all of the disapproval motions have been withdrawn". "Can't we change the culture of verbal salvo?" asked speaker Hamid amid table-thumbing by all MPs. bdnews24.com/
