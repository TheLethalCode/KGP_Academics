<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government Sunday decided to start open-market sale of essentials only for lowly-paid garment workers and tea-garden labourers from March, the food minister said. "Through open-market sale, a labourer will get 20 kg of rice a month at Tk 18 a kg," Abdur Razzak said and added the decision came from a meeting of the food planning committee. He said the sale will start from the middle of next month after talks with factory and tea- garden owner. The move aims to provide food security to the people in the low-income bracket, Razzak said. The minister said 10 lakh metric tonnes of wheat were produced in the country this year but the government will not buy wheat from the local market because of the high price. Against a production cost of Tk 23, the buying price should be Tk 26, the minister said, explaining the government's unwillingness to buy wheat. On the production of Aman, Razzak said, "Aman production has been encouraging and the government has achieved the target of collecting 150000 metric tonnes of rice." However, he said, the target of collecting 75000 metric tonnes of paddy remained unmet due to lack of warehouses. The minister also said with the onset of the Boro season and with 1268000 metric tonnes of foodgrain in the market, efforts were underway to release old rice in the market to empty the warehouses. "The main reason for food deficit in our country is a lack of statistics," said the minister and added that from now, the Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Agriculture will work together to determine the food demand. "If [the demand is determined] we will not have food deficit." b
