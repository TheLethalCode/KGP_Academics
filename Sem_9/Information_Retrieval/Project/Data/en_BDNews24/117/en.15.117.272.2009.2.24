 By Shilpa Jamkhandikar MUMBAI, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A ragtag group of Indian orphans triumphed at the Academy Awards on Sunday as "Slumdog Millionaire" took top honors with an against-all-odds love story that resonated with recession-weary moviegoers. The small-budget British film -- an often dark but ultimately hopeful tale about a poor Indian boy who competes for love and money on a TV game show -- was named best picture as widely predicted and won seven other Oscars. At the climax of the night, the stage was swarmed by jubilant members of the "Slumdog" cast and crew, including several school children who were plucked from Mumbai's shantytowns to appear in the movie. Bollywood met Hollywood for real as the kids clapped, cheered and danced on stage like their favourite Indian film stars. 'JAI HO!' Back in Mumbai, "Jai ho!" (Victory!) rang through the congested by-lanes of Garibnagar, the colony where "Slumdog" child actors Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail live. "I'm so happy that my daughter has won this award and I could see her on stage with such big stars," said Muni Qureshi, mother of 8-year-old Rubina, who played the leading lady, Latika, as a young child. Ali and the rest of her family live in a tiny, ramshackle home with no running water. Friends and relatives packed into the one-room house, which is already crowded by a bed and a cupboard, to watch the ceremony on the family's only visible sign of wealth -- a large flat-screen television. Nearby, neighbours also gathered outside the makeshift home of Azharuddin, who played the young Salim in the film. His shack is covered only in tarpaulin, and a small television was placed on a stool in the street for people to watch the awards. "The fact that a poor man's child has made such a name for himself, that's what makes me most happy," his father Mohammed Ismail said. But "Slumdog Millionaire" has generated controversy in India, where some people find its name, and depiction of poverty, insulting. Rubina's mother Qureshi, however, defended the film, saying it gave her daughter a chance to go on the trip of a lifetime. "I know that this film has been criticised for showcasing poverty. But it has also meant that a girl from the slums of Mumbai who could not even imagine that she would go abroad has reached the Oscars, so how can that be bad?" she said. The crowds celebrated in earnest after the film was named best picture, a rags-to-riches triumph for a movie that almost wasn't released. But one local resident was sceptical about the celebrations. "All this hype is good for Bollywood. I don't think it is justified for people like us who have to work hard just to make ends meet," said Tahir Khan. "I don't know whether it is of any use for us." Other slum dwellers feared the awards would make the film's child stars unapproachable. "I know that she has achieved a lot and she has gone to the Oscars, but I think she has become a big girl now," said eight-year-old Muskaan, who is Rubina's friend and neighbour. "I don't think she will play with me when she comes back."
