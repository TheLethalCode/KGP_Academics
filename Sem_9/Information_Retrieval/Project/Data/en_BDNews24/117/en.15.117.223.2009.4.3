<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)The status of the Public Service Commission chairman and members has been recommended to be upgraded to that of the Supreme Court judges. A report of the PSC for 2008 presented Wednesday recommended the elevation. Nurunnabi, a PSC member, said despite being a constitution-approved institution and despite the fact that it performs a number of most important government functions, the PSC has been kept low. "As the PSC needs to be strengthened and its public status raised, we have incorporated recommendations to that effect in the annual report." The PSC's effectiveness, neutrality and transparency will be enhanced once its vanguards are accorded appropriate status and benefits, the report says. The warrant of precedence entails the PSC chairman enjoy the rank and status of a secretary and places its members just below an additional secretary. Since the incumbent PSC chief, Dr Sa'dat Hussain, was a retired cabinet secretary when he accepted the chair, the rank and status of the PSC chair has been raised to that of a cabinet secretary, the report contends. A number of the serving PSC members held higher rank and position prior to retirement, the report adds. The commission has eight members, namely Mahmudur Rahman, Muhammad Ashraf, Md Nurunnabi, Suraiya Begum, Mirza Shamsuzzaman, AYM Mosharraf Hossain, Abidur Reza Khan and Ehsan Shamim. b
