 ANKARA, Thu Apr 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan and Afghanistan pledged closer cooperation in the fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants during a summit hosted by NATO member Turkey on Wednesday. Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of not doing enough to stop militants crossing the border to carry out attacks, but ties have improved under Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, whose country is facing a growing Islamist insurgency.

Obama has unveiled a new strategy which will combine extra troops, funds for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and a renewed focus on targeting al Qaeda militants on the Afghan/Pakistan border. More than 70,000 US and NATO troops are in Afghanistan battling a growing insurgency by the Taliban movement, which is also spreading its influence in Pakistan through the porous mountain border between the two countries. World officials met in The Hague on Tuesday for a UN-backed conference on Afghanistan at which Washington appealed for international support to defeat militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In a reminder of the violence plaguing Afghanistan, which has reached its bloodiest level since the Taliban's removal in a US-led invasion in 2001, a group of suicide bombers raided a provincial council building in Afghanistan's southern city of Kandahar on Wednesday and killed 11 pe
