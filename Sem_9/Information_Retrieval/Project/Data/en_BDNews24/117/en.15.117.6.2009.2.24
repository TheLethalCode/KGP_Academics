 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP-led opposition staged two walkouts from parliament, alleging violation of the Constitution and parliamentary rules of procedure in passing bills on Tuesday. They said the government was trying to pass ordinances that had 'lapsed'. The prime minister told the House after the walkouts: "These ordinances are being tabled via cabinet approval as bills. And then if parliament gives the nod, they will be passed." "There is no reason for concern," Sheikh Hasina told the House. "The laws have not lapsed as the bills have retroactive effect," she said after opposition MPs led by BNP staged two walk outs. The House went on to pass 10 bills. Walk Outs The opposition MPs walked of the House just before Maghrib prayers as the speaker suspended a rule of procedure. They returned at 7.00 pm after Maghrib recess, only to walk out again an hour later as the speaker upheld his decision on suspending a rule that gave MPs three days to submit notices on bills for adoption by the House. Ruling party MPs Suranjit Sengupta, among others, had argued with BNP's Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury who termed the speaker's decision "against rules of procedure". The debate went on for more than two hours. The opposition MPs did not return to the House after the second walkout. BNP's MK Anwar brought up the caretaker government's ordinances before the first walkout. He said the government was trying to pass ordinances that "expired" on Tuesday. "According to the Constitution, 122 ordinances placed on Jan 25 should have been passed within 30 days after their first placement in parliament. The ordinances not passed had expired "at 3.00pm today," he said. "There is no mechanism in the Constitution to resuscitate them," Anwar told reporters after walking out of the House. Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta countered the claim. "As a special parliamentary committee has recommended the passage of 54 ordinances placed its report to the House, the ordinances have not expired," Suranjit told bdnews24.com. "There is no violation of the Constitution," he said. SQ Chowdhury and MK Anwar also objected to the suspension of a rule of procedure without a prior proposal in the House. Suranjit replied, however, "Any speaker in any country has the authority to suspend a rule." He also said MPs could not walk out protesting the speaker's ruling. bdnews24.c
