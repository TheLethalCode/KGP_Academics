 By Bernd Debusmann Washington Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shock! Horror! The United States is becoming more like Europe! The rugged individualism that makes up part of the country's self-image may be doomed. Paternalism threatens to throttle enterprise and initiative. That has been the reaction of Republican leaders to the $787 billion stimulus package President Barack Obama signed this week after a contentious debate that echoed arguments made more than 80 years ago on the eve of the Great Depression. "We were challenged with the choice of the American system of rugged individualism or the choice of a European system of diametrically opposed doctrines - doctrines of paternalism and state socialism," Herbert Hoover said in his closing campaign speech for the 1928 presidential elections he won comfortably. The European ideas, he said, undermined the initiative and enterprise that propelled Americans to "unparalleled greatness." Fast forward to February 2009 and listen to an updated version of conservative philosophy, expressed by Mitch McConnell, the Senate's minority leader: "This (stimulus package) paints a picture of the Europeanization of America  and if we take all these measures, we will have made a dramatic move in the direction of turning America into Western Europe." Why is this such a dreadful prospect? After all, the United States does not fare particularly well on international comparisons of quality of life. It ranks 15th on the United Nation's annual Human Development Index which measures such things as life expectancy and standard of living. A similar index compiled a few years ago by the Economist Intelligence Unit and using different factors put the United States in 13th place. In both surveys, some of the European countries routinely derided as "nanny states" by conservative ideologues scored comfortably ahead of the United States. Still, conservative talk show hosts dubbed the stimulus bill the European Socialist Act of 2009 - not meant as a compliment  and Newsweek magazine followed up the theme with a cover that carried the headline We Are All Socialists Now and noted inside that "Barack Obama sounds more like the president of France every day." It warned that slow economic growth in the United States, which has historically grown faster than Europe, "could kill rugged American individualism." Which begs the question to what extent rugged individualism can flourish in a deep recession. IN RECESSION, SAFETY NETS LOOK GOOD In January alone, almost 600,000 Americans lost their jobs, the biggest monthly drop in 34 years. Over the past year, job cuts totaled 3.6 million. This year alone, 2.4 million people are expected to lose their homes, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group which tracks foreclosures. In the next four years, that figure is estimated to climb to 8 million. More than 44 million Americans lack health insurance, the highest number in any industrialized country, and another 38 million are under-insured. In these bleak surroundings, European-style social safety nets look attractive even to rugged individualists, particularly those affected by the downturn. Even before the present crisis, polls showed growing support for government programs to help those in need. A 2007 Pew survey, for example, showed 69 percent supporting the notion that government should take care of people who can't care for themselves. Unfettered capitalism this is not. In the Internet debate prompted by Republican warnings of the impending Europeanization of America, one commentator asked: "Does this mean that the half million Americans losing their jobs each month can count on having health care, public transportation, quality education and a public safety net?" That depends on whether and how fast the stimulus package takes effect and allows Obama to translate promises into actions. Health care reform is high on his list, as are plans to overhaul America's creaking transportation infrastructure, make college education more affordable, and provide a safety net for the poor and the unemployed. Call it Europeanization or a 21st century version of the 1930s New Deal designed to end the Great Depression (economists still argue over whether it did or not), it is a sharp turn from the conservative philosophy that government is the problem and can't be the solution. That was the basic plank of the "Reagan revolution" of small government, low taxes, de-regulation and a belief that the markets know best. Numbers confirm that the United States is coming closer to Europe: In the late 1990s, U.S. government spending amounted to around 34 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 48 percent in Europe, according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By next year, stimulus spending is expected to bring the U.S. figure to around 40 percent and 47 percent in Europe. The gap is shrinking. But in comparisons between America and Europe in an age of economic crisis, one element is conspicuously absent: social unrest. Greece, France, Bulgaria and Iceland have been shaken by riots, mass protests and strikes. No sign of that in the United States - yet. Are rugged individualists less prone to protests and riots? Or is it just a matter of time?  Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist. The opinio
