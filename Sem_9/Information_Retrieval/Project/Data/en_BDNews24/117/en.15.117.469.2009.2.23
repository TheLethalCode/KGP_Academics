 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  A city hospital was mobbed and ransacked Monday by relatives and neighbours of a patient, who they alleged died without treatment. The five-storied Padma General Hospital, on Sonargaon Road near Kathal Bagan, came under attack by nearly 100 people, who wrecked two floors of the hospital and an ambulance, police said. Fifty year-old Abdul Haq, a resident of Itbhanga slum, was admitted to the hospital Sunday at about 7:30pm and died early Monday, said Dhanmondi Police Station acting officer-in-charge Mohsinul Haq. Haq told bdnews24.com the relatives of the dead alleged that he had died of negligence and the hospital authorities offered them "compensation". "We did not accept," said Haq's wife Firoza Begum. "My husband was admitted with stomach pain and placed under the supervision of surgeon Abu Ahmed Ashraf Ali. He was given some medicines, but his condition deteriorated through the night," she said. Firoza said the supervising surgeon was not available at the time. "He died at about 3:30am." "The hospital authorities offered compensation after we filed the allegation of negligence," she added. Hospital accountant Mofizuddin denied the allegation. "We offered compensation because the family was poor." Police officer Haq said the hospital had filed a case. bdn
