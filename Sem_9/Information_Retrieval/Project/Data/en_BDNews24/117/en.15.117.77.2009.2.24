<TITLE> BNS to host 2011 WC opening ceremony: state minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangabandhu National Stadium will play host to the opening ceremony of the 2011 ICC World Cup on Feb. 19, the state minister for sports said Tuesday. Considering the cost, the opening match of the biggest cricket extravaganza may be held at the Mirpur Stadium, Ahad Ali Sarker hinted. Sarkar also put to rest the raging debate over whether the opening match should be held at the BNS or Mirpur Stadium. "I've talked to the prime minister and we want to hold the opening ceremony at the Bangabandhu Stadium". The ICC on Feb. 17 decided to stage both the inaugural match and the opening ceremony in Dhaka, as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will co-host the tournament. With the ICC's insistence on holding the opening match and the ceremony at the same venue on the same day, staging the opening match at the BNS appears problematic, as it is meant exclusively for football events. "Look, there will be some problems if you want to play a cricket match on a football ground," the state minister said. "You need to change turf, which costs a lot." Bangladesh Cricket Board senior vice president Mahbub Anam earlier said they had proposed to the ICC to stage the opening match a day after the opening ceremony. If the ICC agrees, the opening ceremony and the opening match can be held at two venues on two consecutive days, Anam said. The BNS was allotted by the then BNP-led government to football in early 2005 and cricket was shifted to Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, leading many to think that the cricket was just shifted due to political reasons. Reacting to the minister's decision, Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin said, "If the minister wants to host the opening ceremony at the BNS, it will happen and there will be no football." The BFF boss said he was aware of the remark after watching television, but no proper authority informed him about the decision. "I learned about it from television and I have not been informed about the decision. I think no one thought it necessary to tell me." He, however, said that the decision taken by the minister was one-sided. BFF vice-president Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir said that the BFF president was very concerned. BFF member Anwarul Haq Helal said, "It is fine that the opening ceremony of the ICC World Cup will be played at the BNS, but the question is how many days will the venue remain cricket's." bdnews24.com/sb
