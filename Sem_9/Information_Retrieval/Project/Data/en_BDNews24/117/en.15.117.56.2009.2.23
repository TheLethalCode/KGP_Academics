 KATHMANDU, Mon Feb 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's prime minister attended an army parade on Monday in what analysts said could be a sign of growing confidence between the army and former rebel fighters, whose rehabilitation is crucial for lasting peace. Prime Minister Prachanda, a former rebel leader, watched a helicopter flypast in the capital Kathmandu from a rostrum once used by Nepal's monarchy. The monarchy was overthrown under a peace deal between the government and the Maoists, ending a decade-long rebellion in which more than 13,000 people were killed. The Maoists ended their revolt under a 2006 peace pact and surprisingly won last year's election for a special assembly. The current defence minister is a former Maoist rebel commander but the rehabilitation of former rebel fighters is seen as the key to meaningful peace in the Himalayan nation. Their integration into the regular army is being resisted by powerful generals. Analysts said Monday's event showed tensions between the army, once seen as loyal to the monarchy, and the rebels could be thawing. "I see this as a measure to rebuild the broken confidence of the Maoists in the army," said Bishnu Raj Upreti, who teaches conflict management at Kathmandu University's Human and Natural Resources Study Centre. "If he had not attended the Army Day function, there would be a negative message to the public that the prime minister is not giving importance to the national army." More than 19,000 fighters are now housed in UN-monitored camps and their weapons locked away in dozens of well-guarded steel containers across Nepal. The army has opposed taking in "indoctrinated" ex-Maoist fighters as some Maoist leaders want. Ties with top military generals could be strained if the Maoists push too hard. The Maoists in turn have criticised recent recruitments by the army, saying they went against the peace deal, but the army insists the landmark pact does not bar filling old vacancies
