<TITLE> US Muslim leaders irked over 'FBI tactics' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Arshad Mahmud Washington, March 29 (bdnews24.com)Prominent Muslim leaders in the US have publicly condemned the Federal Bureau of Investigation for what they regard as the Bureau's inappropriate infiltration of mosques. They also threatened to cut off contact with the FBI, saying in a statement that "these McCarthy-era tactics are detrimental to a free society". "We are not being treated equally and fairly as citizens of this country," said Agha Saeed, chairman of the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, an umbrella group leading the protest. But leaders of some of the nation's largest American Muslim organisations that are not part of the group say they disagree with a policy of 'cutting off contact'. They say that severing ties with the federal enforcement agency tasked with hunting down homegrown terrorists could make it more difficult to track suspects and would increase public suspicion of the Muslim community. "Disengagement does not enable mutual understanding. It does the exact opposite," said Aakif Ahmad, a leader of two American Muslim groups. "Emotive terms like 'McCarthy-era tactics' undermine the hard work on the part of many people seeking to find common ground." Since 9/11, the FBI has had extensive relationships with a number of American Muslim organisations and mosques. Muslim community groups meet monthly with federal agents and also get together more informally. But now, the umbrella body says it may halt that. It is aiming its ire at the FBI over two issues: the decision last fall by the FBI to cut off contact with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, one of the nation's largest American Muslim advocacy groups; and allegations that the FBI is sending informants into mosques to entrap members into making violent statements against the United States. CAIR director Ibrahim Hooper said the group used to organise town hall meetings between the FBI and Muslims and offer diversity-training workshops for agents. Some media reports, however, say the FBI cut off contact with CAIR because it was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the terrorist funding trial of the Holy Land Foundation, once the largest Muslim charity in the United States. The charity and some of its leaders were convicted in 2008 of illegally funneling money to the Palestinian group Hamas. Hooper said the designation was an attempt by the Bush administration to smear CAIR, along with 300 other groups and individuals who were also named as unindicted co-conspirators. According to Saeed, Muslim leaders are also upset over what they allege is the FBI's increasing practice of sending informants into mosques to seek out younger members and entice them into making incendiary anti-US comments. The FBI, however, refuted the allegations. "The FBI does not investigate mosques, we investigate people, and we do that based on predicates that are defined by law and FBI guidelines," a spokesman said. The Islamic Society of North America, a large umbrella group of American mosques, said in a statement that it has met with the FBI and urged it to open an investigation into the infiltration of the mosques. However, it said, it does not condone ending contact with the FBI. And Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, also said his organisation would not suspend talks with the FBI. "We think we need to intensify our dialogue on these very important issues that would advocate for the community's interests and, we believe, would help strengthen America's mechanisms for protecting our country," he said
