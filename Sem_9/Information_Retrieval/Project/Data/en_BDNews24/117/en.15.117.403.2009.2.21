 Sumon K Chakrabarti writes exclusively for bdnews24.com New Delhi, Feb 21(bdnews24.com)  The speaker of the Indian parliament, Somnath Chatterjee, will address the newly-elected MPs of Bangladesh on how to conduct business in parliament. Chatterjee, the first Bengali to become the speaker of the Lok Sabha in New Delhi, is on a two-day visit at the invitation of his Bangladesh counterpart Abdul Hamid. Speaker Hamid invited Chatterjee to share his "perspectives with members of the Jatiyo Sangsad drawing on your long experience as a Member of Parliament, as the Speaker of Lok Sabha and as the former President of the Commonwealth Parliament Association". A stickler for observance of rules in the House, Chatterjee would be addressing, in Bengali, the inaugural session of an orientation programme for the new MPs. "I will mostly concentrate on explaining how the parliament should function properly and how lawmakers should behave inside the house," Chatterjee told bdnews24.com in New Delhi, before leaving for Dhaka. "I will tell them about the importance of parliamentary democracy and how it's a cornerstone of any functional democracy. "I will also narrate my experiences to the members of the new Bangladesh Parliament," Chatterjee added. He will also meet president Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina separately. Chatterjee, who was elected an MP from the Shantiketan area, where Rabindranath Tagore had set up his famous university, was at the heart of a raging controversy last week after he rebuked protesting MPs inside the Lok Sabha. He told them that people will not vote them back in elections. A day later, he had apologised to the MPs.
