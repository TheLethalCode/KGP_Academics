 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Prices will come down with introduction of the consumer rights protedction law, said commerce minister Faruk Khan on Tuesday. He said it was not possible to force down the price of essentials in a free market economy. "However, prices will fall once the Consumer Rights Act is introduced," he said after a meeting with Thai ambassador. "Steps will be taken against unscrupulous and dishonest businessmen under the act," said Khan. If any businessman is found guilty of inflating prices, or selling adulterated foods, punitive measures will include prison sentences ranging from one to 3 years and fines ranging from Tk 1 lakh to Tk 5 lakh under the new law, he said. The act has been given approval by the cabinet and will be raised in parliament soon, said Khan. The minister said the government was trying to create a climate to preserve the interests of both consumers and the business community. On monitoring market prices, the minister said there was no fear of a price crisis. Prices were falling, he said, due to cooperation between the government and businessmen. "They are bringing prices down because their confidence in us is rising." "Talks between the businessmen and the prime minister have already led to the price of edible oil coming down by Tk 5," said Khan. He said compared to the last seven years, prices were at a comparatively tolerable level. Referring to labour unrest in the ports, he said, "Labourers won't have to extract rights through movements; rights for them will be ensured through talks." The minister said trade unions would remain intact. The work of a trade union is to ensure the benefit of both the factory and its workers, he added. The commerce minister said a committee had been formed to modernise the Trade Corporation of Bangladesh. "There is a plan to turn TCB into a company through joint private and public ownership," he said. "A decision in this regard will be taken based on the committee's report." Khan said his talks with the Thai envoy included boosting bilateral trade. "A Thai trade fair will be held in Dhaka on March 11 and we have been invited to take part in a trade fair in Thailand in June," he said. Khan said efforts were on to increase Bangladeshi exports to Thailand. bdnew
