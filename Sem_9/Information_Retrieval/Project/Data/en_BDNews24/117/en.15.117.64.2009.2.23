One-down Hannan Sarkar was trapped leg before by Asif Ahmed for 22, leaving the side at 77-3 in 21.3 overs. However, Rajin Saleh and Anisur Rahman averted any further damage, contributing 68 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket stand. Rajin's 50 off 85 balls was studded with six fours while Anisur was 25 not out.
