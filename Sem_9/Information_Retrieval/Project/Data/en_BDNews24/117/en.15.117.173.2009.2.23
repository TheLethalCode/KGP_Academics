 CAIRO,Mon Feb 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police have detained at least five people for questioning about the bomb which killed a French teenager and wounded at least 21 other people near a popular tourist bazaar in Cairo on Sunday, police sources said. The detainees, all Egyptians, include two women who were wearing full face veils, they said. All five were in the area on Sunday evening around the time of the explosion and were taken into custody overnight, they added. The sources did not say if the police had any hard evidence against the detainees. After security incidents, Egyptian police usually cast their net very wide and then release most of the people they question. The bomb, planted under a bench near the Khan el-Khalili market in mediaeval Cairo, was the first such attack on tourists in the city since April 2005 and the first in Egypt since an April 2006 bombing in the Sinai resort of Dahab. The injured included 13 French tourists, three Saudis, one German and four Egyptians. No one has claimed responsibility and analysts said the bomb was probably the work of a small group of disgruntled Egyptians, similar to the one that carried out two operations in 2005. The incident could damage the Egyptian tourist industry, which accounts for about 7 percent of gross domestic product, but previous bombings had only a short-term impact. But at the Egyptian Museum in downtown Cairo, on the banks of the Nile about 2 miles from Khan el-Khalili, the usual crowds poured in to see antiquities including the treasures found in the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamen. An Australian tourist who gave her name as Rowena said the incident did not bother her. "There's 20 million in Cairo, so it's a long way from us," she said. Vassili Tawadros, who runs the Ding Dong bazaar near the museum, said: "We work our whole business with tourists. These things happen and it's very bad for our business and for Egypt." But CI Capital Research said in a report: "As the tourism industry becomes more resilient and the notion of terrorism more widely accepted as a global phenomenon ... the impact of political instabilities has started to lessen and to have a shorter time-span." Police stepped up security at tourist locations and around embassies. At the checkpoints leading towards the US embassy they stopped pedestrians and asked what they were doing
