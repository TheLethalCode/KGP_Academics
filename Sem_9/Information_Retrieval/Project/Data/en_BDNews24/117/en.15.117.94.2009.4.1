 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  Low turnout marked the by-elections to six parliamentary constituencies that began at around 8am and will run through to 4pm Thursday. The constituencies, vacated by MPs who won more than one seat in the Dec. 29 general elections, are being held in Bogra-6 and -7, Kishorganj-6, Kurigram-2, Rangpur-3 and -6. President Zillur Rahman vacated Kishoreganj-6, while prime minister Sheikh Hasina Rangpur-6, Jatiya Party chairman Rangpur-3 and Kurigram-2 and opposition leader Khaleda Zia Bogra-6 and 7. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Wednesday there was no scope of vote rigging. "I don't see any sign of possible rigging in the elections, there is no such scope," he said. "We're determined to make the elections free and fair," he told reporters after visiting five constituencies. The elections chief predicted a low turnout compared to the Dec 29 general election. "Voters may be a bit reluctant to go to polling stations, as this is the third occasion after parliamentary and Upazila elections, within a relatively short period," he said. "Besides, farmers are busy with irrigation," said Huda. He again asked ministers and MPs not to visit election areas. The Election Commission is conducting the by-elections with its own officials, a first for any parliamentary election in Bangladesh. bd
