<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister's call on BNP chief Khaleda Zia to leave the allotted house at Dhaka cantonment "irresponsible", a party colleague has said "The allotted house mingled with the memory of [slain president] Ziaur Rahman has occupied a unique position in the heart of the armed forces. No such comment of the government will prove popular with the army," Salauddin Quader Chowdhury said Thursday. "The prime minister's proposal of distributing the allotted land for Zia family among the family members of the slain BDR officials is very shocking . "She should have considered the possible reaction among the armed forces," he told reporters after attending a roundtable on 'Peelkhana tragedy, militancy and Bangladesh' at the Press Club. He was critical of the frequent extension of the government installed probe body's deadline for report submission. Discovering militants' involvement in BDR mutiny would do nothing but complicate the investigation process further, he observed. To unveil the mystery, the conspiracy over the last two years should be brought to light. He also questioned why those who held talks with the mutineers are not being quizzed. Chowdhury expressed doubts over the restoration of peace and stability as 'an anomalous government has been installed in a volatile situation.' Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad also Khaleda to vacate the 6 Shaheed Mainul Rod house. "I think she (Khaleda) should leave the house for the sake of democracy," he told reporters in Rangpur. "It is not right to run political activities in the cantonment. The cantonment is a restricted area. Sabotage can be carried out if different kinds of people roam the place," the former president said. Hasina told parliament Wednesday no MP, no leader of the opposition should live in the cantonment. "The cabinet will decide whether to cancel this allotted house. I alone cannot decide," she said.
