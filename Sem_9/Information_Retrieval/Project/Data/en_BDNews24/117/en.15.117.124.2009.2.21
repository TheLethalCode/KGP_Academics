 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)Germany's Deutsche Welle will soon switch to FM in its pursuit of a bigger Bangladesh market share as short wave broadcast increasingly becomes a thing of the past. "The number of short wave listener is falling," Grahame Lucas, who leads the South Asia team at Deutsche Welle Radio, told bdnews24.com Friday. bdnews24.com and DW Radio last year joined forces to deliver real-time news to a wider segment of readers both at home and abroad. Speaking to bdnews24.com journalists at its Dhanmondi newsroom, Lucas said the South Asian region has always been an important market for the German international broadcaster. "We always had a focus on the region." DW is thinking about putting a new concept into place, marketing it and finding the right partners. It plans to share websites with people in "two to three years", and make sure when the short waves disappear "we are still an important force in the media here in this country", Lucas said. "Right now our main focus is on Dhaka. If we are able to put our programme on FM, then it would be available to our audience nationwide," he said, in response to a query. "We can say we could stop thinking of our transition from shortwave to FM within two to three years." Lucas referred to the emergence of "the internet and new technology and mobile telephony" as he spelled out his new plans for a market getting more and more competitive by the day. Lucas foresees the transition in next five to 10 years, with internet becoming the key platform for radio and television content. He said Deutsche Welle Radio boasted huge numbers of Bangladeshi audience. "Last year, we had 110,000 emails and SMSs from Bangladesh, which is a new record." Rural Bangladesh remained the DW stronghold, according to Lucas. Lucas said his team was working to bring changes to content, focusing more on "exclusive, reaction and international stories" rather than daily events. The reason, he said, was a much transformed Bangladeshi media, with 24/7 content. This change will be due to real-time update of events by Bangladeshi media "like bdnews24.com", Lucas said and added the audience would not be interested to listen to news of an event they know of. The German journalist praised the "breaking news" of bdnews24.com and news updates on mobile phones. "Every day before I start work, I see bdnews24.com website." bd
