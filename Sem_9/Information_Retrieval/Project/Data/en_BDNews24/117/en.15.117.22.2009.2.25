<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com) - Two more cases have been filed against former information secretary ATM Fazlul Karim, who lost his job on Monday, on charges of sedition and hurting religious sentiment through his controversial poem. Lawyer Omar Faruq and Awami Bastuhara League member CM Alam filed the cases with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Omar Faruq said the poem 'Bagane Fute Ase Osongkho Golap' by Abu Karim (Fazlul Karim's pen name) obscenely termed the Bangla language as "Bokhara" and Bangladesh as "Bokhari". His statement to the court said the book also corrupted the name of the country's independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as Latifur Rahman. The verse was also derogatory to Sheikh Mujib's three sons, naming Sheikh Kamal as "Kamalakali", Sheikh Jamal as "Jamtali" and Sheikh Russel as "Rasokali", the statement said. "Through such acts Abu Karim has humiliated the people and the sacrifice of country's 30 lakh martyrs in the liberation war," Faruq's statement said. He said a verse of the poem termed Islam as "Chil Dharma (hawk religion)" and named India as "Kaksthan (crow land)", which hurt religious sentiment. The case filed by CS Alam, on similar complaints, accused Karim of "sedition". Sacked Karim lost his job Monday, a day after he was sued for allegedly defaming Sheikh Mujib through his poetry. A government announcement on Monday afternoon said Karim would go into retirement immediately. The civil servant, who was given the crucial information ministry posting on Jan 19, was sued by the Awami Ulema League Central Committee president Mohammad Ilyas Hossain bin Helali on Sunday. The government gave no reason for his dismissal, but invoked a rule that gave the authorities unlimited powers to terminate civil servants on completion of 25 years in service. The announcement just said he was being retired since he had 'completed 25 years of service' and "since the government considers it necessary to retire him in the public interest". A newspaper had earlier published excerpts from his allegorical piece in which he allegedly depicted the leader of Bangladesh's independence war and his three sons in a manner deemed defamatory by the religious wing of the ruling Awami League. Uproar The poem has since caused an uproar among certain quarters, and youth activists of the ruling party have warned of dire consequences if no action is taken against the civil servant. The publisher of the book has already closed its outlet at the annual Ekushey Book Fair on the Bangla Academy premises in Dhaka. The prime minister's adviser Alauddin Ahmed said "although his stance is a different one", Karim could appeal to the government for a rethink of his retirement order. Ahmed also chairs a review committee formed to reconsider the issues of "promotion-deprived and forcibly-retired" officers during the BNP-led alliance government. After attending a meeting of the review committee at the Secretariat, he said, "Incidents like [Karim's] have been rare and the first since the government took office." bdnews
