 KARACHI, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan selectors called up pace bowler Nuwan Kulasekara on Monday to replace the injured Farveez Maharoof in the test squad in Pakistan. Sri Lankan coach Trevor Bayliss said Kulasekara would join the team before the second test in Lahore from March 1. All-rounder Maharoof returned home on Sunday after sustaining a groin injury during training. Doctors have advised him to rest for four to six weeks. Kulasekara, a regular member of the Sri Lankan one-day team, has played six tests and 52 one-day internationals. His most recent test appearance was against India at home in August last year.
