 MILAN, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson was confident his side would progress despite being disappointed not to have grabbed an away goal in Tuesday's 0-0 Champions League draw at Inter Milan. The holders had several chances in the last 16 first-leg match at the San Siro, making Serie A leaders Inter look very ordinary in the first half.

"Obviously the team that plays the second leg at home is happy. But for us it is an important result. We have to score as soon as possible (at Old Trafford). That is the target." Mourinho exited the dugout at the end without greeting Ferguson, but the Inter coach said it was not a snub and he had left an expensive bottle of wine at Ferguson's hotel.
