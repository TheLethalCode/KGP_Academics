 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com) Landlords who will rent out accommodation to people linked to militants or militancy will be tried on charges of abetting militancy, the law minister said Tuesday. "Providing either assistance to the militantsbe it accommodation or moneyare wrongdoings of similar gravity. The house owner is responsible for what his/her tenants should be doing at their places," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters Tuesday. "The landlord will have to stand trial in case there occurs any untoward incident, irrespective of any lease agreement or the absence of it," he said, replying to a query related to the Anti-terrorism Act 2009. "The government wants law and order and peace restored to society. The government will frame any harsh or stringent laws to curb crimes and maintain order in society," the minister said. The new law provides for a maximum punishment of death penalty for a militant convict and minimum two years in prison and fine, he said. On what measures are there for foreign patrons of militants, the minister said the government was yet to decide those. The minister said the Representation of the People Ordinance would be passed as law to ensure expatriates' voting rights. The provision of "NO" vote will be scrapped, he said adding, "There is no provision of NO vote in any democratic country." If any voter does not like any candidates, they can stay away from voting, which will mean NO vote, he explained. bdnews24
