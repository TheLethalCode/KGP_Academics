<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the government to explain why BTTB's conversion to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited was not illegal. The court also demanded an explanation from the government on why transfer of BTTB employees to BTCL and dissolution of the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board should not be declared to be without lawful authority and without legal effect respectively. A High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossen and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui passed the order on a writ petition filed by Giasuddin Ahmed, former director of BTTB, and 312 other officers. Law secretary, Post and Telecommunication secretary, Establishment secretary, Bangladesh Public Service Commission, BTTB and BTCL were asked to reply to the order within four weeks. Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud moved the petition, while Barrister Mustafizur Rahman Khan and Barrister Zakir Hossain Bhuiyan assisted. Rokanuddin submitted that the BTTB (Amendment) Ordinance 2008 allowed transfer of the service of the petitioners. Their service was transferred by a government notification of July 1, last year. The lawyer submitted that the petitioners are public servants. "They have the right to be treated in accordance with law. But by transferring their service to a company, their fundamental rights have been curtailed," he argued. Rokanuddin further submitted that the petitioners were appointed to the cadre service recruited by Public Service Commission. "They had a chance of being appointed secretary of the concerned ministry. Transferring their service to BTCL was discriminatory." Deputy attorney general Rajik Al Jalil was present during the hearing.
