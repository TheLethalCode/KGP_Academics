 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Parliament passed Monday six lawsfour on budget, two new ones on Election Commission and electoral rollsignoring reservations of the opposition. Finance minister AMA Muhith tabled the Tk 9407.87 crore supplementary budget for the fiscal year 2006-2007, Tk 79614 crore national budget and Tk 35838 crore supplementary budget for FY 2007-2008, and Tk 99962 crore budget for FY 2008-2009. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed put Election Commission Secretariat Bill, 2009 and Electoral Rolls Bill, 2009 Sunday for passage. The bills have contents almost similar to those in the two ordinances made by the military-installed caretaker government. Opposition BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury asked the House not to take responsibilities for the budgets tailored by the "corrupt" interim administrators. "Why do you legalise [the acts of] those who violated the constitution?" he asked. The opposition MPs said an unelected, undemocratic government had spent money of the budget, flouting the constitution and the rules of procedure. They called for a censure motion to be adopted in parliament to condemn the activities of the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led interim government. Muhith said the government did not consider all of the 122 ordinances the caretaker government had enacted. It was passing only those laws necessary for the continuation of the government. Ruling Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta retorted, "BNP cannot say that. The country was run unconstitutionally between 1975 and 1979. "At that time all killings were indemnified. Prime minister Shah Azizur Rahman flashing a blank paper in parliament had said 'everything is passed'." He added the four budgets had been passed for the sake of the continuation of the constitution. Earlier, the law minister proposed to the House to pass the bills and those were passed by voice vote. The BNP shouted "no" as the speaker put the proposal to vote. A parliamentary special committee earlier recommended the two ordinances for the passage along with 52 others of the past caretaker government. The minister in his statement on the EC Secretariat bill said the commission would be independent from government agencies if the bill was passed. The law ministry would enact necessary laws and rules on the Commission's behalf, the minister said. "The Commission will get necessary funds directly from the national budget," he added. The nationwide voter list with photographs project, meanwhile, was undertaken under the caretaker government's Electoral Rolls Ordinance 2007. bdnews24.com/krc/
