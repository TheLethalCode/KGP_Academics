 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka Medical College will reopen its doors as soon as possible, principal Dr Kazi Deen Mohammad said Wednesday. "If everything remains quiet, the college will reopen very soon. The situation is returning to normal," he told bdnews24.com. Authorities were forced to close Dhaka Medical College indefinitely on Tuesday after overnight clashes between two factions of the ruling party-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League over control of Fazle Rabbi Hall. The violence had left general secretary of college's BCL unit, Abul Kalam Asad Rajib, critically injured. He succumbed to his injuries in hospital later in the day. At least fifteen other students were admitted to hospital, the college head said. DMC's scheduled examinations were postponed and students were told to leave halls of residence to prevent further violence on the campus. Police said they had not arrested anyone up to Wednesday night in connection with the violence. "Those who caused this incident have gone into hiding. It will take time to find an arrest them," officer in charge of Lalbagh Police Station Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com. "Efforts to find them were on," he said. bdnew
