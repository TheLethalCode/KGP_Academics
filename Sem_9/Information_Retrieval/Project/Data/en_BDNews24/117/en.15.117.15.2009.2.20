 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of thousands of people from across broad social spectrum paid tributes to martyred heroes of the Language Movement in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country Saturday. The day is observed worldwide as the International Mother Language Day in recognition of the Feb. 21, 1952 demonstrations by Bengali-speaking students in Dhaka, who had died to demand Bengali as one of the state languages of the undivided Pakistan. Barefeet and sporting black ribbons, people flocked to the Central Shaheed Minar on Dhaka University campus and other Minars countrywide. They placed flowers at the alter of the Minars to recall the sacrifices that provided the platform for movements leading to the struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971. Tributes began pouring in at one minute past midnight Saturday when president Zillur Rahman led the nation by placing a wreath at the memorial. The entire Dhaka University campus and the surrounding area turned into a human sea, hours before midnight, and people continued to stream to the memorial until Saturday afternoon. The flowers of different colours were piled on the memorial podium. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina followed the president to honour the Language Movement heroes. Hasina, chief of the ruling Awami League, then led her party's presidium members to pay homage. Sister Sheikh Rehana joined the group in placing wreaths. Speaker Abdul Hamid, deputy speaker Shawkat Ali and whips came in next to show their respects, Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, chiefs of army, air force and navy, leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, DU vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique, diplomats and donor representatives followed them. Three-tier security measures were taken to avert any disruptions. The law-enforcers controlled thousands of emotional and curious onlookers as the leaders placed wreaths. A good number of foreigners also visited the Shaheed Minar and the ongoing Ekushey Book Fair at Bangla Academy, an outcome of the Language Movement. A number of citizens from Sri Lanka, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan said they were surprised and touched with observation ceremony. "That Bangladeshis laid down their lives to protect their mother language is unprecedented elsewhere in world history," Irfan Bin Abdullah from Saudi Arabia said. UNESCO proclaimed Feb. 21 the International Mother Language Day on Nov 17, 1999 to honour the sacrifices of language martyrs Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar, Shafiur and the ones whose names could not be known. Since then 188 countries across the globe observe the day to promote linguistic diversity, multilingual education, and to raise awareness about cultural traditions based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue. A number of socio-cultural, political and student organisations have arranged programmes, including photo exhibition, blood donation, movie screening, painting exhibition and cultural programmes in the city. Uttaradhikar '71, an youth organisation, arranged a photo exhibition on the country's liberation war at Dhaka University, considered to be the hub of all national occasions. At the fine arts faculty of the university, a painting exhibition is being held, while traditional songs are being rendered at Central Public Library premises at Shabagh. The port city of Chittagong observed the International Mother Language Day with recitations and cultural shows at Ekush Mela at the city's Hill DC area. Srijonshil Prokashak Parishad arranged a weeklong book fair. Bangladesh Shishu Academy's Sylhet chapter organised a special seminar and different competitions for children. Book shop Boipatra launched a book fair, Boiyer Aarong, which will continue through to the Independence Day on March 26. In Khulna, Hadis Park, the cultural hub of the southern port city, hosted seminars and cultural programmes. Different political, cultural and social organisations paid tribute to the language martyrs and marked the day with programmes.
