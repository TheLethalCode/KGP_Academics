 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  India's Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee has praised the Bangladeshi people's fight for their mother tongue. "I congratulate the Bangladeshi people for their role in establishing democracy," he said on his arrival in Dhaka Saturday. He said he hoped Bangladesh would continue its march forward with democratic ideals. He met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, at the Jamuna State Guest House, in the afternoon. Chaterjee had earlier visited the Central Shaheed Minar, or Martyrs' Monument. The country was paying tribute Saturday to the martyrs of the 1952 Language Movement who set Bangladesh on its path to independence. Feb 21 is now celebrated as International Mother Language Day around the world. Chatterjee arrived in the afternoon for a three-day visit on an invitation by Jatiya Sangsad speaker Abdul Hamid, who greeted him at the airport. The Indian speaker will also meet with president Zillur Rahman and parliamentarians during his visit, said a government statement. He will address an orientation programme for newly-elected MPs, organised by the US-based National Democratic Institute at the Sonargaon Hotel on Sunday. bdnews24.c
