 Barisal, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com) - Ten more bodies have been recovered three days after a launch capsized on the Kirtankhola river in Barisal, said police on Sunday. "The total body count now stands at 41," said Barisal assistant police commissioner Hayatul Islam Khan. The victims were identified as Moslem Choukidar (50), Moulana Faruk Hossain (45), Noor Mohammad Bepari (50), Abdul Khaleq Molla (55), Noorunnessa Begun (65), Bimal Chandra (30), Rubel (22), Hanif Mian (32) and Shohag (8). One body, that of a 10-12 year-old adolescent remains unidentified, said Khan. Four more bodies were retrieved Saturday at Beltola, near Barisal district town, where the launch went down with over 100 passengers on Thursday. Twenty-seven bodies were recovered in a day-long rescue operation after the ML Happy sank around 6:30am after being hit by a sand-laden cargo vessel. The exact number of passengers on board could not be confirmed by police, water transport authorities or rescue workers. bdnews2
