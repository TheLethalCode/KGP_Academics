 WELLINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - All-rounder Jacob Oram and batsman Jesse Ryder have been recalled after injury to the New Zealand squad for next week's two Twenty20 internationals against the visiting India team. Oram returns to the 13-man squad as a batsman only after recovering from an Achilles tendon injury while Ryder was cleared to make his comeback from a shoulder complaint. Batsman Ross Taylor, who injured a hamstring last week, was also passed fit to play while the selectors recalled left-arm pace bowler Ewen Thompson after he made his international debut against West Indies in December. "Ewen comes in for Kyle Mills who is still recovering from injury to his Achilles tendon," the head of the selection panel Glenn Turner said in a statement. "He will give the side additional strength as a specialist new ball and swing bowler." New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan also confirmed that six members of the touring Indian squad would be allowed to play in New Zealand's domestic competition before next month's test series, which was recently expanded from two to three tests. Vaughan said New Zealand had struck a deal with Indian officials allowing the players to join local teams in the absence of an official warm-up match. "India have bent over backwards to accommodate our wish for three tests so we have to give them some warmup," Vaughan told The Dominion Post newspaper. "I said to them: 'We won't leave you in the lurch, we will give you some decent warmup,' and one way or the other we will honour that." The Twenty20 matches are on Feb. 25 in Christchurch and Feb. 27 in Wellington. New Zealand - Daniel Vettori (captain), Neil Broom, Ian Butler, Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum, Nathan McCullum, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Ewen Thompson
