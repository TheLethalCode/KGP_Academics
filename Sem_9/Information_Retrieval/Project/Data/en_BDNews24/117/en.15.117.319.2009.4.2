 BANGALORE, Thu Apr 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Financial bids for Satyam Computer will be submitted by next week, three banking sources involved in the deal said on Thursday, and the sale of the fraud-hit Indian outsourcer is likely to be completed by mid-April, another source with knowledge of the proceedings said. "By April 9 we have to put in the final and financial bids," one banker directly involved in the deal told Reuters.

Analysts have said Satyam looks attractive because of its long list of marquee clients, including General Electric and Qantas Airways, and due to the plunge in its market value. However, bidders face a tough job in valuing the company, due to uncertainty about its accounts and legal liabilities arising from the lawsuits filed in the United States by its shareholders. Last week, India's diversified Spice Group, a potential suitor for Satyam, said it would not proceed with its bid for now as it has not got the desired level of transpar
