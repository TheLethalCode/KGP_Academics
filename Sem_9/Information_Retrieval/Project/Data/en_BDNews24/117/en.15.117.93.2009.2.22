 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com) - In a bid to discover young talent as well as revive football at the grass-root level, an Under-13 Development Football Festival kicks off on Monday at eight different venues across the country. "Ahead of the AFC U-13 Football Festival in Iran from May 6 to 16, we are organising a U-13 tournament across the country so that we can find footballers for building a good team for the AFC meet," said Bangladesh Football Federation vice- president Kazi Nabil Ahmed at a press conference on Sunday. Ahmed also said that they had also a plan to revive football at grass-root level through the age-level competition. As many as 40 districts, split into eight venues, will play in the robin-round matches and later the top two teams from each venue will qualify for final. Later, eight venue champions will play in the final round. But the venue and date are yet to be decided. Coaches will be sent to every venue to select the players. Ahmed said that they had maintained strict way to measure the players' age as a committee comprising two doctors and a coach certified the players. Each of the forty teams will be given Tk 20,000 as participation money and each of eight venues will receive Tk 40,000. Besides, the qualifiers of the final round will be given additional Tk 20,000. BFF member Satyajit Das Rupu said that it was mandatory for the team to keep players at least 20 minutes in the field before making any change during the 25+10+25 game. Eight venues are: Comilla, Chapainawabganj, Bagerhat, Thakurgaon, Bhola, Mymensingh, Narail and Noakhali. bd
