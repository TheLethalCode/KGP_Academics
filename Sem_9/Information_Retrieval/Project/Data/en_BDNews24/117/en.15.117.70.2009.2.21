 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested another four suspected JMB militants in Gazipur early Saturday and seized some explosives. Joydevpur sub-inspector Nazmul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com the suspects were arrested from a residence in Kalameshwar village in Bodbazar area of Tongi around 4.30am. The four, including a woman, were identified as Nasreen Akhtar, Masud Rana, Arifur Rahman and Zahid Hasan. The arrests came just 12 hours after another JMB suspect, handcuffed in police custody, exploded a grenade at the Gazipur Sadar SP's office. "They were caught with one grenade and some material good for making two hand grenades," said Khan. Police and RAB had arrested seven suspected members of the same outlawed group, including three women, on Friday in separate raids. Four, including the three women, were arrested from a house in Hortul, Tongi, with a haul of five hand grenades and bomb-making materials. Of the four arrestees, the male suspect Mamunur Rashid, managed to pounce on a grenade, pull the pin and throw it as Gazipur Sadar superintendent of police Abdul Baten was briefing the media at around 5pm. Some 100 journalists and police gathered at the SP's conference room, said police and witnesses. At least 12 policemen and journalists were critically wounded. Rapid Action Battalion arrested another three JMB members later that evening. The elite force seized two improvised bombs, 2000 campaign CDs and books on Jihad after a raid on a house Ambagh in Konabarhi, Dhaka, according to a press release. The arrestees during interrogation admitted the explosives were meant to create "a security situation".
