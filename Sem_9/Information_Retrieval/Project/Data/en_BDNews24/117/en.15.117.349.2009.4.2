 KABUL Thu Apr 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan will face a power vacuum after August 20 polls despite a Supreme Court ruling allowing President Hamid Karzai to stay in office after his term officially ends on May 21, a rival candidate said on Thursday. The presidential election will be the defining test of progress this year in Afghanistan, where violence is surging despite the presence of 70,000 foreign forces, expected to rise to some 90,000 by the time the polls are held. Karzai said on Sunday he will stay in office after his term officially ends on May 21, following a Supreme Court ruling that he could remain president until the August 20 elections. Ashraf Ghani, one of around half a dozen politicians who have announced their intention to stand in the elections, said results will not be ready for three weeks after the polls and it was not clear whether Karzai could stay in office in the meantime.

CONSTITUTIONAL DISPUTE Ghani called for a national consensus to fill the gap between the election and the time results are announced. The comments could re-ignite a constitutional dispute over the legitimacy of the presidency, which has already thrown the young Afghan democracy into turmoil and undermined faith in the system as it struggles to combat the growing Taliban insurgency. Ghani, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute think-tank and author of a book on fixing failed states, said a monitoring process should be set up to make sure Karzai, who has ruled Afghanistan since the Taliban's overthrow in 2001, does not misuse his power in the election campaign. The 59-year-old Ghani said the next six months were crucial for Afghanistan and its future political stability. The Afghan constitution says presidential elections should be held before May 21, but security concerns prompted the election commission to put the date back to August. US President Barack Obama has ordered the deployment of 4,000 extra US troops to Afghanistan, on top of the 17,000 already on their way. That will bring the number of American troops close to 60,000 around the time of the Afghan elections. There are also some 30,000 troops from 40 other nations serving under a NATO-led f
