 ISLAMABAD, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court nullified on Wednesday the election last year of Punjab province's chief minister, a lawyer said, effectively dismissing him and raising fears of renewed political instability. The court also declined to rule on a challenge to an electoral ban on Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif's brother, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, effectively maintaining a bar on him standing for election. The court's decisions raised the prospect of confrontation between the country's two main political parties which battled for power in the turbulent 1990s when both twice headed governments. Pakistani stocks fell 5.12 percent as investors sold on fears that the nuclear-armed country was heading into a fresh phase of instability as it struggles to contain Islamist violence. "Shahbaz Sharif's membership (of the provincial assembly) has been cancelled," Akram Sheikh, a lawyer supporting the Sharif brothers, told reporters outside the Supreme Court. Neither of the Sharif brothers were in court. Asked whether Shahbaz Sharif would remain chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's biggest and politically most important province, Sheikh said: "It's the natural consequence of this, how could he remain chief minister?" The Sharifs head the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), which came second in a general election last year. The party later dropped out of a coalition with the party of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, which won the most seats, in a dispute over the restoration of judges former president Pervez Musharraf had dismissed in late 2007. Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, is now president and his party hopes to win a majority of seats in both houses of parliament in upper house elections next week. "KANGAROO COURT" A spokesman for the Sharifs' party dismissed the court decision that he said was aimed at sidelining the brothers. "This judgement has been given by a kangaroo court on the direction of Mr Asif Ali Zardari," said Sharif party spokesman Siddiqul Farooq. "We will fight our case in the court of the people of Pakistan." The brothers' supporters took to the streets in towns and cities in Punjab, burning tyres and chanting anti-government slogans. Nawaz Sharif has thrown his party's backing behind a lawyers' protest campaign, set to resume next month, aimed at securing the restoration of the chief justice that Musharraf dismissed. Another party spokesman, Pervez Rashid, said Shahbaz Sharif had left the chief minister's house in the city of Lahore after the verdict. Though both brothers were barred from the general election in February last year, a court later cleared the way for Shahbaz Sharif to contest a by-election, which he won. He then became chief minister of Punjab. Nawaz Sharif was ousted as prime minister in a 1999 coup by then army chief Musharraf. He was barred from running in last year's election because he had been convicted for the 1999 hijacking of Musharraf's aircraft, an action that triggered the military coup that overthrew him. The Election Commission later ruled he could contest a by-election for a National Assembly seat. But in June, a court disqualified Nawaz Sharif from contesting the by-election. The Supreme Court had been hearing challenges to that ruling. Nawaz Sharif had declined to recognise the authority of the present Supreme Court, saying its judges were Musharraf appointees.
