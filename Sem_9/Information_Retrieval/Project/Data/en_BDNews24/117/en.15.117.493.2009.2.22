<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Hundreds of police began raiding a Dhaka University hall early Sunday after reports of gunfire between student activists. Residents of Sergeant Zahurul Haque Hall (formerly Iqbal Hall) said "rival Chhatra League groups" had exchanged four to five rounds of gunfire at the hall gates on Saturday evening. Some eight to ten platoons, of 30 policemen each, began raiding the hall from about 1.30am Sunday. They were, however, forced to retreat without completing their raid as dozens of BCL activists staged a noisy protest. "I was told by the security guards of the hall that at least two rounds of bullets were fired in the evening (Saturday)," said hall provost Zahidul Islam. Islam said no injuries were reported. "But I informed the vice chancellor and proctor as soon as I heard of the incident," he added. BCL's Dhaka University unit general secretary, Sajjad Saqib Bachcha, said: "If the allegation against our Chhatra League members is found true, the organisation will take strict measures against them." Bangladesh Chhatra League, student wing of the ruling party, has come under a cloud of bad publicity over campus violence in recent weeks. It was forced to dissolve its Jahangirnagar University unit less than a week ago, after rival factions fought a bloody gun battle there over control of residential halls. Security guards at Sergeant Zahurul Haque Hall said they had filed a general diary complaint with Shahbagh police over the gunfire on Saturday evening. bdn
