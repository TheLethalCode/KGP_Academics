<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Borussia Dortmund needed a late strike by substitute Mohamed Zidan to salvage a 1-1 draw against local rivals Schalke on Friday. Schalke, who had taken the lead with a well-struck Kevin Kuranyi volley and looked better throughout, remain in ninth place in the Bundesliga table, a point behind Dortmund. Kuranyi, whose strained ties with his club have given rise to speculation he may move in the off-season, struck in the 20th minute when he spectacularly volleyed a Halil Altintop cross in mid-air past stunned Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller. The former Germany international could have bagged a second on the hour but his shot from just inside the box flew wide. Dortmund, who have only lost three times this season, finally broke past the Bundesliga's tightest defence in the 81st when Zidan, a second half substitute, combined well with Tamas Hajnal and Nelson Valdez to level. This was Dortmund's 11th draw in 21 league matches, while Schalke's erratic season continues with only a point from the last two games. Leaders Hertha Berlin visit improved VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday, while second-placed Hoffenheim, a point behind, take on Stuttgart, who have not lost in the league since November. Champions Bayern Munich, in fourth place, travel to Cologne
