 NEW DELHI, Tue Feb 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Here are some facts about Omar Abdullah, Kashmir's new leader sworn in last month. The 38-year-old Omar Abdullah became Kashmir's youngest-ever chief minister after winning state elections last December. His National Conference party heads the state government in coalition with the ruling Congress party. Abdullah is heir to Kashmir's oldest ruling dynasty and the third member of his family to hold the state's top job. His grandfather, Sheikh Abdullah, was known as the "Lion of Kashmir" for his defiance against New Delhi and his imprisonment for nearly 20 years. The British-born Abdullah, a former Minister of State, was sent to Kashmir in 2002 to revive his ailing party. The National Congress had lost popularity under his father Farooq, a former chief minister seen as aloof from the needs of ordinary Kashmiris. Abdullah won acclaim for a brainstorming parliament speech in defence of secularism and a civilian nuclear deal with the United States last year. "I am a Muslim and I am an Indian, and I see no distinction between the two," it began. The speech received tens of thousands of hits on Youtube. Abdullah is a good friend of Rahul Gandhi, the 38-year-old son of Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi who is widely tipped as a future Indian prime minister. Both are said to hold wide appeal with young voters
