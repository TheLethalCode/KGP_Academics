<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)BNP MPs returned to parliament Monday, ending weeks of boycott. The opposition, led by Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, were taking up their seats for the first time after a 26-day absence. "We'll attend the session from today (Monday), and expect to play a positive and constructive role," he told bdnews24.com earlier in the day. "We hope that the ruling party will accommodate us in the right spirit, allowing for our meaningful participation in Sangsad deliberations," Chowdhury said. On seat allocation in the House, he said the speaker had promised "to resolve the issue honourably and that's why we're returning to parliament". The BNP leader repeated his trademark tirade against the caretaker government and its 100-odd ordinances. "BNP will not endorse any of those ordinances that contravene the caretaker government's constitutional mandate," he said. "The caretaker government had no other business constitutionally except carrying out certain routine activities and holding a free and fair election." "Instead, the caretaker government remained in power illegally for two years and passed 122 ordinances in the process," he said. A BNP parliamentary party meeting on Sunday, chaired by Khaleda Zia, took the decision to return after weeks of dispute over the seat allocations to opposition MPs in the House. bdnews
