 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Rifles must work more effectively to counter trafficking of women and children, the prime minister said on Tuesday. "The duties of BDR are no longer limited to protecting the country's borders and prevention of smuggling," said Sheikh Hasina, inaugurating 'Rifles Week 2009' at Bangladesh Rifles headquarters. "They must also safeguard the wellbeing of the people." "The onus is on the state to meet its people's needs and BDR has to assist the government in fulfilling its mandate," said the prime minister. On BDR's role in Bangladesh's liberation struggle, she said, "It was through our riflemen's wireless network that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's call for independence was transmitted countrywide in 1971." "We know today that the Pakistani occupation army had then arrested, tortured and killed those four valiant men for spreading Sheikh Mujib's word." "I bow most respectfully to the memory of their supreme sacrifice," said Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Mujib. The prime minister also acknowledged BDR's achievements post-independence, but she said, "There's no room to indulge in self-satisfaction. Our border security men must always uphold the highest standards." "The government will take careful and positive steps to help BDR enhance its strategic capacity," she said. On arrival at the BDR headquarters in the morning, the prime minister received a ceremonial march-by. She handed Bangladesh Rifles Medals to Colonel Anisuzzaman, Lt Col Quamruzzaman, retired Captain Murad Salahuddin Ahmed and Sepoy Imamul Hossain. President's Rifles Medals were awarded to Lt Col Md Badrul Huda, Lt Col Abdul Mukin Sarkar, Major Md Maqsudul Haque, Major Akramuzzaman, Subedar Md Ali Akbar, Subedar Md Ali Sarkar, Nayeb Subedar Md Azir Uddin, Havildar Md Younus Ali, Nayek Md Ishaque Ali and Nayek Md Jahangir Alam. Home minister Sahara Khatun and BDR director general Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed were among those present. bdnews24.c
