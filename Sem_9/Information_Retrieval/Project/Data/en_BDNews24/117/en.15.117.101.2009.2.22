<TITLE> Don't let democracy derail again: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister has asked the people to be watchful against any 'backdoor' attempts to derail democracy again in Bangladesh, which has experienced military rules and unconstitutional governments in the past. Addressing the first ever orientation workshop for newly elected MPs, the prime minister said the Dec 29 elections could take place because of "people's courage". She said the boycotting of parliament by opposition BNP should end as the speaker had made a conciliatory offer on the seating dispute. The prime minister also said that the parliament secretariat, like India, could launch a dedicated television channel for airing parliamentary proceedings. The prime minister, who was jailed during the immediate-past military-installed caretaker government on corruption charges, said Bangladesh's democratic foundations had not been properly secured owing to disruptions by military regimes. "The people should be watchful so that nobody can choke democracy from behind," Sheikh Hasina told MPs at an orientation programme on Sunday. "The country's welfare cannot be ensured without democracy. We have to take the democratic stream forward for the sake of the country and its people," said the prime minister. "Unlike India, we did not enjoy uninterrupted democratic rule. Owing to the interruptions, parliamentary practices were disrupted," said Hasina, in presence of Indian Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee who was attending as special guest. "We could not hold regular elections because of military regimes, states of emergency, and so on," said Hasina, whose father, independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, mother and family members were killed in a military coup on August 15, 1975. "People could not uninterruptedly exercise their voting rights." The prime minister said military rulers had imposed martial law, formed king's parties and then held sham elections to hold up a rubber stamp parliament. Hasina's coalition ally, former president Gen HM Ershad who promulgated martial law in 1982, was in the audience as the prime minister spoke. "The same process was started this time," she said, referring to the past caretaker government that held office for an unprecedented two-year term instead of the constitutionally mandated three months. "They tried to form a king's party offering to make various figures prime minister at different times," said the Awami League president. "Where is the king's party now?" "Democracy was restored through the Dec 29 elections because of people's courage and international pressure," she said. On BNP's boycott of parliament, the prime minister said: "The speaker has made a move to bring the main opposition back. He may have to fulfil some of their demands to that end." "I hope they will return to the House soon." The prime minister also said the government was considering a new dedicated television channel which will only air parliamentary proceedings. She said opposition BNP in 1996 were unruly in parliament until her government started to telecast the proceedings live. "Then they began showing restraint," said Hasina, who first served as prime minister from 1996 to 2001. Speaker Abdul Hamid presided on day one of the orientation programme for 162 first-time MPs. "I hope this orientation workshop will help the newly elected MPs better understand parliamentary procedures," speaker Abdul Hamid told the opening session. The three-day programme was jointly organised by the parliament secretariat, US-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) and USAID at the Sonargaon Hotel. bdn
