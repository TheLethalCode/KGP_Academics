 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government will investigate the failure of state-run fixed and mobile-phone operators to woo new customers, the telecoms minister has told bdnews24.com. "Land phone was out of reach of the people in the past. They had to wait for two-three years after submitting application. They had to pay Tk 20,000 to 30,000, " Raziuddin Razu told bdnews24.com Thursday. "Now the situation has changed. The call tariff and connection fee of [Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited] tariff have been cut. Customer can talk from Tk 0.10 to Tk 0.15 a minute. "The connection process has been made easy, as well. New technology has been introduced. However, the previous governments did not concentrate on [the expansion of the land-phone operator]. " "We will take the measures t0 make it popular again," the minister said. "We saw long queues for TeleTalk mobile phones. We will investigate to find out why the company fell behind. " According to telecoms regulator Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, cell-phone operator TeleTalk has 8.4 lakh customers and BTCL 8.72 lakh until January. The ministry sources said a project on expansion of TeleTalk's network was approved Wednesday. Under the plan, 700 base towers will be installed across the country. State-run Telephone Shilpa Sangstha will jointly implement the project with a foreign company. Razu, also post minister, said, "The condition is similar in the postal department. The ministry will take steps to make it more dynamic. "The postal service office will begin receiving, handling and delivering overseas remittance," he said. "Mail carriers will also be provided with mobile phones for ease of their work and to provide phone services, like local shops do at present, to those without phones," he added. "We are also planning to recruit a larger postal workforce. Already we have talked with the finance minister on the issue". According to the ministry, around 9000 post offices are spread throughout the country. But the state-run postal service has failed to maintain its popularity in the face of competition with private courier services.
