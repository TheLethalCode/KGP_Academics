 HARARE, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai called for national reconciliation and forgiveness on Sunday after years of political conflict in the country. Tsvangirai, who entered into a unity government with President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party this month, also said the time had come to address poverty and hunger. "This nation needs national healing. It has endured so much violence. Let's forgive those who have transgressed against us ... ," Tsvangirai told supporters of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) at a rally in Gweru, 220 km southwest of Harare. "If there's no national healing, there won't be progress." Zimbabwe's new government urgently needs to find a solution to the country's economic meltdown that has led to the world's highest inflation and a worthless currency. Tsvangirai said last week it would cost as much as $5 billion to repair the shattered economy. He said on Sunday that Mugabe, himself and Arthur Mutambara -- leader of a breakaway MDC faction -- were committed to the unity government. "We realised that the time had come to sort out this mess. There is absolute poverty and hunger in this country. This is what prompted us to work with ZANU-PF and I am sure that is what also prompted ZANU-PF to agree to this inclusive government," he said. The MDC has said the detention of some of its members, including that of senior party official Roy Bennett, can undermine the power-sharing government. Bennett was arrested on Feb. 13 before he could be sworn in as deputy agriculture minister and has been charged with terrorism. The High Court will rule on his application for bail on Tuesday. Tsvangirai said the issue of ongoing detentions will be addressed. "We can't be a government that wants to give people freedom, and at the same time be the one that detains people. We are very conscious of that fact and we will deal with that matter". Mugabe lost a first presidential poll to Tsvangirai a year ago before winning a subsequent run-off which the opposition boycotted over political violence. Analysts say the partners have no choice but to make the unity government work despite their policy and personality differences
