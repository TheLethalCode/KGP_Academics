 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister was hopeful Sunday that the parliamentary boycott by opposition BNP would end as the speaker had made a conciliatory offer on the seat dispute. "The speaker has made a move to bring the main opposition back," Sheikh Hasina said at an orientation programme for first-time MPs. "He may have to fulfil some of their demands to that end," said the prime minister, who appeared to have softened her stance on the row. "I hope they will return to the House soon," she said. Just days before, Hasina had said BNP's party strength did not warrant any more front-row seats in parliament. Outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar had allotted BNP MPs nine seats in the first row and ten in the second for the first session of parliament. But the opposition began their boycott when incoming speaker Abdul Hamid redistributed the seats, giving BNP four seats each in the frontmost and second rows "in line with their total number of MPs". Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, meanwhile, called a meeting of BNP's parliamentary party Sunday afternoon to decide if they will be re-joining the House in the current session. "BNP would like to play its role effectively in parliament, which so far has been impeded by the government. In today's meeting, we'll decide the issue finally," MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury told bdnews24.com in the morning. He hinted that his party was keen to re-join "during this session" so that they might have their say on the ordinances the emergency government had enacted. Opposition chief whip Joynal Abdin Faruq told bdnews24.com: "We will discuss the speaker's proposal on seat allocation at this afternoon's meeting." Speaker Abdul Hamid held a meeting with the chief whips of the ruling and opposition parties at the end of last week, said Faruq. "[Hamid] proposed some changes to the seating arrangements," said the opposition whip.
