 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)--A Russian minister will visit Bangladesh later this month to sign a memorandum of understanding on building nuclear power plants in this energy-starved country. Senior officials from the two countries ended three days of "useful" talks in Dhaka Thursday and said they had already drafted the MoU. "We'll now await clearance from the higher authorities," M M Neazuddin, who led the Bangladesh team to the talks, told bdnews24.com. Once the MoU was okayed, he said, further steps would be taken. Neazuddin, a joint secretary at the science and ICT ministry, would not give further details. But Dhaka officials familiar with the negotiations say the two sides discussed the possibility of setting up two 1000-mw units. The talks did not cover the source of funding or financing terms. The Dhaka officials said the Russians were not too keen to discuss financing at this stage. "Let's sign the MoU first and then we'll sort out the financing issues," a Russian official was quoted to have told his counterparts. The host officials hinted that Russia was interested to lend the money needed to build the plants on easy terms. "It is unlikely they would consider giving us grants," one official said. The loan negotiations will be handled by the Economic Relations Division. Russia, a global leader in nuclear technology, has supplied as many as 65 plants to Iran, India, China, Armenia, Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Finland, Bulgaria and Germany. Last year, it supplied 10 nuclear power plants to different countries. The Russians are now working on 11 power plants all over the world. The idea of a nuclear power plant in the north of Bangladesh (Rooppur, Pabna) was mooted way back in 1961. Currently, 439 power plants are producing 16 percent of total electricity around the world. A two-member high-level team of Russian nuclear experts by Vladimir Averkiev, head of international co-operation at Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, arrived in Dhaka Monday for the three-day talks. Nikolay Poznyakov, head of external affairs of International relations department, was the other member. Liakat Ali, acting chairman of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, project director of nuclear power plant Shawkat Akbar, former chairman of the Commission Shafiqul Islam and director of BCSIR Rafiqul Islam were in the Bangladesh delegati
