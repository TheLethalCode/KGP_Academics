 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Gunfire erupted in and around Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters Wednesday morning. "Jawans laid siege to a group of officers within the BDR HQ premises this morning," home ministry public relations officer Shahinoor Miah told bdnews24.com "They began firing their rifles shortly after 9am." The riflefire was continuing without break up to 1pm. bdnews24.com senior reporter Liton Haider reported a patrolling helicopter shooting into the compound at one point. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, summoned the home minister Sahara Khatun as soon as the troubles started. The prime minister had inaugurated the start of Rifles Week 2009 at the BDR Headquarters just the previous day. The BDR jawans carrying heavy arms were seen taking position at the main entrance of the Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters on Dhanmondi Road 2. bdnews24.com correspondents reported that the jawans fired shots out of the compound on at least two occasions, injuring civilians and smashing windows of surrounding buildings, once around 10.30 am and a second time at around 11:15 am. Traffic movement remained suspended on the roads around the BDR compound since army troops took position. An Inter Services Public Relations press release issued after the incident asked the BDR jawans to surrender their arms immediately and return to barracks, stopping all of their destructive activities forthwith. The prime minister will speak to the BDR jawans and hear their complaints and grievances, it said. If anyone is found taking the law in their hands violating this order, stringent punitive measures will be taken against them, the ISPR release warned. bdnews24.com/lh/sit/
