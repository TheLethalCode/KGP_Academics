<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb23 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid has urged MPs to stay alert to the danger of a repeat of the past. Hamid made the call Monday after main opposition BNP MPs joined parliament after 26 days of boycott over seating arrangements. "All will have to stay alert so that no undemocratic events take place like in the past. Only then will we be able to run the House effectively." He sought cooperation of the treasury and the opposition in the running of parliament. "Many things happened in the past, but we need to think anew." He thanked the opposition MPs for returning to the House and admitted that mistakenly had included no opposition MP in the list of panel chairmen. "That was my mistake. It happened as I was making the panel in a hurry." He dispelled the allegations of opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farrouque that Hamid had not allowed him to thank the speaker on his election. "The allegation that he (Farrouque) was not allowed to thank the new speaker was not correct. "On that day I looked at the members of the opposition to see whether any of them raised hand. I could not give floor as none had raised hand." BNP MPs entered parliament at 3:54pm. and Faruq made his speech with permission from the Speaker. He requested the speaker to run the House impartially giving equal opportunities to the treasury and the opposition bench to make parliament effective. bdne
