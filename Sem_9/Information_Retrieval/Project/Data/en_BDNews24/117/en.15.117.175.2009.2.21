 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Security agencies arrested eight more suspected members of outlawed Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh and seized three grenades and explosives Saturday in raids on Gazipur, Jamalpur and Nilphamari districts. The raids came after a JMB suspect in handcuffs reportedly exploded a grenade at the Gazipur Sadar superintendent of police's office at a press briefing Friday. The latest arrests pushed the number of people detained to 11. GAZIPUR Four suspected JMB militants were arrested and three grenades and grenade-making materials were seized from a residence in Kalameshwar village in Bodbazar area of Tongi, Joydevpur sub-inspector Nazmul Islam Khan said. The four, including a woman, were identified as Nasreen Akhtar, 19, Masud Rana, 22, Arifur Rahman, 20, and Zahid Hasan, 21, Khan said. He added that they seized a number of leaflets, Jihad propaganda books and CDs from the arrestees. JAMALPUR Police arrested two JMB suspects from Sadar Upazila. The arrestees were identified as Shamsul Haq, 55, and Mehedi Iqbal Ripon, 34, both from Iqbalpur of the district town.
