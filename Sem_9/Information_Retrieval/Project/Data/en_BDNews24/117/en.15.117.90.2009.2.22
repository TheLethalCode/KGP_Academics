<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Japan will provide Bangladesh about Tk 30 billion (approximately $440 million) as loans to implement two power and one bridge projects. Japanese ambassador in Bangladesh Masayuki Inoue and secretary to the external resources division M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan signed the agreement in presence of Japan's state secretary for foreign affairs Seiko Hashimoto. Hashimoto came to Dhaka Sunday to greet Sheikh Hasina's new government. She met foreign minister Dipu Moni at her foreign ministry office, congratulating the Bangladesh government for appointing so many women as ministers, according to a foreign ministry press statement. "Bangladesh is an ideal partner for Japan in this regard," said Hashimoto. "Being a Muslim majority country, the victory of a secular party in the polls proves that people of this country are liberal," the statement quoted the Japanese minister as saying. "This is an important message," she said. The two power projects under the new deal are: Phase-2 of the New Haripur Power Plant (360 MW) costing Tk 16.66 billion and Central Zone Power Distribution Project with a cost of Tk 7.29 billion. The bridge project will cost Tk 5.87 billion. The conditions of the loans are generous, with an interest rate of 0.01 percent per annum and repayment period of 40 years inclusive of a 10-year grace period for all three loans. Total assistance from Japan to Bangladesh amounts to approximately Tk 503 billion in loans since 1973 for some 80 projects. Japan has greatly increased its aid to Bangladesh in recent years. In 2007, Japan gave US $473 million, US $275 million in 2006 and US $125 million, 2006 and 2005 respectively. bdn
