 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Troops massed on the streets after gunshots erupted in and around Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters Wednesday morning. "The Jawans have laid siege to a group of officers within the BDR HQ premises," home ministry public relations officer Shahinoor Miah told bdnews24.com "They began firing shots shortly after 9am." The rifle fire was continuing without break up to 1pm. bdnews24.com senior reporter Liton Haider reported a patrolling helicopter shooting into the compound at one point. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina summoned the home minister Sahara Khatun as soon as the shootings began. BDR personnel carrying heavy arms were seen taking position at the main entrance to the Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters on Dhanmondi Road 2 in the morning. bdnews24.com's Rohan Ziad reported that the personnel fired shots out of the compound at civilians on at least two occasions, once around 10:30am and a second time around 11:15am. bdnews24.com correspondents said a bullet-hit rickshaw puller brought to Dhaka Medical College Hospital died on arrival at DMCH. At least 200 panicked students of the nearby South Breeze School were trapped. Sources inside the headquarters told bdnews24.com that in an act of defiance BDR jawans began firing during the director general's address at the annual Darbar. A number of top officers were injured inside the compound, the sources confirmed. Traffic movement remained suspended on the roads around the BDR compound since troops took position. An Inter Services Public Relations press release issued after the incident asked the BDR personnel to surrender their arms immediately and return to barracks. The prime minister will speak to the BDR personnel and hear their complaints and grievances, it said. If anyone is found taking the law in their hands violating the order, stringent punitive measures will be taken against them, the ISPR release warned. bdnews24.com/lh/sit/
