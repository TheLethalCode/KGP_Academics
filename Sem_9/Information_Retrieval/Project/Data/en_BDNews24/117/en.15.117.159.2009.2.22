<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mike Myers really did lose his mojo in 2008. Myers and his comedy "The Love Guru," which won few fans at box offices, were named worst actor and worst picture of 2008 at the Razzie Awards on Saturday, one day before the world's top film honors, the Oscars, are given out in Hollywood. The comedy featuring Myers as a spiritual healer was also given the Razzie for the worst screenplay of 2008. The Canadian actor and the movie he spent years developing won gold spray-painted Raspberries at the awards ceremony created in 1980 to spoof the glitzy Academy Awards. "The Love Guru" flopped in theaters with only $40.8 million in global ticket sales. That figure is a huge come-down after Myers' three "Austin Powers" spoofs in which the comedian worked his spy character's positive mojo to perfection, raking in a combined $675 million at global box offices. Socialite Paris Hilton was the other big award-winner at the 29th annual Golden Raspberry Awards. Hilton won three trophies: worst actress and worst screen couple for her low-budget romantic comedy "The Hottie & The Nottie," as well as worst supporting actress for her role in the horror fantasy "Repo! The Genetic Opera." Some of 2008's biggest blockbusters also got Razzies. "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," the highly anticipated fourth installment of the adventure franchise starring Harrison Ford, was declared the worst "prequel, remake, rip-off or sequel." Former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan was awarded the worst supporting actor for his singing turn in the ABBA tunes musical "Mamma Mia!" The "winners" of the Razzies were determined by mailing ballots to 657 voters living in the United States and 19 foreign countries. Few Raspberry winners collect their trophies but Oscar winning actress Halle Berry sportingly showed up four years ago to take home her prize for "Catwoman." Following is a list of 2008 Razzie winners: Worst picture: "The Love Guru" Worst Actor: Mike Myers Worst Actress: Paris Hilton ("The Hottie & The Nottie") Worst Supporting actor: Pierce Brosnan ("Mamma Mia!") Worst Supporting actress: Paris Hilton ("Repo! The Genetic Opera") Worst Screen Couple: Paris Hilton with either Christine Lakin or Joel David Moore ("The Hottie & The Nottie") Worst Screenplay: "The Love Guru" by Mike Myers and Graham Gordy Worst Director: Uwe Boll ("Tunnel Rats," "In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale," and "Postal") Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel: "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
