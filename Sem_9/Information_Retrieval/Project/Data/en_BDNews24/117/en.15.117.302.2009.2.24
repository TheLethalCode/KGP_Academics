<TEXT>
 Bogra, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  A mother has charged businessman Osman Gani and three others in a court with murdering her son in 1971 after police had dropped charges against them. Nekbanu Bewa, an inhabitant of Chelopara in the town, filed the case Tuesday with the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court of Bogra. She demanded that they be tried for war crimes. "I want justice for the murder of my son. This time I'm optimistic," Bewa said, referring to the government's announcement that the trial would finally be held. The case statement said Osman and his three associates attacked the town's Momin Radio House on May 14 in 1971 and shot his 16-year son Guljar Hossain and the owner of the house. Guljar died on the spot, the statement said. The other accused are two sons of Osman Ghani, Aslam Hossain and Iqbal Hossain, and his nephew Anwar Hossain. The Osman Ghani alias Osman Behari denied the allegations. "I was never a war criminal and I don't know anyone by the name of Nekbanu or Guljar." The judge, Md Hasanuzzaman, has ordered the Sadar Police Station's officer-in-charge to take the case, Bewa's lawyer Md Azad Talukder said. Nekbanu filed another case on the same charge against Osman Behari, his two sons and nephew on the same allegation last year. But then the officer-in-charge of Sadar Police Station gave the final report of the case on June 14 on "lack of proof and witnesses". The current officer-in-charge, Ahsan Habib, said he was yet to receive the court orders but heard of the case. CHILDREN SAY "RAJAKAR" Osman Ghani's three childrenShabnam Khan, 'Jennifer', and Tarek Hssan Pappu, said their father was a "top-ranked Rajakar", the local collaborators of Pakistan army. At a press conference last year, they demanded his trial for war crimes during independence war. "Despite being my father, I want him tried on war crime charges," Pappu, also the convener of war crime trial implementation committee, said. bdnews24.c
