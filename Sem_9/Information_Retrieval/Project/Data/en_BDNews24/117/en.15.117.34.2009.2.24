 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association has urged the government to pass the Real Estate Development and Management Ordinance 2008, without dropping the provision of punishment and fine. In an application to the law minister, the BELA chief executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan Tuesday said the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh's demand to cancel the provision of punishment and fine in the ordinance is "illogical and anti-people". They said the "dishonest developers" are doing business through grabbing lands. Minister Shafiq Ahmed said measures would be taken to keep the developers away from "irrelevant" activities. The REHAB on Feb. 18 urged the law minister to drop the provision of punishment and fine. The military-installed interim government made the ordinance with provisions of jail and fine for the developers if they fail to hand over flats to the buyers in time. Shafiq had said the ordinance would be passed in the parliament taken into account the interests of the buyers and developers. "Prior to placing it before parliament to make it a law, the cabinet and the parliamentary standing committee (on the housing ministry) will scrutinise the ordinance," Shafiq had told reporters after the meeting. bd
