 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA received around 200 applications a minute in the first five hours when World Cup tickets went on sale on Friday. There were 60,000 online ticket applications worldwide within the first five hours, far exceeding expectations, world football's governing body said in a statement. It added that thousands of South Africans collected paper applications from bank branches in the 2010 tournament's host country. Organisers said the opening day of ticket sales dispelled any doubts about the tournament going ahead in South Africa. "The beginning of this part of the build-up to the World Cup is our irrevocable promise that we make to the people of the world that all is in place and will be ready for 2010," said Organising Committee chief executive officer Danny Jordaan. The readiness of South Africa's stadiums and infrastructure has come under scrutiny but FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in December there was "no plan B". Some 700,000 tickets are available for purchase out of a total of just over three million for the 64 games between June 11-July 11 next year. Fans have from Friday until the end of March to apply for tickets before going into a random draw lottery in April to determine the successful applicants. Some 20 million applications were received during the first phase of the sales process for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany, which was conducted entirely online. Ticket prices range from $20 to $900, a drastic increase in the standard $1.50 to $2.50 supporters pay for entry to South African premier league matches
