 MADRID, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Villa scored and was later sent off as Valencia were held to a 1-1 draw away to Deportivo Coruna in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Both sides have struggled for form of late and it was perhaps indicative that Villa's goal came from an error in the 25th minute. The Spain striker intercepted Julian de Guzman's long pass back to his keeper to net his 19th goal of the campaign before picking up a second yellow card 14 minutes from time.

Earlier on Sunday, Malaga moved up to sixth with 39 points, behind Valencia on goal difference, with a 3-1 victory at Real Valladolid. Albert Luque put the promoted side ahead early on and Apono buried a penalty in the 29th minute after Eliseu flung himself to the ground. Valladolid put them under pressure after the break hitting the woodwork twice and a Pedro Oldoni header briefly threatened a fightback, before Nacho made it 3-1 near the end.

Atletico are seventh with 36 points, ahead of Depor on goal differenc
