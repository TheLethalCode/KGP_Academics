 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)A fine arts student died Friday noon after she slipped on a foot overbridge at Shahbagh and fell, police said. Sultana Akter Sumi, 20, a resident of Sabujbagh in the city was a first-year student of Narayanganj Art College. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim said the young woman fell after she slipped on the Shahbagh foot overbridge. The overbridge is still under construction and has not yet been opened for public use. There were loose power cables hanging around and Sumi was caught unawares by a live power cable hanging on the foot overbridge. The contact possibly shocked Sumi and she lost balance and fell. She was also electrocuted, her face was burnt, Karim added. "After Sumi was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the duty doctors declared her dead." He said Sumi's identity was learnt from the papers she had on her person. Her relatives have been informed.
