 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Elections to 45 seats reserved for women in parliament will be held on Mar. 22, election officials said Sunday. According to a circular, signed by additional secretary at the Election Commission Secretariat Rafiqul Islam, the deadline for nomination submission is Feb. 26 and for withdrawal it is Mar. 5. Returning officer, the commission's deputy secretary Jesmin Tuli, said personal data submitted with nominations will have to comply with recent High Court orders. The officials said letters were sent to the Awami League-led ruling alliance, main opposition BNP and Jatiya Party, informing them of the schedule. The Awami League gets an allocation of 36 seats, Jatiya Party candidates will contest four, the BNP-led four-party combine gets five in proportion to party strengths in the House. The commission had earlier set Mar. 22 as a tentative election date, but sought views from the parties before deciding on a final announcement. However, no party opinions were received, said election officials who added that the Commission would announce the full schedule Monday. bdnews2
