 KARACHI, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Mahela Jayawardene became the 10th batsman to score a century against each of the other test countries on Saturday on the opening day of the first test against Pakistan. Jayawardene (136 not out) and Thilan Samaraweera (130 not) shared an unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 229 in Sri Lanka's 406 for three at the close. The Sri Lanka captain hit his 25th test hundred from 169 balls with 15 fours while Samaraweera made his eighth century from just 127 balls with 17 fours. Jayawardene, 31, who will step down as captain after this series, also became the first Sri Lankan and only the 20th player ever to reach 8,000 runs. Pakistan's rustiness was evident in their first test for 14 months as the Sri Lanka batsmen scored at a brisk pace, making 158 runs from 35 overs in the final session
