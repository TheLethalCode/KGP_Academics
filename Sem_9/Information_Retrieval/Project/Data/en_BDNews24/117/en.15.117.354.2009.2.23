 NEW DELHI, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bollywood's A.R. Rahman won Oscars for original score and original song in Danny Boyle's "Slumdog Millionaire" on Sunday, becoming the first Indian composer to strike gold at the annual Hollywood awards. "Slumdog," which tells of a young man looking for love and competing for money on the Indian version of the television game show "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire", also earned Oscars for Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound Mixing and Film Editing at the world's top film honours. Rahman, 43, won the Original Song Oscar for 'Jai Ho'. He had also been named best composer at the Golden Globes last month. Known for his musical versatility -- from romantic compositions to foot-tapping numbers, Rahman has innovated with different instruments and sounds to create some of India's best-known musical hits for nearly two decades.
