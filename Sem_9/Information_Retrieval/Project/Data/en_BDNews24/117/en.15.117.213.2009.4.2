 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)The government is moving to form a single high-powered body to oversee registration of non-governmental and charity organisations, the social welfare minister said Thursday. Another body will be formed to regulate and monitor their activities. AH Mostafa Shahid said some 55,000 organisations including NGOs, orphanages, associations, aid organisations receive money from the social welfare ministry alone. "Due to lack of monitoring, the government does not know how they spend the government allocation." "It's necessary to monitor the NGOs' sources of income, so that the government can step in to prevent any of them if they have ill-motives," Shahid told reporters at the ministry. Asked if the government would take any measures to stop "militant financing", Shahid replied the sources of militant financing were still unknown. Meanwhile, the government has sent letters to local MPs to monitor the activities of madrasas. Money will only be allotted for those institutions in the new budget upon clearance from them. "NGOs are stronger now, with widespread of coverage. This is high time to monitor their activities," he said. A proposal for forming a registration authority, which will get police verification if necessary, before giving an NGO registration, has already been sent to the prime minister. Initiatives have also been taken to form a Social Security Council, which will monitor the activities of already-registered NGOs, charities and voluntary organisations, the minister said. "The council will have the power to cancel registrations of any organisations that will have to renew their certificate every two years." At present, the NGO Bureau, social welfare ministry and the department of cooperatives under the LGRD ministry oversees registration of NGOs, charities and voluntary organisations. "If there is a single authority to register them, then it would be much easier." The finance minister AMA Muhith also appreciated the social welfare ministry initiatives. A registration authority will make it easier to control the activities of NGOs and how the money channelled through them is being used, he said. About the militancy financing, Muhith said the existing money laundering law was enough to prevent militancy financing. bdn
