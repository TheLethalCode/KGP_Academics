 LONDON, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will miss the fourth test against West Indies in Barbados starting on Thursday because of a right hip injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Saturday. A scan on Friday revealed Flintoff, who was troubled by the injury in the drawn third test in Antigua this week, had strained a muscle. "He will be reassessed over the coming days in the hope that he will be fit for the final Test in Trinidad and the one-day series which follows," the ECB said on its website (www.ecb.co.uk)
