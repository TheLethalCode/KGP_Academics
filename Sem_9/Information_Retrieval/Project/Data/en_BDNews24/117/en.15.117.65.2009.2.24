 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The 'Sammilito Parisad' panel, led by former footballer and managing director of Envoy Group, Abdus Salam Morshedi, pulled off a landslide win in the BGMEA elections Tuesday. The Parisad swept all 27 director posts handing a huge defeat to the 'Forum' panel, led by Dekko Group managing director M Shahadat Hossain Kiran. The polling, beginning 8am in Dhaka and Chittagong, saw a record turnout of over 90 percent, said head of the election board Anisuzzaman. Counting began around 6:30pm and closed just before midnight. "We saw the highest number of votes cast in BGMEA's history. Dhaka saw 90.67 percent votes cast and Chittagong 90.47 percent," Anisuzzaman told bdnews24.com. Sme 1,934 voters in Dhaka out of 2,122, and 539 voters out of 556 in Chittagong, cast their ballots, he added. Voting at the Dhaka office was disrupted for an hour in the morning, however, as members of the two panels argued over involvement of FBCCI president Annisul Huq, also a former BGMEA chief. "The polling agents of the Sammilita Parishad panel raised complaints against Annisul Huq for campaigning on behalf of BGMEA's incumbent president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury of the Forum Group," Anisuzzaman, also chairman of Bangladesh Teri Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com. The complainants feared the campaigning might raise question about the neutrality of the polls, he said. Murshedi had said: "It's not right for the head of [one of the] country's top trade bodies to get involved." On the allegation, Huq said: "I didn't come here as the FBCCI president. I came here as a voter and president of the Forum group. "There is no such law in the world that says I am not allowed to cast vote because I head a separate organisation," he said. Chowdhury agreed. Both Huq and he campaigned at the entrance to the polling centre. M Shahadat Hossain Kiran, candidate for president from the Forum group, said "Misunderstanding sometimes takes place. However, it has been resolved." The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association's executive committee has 20 directors in Dhaka and seven in Chittagong. bdnew
