 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury stepped down Thursday, saying there was no need to spell out the reason for his resignation. "I think you all know the situation now prevailing; there's no need for me explain it," the former army chief briefed reporters, before leaving the ACC headquarters in the city at around 4pm. "There is a need for a new leadership now to bring swiftness to the work of the ACC," said Chowdhury. "I would like to talk with about two topics today. First, I've resigned by the will of Allah. "And the second, I express my gratitude and thank the journalists for extending me cooperation in discharging my duties over the last two years," Chowdhury said. He said he worked to prevent corruption and the work required cooperation from all. The corruption issue was yet to be solved. There are lot of opportunities to work, Chowdhury said. "I think there's need for a new leadership to bring swiftness to the work of [the ACC]." He said he believed that his successors will press on with the anti-graft drives. The time to evaluate the two-year activities of the ACC under his leadership was yet to come, as prevention of corruption had been a tough one, Chowdhury said. Without taking any questions from the press, he got in his car and left for his residence, ending his last workday since he took over on Feb. 25, 2007. Senior government officials had earlier told bdnews24.com the ACC chief sent his resignation letter to the Bangabhaban around noon. Chowdhury met with his officials at the headquarters after 3pm and bid them bye. He was appointed on Feb 22 by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led army-installed caretaker government after resigning as an adviser to the caretaker government led by president Iajuddin Ahmed. Chowdhury led the antigraft body in its drive against top political figures during the immediate past caretaker regime. MPs from the ruling Awami League and opposition BNP have since demanded his resignation. In the opening session of the ninth parliament, prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Feb. 4 told parliament that the ACC should be "reconstituted" to ensure its own accountability, giving rise to widespread buzz that it might be a resignation call for the ACC chief. The prime minister had said that the anti-graft drive during the caretaker government's two-year tenure became an "anti-politician drive", and that the ACC was itself tainted by allegations of corruption. The next day, Chowdhury rebuffed the prime minister's allegations against the anti-graft body, saying she was "not right". "The Anticorruption Commission has conducted its drive on specific information and evidence. The remark that the commission was used to shackle politicians is not right," Chowdhury had said. He met the prime minister on Jan. 21 and discussed ACC's management. Hasina and former prime minister Khaleda Zia were detained in jail pending trial for more than a year after the ACC brought a slew of graft charges against them during the emergency government's rule. The commission also sued other high-profile politicians and businessmen including Khaleda's two sons and a score of former ministers. bdnews24.com/s
