<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  A High Court judge left courtroom Monday after repeated interruptions during delivery of a split judgement on the appeals for bail and withdrawal of cases against convicted fugitive VIPs. The senior member of the bench, Justice Syed AB Mahmudul Haq and the other member, Justice Mainul Islam Chowdhury differed when the senior judge had ordered that the VIPs, upon surrender to trial court within eight weeks, would not have to go to jail. In that case, Justice Haq ruled, hearing on their appeal pending in the High Court will be held after execution of vokalatnamas by the VIPs from the trial court. Justice Chowdhury, rejecting their appeal, ordered the VIPs to surrender to trial court, and accordingly they can appeal against the trial court verdict from jail as per applicable law. At one stage, Justice Chowdhury left the courtroom. Explaining the situation, additional attorney general M Enayetur Rahim told reporters that now the issue would be taken up with the chief justice, who will dispatch the matter to a third High Court judge for further decision. He declined comment when asked about the reasons behind Justice Chowdhury's leaving the courtroom. A Supreme Court lawyer, who was present at the courtroom, said barrister Rafiqul Ul Huq, who was acting for one VIP convict, former minister Anwar Hossain Manju, told Justice Chowdhury to mention his argument in the verdict. Referring to a Pakistan High Court's decision in a similar case, Justice Chowdhury observed that in such cases, the convicts were to surrender to trial court, according to that lawyer who spoke on condition that he not be named. Barrister Huq put his argument by saying that according to Section 111 of the constitution, the High Court was bound to follow the verdict of the Supreme Court, not the verdict of the Pakistan High Court. He also referred to the High Court rules. After debates with the counsel for a while, Justice Chowdhury left the courtroom. The convicted fugitive VIPs, who appealed for bail and cancellation of their cases, are Awami League leaders Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Mockbul Hossain, Haji Selim and Md Mohiuddin, BNP leaders Nadim Mostafa, Babul Chowdhury, Abul Bashar, Abu Hanif Patwary, Sabrina Sultana, Masudur Rahman and Mijanur Rahman. However, the High Court rejected the appeals of former AL chief whip Abul Hasnat Abdullah, ASM Mostafa Rashidi Suja and his wife Khodeja Rashidi Suja, as those "were not placed". Alongside barrister Huq, barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud, barrister Amir Ul Islam, barrister Moudud Ahmed and advocate Abdul Baset Mojumder conducted the cases for the applicants. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and additional attorney general M Enayetur Rahim appeared on behalf of the government. bd
