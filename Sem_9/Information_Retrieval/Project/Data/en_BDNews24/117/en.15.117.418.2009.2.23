<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Parliament passed two new laws Monday, one for an independent Election Commission and the other on electoral rolls, with almost the same content as the previous caretaker government ordinances. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed proposed passage of the Election Commission Secretariat Bill 2009 and Electoral Rolls Bill 2009, after tabling them the previous day; they were passed by voice vote. BNP MPs, who attended parliament for the first time after weeks of boycott, shouted "No" as the speaker put the proposal to the vote. BNP leaders had earlier decided to rejoin the House, ending weeks of boycott, as a long-running dispute over seat allocation was finally settled. A parliamentary special committee earlier recommended the two ordinances for the passage along with 52 others of the past caretaker government. The minister tabling the bills said the Election Commission would be independent from government agencies if the EC Secretariat law was passed. The law ministry would enact necessary laws and rules on the Commission's behalf, the minister said. The Commission will get necessary funds directly from the national budget, he added. The nationwide voter list with photographs project, meanwhile, was undertaken under the caretaker government's Electoral Rolls Ordinance 2007. bdnews2
