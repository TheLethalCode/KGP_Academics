 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com) The law minister tabled two bills for passage in parliament Sunday, including one to set up an independent Election Commission, repealing previous ordinances of the caretaker government. The Election Commission Secretariat Ordinance 2008 was promulgated to free the commission from the Prime Minister's Office. The minister also repealed the caretaker government's Electoral Roll Ordinance 2007 and presented a fresh bill with almost the same content. A parliamentary special committee earlier recommended the two ordinances for the passage along with 52 others of the past caretaker government. "As the special committee scrutinised the bills, I think these will not require further recommendations of the concerned parliamentary standing committee," law minister Shafiq Ahmed told the House. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was presiding over the session, and Suranjit Sungupta, chairman of the law ministry's parliamentary standing committee, supported the minister. The minister in his statement on the EC Secretariat bill said the commission would be independent from government agencies if the bill was passed. The law ministry would enact necessary laws and rules on the Commission's behalf, the minister said. "The Commission will get necessary funds directly from the national budget," he added. The nationwide voter list with photographs project, meanwhile, was undertaken under the caretaker government's Electoral Rolls Ordinance 2007. The government has decided to present 54 out of 122 ordinances of the past caretaker government for passage through parliament. bdnews2
