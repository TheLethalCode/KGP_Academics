 JAMMU, India, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bus carrying dozens of passengers in Kashmir skidded off a road and plunged into a river on Wednesday, killing at least 39 people, police said. Another 14 people were seriously injured when the overcrowded bus en route to Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir, plunged 250 metres (800 feet) into a river near a remote village, police said. "The bus driver was negotiating a sharp bend when he lost control and it rolled down into the Chenab river," A.R. Baig, a police spokesman said. Rescuers, mostly villagers, helped pull bodies from the river and took survivors to a hospital.
