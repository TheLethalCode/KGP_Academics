Simultaneously, Selima Rahman, responsible for Khulna metropolitan city, interviewed the Khulna city leaders of the party. "After the field-level perceptions and opinions are compiled as a report and presented before the standing committee, the 'appropriate next steps' will be considered," secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told bdnews24.com at noon. "Six organising committees are expected to submit their reports separately within a few days, which will be reviewed by the standing committee before necessary measures are taken."
