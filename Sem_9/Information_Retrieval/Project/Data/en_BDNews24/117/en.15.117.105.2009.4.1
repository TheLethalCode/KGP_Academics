A case was filed against the three on Mar. 30by ASP Fazlul Kabir, the last investigation officer in the caseaccusing them of presenting a false witness in court and concealing information during the investigation of the brutal grenade attack. The accused are former assistant superintendents of police Abdur Rashid and Munshi Atiqul Islam and special superintendent of police Ruhul Amin.
