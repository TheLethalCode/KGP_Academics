 Dhaka, February 22 (bdnews24.com) The High Court on Sunday granted two months' ad interim anticipatory bail to former Awami League MP Joynul Hazari in a graft case and ordered him to surrender to trial court in eleven cases within eight weeks. The former MP surrendered before the court around 2pm seeking bail in a total of 14 cases. He secured bail in a corruption case relating to purchase of a car. The eleven other cases involve allegations of murder, money laundering and looting. A High Court bench of justices Syed AB Mahmudul Haque and Mainul Islam Chowdhury also called for records of the two remaining cases filed under the Public Safety Act. They asked the government not to arrest or harass Hazari until his surrender. Hazari fled the country on Mar 17, 2001 and returned home on Feb 14 this year. He has already been tried in absentia in five separate cases and awarded 60 years' imprisonment. Senior advocate Abdul Baset Majumder moved the bail applications for Hazari, while advocate AKM Enayetullah Chowdhury assisted him. Hazari said he tried to surrender to authorities in 2001, but he was unable top do so as law enforcers then surrounded the court premises to arrest him. His counsel Majumder submitted that Hazari was thrice-elected member of parliament. "He surrendered in this court and will be arrested if he is not granted bail," said the lawyer.
