 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke remained defiant over the Allen Stanford scandal on Wednesday, saying the idea of resigning over the affair was not on the agenda. Clarke, who has just been re-elected, has been criticised in the British media and by some people within the sport over his role in England's participation in last year's $20 million winner-takes-all Stanford Super Series. Texan billionaire Stanford was last week charged by U.S. financial regulators with an $8 billion fraud. "No one is going to resign -- it's just not on the agenda," Clarke told the Daily Telegraph in an interview. "There are a lot of things that have happened and lots of things that will be debated. But this game (cricket) will start to move forward." Asked if the Stanford saga had damaged his reputation, Clarke said: "Stanford is not going to be my legacy. My legacy is going to be test cricket." Clarke helped negotiate the lucrative deal with Stanford last year that would have involved five $20 million matches and a Twenty 20 quadrangular series that was scheduled to start at Lord's in May. England's first class counties were also in line to benefit from Stanford's involvement. The ECB last week severed all its ties with Stanford, who has denied any wrongdoing. No criminal charges have been filed against Stanford. "We entered into the Stanford transaction in good faith," Clarke said. "Like many sporting bodies we carried out our side of the contract and he carried out his and we were paid. We then passed those funds on to the benefit of the game." Clarke said England had received "more lucrative" offers from the Middle East and Far East but any future deals would need to be properly evaluated. "If someone offers us a huge amount of money we decide has been made legitimately from unimpeachable methods, then we need to decide whether we want the team to play as England or do we give them another name?" he said.
