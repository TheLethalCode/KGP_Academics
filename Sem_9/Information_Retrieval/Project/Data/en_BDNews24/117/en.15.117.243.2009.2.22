 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Biman stretched their unbeaten run in the Premier Division Cricket League to five matches with a four-wicket win over Old DOHS at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground on Sunday. Imran Ahmed struck a well-composed century to guide Abahani to a 53-run win over Victoria Sporting Club, who tasted their fourth defeat in five matches, at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Elsewhere, centuries from Shamsur Rahman Shuvo and Rokibul Hasan helped Mohammedan Sporting Club return to winning ways with a massive 98-run victory over lowly City Club, who continued their miserable run with a fifth straight defeat, at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Biman stay atop with 10 points from five matches, two ahead of Abahani and DOHS. Mohammedan have five points from as many matches. Biman vs DOHS Put in to bat, DOHS were caught in a spin web and were bundled out for 192 with three balls to go. Left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan led the attack with four for 20 while spinners Nabil Samad (2/35) and Sanwar Hossain (1/14) provided fine assistance. Strike bower Shahadat Hossain, however, made inroads to return with 2-35 and new-ball partner M Shahajada took one for 36. Mahmuduallah Riad was the most successful DOHS batsman, who hit 41 off 62 balls. Fazle Rabbi and Abul Hasan Razu chipped in with 35 and 28 to help DOHS post a respectable total. Biman, in reply, reached 195-6 in 46.2 overs, thanks to a gritty 75-run knock from opener Javed Omar, who consumed 137 balls to club seven fours. One-down Zahirul Islam and Shakib added 35 and 32 as Biman inflicted a first defeat for DOHS in their fifth match. Abahani vs Victoria Electing to bat, Abahani got into trouble when they lost opener Tamim Iqbal in just the fourth delivery. However, Rony Talukdar and one-down Imran Ahmed rescued the defending champions with a 70-run second wicket partnership. Tapash Gosh broke the stand having Rony caught by Amit Majumdar for 39, but Imran stood tall to propel the side to a challenging total of 280-7 in 50 overs. Imran struck 109 off 140 balls studded with nine fours while Nasir Hossain made a quickfire 66 off 51 balls smashing six fours and two sixes. In reply, Victoria openers Amit and Arman Hossain gave Abahani a scare with a brisk 114-run opening stand before third-change bowler Venu Gopal separated them, having Arman caught by Nasir for 56. Then, paceman Nazmul Hossain removed Amit for 55, triggering a middle-order collapse and Victoria became 143-5 from 121-2. Middle-order batsman Arafat Salahuddin staged a fight-back with 52 though the effort was not enough for Victoria, who eventually ended up on 227-7 in the stipulated 50 overs. MSC vs City Club Opting to bat, Mohammedan saw both openers depart for just two runs inside three overs before Shamsur Rahman and Rokibul Hasan stole the show, slamming centuries. Shamsur and Rokibul together took Mohammedan to 196-3 before the latter was dismissed by Ghayour Abbas. Rokibul, however, completed his century to finish on 102 off 125 balls with the helps of nine fours. Shamsur put on another 112 for the fourth wicket with Marshal Ayub, who hit a whirlwind 69 off just 32 balls hitting nine fours and two sixes. Shamsur was the fourth batsman out, but not before he hammered 127 studded with 10 fours and three sixes and Mohammedan posted a big total of 317-5 in 50 overs. In reply, opener Rasel Al Mamun and lower-order Sirajullah Khaled smashed 67 and 50 to help City Club finish on 219-7, but could not avert their fifth straight defeat in as many matches. bd
