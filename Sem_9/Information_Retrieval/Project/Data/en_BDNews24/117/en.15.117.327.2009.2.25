<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  Nearly 12 hours into an armed rebellion to seek better pay and break army control, the Bangladesh Rifles mutineers said Wednesday night they would not surrender arms until the army was fully withdrawn from around the Peelkhana headquarters and 46 BDR units countrywide. Heavy gunfire again rocked the compound at around 9:25pm. The rebellious border guards had earlier agreed to surrender their arms after a two-hour meeting with the prime minister at her official residence, government spokesman Nanak told reporters. But BDR men inside the compound began demanding through loudspeakers that the army withdraw otherwise, as they feared the military could "finish them off at any time". They said they would not surrender arms for the security of its members. They agreed to talk to the prime minister in a video conference. Nanak and Awami League MP Mirza Azam were briefed of the BDR rebels' refusal to surrender when they went to Jigatola in Dhanmondi near the headquarters at 8:25pm. Azam and police officials went to urge the border guards to release the women and children in the compound. The border guards said they could not do that and would act as the situation developed. The BDR mutineers had been negotiating within the complex since late evening after another local MP gave them half-hour to say when they would surrender arms. Awami League MP Fazle Noor Tapash along with inspector general of police Noor Mohammad went to the main Dhanmondi gate of the headquarters around 7:50pm. He asked the BDR leaders about the surrender of arms, which they had agreed to in the meeting with the prime minister. The MP told them he would be waiting at the entrance to know know their decision. One BDR member asked the MP if the army would storm the compound or any measures would be taken against the rebels. He assured them nothing of the sort would happen. Nanak earlier briefed reporters at around 5:45pm on the outcome of the meeting between the prime minister and a team of BDR representatives. The chiefs of the army, navy and air force, the director general of Rapid Action Battalion and the inspector general of police also sat in the talks at the prime minister's Hare Road residence. The prime minister has pledged to meet "our just demands", the BDR team announced through loudspeaker after returning to the headquarters around 6:40pm. The prime minister announced a general amnesty and no one would be tried for the incident, they told their expectant comrades. The representatives added that the home minister would visit them and they would surrender arms to her. They said they talked to the army chief and he assured them that the army troops, who deployed around the BDR headquarters, would return to barracks. "We will also return to barracks after surrendering our arms," one of the border guards said. They said the army officers residing inside the BDR complex would be allowed to leave with their families. Some 25 gunshots fired as the outcome of the meeting was being announced. bdnews24.com/s
