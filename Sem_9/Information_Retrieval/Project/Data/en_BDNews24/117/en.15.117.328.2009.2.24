 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government tabled Tuesday for passage in parliament the law on Upazila councils that makes the MPs advisors to the local government body. But the new law will not force the councils to accept the suggestions of the MPs on development works at the grassroots. The Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Bill 2009 was passed, stripping the armed forces and paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles of the powers to make arrests without warrant on violation of electoral rules on election day. Two more laws were placed while 10 others were passed in Tuesday's sitting. Most of the laws had contents almost similar to those in the ordinances made by the military-installed caretaker government. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam tabled the Upazila law when the BNP-led opposition had walked out. The government also annulled the Local Government (Upazila) Ordinance 2008. The law was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on the local government ministry for scrutiny and to prepare recommendations in 15 days. The emergency government made the ordinance in 2008 and annulled the Upazila act of 1998 in violation of the constitution. The Local Government Ordinance 2008 deleted a section of the Local Government (Upazila) Act, 1998 which forced the Upazila councils to accept the suggestions of the MPs. Finance minister AMA Muhith piloted the Money Laundering Prevention Bill 2009, The Finance (2007-2008) Bill 2009, the Finance (2007-2008) Bill 2009, The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2009 and The National Board of Revenue (Amendment) Bill 2009 before the House. They were approved by voice vote. The House also rejected a few motions moved by the opposition lawmakers seeking disapproval of the bills, by voice vote too. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury tabled The President's (Remuneration and Privileges) (Amendment) Bill, 2009 and it was passed too. The finance minister moved Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (Amendment) Bill 2009. The law minister introduced the Bangladesh Laws (Revision and Declaration) (Amendment) Bill 2009 and the Anti-Terrorism Bill 2009. The bills were passed in absence of the opposition MPs. The House also accepted the Bangladesh Flag Vessels (Protection) (Amendment) Bill 2009 tabled by shipping minister Md Afsarul Amin and the Artha Rin Adalat (Amendment) Bill 2009 by law minister Shafiq Ahmed. The House sent the bills to the parliamentary standing committees on the ministries concerned for recommendations within 10 days. bdnews
