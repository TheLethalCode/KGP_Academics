 PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil, April 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luis Fabiano scored twice as Brazil strolled to a 3-0 win over demoralised Peru in a hopelessly one-sided World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Brazil, who have 21 points from 12 games, moved up to second in the South American group and cut the gap between themselves and leaders Paraguay to three points.

After that, it was a question of how many Brazil would score. The second came nine minutes later when Elano chipped the ball over the Peru defence and Luis Fabiano chested it down and scored despite not hitting the ball cleanly. Butron prevented Brazil from adding a third before halftime when he denied Robinho with his feet after the hosts sliced through the Peru defence, then saved a powerful drive by Daniel Alves. Luis Fabiano was denied a hat-trick when Butron tipped over his header on the hour. But midfielder Felipe Melo added the third four minutes later when he won two challenges in midfield, burst into the area and placed his shot between Butron and the near post. Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar, who almost single-handedly earned Brazil their draw on Sunday, prevented Peru from scoring when he tipped Alexander Sanchez's drive onto the cross
