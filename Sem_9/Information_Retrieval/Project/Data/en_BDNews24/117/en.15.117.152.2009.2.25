<TITLE> Voter slips to be posted for DCC polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will send "voter slips" out by post ahead of the Dhaka City Corporation election. Election officials said a good number of voters had to face hassles during the Dec. 29 general election, as many of them could not find their voting stations or did not know their voter serial numbers, forcing the EC to open "help lines". "It is possible to send voter slips to all DCC voters within one month," Bangladesh Post Office director general Mobasher ur Rahman said Tuesday after holding a meeting with EC secretary Muhammad Humiyun Kabir. The initiative would be a first, as polling agents have previously provided voters with such slips. EC officials say sending out the slips to 3,525,459 DCC voters would cost an estimated Tk 1 crore. The EC has proposed holding the long-due DCC mayoral election between Apr. 10 and 12. If local government authorities agree on a date, the schedule will be announced by the first week of March, say EC officials. bdnews2
