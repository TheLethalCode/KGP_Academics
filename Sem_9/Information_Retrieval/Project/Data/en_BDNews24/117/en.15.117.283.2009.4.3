 London, Apr, 3 (bdnews24.com/BBC)- Barack Obama has hailed the G20 summit as a historic turning point in the pursuit of world economic recovery. Leaders pledged new spending and tougher financial regulations, in what the US leader called an unprecedented set of actions to ease the crisis. He now heads to Strasbourg for talks with the French and German leaders, before a Nato summit begins. Security is extremely tight in the city, with tens of thousands of troops and police deployed. On Thursday police clashed with protesters, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to stop a crowd getting to the city centre. Masked protesters smashed bus shelters and set fire to rubbish bins. French news agency AFP reported around 100 arrests.
