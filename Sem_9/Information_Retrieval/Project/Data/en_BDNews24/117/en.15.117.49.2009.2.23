 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP MPs have demanded trial of army chief Moeen U Ahmed for "torturing people" in the two years of emergency government. Speaking in parliament on Monday on the supplementary budget for 2006-7 fiscal year, made by the caretaker government, the BNP MPs asked the government to also try former President Iajuddin Ahmed and former caretaker government head Fakhruddin Ahmed for the same reason. "We are the victims of tortures of the 'IMF': I stands for Iajuddin, M for Moeen Uddin and F for Fakhruddin," Shahid Uddin Chowdhury Anny MP said. "First try them, then the budget can be approved," the BNP MP said, speaking on the budgets during the last two years. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhit placed one supplementary and two original budgets for 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 fiscal years for parliament to pass. "This parliament can at least take a censure proposal against the IMF," said A B M Ashraf Uddin Nizam, another BNP MP. "Mr speaker, please look where the tax money went. Please check who suggested us to eat potato," said opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque. "More than 100 Mercedes were bought and where did those go?" "Please, look into it how he writes book being in service. Which rules permit this," he said, referring to the army chief's recent book on politics of Bangladesh. He said the caretaker government tried to implement the so-called "Minus Two Theory". Gen Moeen had urged people to eat potato instead of rice as rice price soared during the tenure of the military-installed interim administration. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury in his speech said the constitution did not allow anyone to impose tax on people without parliament's approval. He said the caretaker government violated the constitution in making the budget for 2007-08 fiscal year. "Please, place the budget after taking actions against those who violated the constitution. Then the House will consider the passage of the budgets," Chowdhury said. He said all politicians were the victims of the two years of unconstitutional rule. bdnews
