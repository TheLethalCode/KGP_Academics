 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid admitted to a mistake in parliament Monday by not including any opposition MP in a panel of chairmen who will run the House in his absence. He also urged MPs to point out his mistakes. "I admit that it was a mistake. I was in a hurry to prepare a panel of chairmen," Hamid said while clarifying his position on a BNP MP's allegation of partisanship. "I will confess what is wrong. Please, find out my mistakes," he told parliament. Hamid said there was no instruction from the treasury bench to exclude the opposition from the list of panel chairs. The MPs including the prime minister appreciated Hamid by thumbing desks. Chief whip of opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque alleged that the speaker had broken tradition by not including an opposition MP in the first session's panel of chairmen. Hamid on Jan 25 announced a five-member panel of chairmen, all of whom were drawn from the ruling coalition. The members of the panel chairs preside over the sessions of parliament in absence of the speaker and deputy speaker. At the first sitting of any session, speaker prepares a new panel of chairmen. "Mr Speaker you announced a panel of chairmen on Jan 25. You did not include a single member from the opposition. "This is for the first time in parliamentary practices that such an incident took place," said Farroque. bdn
