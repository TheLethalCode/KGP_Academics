 LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said on Tuesday it would not stand in the way of an appeal by two Italian footballers banned for a year after turning up late for a 2007 drugs test. Napoli winger Daniele Mannini and Brescia striker Davide Possanzini were suspended last month by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after WADA challenged the original 15-day ban issued by the Italian Olympic Committee.

"If they can substantiate to the court there is new factual information to justify it then there should be a re-hearing. But it will be up to the court to decide." The decision to ban Mannini and Possanzini was strongly condemned by the Italian players' association which arranged a 15-minute delay to the kickoff of all Serie A and B matches at the weekend following the CAS announcement. The association described the verdict as a "scandalous sentence" while the players' clubs and the Italian soccer federation said they would help back any appea
