 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury stepped down Thursday, saying there was no need to spell out the reason for his resignation. "I think you all know the situation now prevailing; there's no need for me explain it," the former army chief briefed reporters, before leaving the ACC headquarters in the city at around 4pm. "There is a need for a new leadership now to bring swiftness in the work of the ACC," said Chowdhury. Without receiving any questions from the press, he stepped into his car and left for his residence, ending his last workday since he took over on Feb. 25, 2007. Senior government officials had earlier told bdnews24.com the ACC chief sent his resignation letter to the Bangabhaban around noon. Chowdhury met with his officials at the headquarters after 3pm and bid them farewell. He was appointed on Feb 22 by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led army-installed caretaker government after resigning as an adviser to the caretaker government led by president Iajuddin Ahmed. Chowdhury led the antigraft body in its drive against top political figures during the immediate past caretaker regime. MPs from the ruling Awami League and opposition BNP have since demanded his resignation. bdnews24.com/s
