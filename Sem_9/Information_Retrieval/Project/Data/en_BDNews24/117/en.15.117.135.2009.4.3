 LONDON Fri Apr 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some US allies are open to boosting troop levels in Afghanistan to back President Barack Obama's new strategy but he will not press for concrete commitments at this week's NATO summit, US officials said. "The NATO summit is not a pledging conference" on manpower and resources for the Afghan war effort, said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, outlining Obama's approach to leaders who have mostly seemed reluctant to deploy more forces. While making clear Obama would not push too hard at the summit that opens late on Friday on the French-German border, Clinton echoed his assertion that more international help was needed to turn the tide in Afghanistan. She said Obama would start talking "specifics" at the NATO meeting and also at a European Union summit next week in Prague. Obama wants NATO backing for a strategy he unveiled last week to tackle a worsening insurgency in Afghanistan, a conflict he inherited from his predecessor George W. Bush.

"So I expect there will be additional troop contributions." He said there was a new mood in NATO that "we're all in this together, and we'll wait and see exactly how far that takes us." But he and Clinton stopping short of naming which allies were willing to step up involvement. Clinton said the new US administration had decided to give allies time to "take a hard look at what they believe is their highest and best contribution." Asked about bids by Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO, Clinton said: "Membership in NATO is dependent on meeting a set of standards, and we have teed up the process for both. "They are very interested in continuing to pursue membership, and the NATO process is moving on." Despite that, the Obama administration has signalled NATO expansion into former Soviet republics will be on the back burner for now, in contrast to Bush's push to bring the
