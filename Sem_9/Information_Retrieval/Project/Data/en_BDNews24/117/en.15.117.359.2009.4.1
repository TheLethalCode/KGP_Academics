<TITLE> China to spend $1.2 billion on quake-zone schools </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Chinese government will spend an extra 8 billion yuan ($1.17 billion) this year on making schools in earthquake-prone areas safer, state media said on Thursday. Thousands of students died in last year's deadly Sichuan earthquake after shoddily built school buildings collapsed, even as surrounding buildings withstood the devastating tremors. China has never given a final figure for the school deaths, but overall more than 80,000 people were killed and thousands more listed as missing from May's disaster. Bereaved parents say corrupt officials or construction firms pocketed some of the cash meant for schoolrooms and instead bought cheaper, sub-standard materials. But the government is now going to reinforce schools in earthquake-susceptible areas, state newspapers said, citing a government statement issued following a meeting of the State Council, or Cabinet. "The safety of school buildings directly relates to the safety of teachers and students, and is related to social harmony and stability," said the statement, a copy of which was carried on the Education Ministry's website (www.moe.edu.cn). The project will take three years, it added, and be focused on schools in the poorer central and western parts of the country, where the strongest earthquakes normally hit.
