<TITLE> Somber New Year for Tibetans a year after unrest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TONGREN, China, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tibetans living near the birthplace of the Dalai Lama marked their New Year on Wednesday in quiet defiance and mourning a year after the region erupted in deadly riots and protests against Chinese rule. Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the exile of the Dalai Lama, following a failed insurrection against China, and there is intense security across Tibet itself and many neighboring areas with many ethnic Tibetans. Travel agencies in Tibet have been told that no foreign tourists may enter the region in March, a Lhasa-based agent said. Tibet was closed to foreigners after the March 2008 demonstrations, but had been accessible over the winter. Qinghai, an arid, mountainous province of China next to the Tibet Autonomous Region, is the early childhood home of the Dalai Lama, the Buddhist leader whom Beijing blames for inspiring the unrest that swept Tibetan areas last year, prompting a widespread security crackdown. Tibet's regional capital, Lhasa, is still under tight security. Last year, protests led by monks gave way to anti-Chinese riots on March 14 that killed 19 people. The subsequent crackdown prompted overseas protests which disrupted the international leg of the Beijing Olympic torch relay. Beijing is determined to use this year to argue that its spending, schools and religious policies have done far more for Tibetans than the Dalai Lama and his calls for full regional autonomy. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly denied being a separatist or supporting violent unrest. Liu Yunshan, head of the ruling Communist Party's propaganda department, said it was undeniable that government policies in Tibet "have created one miracle after another," Xinhua news agency reported. At an exhibition on Tibet in Beijing on Tuesday, Liu said: "Only adhering to Communist Party leadership ... can build a united, prosperous, democratic and civilized Tibet." Nonetheless, unemployment, especially for young people, contributed to the dissatisfaction that helped fuel the demonstrations, Lousang Zhendui, a scholar at the China Tibetology Research Center, told reporters in Beijing. QUIET AND REFLECTION In Tongren, an overwhelmingly Tibetan part of Qinghai, locals said they would quietly show their unhappiness by marking their traditional New Year, or Losar, bereft of celebration. About 40 riot police wielding shields and batons, but no firearms, marched along the streets in the afternoon, but security was light compared to many Tibetan areas. "There is nothing to celebrate after what happened last year," said Zhihua, a Tibetan Buddhist lama, speaking in heavily accented Mandarin. Many Tibetans use just one name. "There's nothing planned today," said another monk, Jigmye. "We're remembering the dead from last year. It's a Tibetan tradition." The date of the Tibetan New Year depends on the lunar cycle, and most Tibetans mark this year's from Wednesday. In Dharamsala, the north Indian city headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile, hundreds of people, including monks, women and children in traditional clothes, filed into the main Buddhist temple to offer prayers. Celebrations were low-key without the usual fireworks to protest what exiled leaders said was a continued Chinese crackdown in Tibet. Many exiled Tibetans in India called their friends and families who are back in Tibet on Losar, a few complaining that calls were either disconnected or they were unable to get through to parts of western Sichuan and Qinghai. In Nepal, home to more than 20,000 Tibetan refugees, hundreds of exiles held quiet prayers, saying they were not celebrating the New Year because of last year's killings. Last year, thousands of Tibetans were arrested in Kathmandu for organizing anti-China protests. In Tongren, a steady flow of locals walked to a monastery to make offerings and turn prayer wheels while chanting and clutching beads. There were no displays of joy, but also none of public protest. A few firecrackers could be heard. Inside the monastery there were several portraits of the Dalai Lama, a show of devotion unthinkable in more strictly controlled areas. "This is a time for quiet and reflection. Last year was very noisy," said Riden, a 23-year-old resident, speaking in English. He said the snow falling throughout the morning was a sign of a better year ahead.
