 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Mohamed Bin Hammam will visit Bangladesh in March. Hammam will also be accompanied by 12 to 13 presidents of the different football federations, said BFF president Kazi Salahuddin. The AFC boss is scheduled to arrive here on March 12. "After being elected BFF president, I had invited him (Hammam) to visit Bangladesh. He is probably coming to see the activities of the new committee," Salahuddin told reporters on Monday. Hammam visited Bangladesh last year to unveil the foundation stone of the artificial football turf adjacent to BFF House under the FIFA Goal Project-2. BFF is taking Hammam's visit seriously. "Football is my life. I will certainly discuss with him how Bangladesh's football could progress. And I am sure I will get specific direction from him," said legendary footballer Salahuddin. bdnew
