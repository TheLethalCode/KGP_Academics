<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia to leave her house in cantonment. "I will request her to leave her 6 Shaheed Mainul Road house in Dhaka Cantonment," she told parliament in reply to a question by Awami League Abdul Matin Khasru MP. "No member of parliament, no leader of the opposition, should live in the cantonment," Hasina said in reply to another query of AL MP for Narayanganj-2 Nazrul Islam Babu. "The cabinet will decide whether to cancel this allotted house. I alone cannot decide," she said. Hasina also said her younger sister Sheikh Rehana would hand to the slain BDR officers' families the one-bigha land in Dhanmondi which she was allotted in 2001. "We will construct apartments there for some of the families of the (martyred army officers," Hasina declared. The BNP-led coalition government cancelled the land allocation for Rehana and established Dhanmondi Police Station there. The leader of the House said the government would build apartments on the 2.72-acre land of Khaleda and allocate two apartments to each of the families of army officers slain in the BDR mutiny, should the opposition leader return the house. She said the house was allocated to Khaleda in violation of the Cantonment Board Law. Each of the family can live in one flat and rent the other. Khaleda should give the house to the officers' families, Hasina added. The prime minister said she checked the minutes of the June 12, 1981 cabinet meeting and found out that it did not allot the house to Khaleda. Instead, it allocated a house to her in Gulshan, Hasina added. Hasina alleged Khaleda was supposed to leave the Mainul Road house, rather she took the property in her name in addition to a house in Gulshan. Khasru told the prime minister that the house was leased out to Khaleda for 99 years with some conditions including restrictions on political activities in the house. But Khaleda breached the terms by carrying out political activities at the house, and the head office of Dandy Dyeing was set up there, Khasru added. The AL MP wanted to know whether the government would cancel the lease on breach of conditions. Hasina said the cantonment authorities cannot allocate the house to Khaleda, but they did so violating laws. Khaleda's family mortgaged the house to bank for loan in violation of the lease condition, she added. To a query of Jatiya Party MP Hafizuddin Ahmed, the prime minister said it was former president HM Ershad who was responsible for allocation of the Mainul Road house to Khaleda. "Ershad allotted the house to [Khaleda] violating law to make his sister-in-law (Khaleda) happy," Hasina said. She said the former prime minister was no more insolvent and in fact, now had crores of taka and so, she should leave the house. The prime minister also referred to the assets statement Khaleda had submitted to the Anticorruption Commission and said: "We heard (former president) Ziaur Rahman left nothing for her family. "But the wealth statement filed shows Ziaur Rahman purchased land in Savar and Uttarkhan in Uttara. "Why should you, being a political leader, live in the cantonment? You were allotted another house on one-and-a-half-bigha land in Gulshan, why will you keep the army land?" The premier told the House about the facilities given to Khaleda and her two sons after the assassination of her husband. She was assigned one house in Gulshan and another in cantonment, she and her two sons got Tk 10 lakh, Tk 1,500 a month in bursary to facilitate studies of her sons until 1986, and one vehicle with fuel and a driver. Hasina said Khaleda was now living at the cantonment home renting the Gulshan house and was enjoying all other facilities. "But my sister and I did not take any state facilities," she pointed out. Hasina and Rehana lost most of their family including father, independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to a military putsch on Aug 15, 1975. bdnews24.
