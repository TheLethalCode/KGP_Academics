 Dhaka, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)  About 20 million people of the country are still under direct threat from arsenic poisoning, posing a serious challenge for Bangladesh towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, according to newly launched report. "The arsenic crisis spread in the country in 1990," health minister AFM Ruhul Haque said at the launch of the publication, 'Towards an Arsenic Safe Environment in Bangladesh', organised jointly by the United Nations and Bangladesh government. "The government is working to mitigate the problem. Health professionals, officials and staffs are being trained to tackle the issue," he said. The minister also urged the people to create mass consciousness about the issue and 'not to panic'. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said, "Everyone in the country should be provided with safe drinking water. Therefore, all should put stress on surface water rather than underground water. The speakers at the programme said that special actions should be taken immediately to mitigate the arsenic threat as an estimated 20 million people still drink arsenic-contaminated water. Renata Lok Dessallien, UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, and A Atiq Rahman, executive chief of Bangladesh Centre for Advance Studies, also spoke at the programme.
