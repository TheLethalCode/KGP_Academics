 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered opposition chief whip Jainul Abdin Farroque to surrender to six different district courts within the next eight weeks in connection with separate cases accusing him of defaming the prime minister's son. A High Court bench of justices Md Abdul Wahab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaque issued the order on Monday following a petition by Farroque's lawyers for anticipatory bail. The bench directed the trial courts to grant Farroque bail following his surrender in connection with the cases. The High Court also directed the government not to harass or arrest him in connection with the cases in the next eight weeks. The six cases have been filed against him in Rangpur, Shariatpur, Nilphamari, Sylhet, Pabna and Chittagong courts. He faces a further five similar cases. The cases have been filed by supporters of Awami League and associate organisations. They accuse the opposition chief whip of defaming the prime-minister's son, Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, in parliament on March 11, by alleging that Wazeb was involved in illegal Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations. Among the six cases, Farroque has been asked to appear before the courts of: Magura district magistrate Sheikh Jalal Uddin on May 10 to face charges laid by the district's Jubo League convener Enamul Haque Hirak; Rangpur district magistrate Nityananda Barman on April 19 to face a Tk 100 crore defamation suit filed by Rangpur's Chhatra League vice president Jasem Bin Jummon; and Bogra magistrate Md Anwar Hosain on 4 May in another Tk 100 crore case filed by the district's Chhatra League president Subhasish Podder Liton. Farroque was represented in the High Court Monday by Moudud Ahmed, Rafiqul Islam Miah, and Mahmudduddin Khokon. bdnews
