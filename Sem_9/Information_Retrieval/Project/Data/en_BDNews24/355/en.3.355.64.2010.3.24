US lawmakers this month urged the Obama administration to focus more attention on LeT militants and push Islamabad harder to rein in the group. LeT, one of the largest and best-funded Islamist militant groups in South Asia, was nurtured by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency to fight India in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. India wants Pakistan to prosecute LeT founder Hafiz Saeed, who it blames for the Mumbai rampage that killed 166 people. "It is the religious obligation of Mujahideen to fight the invaders and oppressors across the world," Kashmiri told a rally in Kotli, a town in Pakistani Kashmir. Pakistani authorities officially banned LeT after it was blamed for an attack on the Indian parliament in 2001, but analysts say the group is still unofficially tolerated as it is not believed to have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. Pakistan has in recent months offered greater cooperation in tracking down Taliban militants from neighbouring Afghanistan, but US officials are frustrated this has not extended to LeT extremists.
