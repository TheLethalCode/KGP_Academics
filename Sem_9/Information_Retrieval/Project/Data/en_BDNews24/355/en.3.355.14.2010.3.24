 Dhaka Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has filed a case against former president Iajuddin Ahmed, ex-chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed and others for allegedly attempting to poison prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her detention in special jail in 2007-08. Advocate AKM Fakhrul Islam filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on behalf of the BNP leader on Wednesday. Sheikh Hasina and six others have been named witnesses in the case. The prime minister herself alleged in parliament, on Mar 11, that there was an attempt to murder her by "slow poisoning" during her detention in special jail on graft charges by the past caretaker government . Chowdhury, an MP from Chittagong, said in his complaint: "Sheikh Hasina is the leader of parliament ... There were attempts on her life." The BNP leader said the matter had "infuriated" him. "So I decided to file a case over the matter," he said in the case statement. Other accused are general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, Maj Gen ATM Amin, Brig Gen Fazlul Haque Bari and inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Jakir Hossain. The hearing is likely to be held in the court of metropolitan magistrate AKM Imdadaul Haque later in the day. b
