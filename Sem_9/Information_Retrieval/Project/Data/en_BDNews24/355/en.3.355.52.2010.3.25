 Dinajpur, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Coal Barapukuria Coal Mine Workers' Union say they will continue their strike into a third day following the failure of a meeting on Thursday afternoon between the workers and the the Chinese contractor who employs them. Over 1,000 miners started their strike on Monday demanding a pay rise. Zahidul Islam Ratan, the union treasurer, said that the meeting, which was mediated by the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL), failed because the chinese contractor refused to agree to pay the workers 1 percent more than the workers employed by the Moddhopara Granite Mining Company Limited (MGMCL). The workers' movement will continue until this demand is met, he added. BCMCL managing director Mir Abdul Matin on Wednesday explained to bdnews24.com that the miners of MGMCL are recruited by the government, while the BCMCL miners are appointed on a temporary basis under the authority of the Chinese company." "The Chinese company did not agree with the 'illogical demand'," Matin said. Officials and staff of the mining company continue to remain confined inside the company compound as the strikers have prevented them from leaving since the strike began. Habib Uddin Ahmed, president of BCMCL officers' welfare association, said the families of some 500 staff members and around 200 Chinese citizens inside the compound were facing severe problems due to lack of food and medicine. He said, that they have asked for help from the Dinajpur Red Crescent unit, but they have had no response till now (evening). Last month, a similar strike demanding a profit bonus was called off after just two days following assurances from the employers. According to a tripartite deal between BCMCL, XMC and workers signed in 2008, miners are supposed to get their annual increment each February following discussions. Robiul Islam, president of Barapukuria Coal Mine Workers' Union, had earlier explained that the workers decided to strike again as the authorities had broken their promise to take a decision about raising their salaries by March 20. bdnews2
