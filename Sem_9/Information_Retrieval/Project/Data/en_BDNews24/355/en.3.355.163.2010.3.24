However, there was some hope that as settlement to end the strike may end as a meeting started this afternoon between the workers and coal mine officials Until this morning, the strikers had demonstrated outside the coal mine's office compound preventing mine officials from leaving. Over 1,000 miners started the strike from Monday midnight. Last month, a similar strike demanding a profit bonus was called off after just two days following assurances from the employers. Robiul Islam, president of Barapukuria Coal Mine Workers' Union had earlier explained that the workers decided to strike again as the authorities had broken their promise to take a decision about raising their salaries by March 20.
