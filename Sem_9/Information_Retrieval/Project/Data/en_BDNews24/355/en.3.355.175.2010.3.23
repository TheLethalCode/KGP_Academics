 LONDON, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three former cabinet ministers were suspended by the Labour party on Monday after being secretly filmed claiming they could use their position to influence government policy for cash. Former Defence Minister Geoff Hoon, Stephen Byers and Patricia Hewitt were suspended pending further investigation following the screening of a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, in which all three were secretly filmed meeting a bogus American lobby firm. Margaret Moran, a Labour MP, who also featured in the programme has also been suspended. All four are due to stand down at an election due by June. "The Labour Party expects the highest standards of its representatives and believes that they have a duty to be transparent and accountable servants to their constituents at all times," a Labour party statement said. Undercover footage showed Byers, a former transport secretary, telling reporters he could be hired for 5,000 pounds a day in exchange for access to ministers, secret government information and advice on influencing policy. Earlier Byers referred himself to parliament's standards watchdog after a Sunday newspaper published allegations saying he could be paid like "a cab for hire" to lobby the government, but denied any wrongdoing. "I am confident that he will confirm that I've complied with the MPs' code of conduct and have fully disclosed my outside interests," Byers said in a statement. EXPENSES SCANDAL There was a public outcry last year after details of MPs' expenses claims for everything from bathplugs to pornographic films were stolen and leaked to the newspapers. Conservative leader David Cameron, whose own party was mired in sleaze allegations in the 1990s, said the government should also investigate the Byers allegations. "This goes to the heart of the question of the integrity of government," Cameron said. The timing of the inquiry is uncomfortable for Brown, whose party trails the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Brown's spokesman said there was no need for a separate government inquiry, adding: "Stephen Byers has done the right thing by referring himself to the parliamentary authorities." Byers, a former law lecturer who also served as chief secretary to the Treasury in prime minister Tony Blair's government, made his comments to reporters working for the Sunday Times newspaper and broadcaster Channel 4. Eight MPs leaving parliament this year were approached. The reporters posed as representatives of a fictitious American communications company, Anderson Perry, that wanted MPs to work on behalf of its corporate clients as lobbyists. Former Labour ministers Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon also offered to help. They denied any wrongdoing. The allegations revived memories of the "cash-for-questions" scandal that undermined former Conservative prime minister John Major's government. Conservative MPs were accused in the 1990s of taking money from lobbyists to ask questions in parliame
