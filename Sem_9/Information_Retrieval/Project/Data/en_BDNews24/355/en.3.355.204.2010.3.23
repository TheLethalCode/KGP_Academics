 LOS ANGELES, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Caroline Wozniacki has stuck with the same clear-cut expectations for this year, despite having surprised herself with an extraordinary run of success last year. The Danish teenager climbed to a career-high second in the WTA rankings on Monday, after losing the Indian Wells final the day before, but her goals for 2010 are identical to those for 2009. "My outlook is no different," Wozniacki, 19, told Reuters. "Every time I step on the court I want to win. I hate losing. It doesn't matter who I'm playing against. "I just have to believe that I can do it and I know that if I keep working hard, the results will come. I do my best to win and to become a better player. That's my only expectation." The Dane, a six-time winner on the WTA circuit who is known for her tenacity and elegant groundstrokes, was crushed 6-2, 6-4 by Serbian Jelena Jankovic in Sunday's final, a defeat that left her with a bitter after-taste.

"I've been playing some good tennis," she said in an interview arranged by the WTA Sony Ericsson Tour. "Obviously it's very disappointing when you lose, but I will be okay.

Asked whether she was taken aback by the level of success she had achieved so swiftly, Wozniacki replied: "Yes and no. I've been working hard for a long time and I felt I was playing well. "It's always good when the results come but I didn't expect being in a Grand Slam final already. "That was a great thing for me." Wozniacki, who wears tennis dresses designed by Stella McCartney, became the first Dane to make a Grand Slam final since 1955 before losing to former world number one Kim Clijsters of Belgium at the US Open. She won WTA titles at Ponte Vedra Beach, Eastbourne and New Haven and reached four other finals before ending the year a career-high fourth in the rankings. Fast forward to this week, Wozniacki is headed by only American Serena Williams in her quest to become world number one. "I'm hungry to get to that top spot," she said. "That's what everyone else dreams about and hopefully it will happen for me one day. I just keep looking forward but I am closer to number
