 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has urged people to hand in information and evidence about 1971 war crimes. He urged this at the inauguration of a workshop titled "International Criminal Tribunal and the Trial" organised by Bangladesh Heritage Foundation at Dhaka's BILIA auditorium on Wednesday. "An investigation body will be formed within two days to probe into war crimes committed during 1971 including those involved in mass killings. Help this body by providing information and evidence and testimonies. Whether in the country or abroad, come forward", Shafique Ahmed said. He said "There might difficulties in holding the war crime trials. I am urging people to be aware of this." "If any barriers come our way, we will overcome them and move towards our goals. We are not treating any barriers to the trials as insuperable." Referring to the investigation body, he said "An inspector general of police will be assigned as the chief investigator, someone who is efficient in handling investigations. There will also be a retired army major and two other members from another organisation will be employed." The law minister assured the audience that the probe body will not be used for political purposes. Former ambassador Wali-ur Rahman, Mafidul Haque and professor Mizanur Rahman spoke at the workshop. bdnew
