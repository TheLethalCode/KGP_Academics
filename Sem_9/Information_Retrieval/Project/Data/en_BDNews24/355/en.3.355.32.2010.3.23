<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com) - An emergency meeting of the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) on Tuesday decided that unauthorised billboards in the city should be removed. DCC chief urban planner Serajul Islam told bdnews24.com that this decision was taken in accordance with the High Court decision. He also said that mobile courts would be used. His decision was made despite the pleas of members of the billboard owners' association and advertising agency representatives that such steps could result in losses of 100 crore taka. Neptune Advertising managing director and Billboard owners' Association president Rafiqul Islam claimed there would be a significant financial loss suffered by people involved in the billboard business and said several thousand people would become unemployed. He also said that the DCC could have earned about 10 crore taka had it imposed taxes on these billboards. However, Serajul Islam remain unmoved, saying that illegal billboards were a threat to security and should be removed as per the High Court directive. The meeting also decided that additional equipment and increased manpower will be organised for the dismantling process. Serajul Islam said the DCC would re-start the process of removing bill boards on March 26 where the area between Dhanmondi and Russel Square would be cleared. It will then start the process in the area between Kuril and Notun Bazar on April 1 and from Farmgate to Bijoy Sarani on April 8. On April 15 the operation will take place at Agargaon and adjacent areas. He said that there were only about 500 legal bill boards and large signs in the capital and a further 2500 unauthorised ones. The DCC launched its more recent drive against illegal billboard demolition at Shahbagh on March 18. DCC magistrate Khalil Ahmed however stopped the operation after two hours citing insecurity and police non-cooperation. On March 22 the High Court gave a directive to the DCC to remove unauthorised billboards without delay. The Shahbagh thana Officer-in-charge was also summoned to attend the court to explain the police's non-cooperation with the DCC. On March 15, two people had died when a billboard fell in Gulshan. b
