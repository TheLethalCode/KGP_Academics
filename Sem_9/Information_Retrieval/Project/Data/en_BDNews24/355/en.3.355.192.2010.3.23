 Chittagong, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Chittagong court gave the CID 60 more days on Monday for further inquiries into the 10 truckloads of arms seized in the port city of Chittagong in 2004, the seventh extension in the current investigation. Metropolitan judge Bhabani Prasad Singh granted the extension following a police request for 90 days as the CID said it needed more time to identify the ship that carried the arms consignment to Bangladesh. Chittagong police made the unprecedented weapons seizure at the secured jetty of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd on midnight of Apr 1, 2004. Two cases relating to the smuggling of weapons were filed. State counsel for the case and metropolitan public prosecutor Kamal Uddin told the court on Monday: "The ship bringing the weapons to Bangladesh could not yet be identified." "And we have still not been able to trace the navy ship which should have been patrolling when the weapons were being offloaded. We need to further question the navy officials too," he said. The public prosecutor, in his request to the court, also said that the time extension was needed to analyse the role of members of the former investigation committee and the statements made to them. A reinvestigation into the case started during the previous army backed caretaker government in 2008, since the previous inquiry report was thought to be flawed. It is alleged that the past BNP-led government had influenced the investigation process to try to suppress the facts. Since then information has reportedly emerged that the arms consignmentwhich according to the original FIR included rocket launchers, sub-machine guns, assault rifles and ammunitionwas meant to be transferred to the separatist group United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) for one of India's oldest insurgency wars. Officials of Bangladesh's main intelligence agenciesincluding the National Security Intelligence and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligenceand the Bangladesh Navy are implicated in the case as are members of the past BNP-led government including its former state minister for home. The Chittagong court ordered further investigation into the case on Feb 12 2008 following a request by Ahsanul Huq Hena, the former metropolitan prosecutor. New CID investigators were appointed at the time, who have now been given seven time extensions to make headway amid the complex web of new information, some of which has leaked out to the press. Investigators have said they want to identify who was behind the supply of arms, not only the handlers and receivers. bdnew
