 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Indian Government has told the country's Supreme Court that its order halting mining and supply of limestone from the north-eastern State of Meghalaya to the French company Lafarge's cement plant in Bangladesh is affecting the two countries' bilateral relations. India's Attorney General G K Vahanvati told the country's apex court that the legal order had hit production at the Lafarge's $255 million state-of-the-art plant at Chhatak in Sunamganj district in the Sylhet division of Bangladesh. Vahanvati appeared for the Indian Government's Ministry of Environment and Forest before a bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan and sought an early hearing on the matter. Lafarge also told the Supreme Court that the Bangladesh Government had written to the Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka on March 2 expressing concern over its decision. The Supreme Court directed that the matter be listed for hearing on Mar 26. A three-judge bench of the court had on February 5 passed an order to temporarily halt limestone mining by Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited (LUMPL) . The LUMPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Lafarge Surma Cement Limited (LSCL). The LUMPL has been transporting limestone mined from Nongtrai to the cement plant at Chhatak, owned jointly by the LSCL and Spanish company Cementos Molins, by a 17 kilometre long cross-border conveyer belt. The LSCL plant at Chhatak in Bangladesh has a capacity of producing 1.5 MT cement every year. The order followed a petition lodged by a local tribal organisation, the Shella Joint Action Committee (SJAC), that alleged that the French company's exploitation of the natural resources at Nongtrai, was posing a threat to the environment and changing rainfall pattern in the area. It claimed that rainfall in and around Nongtrai had reduced due to large-scale cutting of forest caused by the limestone mining. It also said that the rainfall that came flowed off the land instead of being retained in the hilly stretch. Nongtrai had once earned the sobriquet of being "the wettest place on earth" The organisation also alleged that LUMPL had obtained environmental clearance for the project by misrepresenting to the Indian Government that it would carry out mining in "wasteland and non-forest area consisting mainly of barren land, and rocks" although in fact the area had thick forest. It had also alleged that the State Government of Meghalaya had transferred ownership of the tribal land to the LUMPL in violation of the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution which prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribal individual or entities. Lafarge, in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on March 16, admitted that it had mortgaged tribal land in Meghalaya to international banks to secure a loan of US $153 million to finance its plant in Chhatak, but claimed that this had been approved by the reserve Bank of India  the central bank of the country  in March 2005. Three years ago in April 2007 the Indian Government's Ministry of Environment and Forest had stopped the LUMPL's operation in Nongtrai, but an interim order made on November 23, 2007 had allowed the company to continue mining.
