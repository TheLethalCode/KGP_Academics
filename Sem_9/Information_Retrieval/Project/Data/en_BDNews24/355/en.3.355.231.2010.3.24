 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  State owned BTCL and TeleTalk will share infrastructure with Warid to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. Two memorandums of understanding among the companies have been signed in this regard on Wednesday. Chris Tobit, the managing director of Warid said, "Infrastructure sharing with the two operators would facilitate Warid's quick roll out plan under the new management."

The companies will share their resources including optic fibre lines, bandwidth, power and transmission equipment. "This will significantly reduce costs and will allow the companies to provide more benefits in terms of price and service," said Sunil Kanti Bose, telecommunications secretary. Md Mujibur Rahman, managing director of Teletalk said, "The sharing of infrastructure will allow both companies to reach out further and expand in the rural areas. This will also help the government to reach it's vision 2021.
