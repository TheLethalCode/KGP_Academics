<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  Over 1,000 miners at Barapukuria coal field started an indefinite strike from Monday midnight demanding a pay rise. Last month, a similar strike demanding a profit bonus was called off after just two days following assurances from the employers. Robiul Islam, president of Barapukuria Coal Mine Workers' Union explained that the workers decided to strike again as the authorities had broken their promise to take a decision about raising their salaries by March 20. Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited, the Chinese contractor XMC and workers held talks on Sunday and Monday but the discussions broke down. Md Kamruzzaman, managing director of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited admitted that the strike hampered regular work in the coal field. "We are trying to convince the workers to go back to their work," he said. According to a tripartite deal between Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited, Chinese contractor XMC and Bangladeshi workers signed in 2008, miners are supposed to get their annual increment in each February through mutual discussions. The workers had drawn the agreement to the attention of the Chinese company, but they had not received any response, Noor Islam, general secretary of the union, said. bd
