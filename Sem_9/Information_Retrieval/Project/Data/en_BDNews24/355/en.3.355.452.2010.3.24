 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)Chairman of the Public Undertaking Committee Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, who summoned former the Anticorruption Commission chief in front the committee last year, has been moved to chair another parliamentary committee. Awami League MP ABM Golam Mostofa, a former bureaucrat, replaced him as chairman of the Public Undertaking Committee. Alamgir has been appointed new chair of the Public Accounts Committee replacing KH Rashiduzzaman, a first-time MP from Kushtia. KH Rashiduzzamn has been made a member of the Privilege Committee headed by speaker Abdul Hamid. Alamgir, who was convicted on charges of corruption by the ACC during the military-installed interim government, raised a charge of contempt of parliament against former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and other officials as they refused to appear before his committee meeting. He was publicly criticised for summoning officials of the ACC, meant to be an independent body. ACC officials also alleged that Alamgir should not hold the post of chair because of "conflicts of interest". Rashiduzzaman, a businessman-turned MP from Kushtia, failed to hold at least one meeting every month as per the Rules of Procedure. Committee members had criticised the chairman for not holding regular meetings.
