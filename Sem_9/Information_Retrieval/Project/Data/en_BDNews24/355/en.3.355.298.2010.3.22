 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)China has responded positively to Bangladesh's request for funds and technical support to connect Dhaka with the Chinese city of Kunming, foreign minister said Monday. "China has given very positive response as we have sought China's support for connecting Kunming with Dhaka," Dipu Moni told reporters at a press conference at the foreign ministry. The foreign minister was breifing the press about prime minister Sheikh Hasina's just-concluded visit to China. On Mar 18, Sheikh Hasina during meeting with her Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao talked about implementing a railway project, which would connect Chittagong's Dohazari with Cox's Bazar, and Ramu (Cox's Bazar) with Gundum in Bangladesh-Myanmar border. If Dohazari-Cox's Bazar and Ramu-Gundum rail links are established, the landlocked Kunming can be connected with Dhaka through Myanmar. The communications ministry has estimated the cost of the two projects at $210 million. According to railway officials, Ramu, which is 28 kilometeres from Gundum, will serve as a station along the 100 kilometres Dohazari-Cox's Bazar rail tracks. The railway authorities have recently chalked out a project to improve the existing rail link from Chittagong to Dohazari. Dohazari-Cox's Bazar and Ramu-Gundum rail links can be implemented in three years if necessary funds and technical supports are ensured, a senior railway official told bdnews24.com. He said Canarail, an engineering consulting firm, carried out a study in 2001 on Dohazari-Cox's Bazar rail track and found the project feasible. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Bangladesh handed over a list of infrastructure projects to Chinese leaders for funding and technical supports. "The Chinese were equally enthusiastic about the projects as we were," she said. The Dohazari-Cox's Bazar and Ramu-Gundum rail links was the second priority projects for Bangladesh, according to the communications ministry's paper handed over to China
