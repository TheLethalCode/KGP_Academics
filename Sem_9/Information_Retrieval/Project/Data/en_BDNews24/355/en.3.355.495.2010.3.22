<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition party has expressed concern about whether the Bhola-3 re-election could be held peacefully on April 24. A team of senior BNP leaders met the chief election commissioner Monday demanding deployment of army to ensure free and fair polls for the vacant seat in Bhola. The polls are being held following cancellation of parliamentary membership of Md Jashimuddin of the ruling Awami League. BNP has nominated former MP of that constituency Hafizuddin Ahmed. The BNP contender along with standing committee members MK Anwar, Nazrul Islam Khan and office secretary Razvi Ahmed participated in the meeting with election commission chief ATM Shamsul Huda and election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain. MK Anwar told journalists that the election commission has given assurance regarding army deployment. "We are anxious about whether a free and fair election can be held under the prevailing law and order situation", Anwar said, adding "we've demanded army deployment on the polling day". Mentioning that 46 BNP supporters have been arrested so far since the poll schedules were announced, the senior BNP leader also said RAB and police officials are harassing their supporters and threatening them. "In such situation we are anxious about whether the polls will be held appropriately. With deployment of the army such situations will not arise", Anwar said. BNP also demanded that EC employs the commission officials instead of giving anyone else the responsibility of holding the polls. It also demanded regular visits to Bhola by election commissioners and regular monitoring of the electoral area. Anwar claimed that the EC has assured to consider BNP demands, saying, "It seems that the EC has agreed to our demands." However, election commissioner Sohul Hossain told journalists that "We have heard their demands but are yet to reach a decision." b
