 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  A fire broke out in a dairy farm at southern Keraniganj, killing 17 cows in the early hours of Tuesday. The farm's owner Raja Mia blamed the deaths on the late response from the fire brigade, saying, "Even though the fire erupted around 4am, the fire fighters arrived around 5.30am. Due to the delay, 17 of the herd of 18 cows are dead." He also claimed to have incurred losses worth Tk 10-12 crores due to the fire at Talha Dairy Farm. Keraniganj's fire station officer Shahjadi Sultana said, "Two fire-fighting vehicles of the unit fought for one and half hours before being able to bring the balze under control around 6.30am." She also said that the fire could have erupted from an electrical short-circuit. Raja Mia speculated that the fire could be a sabotage and attributed his suspicions to the alleged visit of two persons to the farm only two days ago, who after being unable to find him, threatened his workers. OC of South Keraniganj Police Station, Nilutpal Dey told bdnews24.com that the estimation of losses is underway. bdnew
