<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)The telecoms regulator has said it will reconnect around half a million land phone subscribers whose lines were unceremoniously cut off in recent days as four private telephone companies were shut down for reported links to the illegal VoIP trade. Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission formed a committee on Monday, headed by commissioner Aliwardy Khandkar, to find out ways to re-open the lines, said the regulatory chief. "We expect that the process of switching on their call facilities will start from tomorrow [Tuesday]," BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed told the media. Between Mar 14 to 21, the BTRC shut down four private PSTN, or land phone, operatorsDhaka Phone, WorldTel, RanksTel and PeoplesTelon charges of providing illegal VoIP services. The four companies account for almost half of Bangladesh's 1.2 million land phone subscribers. RanksTel has an estimated 280,000, PeoplesTel around 140,000, Dhaka Phone about 75,000 and WorldTel some 14,000. Zia Ahmed said that the operators would have to meet certain conditions, such as submitting a "certified subscribers list", before BTRC could agree to open up the switches for their legal subscribers. Replying to a query, the BTRC chief said that the regulator has vowed to take stern actions against any entity including mobile phone operators to curb illegal VoIP activity. However, he said, such activity is "very low among the mobile phone companies".
