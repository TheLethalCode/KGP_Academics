 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has dismissed Dhaka Phone's petition seeking a cancellation of BTRC's decision to shut down the company's operation. Justice AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain ruled that Dhaka Phone should first respond to a 'show-cause' notice sent by telecom regulator BTRC, and only after the deadline has expired, apply to the court for cancellation. The regulator has recently shut down the operation of four telecom companies for allegedly running VoIP operations. Dhaka Phone's operations were shut down on March 15. BTRC has also detained five officials of the private land phone operator Dhaka Phone, including its chairman and general manager, on charges of providing illegal VoIP services. Dhaka Phone's lawyer Barrister Rokonuddin Mahmud had told the court that, "No VoIP equipment was recovered from Dhaka Phone. But the operation was illegally shut down." "Legally, a fine of Tk.1 lakh can be imposed for breaking the licence agreement but operation of the company can not be shut down in this manner," he added. Additional attorney general Murad Reza, arguing for the government, said, "There is legal provision for shutting down operations in a case where grave illegal activities have taken place." Kawser Ahmed, a BTRC official told bdnews24.com on March 15 that it had found evidence of illegal VoIP calls in Dhaka Phone's office and the phone company has failed to provide any satisfactory explanation. bdnews
