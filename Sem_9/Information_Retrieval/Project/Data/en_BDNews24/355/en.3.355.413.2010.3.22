<TITLE> Planned EU deal won't hit generic drug firms - Sharma </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, 22 march (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trade Minister Anand Sharma said on Monday that a proposed free-trade agreement with the European Union would not hurt the country's thriving generic drugs industry. Medical advocacy group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said earlier this month that poor people in India and other developing countries may lose access to affordable generic drugs as part of free-trade deal being negotiated between India and the EU. The warning highlighted one of the most sensitive issues in trade -- the extent to which companies' intellectual property rights can be waived to help poor countries and whether that stifles research and innovation. "We will not allow any injury to be caused to the Indian generics industry," said Sharma on the sidelines of a summit. The EU has said it was not asking that India stop producing cheap generic medicines. MSF said the bilateral agreement threatens to tighten the protection of intellectual property rights and keep the price of medicines out of reach of poor people in India and other developing countries. More than 40 percent of India's 1.1 billion-plus people live below the poverty line of $1.25 a day. India and the EU started negotiations for a trade deal in 2007, but have so far failed to iron out differences about market access, procurement and the EU's efforts to link trade with issues such as child labour and India's environmental record. EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht said earlier this month that the 27-country bloc was aiming for an October signing of the agreement which could open up export opportunities worth $9 billion for India. Sharma on Monday confirmed that New Delhi was eyeing the same target date. Trade between India and the EU currently stands at 78 billion euros ($105 billion), but is still less than one-fifth the value of the EU's trade with China. "IT'S A TRAP" MSF has called India the "pharmacy of the developing world", whose large generic drugs industry exports to countries in Africa and Latin America. In a interview with Reuters, the joint managing director of Indian generics maker Cipla Ltd said a poorly negotiated deal could hit all of India's generic drugs exports. "We have all tried to educate the authorities that this is something about which we should be cautious," he said by phone, when asked if Indian companies had voiced concerns on the deal to the Indian government. "It's a trap. It's not going to help anybody." MSF said the proposed agreement would legitimise seizures by EU officials of Indian generic drugs in transit to other developing countries. India and Brazil have threatened to launch a formal dispute at the World Trade Organization over EU seizures of Indian generics bound for Brazil, but talks to settle the dispute are taking place. India and the EU, India's biggest trading partner, would strive to resolve the dispute "amicably", Sharma has said. But the Economic Times said on Monday that talks had failed to resolve the dispute and that India was ready to file a WTO case, citing an unnamed government official. Sharma hinted India may take action to protect its industry. "They (EU) have given this assurance. And if they do not ... we will protect the Indian pharmaceutical industry. We will not allow them to be unfairly targeted purely because of commercial considerations.
