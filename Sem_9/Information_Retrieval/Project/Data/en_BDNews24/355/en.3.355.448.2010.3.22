 Dhaka, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday ordered Dhaka City Corporation to remove all illegal hoardings in the capital. It also summoned Shahbagh police chief for his reported non-cooperation during last week's drive by the city authority when it begin removing illegal hoardings in parts of the city. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain gave the order on a petition by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The human rights watchdog filed the petition Sunday after two people were killed in Gulshan earlier this month when a billboard fell on them during a storm. The court also asked authorities why families of the dead should not be given compensation. The Dhaka mayor, home secretary and the inspector general of police (IGP) will have to explain it in three weeks. On Mar 18, the DCC began to remove all illegal bill boards but the "overnight drive" came to a halt at around 11.30 pm, after just two hours, as two teams of Shahbagh Police, who had been providing protection, abruptly left the scene. The High Court bench asked the IGP to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against those responsible for non-cooperation. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim has been asked to appear in the court on April 5 and give his explanation on the matter. It is reported that several illegal billboards have been put up in the capital with police permission. The court bench asked the Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner to explain by April 5 under which law the approval had been given. It also ordered DCC to examine whether the legal hoardings are installed properly by the expert committee and submit the report to the court in two weeks. Advocate Manzil Morshed argued for the petitioner while deputy attorney general Akram Hossain stood for the government. According to DCC, there are only around 500 legally erected hoardings in the capital. The rest, an estimated 2,500 billboards and mega signs, are illegal. bd
