<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Tuesday passed legislation recognising alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as a legal means to settle loan default cases. During the passage of the Bill, the Law minister claimed that it may stop the loan default culture pervasive in the country. The legislation was passed by a voice vote. MPs from the opposition had tabled some amendments to the bill in Feb 24 last year, but they were all rejected. "The amendment bill has been brought forward to make the act more relevant and effective," law minister Shafique Ahmed told parliament. "We have seen from the experiences of different countries that about 90 percent of the cases are settled by the ADR. "The provision of the ADR creates an industry-friendly law for the country," he said. The statute says that under the supervision of the court, the lawyers of the two parties in dispute will be able to appoint an independent arbitrator to find a formula to settle the case. The arbitrator can be a lawyer, a retired judge, a former banker or other competent person from other professions as long as they do not hold any state of government post. The arbitration process should be completed within 60 days - but the court can extend this by another 30 days. If the arbitration process fails, the court can restart legal proceedings as though there had been no arbitration it says. "This is the first time that alternative dispute resolution is being used as a means to settle money default cases," Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry, told bdnews24.com. The standing committee had several meetings with all stake holders including the finance ministry, business leaders, 'sick' industry owners and others to finalise its recommendations on the bill. Sengupta said loan default culture in the country had become very serious. He said that a total of 1,04,832 loan default cases involving Tk 29,454 crore were filed between 1989 to 2009. Of the total, 67,336 cases have been settled and Tk 4,200 crore realised. "This bill will we hope reduce the culture of loan default and the tendencies of filing writ petitions. "This bill will force every loan defaulter to repay utilising the arbitration process," said Sengupta. Lawyers say that tough laws on loan default along with the lengthy legal process have made it difficult for people to recover money, and that the provision of ADR may make people feel more comfortable to settle
