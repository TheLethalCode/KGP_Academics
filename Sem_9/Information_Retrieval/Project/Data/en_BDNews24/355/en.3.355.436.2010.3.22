<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign minister Dipu Moni Monday said Monday that the just-concluded ministerial level meeting of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission was an "advancement" on an agreement for sharing Teesta river water. "We can term the JRC meeting as advancement," Dipu Moni told reporters at the foreign ministry. "There are many stages in the process," she said. Dipu Moni said not only the central government, but the interests of the Indian state of West Bengal was involved in the Teesta negotiations and there were many "realities" to contend with. The two water ministers late on Friday night, the last day of the talks in Delhi, exchanged drafts for an 'interim agreement' on Teesta water sharing during the lean period, but no firm deal was struck. The water secretaries of the two countries after examining the drafts will sit soon to reach an agreement, Dipu Moni said. "We cannot term the JRC meeting frustrating. Much progress was gained at the meeting and more will come in future." "We hope that we can reach an agreement on the Teesta soon," said the foreign minister.
