<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Pakistan hold high-level talks on Wednesday aimed at reversing decades of mistrust, but tensions over issues from nuclear cooperation to security are still expected to taint relations. The "strategic dialogue" between the nuclear-armed allies is likely to produce several signed agreements, from building dams and roads to power projects for energy-starved Pakistan, as well as additional security commitments. But the main aim of the meetings, chaired by the foreign ministers and attended also by defence chiefs, is to build on recent military successes by Islamabad against the Taliban while at the same time improve ties and turn around anti-American sentiment. "We want this dialogue to be a results-oriented dialogue," said Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi at an event at the Pakistani Embassy on Tuesday night. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also urged relations to move to a "deeper level" but said she did not expect to "wave a magic wand" and end years of mistrust. "It doesn't happen overnight," she told Pakistan's Dunya TV. "It is a process, but it's such an important process, and we very much believe in it." Pakistan's delegation sent a document to the Americans ahead of this week's meetings, giving their view of future relations and asking for more helicopters and pilotless drones as well as a wish to have a similar civilian nuclear arrangement that archrival India has with Washington. "What is good for India, should be good for Pakistan," said Pakistan's foreign secretary, Salman Bashir, when asked whether Islamabad wanted a civilian nuclear agreement. "The priority is energy, which means, energy comprehensively," he said, adding that the immediate focus was how to tackle blackouts in Pakistan which have disrupted the economy and frayed public patience. US RETICENCE The United States, however, is reticent over any nuclear deal with Pakistan, which took years to negotiate with India and requires consensus approval from both the 46-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group as well as the US Congress. Washington is also cautious due to an uproar created by allegations that a disgraced Pakistani scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, transferred nuclear secrets to Iraq and Iran. U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, and Clinton both played down any talks on nuclear cooperation, indicating this could be a source of tensions in two days of talks. "Let's just see how it develops," said Holbrooke. Pakistan's Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani is also a key player in the Washington meetings and Holbrooke said the military was crucial to any future relationship with Pakistan. Pakistan is a key ally in the U.S. fight against al Qaeda and to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan, where the United States is sending in an additional 30,000 troops to fight the Taliban. Washington has praised Pakistan's recent military actions, especially the arrest of a key Afghan Taliban commander in a joint U.S.-Pakistani raid in Karachi earlier this year. In its 56-page wish list to Washington, Islamabad repeated a demand for the kind of "shoot-to-kill" pilotless drones being used by the United States to target militants as well as other security and economic assistance. Last year, the U.S. Congress passed legislation for a $7.5 billion (5 billion pound) aid package for Pakistan over the next five years and Islamabad is looking for more specifics on projects and timetables over when the money will arri
