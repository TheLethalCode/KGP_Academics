 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government has said that it is probing the alleged poisoning of prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her detention in special jail in 2007-08 and there was no need for any individual to file a case. "Investigation into the matter is already underway. Anyone found guilty in the probe will be punished," state minister for law Quamrul Islam told reporters. Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury Wednesday morning filed a case against former president Iajuddin Ahmed, ex-chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed and four others about the alleged poisoning. Commenting on Salahuddin's action, Qamrul said, "It is the government who will take action regarding the matter. He should not have done anything like this." "He (SQ Chy) does lots of things. His intentions are very hard to understand. His words and his deeds are not always the same," the state minister said. Chowdhury, an MP from Chittagong, said in his complaint: "Sheikh Hasina is the leader of parliament ... There were attempts on her life." The BNP leader said the matter had "infuriated" him. "So I decided to file a case over the matter," he said in the case statement. Other accused are Lt. gen. Masud Uddin Chowdhury, Maj Gen ATM Amin, Brig Gen Fazlul Bari and inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Jakir Hossain. The hearing is likely to be held in the court of metropolitan magistrate AKM Imdadaul Haque later in the day.
