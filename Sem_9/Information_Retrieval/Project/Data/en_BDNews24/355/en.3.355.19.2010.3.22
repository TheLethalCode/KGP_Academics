 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Monday that the just-concluded ministerial level meeting of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission had made progress towards an agreement on sharing Teesta river water, despite the lack of a concrete outcome. "We can term the JRC meeting as advancement. Much progress was made at the meeting," Dipu Moni told reporters at the foreign ministry. "There are many stages in the process (of signing a deal)," she said. Dipu Moni said not only the Indian central government, but the state of West Bengal was also involved in the Teesta negotiations and there were many "realities" to contend with. Last Friday, water resources ministers of the two countries exchanged drafts, during their meeting in New Delhi, for an 'interim agreement' on Teesta water sharing during the lean period, a crucial issue for Bangladesh, but no firm deal was struck. The water secretaries of the two countries after examining the drafts will sit soon to reach an agreement, Dipu Moni said. "We cannot term the JRC meeting frustrating. Much progress was gained at the meeting and more will come in future." "We hope that we can reach an agreement on the Teesta soon," said the foreign minister. She, however, did not mention any timeframe for the Teesta deal in response to the journalists' question. The foreign minister said, in addition to the JRC meetings, many "technical issues" were involved. In January, Dipu Moni said Bangladesh would be able to reach an 'ad hoc' agreement on the Teesta water sharing after the JRC's ministerial meeting in March. The latest JRC ministerial meeting took place after a gap of five years, although it should take place every year. The meeting, however, failed to strike any deal because the Indian central government reportedly wanted to accommodate West Bengal's interests, contending that a large number of people there depended on the Teesta for irrigation and power generation. Foreign ministry sources, however, say that the West Bengal issue was more political than technical. According to the sources, the ruling Congress party does not want to sign any deal on Teesta with Bangladesh ahead of the state polls in West Bengal slated for next Dec-Jan. The Congress wants its ally Trinomul Congress, led by Momota Banerjee, to win the state polls replacing the left front, which has been in power since 1977. Banerjee is now the railway minister in the Congress-led cabinet. The Trinomul is reportedly worried that its opponents could use the Teesta issue in the upcoming elections against the Congress-led alliance if the deal seemed to deprive West Bengal. The flow of Teesta sharply goes down every year since early 1990s when India built a barrage at Gazoldoba in the upstream for irrigation and electricity production. On the other hand, the Teesta project, the largest in Bangladesh, covering 750,000 hectares of land in Rangpur area is largely dependent on the river
