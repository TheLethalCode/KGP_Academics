 Sylhet, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)A Sylhet court issued an arrest warrant on Monday against BNP's central organising secretary M Ilias Ali and his wife, Tahsina Rushdi Lopa in an illegal wealth case. An associate of the accused, however, told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity that Ilias had been in Dhaka on Monday until 2pm. The public prosecutor for Sylhet Misbah Uddin Miraj told bdnews24.com that during the caretaker government period Ilias had ignored a notice to submit a wealth statement to the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC). After investigation, the ACC reportedly found the couple owned assets of Tk 1.87 crore amassed by illegal means. On July 21 2008, the ACC assistant director Enamul Baki filed a case against the pair in the District Sessions Court, following which the two received bail in the High Court. The arrest warrant was issued by Judge Momin Ullah of the Sylhet District and Sessions' Court after Ilias and Tahsina had failed before the District and Session court on three consecutive dates. bdnews2
