 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)The chairman of the telecoms standing committee has criticised the effectiveness of the ongoing crackdown against "illegal VoIP". "With the course of time and advancement of technology, the market is expanding," Hasanul Huq Inu, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on telecommunications ministry, said on Tuesday. "The illegal VoIP business can't be stopped by RAB, police and baton. So it's better to totally legalise, which will generate revenue and employment," he told a roundtable on good governance in the public telecoms sector at the CIRDAP auditorium. The government is losing an estimated Tk 2 crore a day in revenue due to unlicensed VoIP operations. Inu said around 70-80 million minutes of calls are received daily in Bangladesh, 40 percent of which are illegally operated through VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). Only a handful of companies have licenses. Asked about steps against those involved in the illegal trade, he said, "If any politician or minister is found to be involved, they will be sent to jail with those executives of the accused companies." VOIP DRIVE FALLOUT Around half a million PSTN phone connections, cut-off during the current crackdown against illegal VoIP operations, will be switched back on "anytime", Inu also said. Regulator BTRC, between Mar 14 to 21, shut down four private PSTN, or land phone, operatorsDhaka Phone, WorldTel, RanksTel and PeoplesTelfor alleged involvement in illegal VoIP services. The four companies account for almost a third of Bangladesh's estimated 1.5 million land phone subscribers, according to BTRC's latest figures. RanksTel has around 280,000, PeoplesTel around 140,000, Dhaka Phone about 75,000 and WorldTel some 14,000 customers. BTRC formed a committee on Monday to find ways to reconnect the subscribers whose lines were unceremoniously cut off as the telephone companies were shut down. Steps were being taken to reconnect them on Tuesday, Inu said. But when pressed on the timing, he said "it could be two hours or ten hours." Ministry officials and the regulatory authority have already met to resolve the issue, he added. The regulatory chief Zia Ahmed told the media the process of switching on their call facilities would start from Tuesday. "It's the duty of the government to ensure interests of those clients," he had said.
