<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  A twelfth criminal case has been filed on Tuesday against BNP chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque alleging that he defamed the prime minister's son. All the cases relate to a statement first made by Farroque in parliament on March 11, alleging that the prime-minister's son, Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, was involved in illegal Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations. The same allegations were repeated at a press briefing on the following day. The latest case, filed by Bangabandhu Foundation chief Moshiur Malek at Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrates Court, is the first to be filed in the capital. Magistrate Mehedi Hasan Talukder ordered a warrant of arrest to be issued against Farroque. The Foundation chief claimed in his complaint that Sajeeb is the chairperson of the foundation's wing in the United States and that Farroque, in making these allegations, has defamed the organisation and its members, including the plaintiff himself. Farroque sought anticipatory bail from the High Court on Monday in relation to six of the defamation cases. The court asked him to surrender to the respective courts, but directed the trial courts to grant Farroque bail following his surrender. The court also directed the government not to harass or arrest him in connection with the cases in the next eight weeks. bdn
