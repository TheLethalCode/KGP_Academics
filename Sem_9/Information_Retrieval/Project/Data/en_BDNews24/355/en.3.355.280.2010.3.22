 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Drug Court has threatened the police in Brahmanbaria with dire consequences if it fails to produce a report by April 25 on the arrest of three officials of Rid Pharmaceutical Company in a toxic paracetamol case. State prosecutor Mahmud Hossain Jahangir told bdnews24.com, that the Judge of Dhaka Drug court Md Abdul Mazid said "tough actions will be taken against the police if they fail to produce a report for the court by April 25." At least 28 children died countrywide between June and August 2009 after consuming an adulterated paracetamol preparation made by Brahmanbaria-based Rid Pharma, according to tests by the government. The children's paracetamol product was found to contain the toxic chemical diethyl glycol. Jahangir said the lack of a police report was the reason why the case against the company has not started even after six months. However, officer in charge of Bramanbaria Sadar police station Hamidul Islam told bdnews24.com: "The police station has still not received any order from the court." He also admitted that since the case was filed, the police have not done any investigation. The drug court on Monday also denied bail to Rid Pharma's managing director Mizanur Rahman, who has been in jail for the last six months Others accused in the case are Rid Pharma directors Sheuli Rahman and A Gani, and pharmacists Mahbubul Islam and Enamul Haque. Sheuli has been given bail. Police have yet to arrest the other three. b
