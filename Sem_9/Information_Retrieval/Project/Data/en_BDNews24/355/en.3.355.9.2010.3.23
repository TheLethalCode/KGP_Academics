<TITLE> War crimes trials of Pakistan military demanded </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23  The War Crimes Fact Finding Committee has urged the Government to prosecute members of the Pakistan military who are alleged to have committed war crimes in the forthcoming trials relating to the 1971 war. The Government is due to announce in the next few days the names of those it has appointed to lead the investigation and prosecution of those in Bangladesh alleged to have committed war crimes. It will also announce the composition of the tribunal which will be conducting the trials. The committee's convenor MA Hasan said on Tuesday that, "Holding trials without the key criminals of the 1971 war, the Pakistan army members who committed most of the offences during the war, raises real question about the completeness of the trial." Whilst applauding the government's initiative in holding these trials, he said that "we are warning the government about the limits and possible failures of the trials they intend to hold. To hold effective trials, it is necessary for the trials to be above person or party. Leaving the key criminals out will give us a 'partial' trial. We want a 'full' one". He also suggested that without the crimes of the Pakistan military being considered, criminals might escape conviction through legal loop-holes. He added that, unless the Pakistan military is prosecuted, there will be judgement upon the crimes committed between Mar 25 and Apr 4 1971 "All the crimes committed under operation 'searchlight' will be left out including those at Jaggannath Hall, Iqbal hall, Rajarbagh Police Line, Pilkhana, Chittagong EBRC and Jessore Cantonment", Hasan said. Aside from these comments on the trials, He also suggested that March 23 should be declared "Shadhin Bangla Flag Day" and that March 25, the "International Day of Resistance Against War and Cruelty". Mentioning that Sheikh Mujib gave the call for independence on Mar 7, Hasan said that Shadhin Bangla's flag was hoisted on Mar 23, 1971 and that his car had the flag hoisted on his way to a meeting with General Yahya. The War Crimes Fact Finding Committee has been working from 1990 to unearth evidence of the crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war. b
