 DHAKA, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Off-spinners Graeme Swann and James Tredwell each struck to give England a chance of victory as the tourists reduced Bangladesh to 115-3 at tea on the fourth day of the second and final Test on Tuesday. Debutant Jahirul Islam (21 not out) and Mahmudullah (four not out) were at the crease at the break with Bangladesh leading the tourists by 38 runs after bowling out England for 496 runs before lunch. Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal fired an unbeaten half-century before he was caught by Steven Finn off Swann at point for 52. England fielders dropped the left-hander three times before and after the lunch interval with Tredwell being the unlucky bowler on each occasion. Wicketkeeper Matt Prior put down a chance with the opener on 15 before Tredwell failed to hold a sharp return catch on 26 despite having a hand on the ball. Jonathan Trott dropped the simplest of the chances at point with Tamim three runs away from his second fifty in the game. Tredwell was then rewarded for his good bowling with the fortunate wicket of Zunaed Siddique (34), whose drive hit the toe of Alastair Cook at silly-point and looped up for a simple catch for the bowler. The home side suffered an early blow in their second innings when opener Kayes was bowled for four by Broad after his attempted flick hit his thigh pad and deflected onto the stumps. Earlier in the morning England, resuming on 440-8, batted nearly 20 overs to add 56 runs taking. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak claimed both the wickets in his first and third overs to wrap up the innings thanks to stumpings by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim. Tim Bresnan was first man to go falling nine runs short of maiden Test century after he had resumed on 74 not out. Bresnan, who survived a bat pad catch while on five in the previous day, faced 261 balls and struck six fours for his 91 with Tredwell, who batted positively to score 37 off 63 balls, last man out. England lead the two-Test series 1-0
