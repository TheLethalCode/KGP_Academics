 BOGOTA, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb exploded in the Colombian port town of Buenaventura on Wednesday, killing at least nine people and wounding dozens more in an attack authorities blamed on FARC guerrillas or cocaine traffickers. The blast destroyed part of the local office of the attorney general in Buenaventura, the country's largest port which handles half the country's coffee exports but is also a major drug trafficking route to the Pacific coast. Local television images from the city showed wrecked taxis and destroyed store fronts as residents carried wounded people to hospitals minutes after the blast, the worst attack this year in the Andean country.

FARC rebels are still a threat in rural areas where they use ambushes, hit-and-run attacks and homemade landmines to harry army and police patrols. The rebel group is deeply engaged in drug trafficking and extortion. The coast near Buenaventura is a key cocaine smuggling point and rebels and rival paramilitary militias have often bombed and attacked army and police patrols in the city. Uribe is popular for his US-backed security drive and he steps down this year after two terms in office. Colombians go to the polls in May to vote for a new president and most candidates are promising to maintain his security policies. A poll on Wednesday showed his former defence minister, Juan Manuel Santos, was leading the race for the presidency. Santos was credited with organizing important strikes against FARC rebel commanders during his time as minist
