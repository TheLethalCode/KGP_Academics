 Dhaka March 23 (bdnews24.com)--Telecom regulator BTRC reconnected on Tuesday over 300,000 RanksTel and Dhaka Phone subscribers whose land line phones were cut off without notice when they were shut down in the recent crackdown on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), said the BTRC chief. About half a million phone lines have altogether been cut when four private telephone companies - Dhaka Phone, WorldTel, RanksTel and PeoplesTel - were shut down between Mar 14 to 21 for reported links to the illegal VoIP trade. The four companies account for almost a third of Bangladesh's 1.5 million land phone subscribers. RanksTel has an estimated 280,000 subscribers, PeoplesTel around 140,000, Dhaka Phone about 75,000 and WorldTel some 14,000 subscribers. A fifth company, National Phone, was also closed down on Tuesday. Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission had formed a committee on Monday, headed by commissioner Aliwardy Khandkar, to find out how they could reconnect the lines BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed said their call facilities would resume from Tuesday but the operators would first have to meet certain conditions, such as submitting a "certified subscribers list". Ahmed also told bdnews24.com "All the company's illegal E1 connections have been cut-off and from now on, the operators will have to inform BTRC before providing such connections." Ahmed added that the operators are also required to alert the regulatory body before making any kind of changes in their technical infrastructure. The BTRC chief said that the regulator has vowed to take stern actions against any entity including mobile phone operators to curb illegal VoIP activity. However, he said, such activity is "very low among the mobile phone companies". bd
