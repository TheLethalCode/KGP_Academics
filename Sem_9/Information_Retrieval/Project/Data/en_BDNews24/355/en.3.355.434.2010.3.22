 WASHINGTON, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday began a visit to Washington, where he was due to meet President Barack Obama and other top US administration officials after a spat over expanding Jewish settlements. Netanyahu's first scheduled meeting of the three-day trip was with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had termed "an insult" plans Israel announced two weeks ago during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden to build 1,600 more homes for Jews on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood. Netanyahu will dine with Biden and then address the powerful pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC. The trip coincides with renewed US efforts to persuade Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to begin indirect peace talks under US mediation. An Israeli official travelling with Netanyahu said Israel hoped Abbas would agree to start the negotiations, especially after a statement on Friday by the "Quartet" of Middle East mediators that backed his position on the settlements. But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel's decision to continue settlement building in and around East Jerusalem -- captured, along with the adjacent West Bank, from Jordan in a 1967 war -- would prove fatal for the peace process. "Israel continues to demonstrate a preference for belligerency and the violence of occupation over any commitment to peace or seriousness about meaningful negotiations," Erekat said in a statement. NETANYAHU STILL DEFIANT At a meeting in Moscow on Friday, the Quartet -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- called on Israel to halt all settlement building. Israel refuses to do so, citing biblical links to the West Bank and saying it will keep major settlement blocs in any future peace agreement. Under US and international pressure, Netanyahu announced a 10-month moratorium on new housing starts in Jewish settlements in November. But he excluded East Jerusalem and nearby annexed areas of the West Bank from the temporary building freeze. On Sunday, Netanyahu stuck to his note of defiance over Jerusalem, saying he would place no curbs on building homes for Jews in any part of the city, which Israel claims as its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of the state they want to create in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Netanyahu was to see Obama at the White House on Tuesday, a meeting arranged after the president cancelled a planned visit to Indonesia so he could focus on passing the US healthcare bill. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak, head of the centre-left Labour party and a key partner in Netanyahu's coalition, accompanied him to Washington, a sign Iran's nuclear program would be a main issue on the agenda of US-Israeli ta
