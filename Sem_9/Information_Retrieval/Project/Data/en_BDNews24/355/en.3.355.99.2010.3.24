<TITLE> Indonesian militants form broad group, recruit in jail </TITLE>

 JAKARTA, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indonesian jihadist group operating in Sumatra's Aceh province has formed a broad alliance of local militant groups and uses the prison system to recruit and spread their ideology, analysts said on Wednesday. Police in February discovered a militant training base in the deeply religious province of Aceh. So far, they have arrested 43 people suspected of involvement in the network and killed seven members, including top militant Dulmatin. Dulmatin, an electronics expert who was one of the masterminds of the 2002 Bali bombings, was shot dead by police on the outskirts of Jakarta earlier this month. Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the militant group behind the Bali bombings and other attacks, wants to create a Southeast Asian caliphate. It has since rejected use of violence, but a splinter group under Noordin Mohammad Top, a Malaysian-born bomb expert, continues to plan and execute attacks on Western targets. Top was killed last year following bomb attacks on two luxury hotels in Jakarta in July, prompting speculation the threat had been reduced in Indonesia. But a panel of experts on Islamist militancy told reporters on Wednesday that the recently-discovered Aceh group appeared to be a completely new branch of extremists that had rejected both JI and Top's group. "This is a newly formed group, combining many people from different backgrounds," said Nasir Abas, a reformed ex-militant who now works with Indonesia's counter-terrorism unit, adding that JI was now seen as 'soft' by some militants because it rejected violence. ATTACKS ON FOREIGNERS Sidney Jones, a Jakarta-based expert on Islamic militancy, said that while Top had favoured small, autonomous cells that dispersed after big bomb attacks on Western targets, this new group wanted to form a broad coalition of jihadists in Indonesia. Their other priorities included setting up a secure military training base and staging assassinations of "enemies of Islam" close to their base. "One of the things this underscores is the extent of the jihadi movement in Indonesia, precisely because so many different groups have been brought in," she said. Jones said that the group had probably been involved in a series of attacks on foreign nationals, including aid workers, in Aceh late last year. "The people who were involved in this alliance in Aceh, I think, were responsible for the attacks on foreigners but there is still an investigation under way," she said. The network included factions of Darul Islam and members of extremist groups such as Indonesian Islamic State (NII) and Kompak which was active in sectarian conflicts in Ambon and Poso. Police said they have uncovered evidence in the recent raids of regional cooperation between the Aceh militants and the violent Philippines-based group Abu Sayyaf, which harboured Dulmatin and others. However, the authorities have said that there is no indication so far of a link between the Aceh group and a warning issued in March by Singapore of a threat to oil tankers in the Malacca Strait. Jones said several of the militants captured in the Aceh raids had only recently been released from prison where they had served sentences for planning attacks. "[This] underscores how poorly we are monitoring the people who are arrested, the prisons and the ex-prisoners. That has got to be improved," she said. Some of the extremists linked to the Aceh group had been allowed to hold meetings inside prison, recruit from their jail cells, own phones and have visitors stay overnight, Jones said. "In a lot of prisons, there is no control over who visits," she said, adding one prisoner interviewed had 15 mobile pho
