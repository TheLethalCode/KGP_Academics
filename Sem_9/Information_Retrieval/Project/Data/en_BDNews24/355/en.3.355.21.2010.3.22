<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Police closed down the Drik Gallery at 3.30 pm Monday after it refused to stop an exhibition of images relating to deaths by RAB 'crossfire', or extra-judicial killings. The exhibition was due to open at 4 p.m. Over a dozen policemen were seen standing in front of the Drik building preventing entry or exit. People inside were unable to leave because of the police presence. The police had earlier ordered Drik, one of the capital's most prominent photo galleries, not to open the show. "A police officer came to our office and said that we must stop the exhibition to avoid causing 'unrest in the country'," Shahidul Alam, the photographer and Drik's managing director, told bdnews24.com on Monday. He said Dhanmondi police chief Shah Alam said "legal action" would be taken if the show was not shut down. When contacted Shah Alam told bdnews24.com that the police ordered Drik to close down the exhibition as it had not obtained permission from the Special Branch of police as required by law.
