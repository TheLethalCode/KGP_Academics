 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government will increase fees for the new machine readable passports (MRPs) and visas (MRVs), for which Bangladeshis can start applying a week from now, officials said Wednesday. New passports and visas issued from April 1 will have to be machine readable to comply with the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which has directed all member countries to introduce machine-readable passports and visas by April 2010. MRPs and MRVs are already in use in over 80 countries. In Bangladesh, the passport office will start processing MRP applications from April 1, but it will not be able to issue the machine readable passports until at least May 1, officials say, as the project is running behind schedule. In case of emergency travel, it will issue 'emergency passports' as an interim measure till MRPs and MRVs are available. Meanwhile, old-style handwritten passports that are valid up to 2015, can be used until they expire. They will be replaced by MRPs when renewed. Alternatively, short term passport renewal is also being offered up to Mar 31 2011. The newly introduced MRPs will be of three colours  green, blue and red. Green ones will be issued to the ordinary public, blue to government officials and red to diplomats. Iftakher Hossain, immigration department senior secretary, told bdnews24.com that there will be no hand-written information on the 48-page MRPs. The fees applicable for the general passports would be Tk 3,000 and for urgent ones the charges would be Tk 6,000. The fees for old-style passports were Tk 2,000 and Tk 5,000 respectively. Also passports, which expire on or after March 31 2010 may be 'auto-renewed' up to March 31 2011 for just Tk 1,000. Home secretary Sobhan Sikder told bdnews24.com, "A summary of the proposed fees have already been sent to the prime minister for approval. Circulars and notices will be issued immediately after approval." Sikder said that all necessary actions have been taken by the passport department to provide quick services; the police verification also will be done online. Md Abdul Mabud, director general of the Department of Immigration and Passport, told bdnews24.com that the MRPs and MRVs will be introduced first in Dhaka, Maymensingh, Chittagong, Comilla, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Jessore and Gopalganj. They will then be gradually launched in other regional and district offices. Retired Brig Gen Md Refaet Ullah, director of the Bangladesh MRP/MRV project, told bdnews24.com that about Tk 526 crore has already been allocated for implementing the project. He said he hoped that applicants would receive MRPs and MRVs by May 1. He insisted, however, that the government was not missing the Apr 1 deadline, "as we are taking applications from that date". bdnews2
