<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Kings XI Punjab made a sensational fightback before scripting a dramatic victory over Chennai Super Kings via one-over eliminator in the Indian Premier League in Chennai on Sunday, reports PTI. Put into bat, Kings XI made a modest 136 for eight and defeat wrote all over their face after the home team were 96 for one by the 14th over. But after that the visitors made a remarkable fightback to restrict CSK to 136 for seven from the 20 overs to set up IPL 3's first one-over eliminator. In the super over bowl out, CSK made nine runs off the bowling of Juan Theron by losing two of their three nominated batsmen -- Matthew Hayden (0) and captain Suresh Raina (8) -- while Albie Morkel made one. Batting second, Kings XI Punjab made 10 for one with Yuvraj Singh hitting a four from the fourth ball off Muttiah Muralitharan to set up the dramatic victory. Mahela Jayawardene was out in the second ball after hitting a six off the first. The third nominated batsman Irfan Pathan did not face a single ball in the super over. With the win, Kings XI Punjab snapped their three-match losing streak and opened their account -- two points from four matches -- in IPL 3. For CSK, this was their second loss in four matches after their defeat to Deccan Chargers in their first match. Chasing a modest target of 137, CSK looked set for a thumping win before a dramatic collapse from 96 for one to 136 for seven which led to IPL's first tied match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Wicketkeeper batsman Parthiv Patel struck a fighting 57 to take CSK to almost to a winning position only to see his team-mates throw away the game. Parthiv, who struck four fours and two sixes in his 58-ball innings, was the fifth man out in the 18th over, stumped by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara off Piyush Chawla, and his departure gave a turn to the match. Needing 12 runs from two overs and five wickets down, Manpreet Gony was bowled by Juan Theron in the penultimate over CSK needed 10 from the last over. A four by Albie Morkel from the first ball of the final over bowled by Irfan Pathan tilted the scale in favour of CSK and the score was tied in 19.4 overs. R Aswin could not score from the penultimate ball of CSK innings and he was caught by Mohhammed Kaif off the last ball. Theron was the most successful Kings XI bowler with 2/17. CSK began sedately but solidly with Matthew Hayden and Parthiv raising 65 runs from 52 balls for the opening wicket The duo shunned risks and looked content to preserve their wickets while maintaining the required run rate with occasional fours and sixes. They were separated in the ninth over with Hayden, who used his mongoose bat on and off, was bowled by Ramesh Powar for a 24-ball 33 which was laced with four fours and two sixes. Parthiv continued his watchfulness with aggression and lofted pacer Shalabh Srivastava for a six in the 11th over. He and captain Suresh Raina pushed up the scoring rate a bit with the latter also hoisting a Yuvraj Singh delivery for a six. Three quick wickets in two overs followed which gave Kings XI a ray of hope though with a small total to defend it turned out to be too little too late. First Raina (15) was run out by Juan Theron who kicked the ball in his follow through to beat the CSK captain in the 13th over. Three balls later in the same over, Theron got Murali Vijay lbw for a duck. Next over, Subramanim Badrinath fell for two from as many balls as CSK were reduced to 102 for four in the 14th over. Parthiv was the fifth man out in the 18th over after that CSK lost way. Earlier, Muralitharan produced a superb spin bowling show taking three wickets for 16 to restrict Kings XI Punjab to 136 for eight. Muralitharan dismissed visiting captain Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Mohammed Kaif as CSK produced a disciplined bowling performance. Pacers Albie Morkel and Lakshmipathy Balaji also bowled well by taking two and one wickets respectively by conceding 23 and 29 runs from four overs each. For Kings XI, Yuvraj top-scored with a 28-ball 43 which had four fours and two sixes in it while opener Irfan Pathan made 39 from 32 balls. Kings XI did not have a great start with in-form opener Ravi Bopara out for just one in the third over. Bopara, who had two half-centuries from his three earlier matches, top-edged a Morkel delivery to Balaji near the boundary. Pathan, who was promoted to open the innings after his fine batting in Kings XI's previous match, produced some fireworks in front of a near capacity crowd at MA Chidambaram Stadium with some lusty blows off Ravichandran Ashwin including a huge six. But at the other end, another wicket fell in the form of captain Sangakkara (15) stumped by Chennai wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel in the ninth over. Sangakkara was deceived by a turning ball by his Sri Lankan team-mate Muralitharan and missed it completely for Parthiv to do the rest. Run rate plummeted and Pathan fell while trying to push the pace of scoring as he dragged a Balaji delivery on to his middle stump after making 39 from 32 balls with the help of five fours and a six. Kings XI were in trouble then at 58 for three in the 10th over. Next man in Mahela Jayawardene (3) compounded the Kings XI woes as he fell next over lbw to Muralitharan for a five-ball three. It was left to Yuvraj and Mohammad Kaif (14) to take the Kings XI score to a respectable total but they were separated in the 17th over when the latter was out after sharing 45 runs for the fifth wicket. Yuvraj could not accelerate the run rate much before he was out in the penultimate
