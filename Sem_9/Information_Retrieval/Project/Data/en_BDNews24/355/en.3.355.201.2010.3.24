 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has rejected a case by Salauddin Quader Chowdhury's over an alleged attempt to poison Sheikh Hasina during her stay in 2007-08, while the government has said it is probing the matter. Advocate AKM Fakhrul Islam filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning on behalf of Chowdhury, an MP from Chittagong and senior figure of the opposition BNP. The case accused former president Iajuddin Ahmed, ex-chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed and four others over the alleged poisoning. The metropolitan magistrate AKM Imdadaul Haque rejected the case following an afternoon hearing. The prime minister herself alleged in parliament, on Mar 11, that there was an attempt to murder her by "slow poisoning" during her detention in special jail on graft charges by the past caretaker government. Hasina and six others had been named witnesses in the case. Chowdhury said in his complaint: "The prime minister's statement was published in various media. I expected that a case would be filed against the accused on her behalf. But that did not happen." "Sheikh Hasina is the leader of parliament ... There were attempts on her life." The BNP leader said the matter had "infuriated" him. "So I decided to file a case over the matter," he said in the case statement. The court of metropolitan magistrate AKM Imdadaul Haque rejected the case on Wednesday afternoon saying that such a case should be filed either by Sheikh Hasina herself, as the victim, or by someone authorised by her. The complainant Chowdhury did not submit any power of attorney to file on behalf of the victim, it said. The court also said in its rejection order that, in accordance with the constitution, "no questions" about parliamentary proceedings can be raised in a court, that the matter was outside the court's jurisdiction. Since the complaint was not filed according to due process, it was rejected, the court said. However, Chowdhury's lawyers said that their client would proceed to the higher court in this case. Other accused in the complaint were general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, Maj Gen ATM Amin, Brig Gen Fazlul Haque Bari and inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Jakir Hossain. MOTIVE QUESTIONED Meanwhile a government minister said Wednesday that it is probing the alleged poisoning of the prime minister and there was no need for any individual to file a case. "Investigation into the matter is already underway. Anyone found guilty in the probe will be punished," state minister for law Quamrul Islam told reporters at the Secretariat. Commenting on Chowdhury's action, Qamrul said, "It is the government who will take action regarding this matter. He should not have done this." "He (Chowdhury) does many things in which his intentions are very hard to understand. His words and his deeds are not always the same," the state minister added. bdnew
