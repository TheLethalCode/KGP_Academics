<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)A new report has stressed the need for reconstruction of public-owned telecoms company BTCL aimed at reducing government influence and making it more efficient so that it can compete with private operators. The report by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) was presented Tuesday at a discussion on good governance in the public telecommunication sector. Discussants asked to keep the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) free from political interference in terms of recruitment and initiating projects. BTCL emerged from the former Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB) in 2008, and the government now owns all its shares. Hasanul Haq Inu, chairman of the parliamentary committee on telecommunications ministry, was the chief guest at the programme, which was held at the CIRDAP auditorium. BTCL officials, trade union leaders and academics participated in the discussion. BTCL board chairman Sunil Kanti Bose, who is also the secretary of the ministry, was the special guest, but he was not present. TIB presented a detailed research report covering different aspects of the company. It pointed out that the board is dependent on several ministries. The nine-member board has five senior government officialsfour from different ministries and one from the military intelligence. The TIB observed that despite its conversion into a public limited company, BTCL still acts like the former BTTB, where the government officials rule the roost. Inu, the chief guest, said the body needs to be restructured immediately to ensure better governance. The company should also be freed from all sorts of 'interference' in decision making, as well as in case of manpower recruitment, he said, adding that "recruitment should be made on the basis of competence and skill." He said, "It takes time when the decisions are coming from the ministry." "Since the two processesrestructure and recruitmentare yet to begin, how can BTCL meet the current market demand?", he asked. NH Chowdhury, former BTTB chairman, said a state-owned company is hard to manage as the board members from ministries behave like regulators. Regarding the allegations against the board, BTCL managing director SM Khabiruzzaman said, "We can't change the situation until the old system remains in force." Lack of experts on the board was also raised as an important issue by TIB. It presented the examples of Singapore and India, where about 50 percent of the board members are experts. Whereas in Bangladesh there is just one expert on the 9-member board. The company was formed by the previous army-backed caretaker government in a hurry without preparing its legal framework and an organogram, TIB observed. Rafiqul Islam, additional secretary of the ministry and a director of the BTCL board, agreed on the need of adding more experts to the board, but "not by eliminating the government officials." He said that it was more important to adopt state-of-the-art technology than pursuing a legal structure. MEASURES NEEDED TO BE COMPETITIVE Majority at the roundtable emphasised on undertaking extensive marketing strategies to increase the growth of new customers. Since the market has become competitive due to massive promotional activities by the public switched telecom network (PSTN) companies and mobile phone operators, BTCL should move faster with product diversification to attract more customers, Saiful Islam, a BUET professor, said. "It needs to be dynamic while call rates also need to be reduced," he added. The former BTTB chief said that comparative market analysis was needed for boosting growth. Inu, in this regard, said, "Though the company is passing through a transition period, the progress is not 'enough'. "The people will not accept excuses," he added pointing at the BTCL officials. MANPOWER AND CBA The TIB report said around 30 percent position of the engineers are still vacant, while new recruitment cannot be made until the company completes two years after commissioning, according to the company organogram. It also said all the employees of BTTB were taken under BTCL without scrutinising their efficiency. Most of the staffs lack proper technical skills. TIB also identified the presence of five trade union bodies, four of which are politically backed, but only three are approved according to labour law. However, Md Mohir Uddin, president of one of those five unions, denied political backing saying: "The trade unions are functioning under the workers' federation law."
