 MADRID, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luis Aragones has agreed to talk to Sevilla about returning to the La Liga club to take over as coach from the sacked Manolo Jimenez, the former Spain coach was quoted as saying Wednesday. The 71-year-old Aragones, who led Spain to victory at Euro 2008 and had a previous spell as Sevilla coach in the mid-1990s, told As sports daily he had agreed to meet club president Jose Maria del Nido in Cordoba to discuss terms. "Del Nido called me this morning and I am going to eat with him," the paper quoted Aragones, whom they interviewed at Cordoba train station, as saying on their website (www.as.com). "I am excited about the idea of coaching and now I'll go and listen to what Sevilla offer me," he added. Sevilla sporting director Ramon Rodriguez said earlier on Wednesday that the club expected to name a new coach in a matter of hours and As said Aragones would agree a contract through to the end of next season. The club could not immediately be reached for comment. Aragones, out of work after leaving Turkish club Fenerbahce at the end of last season, has coached Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Espanyol, Real Betis, Valencia, Real Oviedo and Real Mallorca. He also played for Atletico, whom Sevilla will play in May's King's Cup final. Sevilla sacked Jimenez after his side were held to a 1-1 draw at home by basement side Xerez Tuesday. The Andalusians suffered a surprise Champions League exit to CSKA Moscow last week and Tuesday's draw with Xerez meant they had failed to win in seven matches in all competitions. The club are fifth in La Liga on 45 points, one behind Real Mallorca, who occupy Spain's fourth Champions League qualification
