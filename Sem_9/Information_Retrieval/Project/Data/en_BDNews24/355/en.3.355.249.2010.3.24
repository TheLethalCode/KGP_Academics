<TITLE> Oil tank owners suspend strike call </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Oil tanker owners have suspended their decision that would have resulted in the halting of all oil transport by ship from Wednesday night. On March 21, the association had threatened the suspension in a bid to cancel the government's plan to procure additional oil tankers. At present there are 81 coastal ships used for transporting oil across the country from seaports. "We had a fruitful meeting with the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) on Tuesday," vice president of the group Habibul Alam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. BPC chairman Anwarul Karim told the association that additional vessels would not be procured, and also vowed to provide a minimum of 3 trips for each tanker, he added. At its earlier press conference on sunday, the Oil Tanker Owners Association president TM Giasuddin had said that "As the use of petroleum has reduced by around 35 percent in recent years, due to an increase in the use of CNG (compressed natural gas), the tankers cannot run more than two trips a day at present." With the costly maintenance of the tankers, many businesses already face huge losses, he said. If 30 or 40 ships were brought in by the government, "the whole industry will be in crisis," he claimed. bdn
