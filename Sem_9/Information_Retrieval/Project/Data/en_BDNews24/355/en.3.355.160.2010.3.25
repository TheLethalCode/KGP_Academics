 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League may choose Mohammad Jashim Uddin to run again for the April 24 election to Bhola-3, a senior party figure said on Wednesday, though the seat was vacated in February after Jashim's candidacy in the 2008 general election was declared illegal. An AL presidium member, who did not want to be named, spoke to bdnews24.com following a meeting at Gano Bhaban with prime minister and party chief Sheikh Hasina in the chair. The senior leader said Jashim would be picked again if "there was no legal complexities". The EC declared Jashim's election to the Bhola-3 seat void on Feb 3 as the retired army officer contested the 2008 national polls before waiting the required time following his retirement. Bangladesh electoral law stipulates that a retired army officer cannot become a candidate in a general election until a certain time has passed - three years in case of ordinary retirement, five years in case of forced retirement. Hafiz was sent into forced retirement in August 2004 and contested the general election in December 2008. Opposition BNP, at a parliamentary board meeting on Mar 21, formally backed Hafizuddin Ahmed, the runner up in Bhola-3 against Jashim in 2008. Jashim won the seat with around 12,000 more votes than Hafiz, who went on to challenge the validity of Jashim's candidacy in the High Court. The High Court ruled that Jashim's candidacy was unlawful; the Appellate Division upheld the ruling on an appeal by Jashim, following which the EC declared his election void. Electoral law holds that a new election must be held within 90 days of vacation of any parliamentary seat. The new election to the Bhola-3 seat, comprising Lalmohan and Tajmuddin upazilas, will be held on April 24. The deadline for submission of nominations is Mar 29. AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that the minutes of Wednesday's meeting will be released on Thursday. bdnews24.
