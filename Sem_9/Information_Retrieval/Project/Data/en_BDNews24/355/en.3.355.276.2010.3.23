 NEW DELHI, 23 march (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The finance minister on Tuesday urged a doubling of infrastructure spending to $1 trillion in the five years to 2016/17, and said private sector firms would be allowed to sell special bonds to help pay for it. Poor infrastructure is a long-standing obstacle to faster development in India, with choked roads and ports and inadequate power supplies acting as a brake on its economic growth. The enormous funding needs cannot be met by overstretched banks alone and will require new sources of financing, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told an industry conference. The government has decided to allow private firms to issue infrastructure bonds, which would hopefully attract investments from big pension funds and other cash-rich firms, Mukherjee said. Issuance of these bonds, whose buyers can claim tax breaks, is currently limited to state entities. "We have still not completely succeeded in exploiting the full potential of insurance and pension funds for deployment in infrastructure projects," Mukherjee said, without giving a timeframe for the first such private sector bonds. "The availability of equity, both domestic and FDI (foreign direct investment), continue to remain an area of concern." Analysts said the moves are a step in the right direction, but more needed to be done. Red tape and difficulties in acquiring land, along with an underdeveloped domestic bond market and wariness of overseas investors in committing to long-term, big-ticket projects have slowed infrastructure development. HURDLES For infrastructure bonds to be attractive they need guarantees and a marketplace for trading. "We don't have a long-term debt market in place, so demand will be an issue. Unless pension funds participate in the debt markets, I don't see demand coming in," said D.K. Joshi, principal economist at rating agency CRISIL. State-run India Infrastructure Financing Co Ltd is considering guaranteeing such bonds, media reports have said. The government needs to address issues of land acquisition and project approvals, analysts said. Red tape has delayed many ambitious projects, including one to build 20 kilometres of highways each day. India is building roads at less than half of that rate. "Those structural bottlenecks are a bigger cause of worry than the availability of funding," said Jai Mawani, who heads the infrastructure practice at consultancy firm KPMG. "Some of the policy issues are not addressed in certain sectors, there are delays in the tender process, there are delays in the bidding process," Mawani said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the conference India needed reforms to ensure increased resources for infrastructure and more private sector participation. More infrastructure spending would help boost India's GDP growth into double digits, he said. "We must aim at accelerating the pace of growth to about 10 percent per annum," Singh said. "It is not something that would happen automatically. We would need continuous improvements in our policy regime and our implementation process." The government has estimated the country needs $514 billion poured into infrastructure in the five years to 2011/12, the year when the economy is expected to expand an annual 9 percent. The bulk of this investment is seen coming from private sources. While Mukherjee said the plan was on schedule, critics have said India's ambitious projects have fallen short of promises. Singh said infrastructure development would have to be broad based and diversify towards building "social infrastructure" like schools and hospitals, adding to the overall cost. Spending on such projects would also win votes for Singh's Congress party, with its core electorate in the villages. An earlier scheme to guarantee these voters work for 100 days a year is credited with helping to return the government to power in 2
