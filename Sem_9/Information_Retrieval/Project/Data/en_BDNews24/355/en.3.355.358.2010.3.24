<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  Export growth of Bangladeshi knitwear has shrunk significantly while overall exports have decreased marginally. According to the Bangladesh knitwear manufacturers and exporters association (BKMEA), total exports were worth $6,222.95 million in 2008 and $6,196.32 million in 2009, decreasing by less than half a percent. On the other hand, BKMEA said, that knitwear export growth to the US market had dropped from 15 percent in 2008 to -9.95 percent in 2009. BKMEA president Fazlul Haque said Wednesday that during the same period export growth to the European Union increased by 0.19 percent. Haque pointed out that China's export growth to US had increased from 1.13 percent in 2008 to 7.26 percent in 2009. He explained that the reason for this growth was that the Chinese government provided assistance to their industry during recession. "So they managed to maintain positive export growth." He said growing exports from China and Vietnam to the US was eating into Bangladesh's share there. The BKMEA president blamed this loss of market share to lack of government assistance in the form of a stimulus package during the recession. "The impact will be more visible in 6 to 7 months, although the recession is over," said Haque. He claimed that fabric production had decreased by half because of gas and electricity shortage. "It is creating a severe problem for us." Haque also alleged that fake inflated gas bills were hampering the industry and increasing production costs. However, the main problem that the industry faced at the moment was yarn crisis, he said. "Yarn price has increased in part because of rise in the price of cotton and partly due to the gas crisis, which has led to a fall of yarn and fabric production." Mentioning that yarn prices did not increase correspondingly with the international market, Haque demanded that the government should form a 'monitoring team' to follow yarn prices
