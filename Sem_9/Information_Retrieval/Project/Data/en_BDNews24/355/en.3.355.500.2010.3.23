<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has stayed for six weeks a High Court ruling that ordered appointment of 202 civil servant candidates, who passed the 27th BCS exams in 2005 but were later disqualified. The Appellate Division chamber judge SK Sinha gave the stayed order on Tuesday on an appeal filed by the government. The court set April 25 to hear the government appeal challenging the High Court order. The High Court last November ordered the government to give appointments to the 202 candidates the within three months. The results of the first round of the 27th BCS exams, held in 2005, were published in January 2007. The Public Service Commission cancelled the results, however, on allegations of irregularities and held a fresh round of viva voce exams for those who had passed a written test. Based on the new viva voce results 1,154 candidates who had passed the first time round were failed the second time. The failed candidates, calling themselves "deprived" and protesting the "unfair treatment", have since lobbied the authorities to appoint them and filed petitions with the High Court against the PSC decision. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and additional attorney general Murad Reza took part in Tuesday's hearing on behalf of the state while advocates Abdur Rob Chowdhury and Abdul Matin Khasru stood for the candidates. bdn
