 Sylhet, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's central organising secretary M Ilias Ali and his wife, Tahsina Rushdi Lopa secured bail on Tuesday in the illegal wealth case only a day after a Sylhet court issued an arrest warrant for them. They appeared at the court of Sylhet district and session judge Momin Ullah and appealed for the bail. The court set the date for the next hearing on May 10. The public prosecutor for Sylhet Misbah Uddin Miraj told bdnews24.com on Monday that during the caretaker government period Ilias had ignored a notice to submit a wealth statement to the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC). After investigation, the ACC reportedly found the couple owned assets of Tk 1.87 crore amassed by illegal means. On July 21 2008, the ACC assistant director Enamul Baki filed a case against the pair in the District Sessions Court, following which the two received bail in the High Court. The arrest warrant was issued by the same judge after Ilias and Tahsina had failed to appear before the District and Session court on three consecutive dates. bdnews2
