<TITLE> US Senate conducts vote marathon on healthcare </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Senate rolled through a healthcare reform voting marathon on Wednesday, with Democrats rejecting repeated Republican efforts to derail a final package of changes to the landmark law. In a late-night "vote-a-rama," Senate Democrats killed more than a dozen Republican amendments to a companion package of final changes to the healthcare overhaul signed into law by President Barack Obama on Tuesday. The Republican amendments were designed to force Democrats to take a difficult political stance before November's congressional elections, but Democrats methodically rejected them in an around-the-clock voting spree expected to last into early Thursday. The Senate's approval of even one of the amendments would send the whole package back to the House for another vote, just days after the House passed the $940 billion (631 billion pound) overhaul in a close ballot that capped a yearlong political struggle. "Make no mistake, the intent of every single one of the amendments on the other side of the aisle is to kill healthcare reform," said Max Baucus, Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The Republican amendments include proposals to deny erectile dysfunction drugs to sex offenders, to ensure that insurance premiums do not increase under the law and to prevent tax hikes for families earning less than $250,000. The vote on final passage of the companion healthcare bill could be held post-midnight on Thursday, or held over to the daylight hours. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid ridiculed the Republicans for the flurry of amendments. "How serious can they be?" Reid said. "Offering an amendment dealing with Viagra for rapists?" Republicans promised to keep fighting the overhaul and said the amendments were designed to improve a bill that even Democrats agree needs fixing. 'FIX IT' "This is called a fix-it bill. We're suggesting you fix it," said Judd Gregg, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. He rejected Democratic claims that sending the bill back to the House would be a death sentence. "That is absurd," Gregg said. "We have suggested a series of amendments that will significantly improve this bill." Both parties also met into the night with the Senate parliamentarian as Republicans looked for language in the bill that could be rejected under a parliamentary challenge. Senate Democrats are trying to pass the changes under reconciliation rules that require every provision to have a budgetary impact. The rules allow passage by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the 60 needed to overcome procedural hurdles. The package of changes to the healthcare overhaul, approved in the House on Sunday, includes an expansion of subsidies to make insurance more affordable and more state aid for the Medicaid program for the poor. It also would eliminate a controversial Senate deal exempting Nebraska from paying for Medicaid expansion costs, close a "doughnut hole" in prescription drug coverage and modify a January deal on a tax on high-cost insurance plans. The final package would extend taxes for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, to unearned income. It also includes reform of the student loan program. The overhaul signed by Obama represents the biggest changes to the health system in four decades. It expands insurance coverage to 32 million Americans and imposes new regulations like barring insurance companies from refusing to cover patients with pre-existing medical conditions. The health insurance industry has been critical of the plan, but the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index of health insurers has risen about 1 percent since passage as investors were encouraged that clarity on health reform was near and the bill avoided worst-case scenarios. The contentious healthcare debate in the House still echoed in the Capitol. House Democratic leaders met with Capitol law enforcement officials to discuss security after death threats and acts of violence against lawmakers accompanied the weekend vote. Bricks were tossed through the windows of one member's office, while another lawmaker was spat at by a protester on Capitol Hill and another was the target of a racial slur. The FBI said it was investigating the threats, and Democrats called on Republicans to reject them. "It's more disturbing to me that Republican leadership has not condemned these attacks and instead appears to be fanning the flames with coded rhetoric," said House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louis Slaughter. Obama signed an executive order reaffirming a ban on using federal funds to pay for abortions, part of a deal with about a half-dozen anti-abortion House Democrats that won their support on Sund
