 Brahmanbaria, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)Seven out of eight units of the country's largest power plant at Ashuganj were shut down at around 8pm as a fire broke out in the transformer room. Managing director of the plant, Abdul Khaleque, told bdnews24.com production capacity of the seven units was 578 megawatts. Only the 150MW Unit 8 was unaffected. Khaleque said Ashuganj fire fighters doused the fire within half an hour. One unit of 34MW later resumed production, at around 10pm, after repair. The plant has a total generation capacity of 728MW, the largest in Bangladesh, and equal to more than a fifth of peak power production in Bangladesh.
