<TEXT>
 Dhaka Mar 22 (bdnews24.com) - The cabinet on Monday ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which sets international standards for prosecution of individuals who commit crimes against humanity. "The ratification will prove that Bangladesh is determined to follow international standards to prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide" the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. Bangladesh signed the Rome Statute on July 17, 1998, the first country to do so in South Asia. The statute, entering into force on 1 July 2002, is the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC's main purpose is to assist the international community in trying the most heinous international crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes again humanity. The official seat of the permanent tribunal is in The Hague, Netherlands, but its proceedings may take place anywhere. But it remains a "court of last resort", leaving the primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over alleged criminals to national legal systems. Under this system of 'complementarity', it will only act when national authorities are unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute crimes. Asked whether ratification of the statute by Bangladesh would help in the government's upcoming prosecution of 1971 war crimes trials, law minister Shafique Ahmed earlier this week said ratification was necessary for prosecution of future instances of crimes against humanity. The ICC can only prosecute crimes committed on or after the date it came into force. However, ratification of the statute calls on countries to adopt a number of actions, including bringing their own laws into line with its provisions. The law minister last week confirmed that Bangladesh's upcoming 1971 war crimes trials would be held under its recently amended International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973. An expert panel of international lawyers, including a former war crimes prosecutor, submitted a legal opinion to the government last month, however, advising further amendments to ensure the 1973 Act meets international standards. Among other recommendations, the lawyers advise that sections of the Rome Statute dealing with rights of suspects during investigations must be included in the Act. As of October 2009, 110 states were party to the Rome Statute, and a further 38 states had signed but not ratified the treaty. The US, Sudan and Israel, once signatories, have 'unsigned' the statute
