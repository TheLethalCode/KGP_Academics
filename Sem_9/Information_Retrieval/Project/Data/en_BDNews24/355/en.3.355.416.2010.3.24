 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  Regulator BTRC has shut down operations of National Telecom, the fifth PSTN operator to be caught in the drive against illegal VoIP activities. The regulator raided the phone company's Mohakhali office for around four hours on Tuesday, shutting down its operations and sealing their switch room just after 6 pm, BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Ahmed said that the company's total call activities ranged between 2.3-2.4 million minutes over a 24 hour period two days ago, which plummeted to just 70-80,000 minutes during the time of the raid. This massive difference is being attributed as evidence of illegal call activities. "None of the company officials were there during the raid except the guards," Ahmed said. Rapid Action Battalion assisted Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission officials during the raid. RAB officials said that they also conducted a separate raid at the Banani residence of retired major Mohammad Jahangir, the company's chairman but failed to find him there. BTRC has until now closed down five private land phone operators for alleged involvement in the illegal VoIP business during the current crackdown that began on Mar 14 with a raid on Dhaka Phone. Since then, WorldTel, RanksTel and PeoplesTel have also been shutdown. In all about half a million land phone subscribers were unceremoniously cut-off due to BRTC's actions. Though the regulator took steps to reconnect them all on Tuesday. Meanwhile, RAB held a businessman with VoIP equipment in Chittagong on Tuesday, seizing telephony equipment worth Tk 1 crore. RAB-7 staff officer Saidul Islam told bdnews24.com that his team arrested Md Nizam Uddin from his flat at Asia Abedin Tower in the city's Love Lane area. He said Nizam had been long involved in the illegal VoIP business. bdnews24.com/
