<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government will not accept any further appeals for the withdrawl of 'politically motivated cases' after the end of March. Qamrul Islam, state minister for law, was speaking after a meeting on Wednesday of the government scrutiny body concerned with the withdrawal of these cases. At the meeting, the committee discussed 568 cases and recommended 274 cases for withdrawal including four filed by the Anticorruption Commission (ACC), Qamrul said. The other cases were filed under the penal code, he said. The scrutiny body rejected appeals relating to two cases filed by the ACC and 92 cases filed under the penal code as it said that it found no political motives behind the filing of these cases. The committee rejected the application made by Narayanganj Awami League leader AKM Shamim Osman involving a case filed by the ACC as he had already been found guilty. The other ACC case that was not withdrawn involved charges of corruption against the government employee Khandaker Abu Bakar Siddique. The state minister said the committee has so far recommended a total of 4,143 cases for withdrawal including 223 ACC cases. The government has sent the details of the case to be withdrawn to the relevant bodies including the courts. Referring to reports that the ACC felt 'pressurised' to withdrawl cases, he said that the government will not pressurise anyone to withdrawl. He said that the cases that seemed to the committee to involve political harassment have been recommended for withdrawal according to article 490 of the penal code. It is up to the relevant authourities, including the ACC to withdraw the cases. The government will not exert pressure. Quamrul said that no cases involving opposition members were withdrawn at today's committee meeting as no such cases were on the agenda. bdne
