<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chief is hopeful that the government will not amend the law in such a way that will curb the commission's independence and neutrality. The ACC chairman Golam Rahmanspeaking to reporters after a meeting with law minister Shafique Ahmed on Tuesdaysaid there were some faults in the Anticorruption Commission Act 2004, which needed to be rectified. "The caretaker government made the commission stronger by issuing an ordinance, which the incumbent government has not yet enacted," he said. The government did recently form a committee to reform ACC laws, which reportedly made some recommendations that, if implemented, would hamper the watchdog to work independently. ACC officials said the committee had recommended 19 amendments to the existing law. The law minister, in a separate meeting with journalists, alleged that the commission was used as a means to curb legitimate politics, rather than to stamp out graft from the country. Shafique said that the cabinet would take the final decision on the necessary legal reforms taking into account the recommendations made by the commission and the committee. ACC officials fear that, if enacted, these changes will curb the commission's independence. The law minister, however, stated that the government would not intervene in the affairs of the ACC. "But the commission will have to follow some legal structures as other commissions do," he added.
