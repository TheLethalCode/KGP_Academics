 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami could lose its registration as a political party if it doesn't amend seven points in its charter, which months after the deadline for final changes is still in conflict with the country's constitution. According to the Election Commission, the Islamist party, a major ally of the main opposition BNP, is refusing to fully comply with registration requirements, even after the commission found points inconsistent with the law. "As long as their constitution remains inconsistent with the country's constitution and the Representation of People's Order registration clauses, we will not accept them," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain has told bdnews24.com. Jamaat's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that his party had agreed to amend two points out of seven raised by the commission but could not reach a consensus on other issues. Party leaders said a part of the text of one section would be dropped that remained in the constitution during submission to the commission due to "printing error". The party has at last agreed to accept the loyalty to the country's constitution by dropping the point stating that it did not acknowledge any entity other than Allah as the supreme and sovereign power. It also agreed to amend a section of women's representation. "We will ask explanation from the Election Commission on other points when we sit with them," he said. The EC earlier this year found seven inconsistencies in Jamaat's constitution and told it to amend them. 'AMENDS' Assistant secretary general Kamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that they had dropped one part of the constitution following the EC's conditions but that it "somehow remained in the charter due to printing error". "We have decided to amend clause 2, sub-clause 5. It will be corrected in consultation with the Election Commission." An EC official, who is also on the committee for scrutinising the ratified constitutions, told bdnews24.com that the sub-clause, acknowledging no sovereignty other than Allah, undermined the authority of the parliament and elected legislature. However, Mojaheed alleged that the EC does not have any problem with the Communist Party of Bangladesh, which advocates Marxist rule in its constitution. "Why the commission should have problem with Jamaat if it wants to establish the rule of Islam in the constitution", he asked. "We will ask the commission's explanation on the matter," the Jamaat leader said. The EC review committee observed that there is no such scope to establish rule of Islam. The other point Jamaat agreed to amend relates to women's representation in the party. According to the EC requirement, every political party must have 33 percent women in the party by 2020. The RPO states that none of the parties' constitutions may contradict that of the national constitution and that there will be no discrimination on the basis of religion, sect, language or gender. Jamaat had protested against both the provisions and lobbied to strike them off the RPO in their consultation with the Election Commission during the immediate regime of the military-backed interim government. Jamaat eventually submitted its amended constitution to the EC by the July 21 deadline last year after holding party conference. Earlier, the party changed its name from Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh to Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami to get registered with the EC before the 2008 national elections. 'STILL IN BREACH' Other clauses that are inconsistent with the commission's requirements include: eradication of all kinds of atrocities, corruption and injustice from the society by establishing the rule of Islam through concerted effort; and change the government in a conventional way to establish the rule of Islam. There will not be any amendment on these points, Mojaheed said. Jamaat is also alleged to have breached some other conditions of the registration. The EC recently sent a letter to the Jamaat secretary general alleging that the party had direct links with Islamic Chhatra Shibir, which is the student wing of the Islamist party. According to the RPO, no party should have any student wing or associated organisaiton. The EC asked for an explanation from the party on the matter, M Sakhawat Hussain said. Kamaruzzaman alleged that the commission is overreacting on the issue. He claimed Shibir is an independent student organisaiton; Jamaat and Shibir has similar ideology from the very beginning. The registration does not have anything to do with it, he believed. He, however, said they would consider giving their explanation on the matter. He said that his party is complying with Bangladesh's constitution. "We have made necessary amendments to the constitution by incorporating a number of recommendations," he said. bdnew
