 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) - The Prime Bank board has decided to raise its authorised capital, but the bank has yet to disseminate the information among investors. In the meantime, the bank's share prices are rising. The board of directors took the decision on May 24 to raise its authorised capital up to Tk 900 crore from the existing Tk 400 crore. Its present paid-up capital is Tk175 crore, according to the bank. "Is it price sensitive information? Our company secretary has not informed us whether it is price sensitive information," M Shahjahan Bhuiyan, managing director of Prime Bank told bdnews24.com by phone Monday night. He said that they might make the information available after approval from the Bangladesh Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as from an extended general meeting. "Obviously, this is price-sensitive information. Any listed company taking such a decision must disseminate it to the market immediately," Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, told bdnews24.com. Manosh Kumar Ghosh, company secretary of Prime Bank, said the SEC guidelines on price sensitive information did not specifically mention it as such. Since early May, the share price of the Prime Bank has been rallying. On May 28 (Monday), its share price stood at Tk 791.5 on the DSE. A DSE monthly review for April showed that the closing price of Prime shares was Tk 483.25 on April 30 this year. Prime Bank, which secured its position in turnover in the last couple of days, recorded Tk 173.13 million Monday. The shares of the bank also grew 0.38 percent although the market ended downbeat. In a posting to the market on May 5, the bank management said that a group of Saudi investors met the Prime Bank top management a couple of times April 28 to 30 in Dhaka to explore the possibility of setting up a subsidiary of the bank in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. "An MOU was also signed between them and Saudi investors on April 30, 2007. This is an initial initiative only and both parties have agreed to continue discussions further," it said. On May 27, the bank, responding to a DSE query, said that there had been no subsequent developments regarding its joint venture arrangement in KSA. bd
