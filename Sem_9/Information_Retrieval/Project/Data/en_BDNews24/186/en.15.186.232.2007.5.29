 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Joint forces picked up seven top politicians, including Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, and two leading businessmen in less than 20 hours from Monday through early Tuesday in Dhaka and Sylhet. The joint forces led away Jalil, a key player in Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's ranks, from his Mercantile Bank office in Dilkhusha shortly before 4:00pm Monday. Former BNP minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar were among those who ended up in the custody of joint forces in a fresh crackdown. Joint forces picked up Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, a former Air Force chief, from his Gulshan-2 home at 3:38am Tuesday, bdnews24.com Correspondents Ehsanul Haque Babu and Abu Noman Sajib reported from the scene. Also arrested was AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim at 5:30am Tuesday at his Banani home in Dhaka, a house staffer told bdnews24.com. In another development, a team of the joint forces took away leading businessman Abdul Awal Mintoo from in front of the Naval Headquarters in Dhaka at 1:30am Tuesday, his younger brother Akbar Hossain told bdnews24.com by phone. Former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar was arrested at his Gulshan home at 4:05pm Monday. His APS Shafiur Shamsu confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. The joint forces arrested Partex Group chairman and former BNP lawmaker MA Hashem at his Gulshan office at 3:00pm Monday. His son Aziz Al Kaiser Tito confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. In Sylhet, the joint forces arrested Sylhet city mayor Badruddin Ahmed Kamran, 20 days after he was freed on bail. He was arrested at Gulshan Hotel and Restaurant in the city at 11:55pm Monday. RAID ON JALIL Jalil, who was at a meeting with the board of directors at Mercantile Bank, left the office with two army officers for an undisclosed destination. Mercantile Bank security chief Ali Akbar said: "Two army officers arrived at 3:45pm and asked him (Jalil) to go with them." In a post-arrest press briefing, AL president Sheikh Hasina asked the government to free her deputy. "He (Jalil) is ill. It's surprising that his arrest came just a day after he said the Awami League would stand by the government in reform efforts," she said. The joint forces raided Jalil's Gulshan home for two hours to 9:00pm Monday after his arrest, his relative Shahjad Rajib told bdnews24.com. Gulshan police sub-inspector Helal told bdnews24.com that the joint forces had seized up to five passports, bank cheques and land documents. ALTAF ARREST Altaf, 64, was taken to an undisclosed destination from his house on Road No. 67 in Gulshan. The bdnews24.com reporters saw the former Air Force chief in white panjabi when he was driven away. The joint forces entered the former minister's house at 1:15am and came out at 3:38am Tuesday. At least five army vehicles were pressed into service for the raid. The area was made off-limits to reporters and TV crew when the raid was going on. Sub-inspector Moyeen, duty officer of Gulshan Police Station, told bdnews24.com that he was unaware of the arrest. Altaf joined BNP politics in 1995 after he retired from the Air Force as air vice-marshal. Altaf, who was elected from Patuakhali-1 constituency, also served the coalition government as home minister and ran into controversy. SYLHET MAYOR Badruddin Ahmed Kamran's wife Asma Kamran told bdnews24.com by phone: "I got to know he was arrested. But I don't know where he is now." Gulshan Hotel manager Shibul Chandra Das said the joint forces had arrived in three vehicles for the midnight raid. Some officers were in plainclothes, he said. Sylhet Kotwali police chief Ahmed Noor said he had heard about the arrest, without giving further details. Kamran was first arrested on April 6 in connection with the longstanding 'kitchen market' case filed in 2003. He was freed from Comilla jail on May 8. PATOL ARREST Former BNP state minister for sports Fazlur Rahman Patol was detained by the joint forces early Tuesday. Patol's younger brother Harunur Rashid Babu told bdnews24.com that the members of joint forces had raided Patol's Banasree home in Rampura at 1:00am. After a thorough search of the house, they took Patol away at 4:45am, he said. When asked where they were headed, the raiders asked the family to get in touch with the local police station and left. RAFIQUL ISLAM In another raid, the joint forces arrested former state minister for power Professor Rafiqul Islam early Tuesday. Ashish, Rafiq's son, confirmed the news and told bdnews24.com: "The joint forces raided our Dhanmondi home at about 4:00am and then took father along with them." Ashish further said four cases were filed against the former AL state minister during the rule of the BNP alliance regime on charges of irregularities involving power projects. bdnews24.com/ehb/ rb
