<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)Barrister Mainul Hosein Tuesday said that not everyone was arrested with corruption links. "Many were detained for information extraction." "I have no information on what charges they are being arrested. The home ministry and the Anticorruption Commission may have information," Mainul told reporters at the secretariat after the arrests of several top politicians and businessmen in a fresh anticorruption drive by joint forces. "I am not informed about the matter. The responsibilities of arrests are not mine." Mainul claimed that the interim government was in power with the people's mandate. On an allegation that the ongoing drive was against politicians, the adviser said, "I would not say anything on the comments of political leaders." Reiterating his ignorance about the drive, Mainul said, "I, alone, am not the government. As the law adviser all information does not come to me. It is known to all that an anti-graft drive is going on in the country." However, while speaking on the drive, Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Monday told reporters, "The Anticorruption Commission doesn't know anything about this. They might have been arrested for other causes." When asked whether anybody with a higher status than that of the general secretary of a political party would be arrested he had said, "The responsibility of arrest is not mine." When Mainul's attention was drawn to Sheikh Hasina's comment on the tenure of the emergency being over, the Barrister in a humorous tone said, "Tenure is over, that's good." At this point he posed a counter question, "Did we come with any such mandate that we will have to go by the dictates of the political leaders? We came with the mandate for holding a fair election. We came with a mandate to free the country from corruption. The political leaders will speak as they wish. Why do you ask me about them?" To a question that as top ranking leaders were being arrested who would conduct party reforms, journalists did not get any reply. From Monday to early morning Tuesday, joint forces arrested Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, former state minister for home of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government Lutfozzaman Babar, former commerce minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and top businessmen Abdul Awal Mintoo and Abul Hashem. bdnews24.c
