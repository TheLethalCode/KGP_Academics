<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Struggling skipper Habibul Bashar has stepped aside from one-day captaincy but says he wants to remain in the squad. Bangladesh's most successful captain announced his decision Sunday after his side lost the two-test series 1-0 to India following a 2-0 one-day series defeat. The 34-year-old batsman said his continued captaincy in Tests depended on the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which might soon decide on his future in the Test squad. "I have made up my mind. I don't want to captain the one-day side any more," he told reporters after Bangladesh lost the second and final Test by an innings and 239 runs. "But, I'll be available for the selectors for the one-day squad. If they want me in the squad, I will definitely play." Bashar led Bangladesh to 29 one-day wins in 69 matches, but came under fire after making only 105 runs in the World Cup. His duck and 43 runs in the two one-day matches against India in the just-concluded series did little to help his cause. A third match was rained out. Bashar has led Bangladesh in 18 Tests with one win, 12 defeats and five draws but has come under scrutiny after making just 46 runs in four innings against India. bd
