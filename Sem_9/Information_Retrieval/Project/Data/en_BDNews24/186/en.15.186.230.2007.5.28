 Ruby Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government is going to soon finalise a national urbanisation policy, decentralising civic amenities such as health, education and infrastructure to ease pressure on the capital. Urban planner Prof Nazrul Islam, one of the policy formulators, told bdnews24.com Tuesday the policy aimed to build a cleaner Dhaka decentralising everything from transport to education to health services. A draft national urbanisation policy was formulated at the fag end of the past government in a bid to ease huge pressure on civic amenities centralised in the capital to service ever-increasing population and infrastructure. "If the policy is implemented, every town of the country will become a centre of development," Prof Islam said. The policy provides guidelines for relocating and establishing garment factories, educational institutions and big industrial units to convenient places outside Dhaka, he said. "Establishment of educational institutions, business firms and industrial units in Dhaka will be discouraged in the finalised policy." "Instead of issuing permission for new private universities in Dhaka City, the government is considering allowing three new private universities in Sylhet, northern Bangladesh and Khulna regions," Prof Islam said. "The draft policy has been submitted to the local government adviser. We will soon meet the adviser to finalise the matter," the executive engineer of the Local Government and Engineering Directorate (LGED), Mohiur Islam Khan, told bdnews24.com. "The policy will be announced after the draft is reviewed by the ministry of local government and approved by the Council of Advisers," the superintending engineer of the LGED, Md Abdul Gaffar, said. bdnews24
