 AMSTERDAM, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland unveiled a bid for ABN AMRO on Tueday valued at 38.40 euros per share, worth a total 71.1 billion euros ($95.7 billion). Consortium member Fortis said the banks planned to offer 30.40 euros in cash plus 0.844 new shares in RBS for each ABN AMRO share. The consortium of RBS, Fortis and Santander expects aggregate estimated cost savings of 4.23 billion euros and estimated profit enhancements from revenue benefits of 1.22 billion euros by the end of 2010. The consortium has so far been rebuffed by ABN management, which has agreed to an all-share takeover by Britain's Barclays currently valued at 63 billion euros. "Because of the banks' comprehensive strategic fit with ABN AMRO across its activities, the banks expect that ... they will be able to create stronger businesses with enhanced market presence and growth prospects," the statement said. The proposed offer is not subject to any financing condition, with capital raisings fully underwritten, but is conditional on ABN AMRO shareholders voting against ABN's planned sale of its US unit, LaSalle, to Bank of America, Fortis said. Fortis intends to raise 15 billion euros of new equity financing via a rights issue and up to 5 billion euros of new Tier 1 capital, and to release up to 8 billion euros of capital, the statement said. RBS plans to issue new shares worth about 15 billion euros to ABN AMRO shareholders and intends to raise approximately 6 billion euros of new non-dilutive Tier 1 capital and to finance the remainder of its share of the payment from internal resources. Santander intends to raise approximately 9.5-10 billion euros of new equity financing via a rights issue and convertible instruments, amounting to approximately half of its share of the consideration, and to finance the remainder through balance sheet optimisation, including leverage, incremental securitisation and asset disposals, the statement said
