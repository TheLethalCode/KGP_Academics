<TITLE> Thailand awaits 'Judgement Day' party rulings </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The judges were isolated and 1,000 police manned barricades around the court on Wednesday as Thais awaited rulings on whether major parties would be disbanded and their leaders banned from politics. 'Judgement Day', the English-language newspaper Bangkok Post proclaimed in a banner headline on a day that could see former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted in a bloodless coup last September, barred from politics for five years. The nine judges of the Constitutional Tribunal, who reached their verdicts on Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) and the Democrat Party on Tuesday and remained in seclusion, were driven in a high-security motorcade to the court. Their verdicts were due to be announced live on television -- at 0630 GMT for the Democrats and 0730 GMT for Thai Rak Thai. The leading Thai-language newspaper Thai Rath said a majority of the judges had opted after fierce debate for the verdict most Thais seemed to want -- to ban individuals for breaching election laws last year but leave the parties intact. But the business daily Post Today said both parties would be dissolved and their leaders banned. There was no confirmation of the reports, although leaders of the two parties said they were confident their organisations would survive. However, about 170 leaders of the two parties are vulnerable to bans for breaches of election laws in inconclusive polls, later annulled, which Thaksin called last year in the face of a mounting street campaign against him. Such bans would delay passage of a new constitution and the holding of elections which coup leaders promised for December. That would plunge coup-prone Thailand deeper into the political unknown, analysts said. Most vulnerable is Thaksin himself, accused of abuse of power and reigning over rampant corruption by the campaigners who took to the streets and the military leaders who ousted him. Thaksin, who has lived in London since his overthrow, regularly insists he has quit politics to general disbelief back home. He has said through his lawyer that he would accept whatever verdict the tribunal hands down. No one doubts the generals want him banned. However, no one is certain that the vast army of supporters in the countryside and among the urban poor who swept him to two landslide election victories will take the judgements as calmly as Thaksin says he will. Despite attempts to block Thaksin supporters from entering Bangkok, they had managed to sneak through checkpoints into the capital, coup council spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said. Army chief and coup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin met Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, who has the power to impose martial law and a curfew, early on Wednesday to talk about the emergency plan he had prepared to deal with any unrest. The army, navy, air force and police had 13,000 men "ready to come out if things escalate", Sunsern said. But Sonthi was sanguine after the meeting. "I expect no violence. But if anything happens, we will start with soft measures and move towards hard measures. No weapon will be used but persuasion," he told reporters. Police around the court building had orders to evacuate the judges if the situation turned ugly. Mobile phone signals, which can be used to trigger bombs, would be switched off in the immediate area
