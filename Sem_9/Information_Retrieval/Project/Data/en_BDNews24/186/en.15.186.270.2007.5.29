 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun Tuesday said that he was shown arrested two months after the joint forces had taken him into custody and that he was threatened with death in "crossfire". He pleaded not guilty of corruption charges to the Special Judge's Court-5 at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. The Anticorruption Commission sued him for his not submitting a wealth statement within 72 hours from their serving a notice on him on Feb 19. A close friend and business partner of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman, Mamun told Justice Ashraf Hossain he had failed to submit statements as he had all along been in the custody of the joint forces. The court set Thursday for hearing the editors and reporters of three newspapers that had reported that Mamun was arrested on Jan 31. Mamun's lawyers sought the court's permission to produce them on Thursday. The court agreed to hear them if they were willing to testify. "The joint forces arrested four people including me from a Paltan house at 12:30 noon on January 31. They took us to an unknown place and after medical examination there, I was blindfolded and moved to another hideout," said Mamun. He had given the joint forces a wealth statement on Feb 6. Another ACC notice asking him to submit a wealth statement reached him on Feb 19, the court heard. Since in the custody of the joint forces from Jan 31 to Mar 26, he could not submit an assets statement to the ACC, he explained. He was shown arrested on Mar 26 and remanded for 50 days, Mamun added. "The joint forces took me to a secret spot on March 6 for crossfire and intimidated me." bdnews24.com
