 Smita Mishra bdnews24.com Correspondent Guwahati, May 29 (bdnews24.com) -- Indian borderguards said on Tuesday they have arrested two Awami League leaders when the duo were trying to cross over into the country's northeastern state of Tripura. The arrests were made early on Tuesday. But neither the BSF nor the Tripura police were divulging their identity. "We have arrested two Bangladesh nationals and they said they are senior leaders of Awami League. We are ascertaining their identity," said J.Khan, Inspector-General of BSF in Tripura. "I have no idea who these people are but I can tell you the BSF has not yet handed them over to the state police," said Tripura police chief Kumar Trishuldhari Singh. bdnews24.com learns that the two arrested are Jahangir Kabir Nanak, chairman of the Awami Jubo League, and Mirza Azam, former MP and general secretary of the Jubo League. The two had apparently fled towards Tripura after the massive crackdown by Bangladesh's military-backed Interim government that has led to a spate of high profile arrests in the past two days. Both are now learnt to be lodged in the BSF camp at Buxanagar in Tripura's western sub-division of Sonamura opposite Bangladesh's Comilla region. Sonamura has always been the favourite route for high-profile escapees from Bangladesh. After the fall of the Ershad regime in December 1990, some of his close confidantes like Kazi Zafar Ahmed and Naziur Rahman Manjur used this route to flee into India. b
