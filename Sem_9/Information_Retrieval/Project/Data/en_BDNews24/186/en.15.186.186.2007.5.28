<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's ruling Socialists and the conservative opposition held their ground on Sunday in regional polls that test the waters before a general election next year. The party in power and their Popular Party (PP) rivals appeared to hold most of their strongholds after a campaign dominated by debate over the future of the Basque Country. The PP attacked Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero for being soft on Basque rebels ETA, with whom he tried but failed to get a peace deal. In a ballot for town halls held at the same time the parties were neck-and-neck with around 35 percent each after 94 percent of the vote had been counted. As predicted, the Socialists took a battering in the capital Madrid. PP Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon widened his lead by up to three seats following a lackluster campaign by a little-known Socialist candidate. The Socialists held Seville and Barcelona as expected, while the PP will stay in Valencia's town hall as well as Madrid's. "The main cities in principle will not change government, ... and this kind of continuity will probably set the general tone," Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. Results for the regional vote were slower trickling in, but exit polls showed the status quo appeared to have held in 16 of 17 regions, although the PP faced losing Navarre. The conservative PP government was swept from national office in 2004 just three days after bomb attacks attributed by judges and security experts to Al Qaeda. The PP, however, had tried to pin the attacks, which killed 191 people, on separatist guerrillas ETA. Voters in the Basque region on Sunday were greeted with demonstrators protesting against a ban on hundreds of candidates because of their links to ETA. Early on Sunday, the mayor of the Basque resort city of San Sebastian was heckled as he cast his vote and in another polling station protesters scuffled with police, with one arrested. ETA's political ally Batasuna has been banned from running but has called on its followers to vote for little-known separatist party ANV. Overall results in the Basque region were slow coming in, although exit polls showed few big changes. But any perception that ANV has done well could cause problems for Zapatero. Surveys show separatist violence is the biggest concern for Spanish voters, and the PP, which wants unconditional ETA surrender, had called on the prime minister to ban ANV. Debate has elsewhere centered on town hall corruption, skyrocketing housing prices and immigration, all issues of national and local concern. Pre-election polls showed the Socialists were expected to have a slight overall lead over the PP, but analysts thought a better result for the government could prompt Zapatero to bring forward general elections, due next March
