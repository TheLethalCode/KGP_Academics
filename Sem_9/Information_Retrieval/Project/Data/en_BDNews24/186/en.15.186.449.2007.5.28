 ROME, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Early results for Italian local elections in which 10 million people were eligible to vote put the centre-right opposition ahead on Monday, but Romano Prodi's left-leaning government appeared to have avoided a drubbing. The ballots on Sunday and Monday were the first major electoral test for Prodi a year after taking office, when opinion polls suggest six out of 10 Italians think his fractious nine-party government has not done a good job. Initial projections for the seven contested provinces gave a 4 to 3 advantage for the opposition, which also strengthened its grip on most of the town halls it already held and was on course to grab the city of Verona from the centre left. In the Piedmont region centre-right candidates had a lead of 70 percent of votes in some municipalities. Prodi's coalition looked set to retain control of Genoa, a northern port city which was one of the main prizes up for grabs in the polls, and take L'Aquila from the centre-right. It also conquered the Sicilian city of Agrigento, previously ran by the opposition, allowing it to partly compensate for its poor showing in other parts of the island earlier this month. In all, some 860 towns elected mayor and seven provinces their governors in the two-day ballot. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent, a run-off will be held in two weeks. Centre-right leader and former premier Silvio Berlusconi, who narrowly lost to Prodi in last year's general election, had raised the stakes ahead of the ballot by saying the government would have to step down in case of defeat. Prodi and his allies have in turn played down the importance of the local polls, saying they had no national bearing. "Berlusconi lost all local elections (when he was in power) and never resigned, so he is the last person who can talk," said Deputy Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema ahead of results. Prodi has been dogged from the outset by a razor-thin Senate majority exposing deep divisions in his Catholic-to-communist coalition, which nearly cost him his job in February. He gets little credit for slashing the budget deficit and spurring growth, while his allies have quarrelled on just about everything from gay rights to pension reforms. Later on Monday, the government meets trade unions over state workers' pay in a last-ditch attempt to avoid a stri
