 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday appealed to the High Court to hear MiG-29 and frigate purchase graft cases against Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. Deputy attorney general Golam Mohammad Chowdhury Alal submitted a "mention slip" to the bench of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Ataur Rahman Khan while appealing that the hearing of the cases be revived. The High Court is to issue an order on the dates for hearing of the two cases Tuesday. Abdullah al Zahid, an official of the now defunct bureau of anticorruption, filed the MiG-29 purchase scam case against the former premier and four others with Tejgaon Police Station on December 11, 2001. Anticorruption bureau official Mir Md Joynul Abedin Shibli filed the frigate purchase scam case with Tejgaon Police Station against five persons including Hasina on August 7, 2002. According to the case details, the frigate purchase allegedly caused the government a loss of Tk 447 crore. Zahid alleged that the government had to count Tk 700 crore in losses on the purchase of eight MiG-29s. In 2003, charges were pressed against Hasina and six others in the MiG-29 case and five people in the frigate case and charge sheets were submitted before the court in this connection. The High Court, in the same year, stayed the proceedings of the cases following Hasina's appeals. The same High Court bench had earlier fixed July 25 for a final hearing on the appeal to scrap the Meghna Ghat purchase scam case against Hasina. The then government of Sheikh Hasina procured eight MiG-29 fighter planes for the Bangladesh Air Force and a frigate for the Navy at a cost of nearly $229 million ($123.98 million for the MiGs and $105 million for the frigate). Apart from the corruption case at home, the MiG sellers sued Bangladesh for non-payment of instalments in the International Court of Arbitration. bd
