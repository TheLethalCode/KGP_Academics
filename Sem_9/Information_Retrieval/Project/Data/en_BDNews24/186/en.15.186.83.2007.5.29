 ODESSA, Ukraine, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine appears increasingly likely to prolong grain export quotas as severe drought threatens the 2007 harvest, prompting industry analysts on Tuesday to slash forecasts for exports in the 2007/08 season. APK-Inform consultancy revised down its 2007 grain crop forecast to 33.3 million tonnes from 34.3 million last year due to a nationwide drought that Ukraine's top weather forecaster said was affecting 60 percent of winter and spring grains. Exports in 2007/08 would drop to 7.8 million tonnes, down from a forecast 8.9 million tonnes in 2006/07, analyst Anastasia Ivasenko told a conference organised by her APK-Inform agency. "We have to expect strict market regulation and export quotas could be preserved in the 2007/08 season," Ivasenko said. "There are only two possible decisions: to import or to limit exports." The grain crop in Ukraine depends heavily on the weather in May. An absence of rainfall could result in a sharp decrease in the harvest. Last week the agriculture ministry said drought had already killed 400,000 hectares of crops and the damaged area was likely to rise sharply. The ministry's current grain harvest forecast for 2007 is about 38 million tonnes. The drought could force the government to cancel a decision to lift wheat export quotas that disrupted shipments and inflicted millions of dollars of losses on some trading firms. "In line with our obligations to the World Trade Organisation, Ukraine has a right to introduce some limitations if the situation affects the country's ability to feed itself," Deputy Agriculture Minister Serhiy Melnik told the conference. Restrictions were lifted last week but their cancellation has not yet been signed into law. "Traders are nervous that the abolition of wheat export quotas could be suspended," one trader said. Tetyana Adamenko, head of Ukraine's department of agrarian meteorology, forecast winter wheat -- which accounts for 90-95 percent of the total wheat crop -- falling to between 10 million and 12.5 million tonnes from 13 million tonnes in 2006. "We have passed the critical point in the south of the country," she said. "Those in the centre of Ukraine have another five days, but even if the rains come, the harvest will be 30 percent less than it might have been." Spring wheat would also be affected, the meteorologist said. "It has a chance if rains come at the start of June although it's already the case that we won't have a good harvest." APK-Inform's Ivasenko forecast Ukraine's 2007 wheat crop at 14.01 million tonnes compared with 13.9 million last year. She said wheat exports would dip to 2.1 million tonnes in 2007/08 from 2.8 million forecast in 2006/07. She forecast the barley crop at 10.73 million tonnes against 11.34 million tonnes last year, and said exports would slip to 4.5 million tonnes in 2007/08 from 4.8 million in the current season. Maize output would fall to 5.96 million tonnes from 6.43 million and exports would be unchanged from a forecast 1.0 million tonnes in the current season, she said. Another agriculture consultancy, UkrAgroConsult, last week revised its 2007 wheat crop outlook to 16-17 million tonnes from its previous estimate of 17.7 million. It cut its barley harvest forecast to 9.5-9.7 million tonnes from 10.3 million. Ukraine consumes about 12 million tonnes of wheat a seas
