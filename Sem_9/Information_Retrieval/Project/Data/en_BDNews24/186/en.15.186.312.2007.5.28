 MINSK, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five activists of an unauthorised youth group went on trial on Monday in Belarus, an ex-Soviet state accused of human rights abuses, with about 100 supporters massed outside the courthouse in their support. The five defendants are members of the "Youth Front" organisation which has been denied official registration by the administration of President Alexander Lukashenko. A crackdown on dissent has seen the recent adoption of legislation with toughened penalties for crimes associated with public order. Membership of an unregistered organisation is punishable by two years in prison. One Youth Front activist has been sentenced to 18 months. Reporters outside the courthouse said protesters joined hands, held up portraits of the defendants and shouted "Hands off the Youth Front!" and "Freedom for our Young People!" Also present was Alexander Milinkevich, who challenged Lukashenko in his landslide re-election last year, but was removed as sole leader of the opposition at a weekend congress. Police took no action but warned participants they could be held criminally responsible for their actions. Lukashenko remains generally popular among voters who say he has improved living standards and avoided the upheavals of other ex-Soviet states. He has been barred entry to the United States and European Union over allegations he rigged last year's election. Western countries have threatened to impose further trade sanctions if authorities take no action to observe human rights norms. Two opposition activists were released from prison terms ahead of schedule last week. But Belarus's Supreme Court threw out an appeal from Alexander Kozulin, who also ran against Lukashenko last year and was jailed for 5 1/2 years after organising protests against his re-election
