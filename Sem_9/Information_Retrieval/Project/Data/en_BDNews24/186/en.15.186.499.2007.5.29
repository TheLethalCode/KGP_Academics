 MOSCOW, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday warned that the deployment of a US missile shield in Europe would turn the continent into "a powder keg". "We consider it harmful and dangerous to turn Europe into a powder keg and to stuff it with new weapons," Putin told visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates at the Kremlin. "It creates new and unnecessary risks for the whole system of international and European relations," he told Socrates, whose country takes over the European Union's rotating presidency on July 1. Russia's Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said it had test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile featuring multiple warheads designed to overcome missile defence systems.

Lukashenko, accused in the West of crushing fundamental rights, criticised Russia in the New Year for increasing gas prices and removing preferential oil tariffs. But he has since urged Moscow to forget their spat and work for improved ties. The United States says the shield is needed to protect against missile attacks from what it calls rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. It wants to place elements of the shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, but Russia has strongly opposed the project as a threat to its national security. German Social Democrat leader Kurt Beck also criticised the planned missile shield on Tuesday, calling in a newspaper editorial for a renewed commitment to global disarmament. Beck, whose SPD governs in a grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, was backed by other European socialists visiting Moscow, reflecting misgivings about the US plans from left-of-centre parties in Euro
