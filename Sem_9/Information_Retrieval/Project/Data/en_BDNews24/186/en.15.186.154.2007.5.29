 HAMBURG, Germany, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The conflict in Afghanistan will ensure Pakistan remains a main ally of the United States regardless of who wins US presidential elections next year, Pakistan's foreign minister said on Monday. Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, whose country is at odds with Afghanistan over an escalating Taliban insurgency, also said he was due to meet his Afghan counterpart in Potsdam on Wednesday on the sidelines of a Group of Eight foreign ministers' meeting for talks organized by G8 president Germany. "Even if there is a change of (US) policy on Iraq, my own assessment is that Afghanistan will remain important to the next administration," Kasuri told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an EU-Asian foreign ministers' meeting in Hamburg. "Pakistan has a fundamental role to play and is of fundamental importance for the future of Afghanistan." The Bush administration regards Pakistan as a key asset in its war on terrorism and its cooperation is considered crucial for the West's mission in Afghanistan. But there has been increasing calls from US media and think tanks for Washington to rethink its support for Pervez Musharraf amid allegations that the Pakistani president is not doing enough to hunt down militants operating from Pakistan. Kasuri said that was not his assessment: "That's not what we are hearing at all from the US administration or from important senators and congressmen, not at all," Kasuri said. "Both parties (Democratic and Republican) understand the situation so I'm not really disturbed." "Both countries have found it in their interest to cooperate with each other and I think those conditions will not disappear," he added. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have also deteriorated sharply in recent months as Taliban insurgents gather strength in Afghanistan. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan blame each other for a resurgence of Taliban militants. "Both countries understand the difficulties, the international community understands the difficulties and it's in that spirit that I plan to discuss these problems with (my Afghan counterpart) in a very cooperative spirit," Kasuri said. "The international community must remain very determined and its resolve must not be weakened by the difficulties that we are facing," he added. Kasuri said it was important that refugees who have fled Afghanistan be repatriated as quickly as possible "Particularly the refugees on the border areas are living in camps and provide a haven for all sorts of unsavory elements," he said. "It's in the interest of Afghanistan and Pakistan that these people go back," he said
