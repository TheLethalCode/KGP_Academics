<TITLE> China presses US to rein in Taiwan's Chen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China urged the United States to do more to constrain Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, whose moves towards independence have angered the mainland. Chinese State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan told George Schwab, president of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a Washington-based association, that ties between their two countries were healthy. But Tang, a former foreign minister who now helps guide his country's diplomacy, stressed China's worries about Taiwan, which receives arms and informal support from the United States. Tang "stressed that opposing and containing Taiwan independence and protecting the peace and stability and Taiwan Strait suit the shared strategic interests of China and the United States," the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported on its Web site (www.fmprc.com.cn) late on Monday. Tang urged Washington to "support China's efforts to improve and develop cross-strait relations, and adopt substantive and effective measures to halt Chen Shui-bian's various Taiwan independence provocations and dangerous ventures". Tang's call for Washington to resist Chen's policies marked another shift from Beijing's long-standing line that Taiwan is purely an internal matter. In recent years, China has maintained that claim while also pressing the Bush administration to rein Chen in. Beijing deeply distrusts the independence-leaning Chen, who won presidential elections for the Democratic Progressive Party in 2000 and 2004, and fears he will accelerate his agenda before presidential elections in March next year. China and Taiwan have been separated since 1949, when defeated Nationalist forces fled to the island. Since then, the Communist Party-ruled mainland has demanded that Taiwan accept reunification and has threatened force to stop the island embracing independence. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States would show "grave concern" at any military moves against Taiwan, but the act does not oblige it to intervene. bd
