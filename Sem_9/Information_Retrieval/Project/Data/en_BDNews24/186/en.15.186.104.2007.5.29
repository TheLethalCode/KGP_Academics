 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Signs of strength in the Japanese economy boosted the yen and global stocks on Tuesday while government bonds fell after the data and after hawkish comments on interest rates from the European Central Bank. Oil prices rebounded above $70 a barrel as worries continued about supplies from Nigeria and base metals were also firmer, with lead hitting a record high following a delay in exports from Australia. The yen rallied from a three-month low versus the dollar after data showed Japan's jobless rate sank to a nine-year low and consumer spending topped expectations in April, fuelling expectations the Bank of Japan will raise borrowing costs in the coming months. "BOJ rate hike expectations are intensifying," said Tomoko Fujii, senior economist and strategist at Bank of America. "The market is pricing in an earlier-than-expected rate rise." The dollar was down 0.3 percent from late European dealings on Monday at 121.25, while the euro was down 0.3 percent at 163.15 yen. Japan's unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in April from 4.0 percent in March, while household spending in the world's number-two economy rose by 1.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with just 0.2 percent expected in a Reuters poll. The data and rate rise speculation sparked a sell-off in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs). The yield on interest rate sensitive two-year paper hit a 10-year high, which weighed on US Treasuries and euro zone Bunds. The yield on 10-year Bunds hit a three-year high of 4.403 percent, while two-year Bund yields hit a five-year peak. Comments from ECB Governing Council member Axel Weber added to the negative bond sentiment in Europe. Weber said in an interview with the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper that euro zone interest rates are not yet appropriate and the ECB was prepared to shift to a restrictive monetary policy if needed to keep inflation in check. "Weber has been very hawkish, opening the way for rates to move beyond 4 percent and we've also taken a lead from JGBs overnight, the Nikkei did okay too," said one Bund trader. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.5 percent to 17,672.6 points, and other regional markets also performed solidly, lifting MSCI's Asia ex-Japan index 0.4 percent. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 edged up 0.1 percent to 1,601.3 points as volumes picked up following holidays in Britain, Germany and the United States on Monday. Commerzbank strategist Ralf Groenemeyer said European stocks, which have gained 7.9 percent so far this year, were likely to continue rising. "The reporting season has supported an upward trend in the market, and the majority of companies have exceeded expectations," he said. Vodafone rose 3.8 percent after reporting solid earnings and a hike in dividends, but there were losses among some heavyweight drug and bank stocks. GlaxoSmithKline shed 2 percent on news doctors have largely stopped prescribing the company's diabetes drug Avandia since a study was published last week linking it to heart attack risk. Royal Bank of Scotland was also down 2 percent after the consortium it is leading unveiled a $95.7 billion bid for Dutch rival ABN AMRO. Commodity markets were mostly firmer, with London Brent crude up 35 cents at $70.06 a barrel, recouping some of Monday's losses after Nigerian unions suspended a two-day strike that had threatened to halt oil flows. "Yesterday's decline was a knee-jerk reaction to the end of the strike, but prices are going up again now because the overall situation in Nigeria is still unstable, and we still have some supply disruptions," said Tony Nunan of Mitsubishi Corp. Gold was little moved around $656 an ounce, but copper added more than 1.5 percent, recouping losses from last week
