 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  Only 36.58 percent of the total annual development programme (ADP) outlay has been spent in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, prompting the government to further cut the revised ADP, officials said. The figure is 8 percent less than what the government had spent in the same period of fiscal 2005-06 and 10 percent less than fiscal 2004-05, according to Planning Commission officials. The government last month revised the ADP down to Tk 21,600 crore from the original allocation of Tk 26,000 crore mainly because of poor implementation blamed on political unrest. "Only Tk 9,513 crore has been spent in July to March of 2006-07, which was Tk 10,950 crore for the same period of 2005-06 and Tk 10,312 crore for 2004-05," a senior Planning Commission official told bdbnews24.com Monday, asking not to be named. "If the government wants to implement the revised ADP allocation, it has only three months to spend Tk 12,087 crore," the official said. Tk 6,439.91 crore had been spent in the first half (July-December) of the current fiscal year, according to Planning Commission statistics. The immediate past government had spent Tk 4,293 crore or 16.51 percent of the amount in the first quarter (July-Sept) of the current fiscal year. The third quarter or January to March of the current fiscal year has been run by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government that has been able to spend only Tk 3,479 crore or 13.38 percent of the ADP outlay. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam had said at a half-yearly ADP review meeting in February that political unrest was the main reason for poor implementation. "Political unrest in the last three months was one of the main reasons for this poor ADP implementation rate," Islam had told reporters. Two other major problems the adviser had identified were failure of the authorities to properly select projects and inadequate inflow of promised foreign aid. bd
