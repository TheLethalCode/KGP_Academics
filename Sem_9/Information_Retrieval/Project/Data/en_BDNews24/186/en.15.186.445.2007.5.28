"There are four dead and 23 injured, five of them seriously," army spokesman Acra Tiproch said. Two of the dead were children. It is not known whether the victims were Buddhist or Muslim. The blast, in the southern province of Songkhla which has avoided much of the daily violence, came less than a day after a string of seven small bombs in the provincial capital, Hat Yai, wounded 13 people. Suspected Muslim separatists have hit towns in the far south, an independent sultanate until annexed by overwhelmingly Buddhist Thailand a century ago, with a series of small bombs designed to cause chaos rather than mass death.
