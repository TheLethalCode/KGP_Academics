<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen wearing police uniforms kidnapped at least three Western lecturers and several of their bodyguards from a Finance Ministry building in central Baghdad on Tuesday, a witness told Reuters. (update) Police said the lecturers were German and they were seized from their cars outside the ministry building. The lecturers had been advising ministry personnel on organising electronic contracts, said the witness, who did not want to be identified. The gunmen entered the lecture room led by a man wearing a police major's uniform. "Where are the foreigners, where are the foreigners?", the gunmen shouted, according to the witness who was in the conference room. At least 22 people were killed and 55 were wounded when a bomb planted in a parked minibus exploded in a busy commercial area in central Baghdad, police said. The blast was near a major intersection in Tayaran Square, an area filled with markets where day labourers, usually poor Shias, queue for work. No other details were immediately available. More than 200 foreigners and thousands of Iraqis have been kidnapped since the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003, although there had been a relative lull in the taking of foreigners in recent months. Most of the foreign hostages who have been taken in Iraq have been released but at least 60 have been reported killed by their captors. The witness in the Finance Ministry said another lecturer escaped being abducted because he was sitting apart from his colleagues. The lecturers, all men and employed by a US organisation, had given at least 12 lectures at the ministry over the past year, she said. There was no immediate comment from the US Embassy. A source at the Finance Ministry confirmed the lecturers had been kidnapped but said he had no further information. Tuesday's assault appeared to be the first time Westerners have been kidnapped from inside an Iraqi government building where many foreigners work assisting the government, and as contractors. A German woman, married to an Iraqi doctor, and her son were kidnapped on Feb 6. Last year two German engineers were captured in Iraq and held for 99 days before they were freed, although it was not clear if a ransom was paid. German archaeologist Susanne Osthoff was also held by an Islamist group
