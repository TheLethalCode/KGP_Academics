 Chittagong, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Sunday filed a new case against Chittagong city mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, accusing him of stealing money from the corporation fund, police said. The commission's Chittagong deputy director Abu Md Arif Siddiqui filed the case with Kotwali Police Station, sub inspector Harunur Rashid told bdnews24.com. According to case details, the mayor along with three officials had embezzled more than Tk 1.4 crore in the name of launching a satellite television, Bijoy TV. The three officials are the corporation's chief engineer Md Moktar Alam, superintendent engineer Md Shahidullah and Chittagong Theatre Institute director Ahmed Iqbal Haider. On Dec 16, Bijoy TV started test transmission but a government order derailed its operations on March 13. The plaintiff also said the accused did not take permission from the local government, rural development and cooperatives and information ministries to launch the television channel. He has said that using the city corporation fund in this way and launching a television channel without permission from the relevant ministries is a punishable offence under law. Police official Harun said a local agent started the channel's operations through an agreement with a Singapore firm on the basis of monthly rent. To support the operation, more than Tk 1.4 crore has been drawn in two installments from the city corporation fund, he said. On May 24, ACC deputy director Arif Siddiqui filed the first case against Mohiuddin and four others. They were charged with misappropriating Tk 83.49 lakh in buying five trucks for waste dumping and other equipment for the corporation. Joint forces arrested Mohiuddin on March 7 at his home in the southern port city of Chittagong. bdnew
