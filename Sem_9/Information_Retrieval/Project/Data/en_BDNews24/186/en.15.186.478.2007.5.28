 HONG KONG, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks held steady on Monday as investors took to the sidelines ahead of a slew of key US economic data due later in the week. Oil shares were the market leaders, with Sinopec Corp gaining on news of a gas find near its Puguang field, but banking stocks extended their decline under pressure from China's tightening cycle. Trade was quiet but cautious as US consumer confidence data, preliminary first-quarter real GDP, May non-farm payrolls and other economic reports were expected later in the week. US and London financial markets will be closed for public holidays on Monday. "There is no obvious direction for the Hang Seng Index," said Castor Pang, strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial. "It's a see-saw situation. People are waiting for direction from the US market and investors are waiting for more information before pushing the index up further." The benchmark Hang Seng Index erased most of the morning's gains to close 9.1 points higher at 20,529.76. The China Enterprises Index of H shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, dropped 6.18 points to 10,643.66. Turnover was HK$54.5 billion (US$7.0 billion) compared with Friday's HK$68 billion. Sinopec Corp vaulted 2.8 percent to HK$8.17 following reports that China had found gas deposits with "verified exploitable" reserves of about 240 billion cubic metres (bcm), or around four years of current production, near Sinopec's massive Puguang field. Sinopec and PetroChina Co Ltd will jointly develop the gas fields. PetroChina gained 0.6 percent to HK$10.08. Offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd leapt 1.5 percent to HK$7.37. Among banking stocks, Bank of Communications declined 0.6 percent to HK$8.3, while China Construction Bank edged down 0.6 percent to HK$4.68. Lenovo Group Ltd leapt 3.6 percent to HK$3.79 following its forecast-beating quarterly results last week, having earlier tapped 1-1/2-year highs. Tsingtao Brewery jumped 3.2 percent to HK$16.60 after Citigroup upgraded the stock to buy amid rising consumption in China's beer market and Tsingtao's brand pre-eminence. Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holdings raced up 3.8 percent to HK$9.24 after reporting its first-quarter profit rose 21 percent. (US$1=HK$7.8
