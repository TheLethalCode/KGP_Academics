 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar and Partex Group chairman MA Hashem were taken into four-day remand for questioning. Jalil stands accused of making inflammatory comments that threatened to unsettle the country, according to details in a case filed with Motijheel Police Station. Jalil's lawyer Mahbubey Alam told the court that the AL leader is seriously ill with cardiac and kidney ailments. Alam urged the court to reject the remand prayer. Any bid to take Jalil into remand adds to mental agony, said the lawyer, assisted by lawyers Abdul Mannan Khan, Sahara Khatun, Kamrul Islam, Nojibullah Hiru and Momtaz Uddin Mehdi. The lawyers said Jalil had been accused in the case of making inflammatory comments. In fact he called for elections, so did civil-society representatives, professionals and foreign diplomats, they said. "Why should he be blamed for making provocative comments?" one of the lawyers said. Babar who worked for the home ministry as state minister during the rule of the BNP-led coalition government faces charges of keeping an unlicensed weapon and sabotage to unsettle the government and the state. Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque appealed for seven-day remand, but the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka granted four days. According to a general diary filed with Gulshan Police Station, Babar plundered state resources by abusing power. Babar was arrested at his Gulshan home at 4:05pm Monday with ties to corruption. "He put obstacles in the path of collective development of the country," according to the GD. The police will question Hashem, former BNP lawmaker, for four days. In a case filed with Gulshan Police Station, he has been branded as land grabber and wealth plunderer. The joint forces arrested Hashem at his Gulshan office at 3:00pm Monday. In the courtroom, Jalil, Babar and Hashem were offered chairs to sit on. Their lawyers gave them biscuits and water. Earlier, former commerce minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and former state ministers Fazlur Rahman Patol and Rafiqul Islam were sent to Dhaka Central Jail for detention. Rafiqul Islam of the Awami League was produced before the court of metropolitan magistrate MA Salam. Altaf was taken to Dhaka CMM's court and Patol of the BNP was taken to the court of metropolitan magistrate Shafiq Anwar. Sylhet city mayor Badruddin Ahmed Kamran, arrested in a city hotel, was sent to jail, shortly before 3pm as the court rejected his bail prayer. Joint forces raided Gulshan Hotel and Restaurant in Sylhet and arrested the mayor, 20 days after he was freed on bail from Comilla jail. bdnew
