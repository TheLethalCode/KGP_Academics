He declined to say how much Al Fahim paid for the stake. Al Fahim plans to help the bus company expand into Asia with operations in cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore, Beynon said. Operations will start in Hong King this year. "It's a good investment, and fits well with our transport, travel and automotive interests," Beynon said. "We plan to expand into alternative markets." Al Fahim will use its stake to bid for a licence in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, to start a public bus service, Beynon said.
