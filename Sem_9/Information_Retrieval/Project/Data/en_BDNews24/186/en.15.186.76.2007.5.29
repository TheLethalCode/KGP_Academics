 LEEDS, England, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies coach David Moore described his team's record test defeat by England at Headingley as a "meek surrender" on Monday. Moore, in his first assignment as coach of a test nation after succeeding Australian compatriot Bennett King following the World Cup, was exasperated at the manner in which West Indies lost by an innings and 283 runs.

We can be so good one test and then very disappointing the next one." A decision is likely to be taken on whether captain Ramnaresh Sarwan will stay on the tour on Tuesday after consultation with medical staff. Sarwan injured a joint in his right shoulder after falling awkwardly trying to prevent a boundary on Friday. Moore is hopeful, though, that experienced batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul will be fit for the third test, starting on June 7, after missing Headingley with tendonitis in his kne
