<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will hear MiG-29 and frigate purchase graft cases against Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina on Aug 1 and Aug 7. The bench of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Ataur Rahman Khan fixed the dates after the government appealed to court Monday to put up the matter for fresh hearing. Deputy attorney general Golam Mohammad Chowdhury Alal Tuesday told the court that Hasina's appeal for quashing the cases have been pending for long. He urged the court to fix a date, as everything was ready for hearing. Hasina's lawyer barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud said the cases cannot be heard just before the summer vacation starting on June 8. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official of the now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the MiG-29 purchase scam case against the former premier and four others with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 11, 2001. Anticorruption bureau official Mir Md Joynul Abedin Shibli filed the frigate purchase scam case with Tejgaon Police Station against five persons including Hasina on Aug 7, 2002. According to the case details, the frigate purchase allegedly cost the government Tk 447 crore in losses. Zahid alleged that the government had to count Tk 700 crore in losses on the purchase of eight MiG-29s. In 2003, charges were pressed against Hasina and six others in the MiG-29 case and five people in the frigate case and chargesheets were submitted before the court in this connection. The same year, the High Court stayed the proceedings of the cases following Hasina's appeals. The same High Court bench had earlier fixed July 25 for a final hearing on the appeal to scrap the Meghna Ghat purchase scam case against Hasina. The then government of Sheikh Hasina procured eight MiG-29 fighter planes for the Bangladesh Air Force and a frigate for the Navy at a cost of nearly $229 million ($123.98 million for the MiGs and $105 million for the frigate). Apart from the corruption case at home, the MiG sellers sued Bangladesh for non-payment of instalments in the International Court of Arbitration. bdnew
