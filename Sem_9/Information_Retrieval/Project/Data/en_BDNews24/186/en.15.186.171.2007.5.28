 NEW DELHI, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Monday that power shortages were a key concern and power supply had to grow faster if the economy was to grow at annual rates of 9 to 10 percent. Noting an energy shortage of up to 13 percent in peak season, Singh told a power conference that the power sector "does not look very promising" and that India needed a "crash programme" to raise capacity if shortages were to be eliminated by 2012, "If we expect the economy to keep growing at 9-10 percent per annum, we need a commensurate growth in the power supply," he said. "We have not been able to make a decisive breakthrough in ensuring high and sustainable rates of growth of this sector and improving its financial health," Singh said. "The current level of losses in transmission and distribution, ranging between 30-45 percent in many states, threatens the financial health of the sector. A large proportion of these losses are due to theft. Theft is the cancer of the power sector," he said. India plans to add 78,577 megawatts of power generation capacity by 2012, mainly from coal-fired units, to tide it over an acute shortage. Under the National Electricity Policy, all of the billion-plus population is to have access to power by 2012 and per capita availability of power is to be raised by nearly 50 percent, a goal that requires 100,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity
