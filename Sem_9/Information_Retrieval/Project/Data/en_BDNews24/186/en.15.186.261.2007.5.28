 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Monday set July 1 for submission of a supplementary investigation report on the Paltan Shibir murder case filed against 46 people, including Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. Metropolitan magistrate Mir Ali Reza rescheduled the date as the investigation officer, sub-inspector of police Enamul Haque, failed to turn in the supplementary chargesheet. Two cases were filed by the Workers Party and Jamaat-e-Islami in connection with the deaths of seven activists in violent street clashes on Oct 28one of the bloodiest days of 2006, just before Khaleda Zia transferred power as prime minister. The police submitted a chargesheet against Hasina and others to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka on April 22. The court issued arrest warrants the same day against Hasina, Mohammad Nasim and MA Malek Kiran in the case filed by Jamaat. The investigation officer pleaded to court on April 23 that the investigation into the case was flawed. The court suspended the arrest warrants. bdnew
