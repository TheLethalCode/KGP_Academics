 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com) -Former Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan ended his two decades of cricketing career with playing the KAI-Altech Premier Cricket League's final round match between Old DOHS and Sonargaon Cricketers at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium Sunday. Old DOHS, led by Khan, won the match by five wickets against Sonargaon Cricketers, who finished third in the league despite the defeat. DOHS were bottom in the six-team super league point. Mohammedan Sporting Club inflicted a 25-run defeat to Abahani, who have already clinched the title in the penultimate round, to be runners-up in the 12-team league at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium (NOS). Biman defeated Victoria Sporting Club by nine wickets to finish fourth at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground. At the DCS, the batsmen presented a guard of honour to Akram raising the bats when the DOHS captain returned to the dressing room with his gloves, pads and boots taken off forever. "I have no sorrow for the retirement. It has given me a lot," said Akram, who started his career in the Railway in 1983-84 and later played for the domestic cricket giants Brothers Union, popular Abahani Limited and Old DOHS. The 38-year-old cricketer guided Bangladesh to be champions in the ICC trophy to qualify for the World Cup in 1997 and was a member of the historic win against Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup. Akram, who scored 259 runs in eight Tests and 976 runs in 44 ODIs, played his last ODI and Test against South Africa in 2003 at home. The cricketer will now start a new career as a selector of the Bangladesh national cricket team. He is to join the Faruque Ahmed-led selection committee in the first week of June. "After having played both versions of the game, it is not a big deal to work with the selection committee. I am looking forward to taking new challenges because there is a lot of scope to work in this field," Akram said. Two fifties from openers Tamim Iqbal (60) and Shamsur Rahman (66) propelled DOHS to make 255 for five in 48.3 overs, chasing Sonargaon's 252 for nine in 50 overs. At the NOS, Mohammedan bundled Abahani out for 140 in 39.5 overs after making a paltry 165 all out in 39.5 overs. At the BKSP ground, Biman reached the revised target of 181 losing one wicket in 37.4 overs as Farhad Reza hammered 80 off 54 balls with six sixes and as many fours. Earlier, Victoria scored 296 all out in 49.4 overs. bd
