<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina came down hard on the army-backed government Monday, hours after joint forces arrested her party general secretary Abdul Jalil. "The drive by the government is not against corruption, it seems it's a drive against politics," Hasina said in her reactions to the arrest of Jalil, a key player in her ranks. Hasina came up with her statement to reporters at her Sudha Sadan home at 8.30pm. The former prime minister also condemned the arrests of other leaders and workers of her party and demanded their release. In a fresh crackdown, the joint forces picked up Jalil from his Mercantile Bank office in Dilkhusha, where he was with the board of directors at a meeting. The arrest, the latest in a long line of political arrestees, has apparently angered Hasina. "It came as a surprise. He was arrested, just a day after the Awami League promised to stand by the government in reform efforts." "He (Jalil) is ill." Hasina posed the government a question, "How long do people have to endure? The activities of the government are crossing the limits of tolerance by the day." "People want elections, democracy. They don't want a suffocating situation anymore." "People want to know how much the government has done for reform in four and a half months. "Maybe I will be arrested tomorrow for saying this. Even they can beat me. If anybody works with a preconceived idea that cannot be just." Hasina questioned the caretaker government's crackdown on graft and said: "The small fries who made fabulous money through corruption are not being arrested. It seems those who earn huge money in an evil way can manage everything." "This government is the fruit of our street movement. Now the sword has come down on us. Just think where the country is moving. "Only 50 out of more than 300 election officials passed the retake exams to prove professional excellence. But now we hear there is a moral side to the whole thing." "It means people can bribe their way in. If they lose jobs, you have to listen to moral sermons. What is the anticorruption drive meant to be? Hasina doubted a credible election under the government. His only fault is, Hasina said, he wrote letters to several embassies in Dhaka, wanting to know how political parties are given financial assistance from government funds. Monday's swoop came in the wake of increasing demands by the Awami League and BNP for the lifting of emergency rule. bdnews
