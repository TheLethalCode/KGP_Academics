 TOKYO, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's public support rate has fallen sharply to its lowest level since the Japanese leader took office last September, hovering between 30 and 40 percent, two newspaper surveys showed on Monday. Here are key facts about the conservative leader. Born on Sept 21, 1954, Abe studied political science in Japan and worked for three years with Kobe Steel before launching into politics with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) party in the early 1980s.

Revising the U.S.-drafted post-war pacifist constitution and boosting Japan's security profile are key planks of his agenda, while his hard line on North Korea's abductions of Japanese citizens has played well domestically. Abe's father, Shintaro Abe, was a foreign minister. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was a wartime cabinet minister who was imprisoned but never tried as a war criminal after World War Two. He served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960 and had a strong influence on the young Abe. His wife, Akie, became a media darling after her husband took office, with tabloids full of tidbits about her clothing and love of South Korean TV. Her popularity has helped shore up her husband's falling domestic support and soften his image overseas. Coming to power after the popular, Elvis-loving, Junichiro Koizumi, Abe's reserved manner and more hawkish persona have made him less of a hit with the public. Known for his soft-spoken ways, he is fond of archery, which he has demonstrated on a TV entertainment show
