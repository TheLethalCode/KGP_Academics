<TITLE> Glaxo's Avandia prescriptions slump after study </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Doctors in the United States have shunned GlaxoSmithKline Plc's diabetes drug Avandia since a study was published last week linking the drug to heart-attack risk, according to early prescription data. Information from market intelligence group Impact RX indicates Avandia's share of the market for newly prescribed oral anti-diabetics (OAD) fell to approximately zero from around 10 percent in the two days after the article appeared on May 21. "This reaction is far worse than we had anticipated and suggests that there could be as much as 22 percent downside risk to GSK's near term earnings, suggesting that there is still further downside to GSK's share price," Deutsche Bank analysts, citing the prescription data, said in a note. Shares in Europe's biggest drugmaker, which fell around 9 percent last week on the critical broadside from top US cardiologist Steven Nissen in the New England Journal of Medicine, lost a further 2 percent in early trade on Monday. The stock was trading at a six-month low of 13.06 pounds by 0810 GMT, making it the second-largest FTSE 100 loser in an overall stronger London market. Nissen's pooled, or meta, analysis of 42 clinical trials concluded Avandia increased the risk of heart attack by 43 percent and cardiac-related death by 64 percent, dealing a major blow to Glaxo's second biggest-selling drug. Glaxo said it strongly disagreed with the study findings, which contradicted other findings from large-scale outcome studies, and Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said there had been an "over-reaction to one statistical analysis". Deutsche said new and switch prescription data from 1,900 US primary care physicians showed Avandia's rolling average share of the newly written OAD prescription market on May 21, 22 and 23 was 10, 8 and 6 percent respectively, suggesting its share dropped to almost zero on May 22 and 23. At the same time, the rate of patients switching from one drug to another was three times the usual level, with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's rival drug Actos share of the new prescription market increasing from 10 to 22 percent
