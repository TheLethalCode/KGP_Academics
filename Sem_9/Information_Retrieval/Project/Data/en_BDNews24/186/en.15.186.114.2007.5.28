Four militants have been killed and two policemen have been injured. One is in critical condition," said Mazhar-ul-Haq Kakakheil, a senior police official in Bannu.

Also on Monday, a paramilitary soldier was killed and one wounded when militants attacked their vehicle car near the NWFP town of Tank, 80 km southwest of Bannu, a member of the paramilitary force said
