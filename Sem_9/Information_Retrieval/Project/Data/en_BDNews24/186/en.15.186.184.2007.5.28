 LEEDS, England, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were on course to inflict upon West Indies their biggest innings defeat in a test match at tea on day four of the second test at Headingley on Monday. West Indies, following on after their first innings 146, were 137 for six at the interval, to trail England's 570 for seven declared by 287 runs. Dwayne Bravo was 50 not out -- his team's highest score of the match -- and Denesh Ramdin had three after being dropped by Liam Plunkett at gully off Steve Harmison when on one. Bravo reached his 50 next ball from 61 deliveries. England effectively require another three wickets to take a lead in the four-match series as captain Ramnaresh Sarwan is unlikely to bat because of a shoulder injury that may force him off the tour. Currently, West Indies' heaviest loss is by an innings and 237 runs against England at The Oval 50 years ago. Left-arm seam bowler Ryan Sidebottom claimed two of the four wickets to fall in the day that has brought only 29 overs because of two lengthy rain delays. Sidebottom now has eight wickets in the match, which is only his second test appearance and first since 2001 when he failed to claim a single victim. Swinging the ball in helpful conditions on a cold and gloomy day, he trapped Sylvester Joseph lbw for one and then Devon Smith (16) edged to Andrew Strauss at first slip. Plunkett had Chris Gayle caught behind in the third over of the day, for 13. Rain has caused two stoppages in the day, after the whole of Sunday's play was washed out. Harmison picked up his first wicket of the innings when Runako Morton top-edged a pull shot to wicketkeeper Matt Prio
