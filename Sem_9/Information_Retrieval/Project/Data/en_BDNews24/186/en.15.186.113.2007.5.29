 MILAN, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian yellow pages publisher Seat Pagine Gialle denied on Tuesday a media report that the company was selling Britain's Thomson Directories. British newspaper the Daily Telegraph said last week Thomson Directories, Britain's second-biggest publisher of classified directories, may be put up for sale as part of a prospective restructuring of Seat. Citing sources close to Thomson, the newspaper said it would be sold for about 300 million pounds ($594.9 million). A Seat spokesman said: "There has been no contact with potential acquirers and there has been no mandate to sell Thomson (Directories)." Investors in Seat last week said they had hired Lehman Brothers to explore strategic options. Chief Executive Luca Majocchi told Reuters in an interview this month that the European directories sector would consolidate within five years and that any large European operator would make a good fit for Seat. As well as publishing directories in Italy and Britain, Seat has invested heavily in directory assistance numbers in Italy, France, Germany and Spain that the public can call, for a fee, to find phone numbers or business listings. At 0727 GMT, Seat shares were flat at 0.46 euros
