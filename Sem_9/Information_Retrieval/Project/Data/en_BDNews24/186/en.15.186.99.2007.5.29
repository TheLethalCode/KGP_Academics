 NEW DELHI, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian families, which believe their members were taken prisoners by Pakistan during a war in 1971, said on Monday they would make a trip across the border this week to search for the missing men. India says 54 soldiers and officers are missing from that war. Pakistan denies it is holding any of them. The trip follows an invitation earlier this year from Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who asked the families to look for the men in his country's jails as part of steps to boost trust in a peace process between the old rivals. "The outcome of the visit would depend on the way it has been worked out," said Damayanti Vijay Tambay, whose husband Flight-Lieutenant Vijay Vasant Tambay went missing after he took off on a fighter aircraft at the height of the war. "Some say we would be taken to 10-12 jails. We want to meet every prisoner of Indian origin above the age of 50," Tambay told Reuters on Monday. Pakistani Foreign Office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam reaffirmed Islamabad's long-stated position that it does not have Indian POWs. "As a humanitarian gesture, the government of Pakistan has allowed these families to visit Pakistan. They will be undertaking a visit ... from June 1," Aslam said, adding that the families would check around 10 jails. "We want this to be transparent as there is nothing to hide," Aslam said. Tambay and other relatives of the missing men claim there is evidence including media reports, photographs and letters to prove the presence of the POWs in Pakistani prisons. A similar visit in the early 1980s by Tambay and others was not successful with no Indian POW spotted among a group of prisoners shown to them. Tambay says it is most likely the prisoners gave false names when they were captured or had turned mentally unstable and only a personal verification by them can end their long wait. The 1971 battle was fought both on the western and eastern border between the arch rivals
