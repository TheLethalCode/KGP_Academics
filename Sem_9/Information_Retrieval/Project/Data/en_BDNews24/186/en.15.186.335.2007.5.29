 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus Tuesday pressed for a quick decision on setting up a mega-seaport. "We have to take a quick decision on different issues including on establishing a mega sea port," Yunus told a reception accorded to him by Chittagong Samity, Dhaka at Osmany Memorial Auditorium. He said several alternatives are there if government cannot build such a port. "We must avail ourselves of the geographical advantage. We can no more sit over coal." The Grameen Bank chief said if the mega seaport was established, Chittagong and Noakhali would become an international industrial hub. "We must establish a mega seaport with all facilities in next 25 years," Yunus Yunus said the seaport must be set up at a proper location that can give facilities to other countries. "Nepal can use our port. Yunan province of China, Bhutan and eastern part of India can use this grand port." President of Chittagong Samity, Dhaka Abu Alam Chowdhury chaired the reception. Former deputy prime minister Jamaluddin Ahmed, acting chief justice Md Fazlul Karim, litterateur Mahbub-ul Alam spoke. bdnews
