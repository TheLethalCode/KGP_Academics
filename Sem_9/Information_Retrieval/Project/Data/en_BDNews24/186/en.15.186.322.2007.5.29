 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The Appellate Division again froze Chittagong Mayor's bail for another two days and ordered the government and Bangabandhu Medical University (BSMMU) hospital authorities to submit the medical history and treatment details of the detained Awami League leader. The five-member Appellate Division led by acting chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim Tuesday issued the order after hearing the case of Mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, now in the hospital as a detainee. Attorney general Fida M Kamal Tuesday said the High Court (HC) had issued the bail order without verifying the medical certificates of the mayor, who has been facing a string of corruption charges. But the mayor's lawyer, Dr. Kamal Hossain, argued all relevant papers were placed before the court. On Thursday, the chamber judge, Justice Hasan Amin, halted the HC order for bail till Sunday after the government appealed against it. A High Court bench comprising Justice Md Abdul Matin and Justice Md Abdul Hye had earlier granted Mohiuddin Chowdhury bail. The mayor's wife, Hasina Mohiuddin, appealed to court for the bail saying Mohiuddin was sick and needed better treatment. Mohiuddin, arrested March 7, was sent to Bandarban jail two days later. The day after his arrest, the mayor was sued under the Emergency Powers Rules. On April 1, another case was filed against him for his alleged role in destroying hills. In both cases, the HC bench granted bail to Mohiuddin in the two cases on May 17. On May 16, Mohiuddin was taken to BSMMU hospital, where he is now undergoing treatment under the supervision of a 10-member medical board. bdnews24.c
