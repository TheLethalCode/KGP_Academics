 SHANGHAI, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's benchmark stock index tumbled 6.08 percent on Wednesday morning after the government hiked the stock trading tax in its strongest effort yet to cool a speculative bull run. The Shanghai Composite Index swung wildly before ending the morning at 4,071.268 points. It had climbed 62 percent so far this year to Tuesday's record closing high. Falling stocks far outnumbered gainers by 814 to 33, while around 150 shares plunged their 10 percent daily limits. Turnover in Shanghai A shares ballooned to 178.8 billion yuan ($23.4 billion) as investors dumped shares, putting turnover on track to hit a record for the full day. The Ministry of Finance announced after midnight on Tuesday that it was raising the stamp tax to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent, the latest in a series of official steps -- including an interest rate hike this month -- to cool the market. Analysts said that, by targeting the speculators who have accounted for the bulk of turnover in recent weeks, the tax hike could hurt the market in the short term. But they did not expect the market to crash or reverse a long-term uptrend. Deutsche Bank's Greater China economist Jun Ma noted that the market had dropped 30 percent over four months after China raised the stamp tax from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent in 1997. But this time, the pull-back should be less drastic, he said. "Domestic liquidity is much stronger due to sustained structural reasons (e.g. balance of payments surplus and low interest rates), and the government is also concerned about the market overshooting on the downside before the Party Congress in the autumn," Ma said. Traders saw initial technical support for the index around 4,000 points, where it briefly stalled in early May. "The index will find a short-term floor at 3,900 to 4,000 points and resume rising after a correction of around three days," said Zhang Yanbing, analyst at Kinghing Securities. Some saw the possibility of a drop in coming weeks to the next technical support level around 3,600 points. But even that drop would only bring the index back to mid-April levels and leave it 35 percent up from the start of 2007 -- not enough of a fall to damage the economy or launch an extended equities bear market, analysts and fund managers said. "Even a 20 percent correction in the A shares should have very limited impact on the real economy," said Frank Gong, chief China economist at JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific). Shares of brokerages, and companies with big stakes in brokerages, were hardest hit on Wednesday out of concern that the tax would eventually shrink market turnover as speculators fled. CITIC Securities, the biggest listed brokerage, tumbled its 10 percent daily limit to 57.60 yuan. Other big losers were stocks that had gained particularly sharply on the back of speculative trading in the past week. Real estate giant Vanke fell 7.14 percent to 18.08 yuan. But strong buying in some companies that announced good news suggested many investors remained confident of the market's long-term outlook. Tianjin Port rose its 10 percent daily limit to 24.10 yuan after saying on Wednesday that it would buy key assets worth 4.1 billion yuan from its state parent by issuing up to 226 million new shares at 18.17 yuan each. The two new stocks listed in Shenzhen soared, exceeding many analysts' expectations. Zhejiang Southeast Space Frame jumped 158 percent from its IPO price to 24.80 yuan, while Anhui Annada Titanium Industry raced up 247 percent to 28.05 yuan. Foreign currency-denominated B shares, which speculators have targeted this month, were hit hard. The Shanghai B-share index slid 8.78 percent. ($1 = 7.65 yuan
