 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Shaun Williams, manager of the National Game Development, is likely to coach Bangladesh along with local coaches in the ensuing Sri Lanka tour in June-July. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has yet to find the successor to Dav Whatmore whose contract expired after the India tour of Bangladesh this month. The board is looking to appoint an interim coach from the Academy team or the game development unit. However, the board will take a final decision at its executive committee meeting on June 2. After the World Cup, coaches of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have quit, forcing their boards to frantically looking for their replacements. "I do not think we would be able to choose a coach before the Sri Lankan board appoints their coach," said BCB general secretary Mahbub Anam. "Now, we are looking forward to appointing a local coach for the national team for the Sri Lanka tour," added Anam. BCB vice president Shah Nurul Kabir Shaheen, also chief of performance evaluation committee, said if Williams gets the responsibility, then one or two local coaches, who are on the BCB payroll, would assist him during the tour. Williams has the experience of coaching the national Under-19 team and he will defiantly be ahead of others during the board meeting, said BCB high-officials seeking anonymity. BCB coaches Sarwar Imran, Wahidul Goni and Dipu Roy Chowdhury are in the country while Minhajul Abedin Nannu is touring Australia on a BCB assignment. During the six-weeks Sri Lanka tour, Bangladesh will play three ODIs and as many Tests. Bangladesh are scheduled to arrive the island nation on June 17. bdn
