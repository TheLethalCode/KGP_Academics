 MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirteen people were killed and 35 wounded in Afghanistan on Monday when police opened fire to break up a violent protest against a provincial governor, witnesses said. More than 1,000 people were protesting to demand the removal of Juma Khan Hamdard, governor of the northern province of Jowzjan, and were throwing stones at several government offices in Shiberghan, the provincial capital, witnesses said. Police fired to stop the protesters from raiding the offices, the witnesses said.

Facing a resurgent Taliban, President Hamid Karzai condemned the violence during the protest and ordered an immediate investigation. Putting the death toll at six, the palace quoted Karzai as saying that peaceful protest was the right of every Afghan, but added that it should not involve violence. The palace said some public and governmental utilities were damaged during the protests. Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek and a former communist, has been involved in a series of coups and regime changes in nearly three decades of Afghanistan's conflict. He considered northern areas as his fiefdom, but his powers have been reduced to a large extent in recent years, though he still is officially a military aide to Karzai.
