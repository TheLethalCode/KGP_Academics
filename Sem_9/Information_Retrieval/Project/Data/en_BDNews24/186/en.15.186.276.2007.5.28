 Joint forces arrest Jalil, Babar and Hashem Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  Joint forces Monday picked up Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil from his Mercantile Bank office in Motijheel. Later in the day, the joint forces raided Jalil's Gulshan home for two hours to 9pm, his relative Shahjad Rajib told bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib on the scene. Gulshan police sub-inspector Helal told bdnews24.com that the joint forces had seized up to five passports, bank cheques and land documents. In an early development, Jalil's private assistant Akram Hossain told bdnews24.com that his boss was led away by the joint forces. The Mercantile Bank security chief, Ali Akbar, said: "Two army officers arrived at 3:45pm and asked him (Jalil) to go with them." Jalil who was at a meeting with bank directors at the time left the office with the army officers a little later, Akbar said. Jalil's arrest is the latest in a long line of high-profile arrestees in an anticorruption drive by the army-backed caretaker government. In a post-arrest press briefing, Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina asked the government to free her deputy. "He (Jalil) is ill. It's surprising that his arrest came just a day after he said the Awami League would stand by the government in reform efforts," she said. Former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar has also been arrested at his Gulshan home at 4:05pm. His APS Shafiur Shamsu confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. In another development, the joint forces arrested Partex Group chairman and former BNP lawmaker MA Hashem at his Gulshan office at 3:00pm. His son, Aziz Al Kaiser Tito, confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. bdn
