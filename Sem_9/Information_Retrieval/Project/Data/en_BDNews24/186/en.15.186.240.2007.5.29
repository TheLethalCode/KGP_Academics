 TOKYO, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei rose 0.48 percent on Tuesday as Sanyo Electric Co Ltd surged after posting strong earnings while small-cap shares gained on strong consumer spending data, encouraging retail investors to pick stocks such as Softbank Corp. NEC Electronics jumped 5.6 percent to 2,915 yen after the Nikkei business daily reported that two US funds want to increase their stake in the company by buying part of NEC Corp.'s holding. Small-cap companies, many of which depend on domestic demand and have little overseas exposure, advanced following strong economic data. Japan's jobless rate fell to a nine-year low in April, while overall household spending rose 1.1 percent from a year earlier, indicating a steady economic recovery. "We finally started to see strong corporate capital spending leading to strong consumer spending," said Yosuke Shimizu, head of the investment information centre at Monex Inc. The Nikkei added 84.97 points to 17,672.56 and the broad TOPIX index was up 0.78 percent at 1,737.90. The Mothers index of start-ups rose 1.75 percent to 873.26 after hitting a record low this month. "Earnings are mostly over for small-cap companies and investors have started to figure out which ones are worth investing in," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities Nozomi Securities. "The market seems to be bottoming out." Murai added the key would be whether the Mothers index could rise above the 25-day moving average, which stands around 890. But Takashi Kamiya, chief economist at T&D Asset Management, remained sceptical. "Unlike large corporations whose balance sheets are solid, small companies tend to have many intangible assets and they are hard to measure," he said. "I'm not certain that small-cap stocks have overcome the correction phase." Trade was moderate, with 1.78 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section. Advancers beat decliners by a ratio of more than two to one. Sanyo Electric leapt 10.4 percent to 213 yen as it swung to an annual operating profit following cost cuts that more than offset slow digital camera sales. In the same sector, Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd ended up 0.7 percent at 8,470 yen. Tsuneo Murata, Murata's soon-to-be president, told Reuters that sales at the electronics parts maker are healthy, helped by PCs and mobile phones. On the Mothers market, designer handbag maker Samantha Thavasa Japan Ltd jumped 10.9 percent to 235,000 yen after the company said it would pay a dividend of 1,600 yen for the year to February 2008. That would be its first dividend since listing in 2005. Gains in the Mothers market and other small-cap markets indicated a healthy appetite among retail investors. Softbank, also a favourite of Japanese retail investors, added 2.1 percent to 2,690 yen. Some analysts blame fewer participants in the market and growing interest in emerging markets for the Tokyo market's struggle to advance. But Nikko Citigroup strategist Tsutomu Fujita said in a report on Monday that government financial institutions in Japan, such as Japan Post, the Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of Japan, are set to sell off a substantial amount of Japanese stock, which could limit the upside for the Tokyo market. "These currently hold a combined 10 to 15 trillion yen in Japanese equities and we think they could sell off half of this over the next several years," Fujita said. "While we do not foresee this triggering a major fall-off in share prices, we do think it could limit the upside.
