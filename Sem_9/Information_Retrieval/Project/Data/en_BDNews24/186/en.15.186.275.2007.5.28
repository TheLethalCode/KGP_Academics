 LONDON, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares ticked higher in early trade on Monday, taking their cue from a strong close in US markets and a rise in Asian stocks, but activity will be thin as many major European markets are closed for public holidays. France Telecom added 0.6 percent after the country's leading telecoms operator kicked off a formal review of bids for part or all of its Orange unit in the Netherlands. By 0710 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was 0.1 percent stronger at 1,599.2, after hitting its highest level in 6-1/2 years at 1,611.2 on Thursday. France's CAC 40 index rose 0.1 percent. Markets in Britain, Germany, Switzerland and the United States are closed, but French, Spanish, Italian and Swedish markets are open. Nordic markets owner OMX added 3.3 percent after the Sunday Times reported Dubai International Financial Centre, the owner of the Dubai stock exchange, is mulling a rival bid to Nasdaq's agreed $3.7 billion takeover of OMX. On Monday, Asian stocks rose as a rally in metal prices boosted miners, while London Brent crude dipped 0.5 percent to $70.4 a barrel
