 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Tuesday accused the caretaker government of attempting to hoodwink the nation. Hasina spoke to reporters at Mujibunnessa Eye Hospital in Dhanmondi where she had an appointment with her ophthalmologist. "It's also necessary for the caretaker government to understand that we are passing days in an emergency regime. The government should stop playing games." On AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim's arrest, she said it would be too heavy a shock to her aunt (Selim's mother) who is in hospital with illness. Hasina said: "I don't understand why joint forces are raiding the homes of Awami League leaders and workers." She said the corrupt people were at large for reasons unknown. Hasina demanded that the corrupt people be punished now. She asked the government to update the voter list without losing time to fast-track the process of elections and stop "playing with people's destiny". bdnews24.c
