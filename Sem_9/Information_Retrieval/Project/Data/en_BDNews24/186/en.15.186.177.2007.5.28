<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Elder statesman Shimon Peres won the backing of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday for his bid to become Israel's next president. "I spoke to Vice Premier Shimon Peres and told him I would support his candidacy for president," Olmert said at a meeting of Kadima party legislators, urging them to endorse the 83-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Parliament will elect the country's president on June 13 and political commentators are predicting an open race, with Peres vying for the office along with candidates from Israel's left and right wings. If he becomes president, Peres, a Kadima leader, would effectively take himself out of the running to replace Olmert should the prime minister resign in response to an inquiry's scathing criticism of his conduct of last year's Lebanon war. Olmert, whose popularity rating is in single digits, has vowed to stay on and correct failings cited in the Winograd Commission's interim report. The panel is to present a final report in August that could determine his political fate. Peres, a former prime minister and architect of interim peace deals with the Palestinians in the 1990s, has spoken publicly of his desire to run for president. He is widely expected to announce his candidacy on Wednesday. As a member of the centre-left Labour Party, Peres lost a 2000 bid for the presidency to the right-wing Likud's candidate, Moshe Katsav. Israeli authorities have announced their intention to indict Katsav on suspicion he raped a former staff member and sexually assaulted three other women who worked for him. Katsav, who has denied any wrongdoing and is on a leave of absence, cannot be charged under Israeli law until his term ends with the election. Peres had been the favourite to win the presidency seven years ago but some of the legislators he counted as supporters turned against him in a secret ballot that commentators described as a settling of old grudges. "There is perhaps no one today who the entire world associates with the vision of the state of Israel, its aspirations for peace and the wonderful progress it has made in technology and science," Olmert said at the party meeting. "I have no doubt that if he is elected president, (Peres) will restore the post to the stature and respect it deserve
