 SHANGHAI, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese stocks surged in heavy trade on Monday, hitting an all-time high, as individual investors continued to pour fresh money into the market despite increasing caution among some institutions. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed to a record intra-day high of 4,269.030 points before ending the morning up 2.11 percent at 4,267.963. Gainers overwhelmed losers by 767 to 102. Turnover in Shanghai A shares was very heavy at 137.5 billion yuan ($18.0 billion), up from Friday morning's 107.0 billion yuan. Traders said there was no fresh, major positive news behind the rally, but individual investors were encouraged by the market's strength last week in the face of an interest rate hike and former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's warning that stocks were dangerously overvalued. Many investors have dismissed Greenspan's view as misguided. While some institutions appear to be committing less new money to the market, and buying by foreign investors has slowed considerably, analysts believe massive retail interest in stocks may keep prices rising for a while. "I think the basic trend of the stock market is still upwards," said Zhou Lin, analyst at Huatai Securities. The huge amounts of fresh money entering the market cannot be reversed in a short time, he added. Continued appreciation of the yuan against the dollar -- it edged up above 7.65 on Monday for the first time since its revaluation -- helped sentiment. Some traders are talking about the index hitting 4,500 points in coming weeks, although authorities have already shown signs of wanting to cool the market and such a rise could prompt further official action, such as stronger efforts to clamp down on illicit fund flows into stocks. Refining heavyweight Sinopec led the index up, jumping 4.60 percent to 12.97 yuan after the official Xinhua news agency reported at the weekend that China had found big gas reserves near Sinopec's Puguang field in Sichuan province. The coal sector was also strong, with Datong Coal Industry Co up 2.69 percent to 24.45 yuan and Hengyuan Coal Industry Co up 6.08 percent to 27.03 yuan. Traders said the coal sector appeared to be one of the few areas where foreign investors were still buying actively. Insurance shares rose sharply after the official China Securities News reported on Saturday that the government was removing remaining regulatory obstacles to their investment in real estate. Ping An Insurance climbed 3.83 percent to 64.29 yuan. Copper shares surged, with Tongdu Copper up 6.73 percent to 17.61 yuan, after Shanghai copper futures rose their 4 percent daily limit early on Monday in response to copper price gains in London on Friday. Foreign currency-denominated B shares continued Friday's rebound from heavy profit-taking earlier last week. The Shanghai B-share index was up 5.36 percent. ($1 = 7.64 yuan
