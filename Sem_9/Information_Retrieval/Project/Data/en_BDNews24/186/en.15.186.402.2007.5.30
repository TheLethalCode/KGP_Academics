 SINGAPORE, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of people infected with dengue in a single week in Singapore has risen to the year's highest level, stoking fears of an epidemic, a newspaper said on Wednesday.

Epidemic levels are reached when more than 378 cases are reported in a week, the paper said, adding health officials were worried that an epidemic may be on its way in the city-state. A dengue epidemic hit Singapore in 2005, when 714 cases were reported in a single week, the Straits Times said.
