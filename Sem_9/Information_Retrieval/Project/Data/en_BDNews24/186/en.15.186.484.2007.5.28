 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)- Health adviser ASM Motiur Rahman Sunday said market prices of medicines would undergo review. He had earlier said the prices of medicines, except for some imported ones, did not increase almost in a decade. In the face of opposition by reporters to his claim, the adviser backed down and said: "What I had said was based on the information provided by pharmaceutical companies." At a press briefing at the health ministry Sunday on the outcome of the 60th conference of the World Health Organisation and his talks with Commonwealth health ministers, the adviser said the prices of most medicines did not go up from 1994. The adviser said Bangladesh secured the second highest financial assistance after India from the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria. "We have sought assistance from the World Health Organisation to set up a biomedical training institute to repair medical equipment and build a central laboratory for drug testing. "Besides, nursing courses will start in five nursing institutes. Training nurses in the private sector has also been approved. The World Bank has assured us of financial support," he said. bdnews24.
