The Australian coach, whose contract was to expire after the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2008, severed ties with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to leave Dhaka on May 21, said BCB chief executive Mahmudur Rahman. "Allister was saying that he would not be able to continue his job citing his personal problems and we had also agreed to release him understanding his problem," said Rahman.
