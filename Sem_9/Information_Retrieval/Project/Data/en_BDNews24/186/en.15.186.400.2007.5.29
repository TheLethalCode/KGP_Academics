 MUMBAI, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court sentenced one man to life in jail and handed six people, including four customs officials, terms of between five and nine years on Tuesday for their role in the country's worst bombings in 1993. The seven, among 100 people convicted in what was one of the world's longest trials, were punished for transporting and concealing weapons and explosives used in the attacks in Mumbai in which 257 people were killed. The four officers were jailed for taking bribes and helping in ferrying the arms. Judge Pramod Kode sentenced one man to life because he helped transport the cargo even though he knew it contained explosives. Tuesday's sentences took the total number of people punished with varying jail terms for abetting the bombings to 43, including five policemen. Police say the attacks were ordered by India's most wanted man, Dawood Ibrahim, a Muslim, to avenge the razing of a 16th-century mosque by Hindu zealots in 1992
