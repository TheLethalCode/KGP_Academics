 Steve Holland WASHINGTON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- President George W Bush imposed new US sanctions on Sudan Tuesday and sought support for an international arms embargo out of frustration at Sudan's refusal to end what he called a genocide in Darfur. "The people of Darfur are crying out for help, and they deserve it," Bush said. Accusing the Sudanese government of obstructing UN efforts to bring peace to Darfur, Bush said the US Treasury Department will bar 31 companies controlled by Sudan from doing business in the US financial system. The companies targeted included firms in Sudan's booming oil business and one that has been transporting weapons to the Sudanese government and militia forces in Darfur. Bush also imposed economic sanctions on four Sudanese individuals, including two senior Sudanese officials and a rebel leader suspected of involvement in the Darfur violence. Khartoum criticized the sanctions before they were even formally announced. "I think these sanctions are not justified. It is not timely. We are cooperating well with the United Nations," Mutrif Siddig, Sudanese undersecretary for foreign affairs, told Reuters in Khartoum. The ratcheting up of U.S. pressure coincides with a broader effort by U.N. officials to get Sudan to end the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 200,000 people and driven 2 million from their homes since 2003. Khartoum says 9,000 have died and rejects accusations of genocide. "My administration has called these actions by their rightful name: genocide. The world has a responsibility to help put an end to it," Bush said. He also directed U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to consult with Britain and other allies on pursuing new U.N. Security Council sanctions against Sudan that would impose an expanded arms embargo on Sudan's government. "It will prohibit the Sudanese government from conducting any offensive military flights over Darfur. It will strengthen our ability to monitor and report any violations," Bush said. CHINA'S SKEPTICISM China, a major consumer of Sudan's oil, was skeptical. In Beijing, China's representative on African affairs, Liu Guijin, said: "Expanding sanctions can only make the problem more difficult to resolve." Asked whether U.N. Security Council member China would veto any new U.N. resolution targeting Sudan, he said: "It's still too early to speak of." But the European Union expressed a willingness to discuss tougher sanctions. "We are open to consider that," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said at an EU meeting in Hamburg. Andrew Natsios, the U.S. special envoy for Darfur, told reporters China may be more sympathetic to the U.S. position than its public statements suggest. "We have many indications that the Chinese position is evolving. They have been much more helpful than may be apparent publicly," Natsios said. Bush has expressed frustration at the international community's inability to force Sudan to stop attacks by Arab militias widely believed to be supported by the government. He had wanted to announce the new sanctions six weeks ago but was convinced to let U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon have more time to conduct diplomacy. Bush urged Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, to let international peacekeepers into Darfur. Bashir has stalled for months in accepting U.N. packages to support an African Union peacekeeping force of 7,000 that are seen as a prelude to a larger hybrid force of more than 23,000 troops and police. Matthew Levitt, a Washington Institute for Near East Policy analyst and former Treasury official, said the sanctions would have a ripple effect because big foreign financial institutions would think twice before dealing with the companies listed. "An action like this carries tremendous weight. It not only shuts these particular listees out from the U.S. financial system but it will have a significant impact on their ability to do business in general," Levitt said.
