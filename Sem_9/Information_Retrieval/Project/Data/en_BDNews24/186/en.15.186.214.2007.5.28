 MADRID, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With two games left, the title race was cut down to a three-horse race on the weekend between leaders Real Madrid, defending champions Barcelona and treble-chasing Sevilla. Real kept their noses out in front by beating Deportivo Coruna 3-1 on Saturday and are in pole position to collect their first major title in four years.

Sevilla's guarantee of at least a Champions League qualifying place means fellow Cup finalists Getafe are assured of their first UEFA Cup place even if they lose. Zaragoza (58), Atletico Madrid (57) and Villarreal (56) are fighting it out for the two UEFA Cup slots available through the leagu
