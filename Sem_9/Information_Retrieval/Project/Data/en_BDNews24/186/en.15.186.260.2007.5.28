<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission is set to send notices to 22 graft suspects, asking them to submit wealth statements by the one-week deadline, ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Monday. The ACC chairman told reporters the decision was taken after a meeting held Sunday. Without naming anybody, Mashhud said, "The ACC considers the assets of the listed persons to be ill-acquired. If they are found guilty of such charges, the ACC will file cases against them." The notices for those who have already been arrested will be sent to jail. The ACC chairman said: "Those who will be asked to submit wealth statements won't have to be present in person. Their representatives can submit the statements on their behalf in a week." An ACC source said drawing up the list of the 22 persons has been based on primary investigation carried out by the ACC. The listed people will be allowed a week's time to submit their wealth statements. The ACC in its first go had asked of 50 people in February to submit their wealth statements. The commission has so far filed 21 cases against the defaulters who submitted false statements suppressing facts regarding their ill-earned properties. bdn
