 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  The mid-term transfer window for the B. League closes Wednesday with clubs expected to call the shots on the final day. The two-week transfer window opened on May 16, a day after the completion of the first-leg matches of the first-ever B. League. No club has yet registered new players or brought any player on loan. The second leg of the B. League begins Thursday when Muktijoddha Sangsad takes on Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Spotlight will be on title contenders Abahani Limited on the final day as the Dhanmondi outfit have are looking for replacements for their Argentine footballers. They have released the South Americans who had had a poor run in the first-leg after they had come to Dhaka with Argentinian coach Andres Cruciani. "We will turn up on the final day to replace the Argentine players as a few players from Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana are due Tuesday night," said Abahani manager Satyajit Das Rupu. "Striker Solaiman Chowhat of Nigeria is already practising with the players, but we will take a final decision Wednesday," said the former Abahani midfielder. Abahani are second with Sheikh Russel KC with 19 points after the first-leg. Sheikh Russel are set to release their Moroccan striker Khobasi Mohammad and local striker Amin Rana, who is suffering from jaundice. They are going to rope in Moroccan midfielders Jaim Nuruddin and Hida Sadan along with local striker Sentu. "Brothers Union midfielder Manwar Hossain has wished to play for Sheikh Russel and we are also interested in him. We are looking forward to get him if he can get his club's clearance," said Sheikh Russel president Nurul Islam Chowdhury. League leaders Mohammedan Sporting Club, with 20 points, have already released Nigerian striker Niche Francis and Rony Islam for bottom-placed Rahmatganj. "We will register two new players who have already contracted us in the place of Francis and retired Imtiaz Ahmed Nakib," said Mohammad coach Shafiqul Islam Manik. "We want to get Nigerian striker Kamara of Chittagong Mohammedan and goalkeeper Nizamuddin of Brothers Union. But we cannot get them as the club officials lack knowledge of the mid-term transfer," said Muktijoddha coach Abu Yousuf. "Kamara, whose contract expired after the first-leg matches, is now a free player. But he cannot play for Muktijoddha as his club would not pay his dues for two months if he does not play the second-leg matches for Mohammedan," Yousuf said. "The officials of Brothers have held up the issue of goalkeeper Nizamuddin," he said. "They may loan Chittagong Abahani midfielder Johnny." Brothers Union manager Amer khan said they are not going to recruit foreigners or bring in anyone on loan. But he said they might complete registrations of Montu and Rubel who had signed for the club before start of the B. League. bd
