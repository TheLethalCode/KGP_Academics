<TITLE> JRC for dam in Nepal to boost Ganges flows </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) - The Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) Monday emphasised the construction of a dam in Nepal to augment Ganges water flows during the dry season. It said that by constructing a dam in Nepal, 1.75 lakh cusecs of water, which would meet the water demand of Bangladesh and India during the dry season, could be added to the flow. The idea was mooted at the 36th meeting of the technical committee of the JRC, attended by Indian and Bangladesh delegations, in Dhanmondi. "India has exhausted her possibilities to construct a dam in the country. Again, no dam can be built in Bangladesh as the latter is a flood plain," Mir Sajjad Hossain, member of the JRC, told reporters after the meeting with a five-member Indian delegation led by SP Kakran. Mir Sajjad Hossain led the three-member Bangladesh delegation. "We have to bring Nepal into the system (flow augmentation) to augment the flow of the Ganges for mutual benefits," Kakran, commissioner (Ganges) of the Indian Water Resources Ministry, told newsmen. The Bangladesh delegates stressed that the country needs more water than the volume of 41,000 cusecs guaranteed under the treaty signed in 1996. The Indian delegate, on the other hand, said that India would have to have 40,000 cusecs of water at the Farakka point for diversion. Sajjad also said, "If the dam is constructed, we can augment the Ganges flow by 1.75 lakh cusecs during the dry season." "To construct a dam in Nepal, there must be a regional approach to bring Nepal into the system," both Sajjad and Kakran told the joint press briefing. "We cannot assure that Bangladesh will get 60,000 cusecs of water at the Hardinge Bridge point since flows depend on climatic conditions", Kakran told bdnews24.com. He said that as per the Ganges water sharing treaty of 1996, water flow at the Hardinge Bridge point should be 41,000 cusecs. But the flow at the same point on May 27 was 60,560 cusecs, he added. Mir Sajjad said, "Every year about 500 billion cubic metres of water is wasted during the monsoons." bdnews
