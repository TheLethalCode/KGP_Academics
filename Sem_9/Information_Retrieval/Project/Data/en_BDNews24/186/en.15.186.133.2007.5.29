<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP has spelled out no formal programme to mark the 26th death anniversary of party founder president Ziaur Rahman on May 30 because of a ban on politics by the emergency government. Chairperson Khaleda Zia along with some leaders and workers will lay wreath at his grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. No more than 150 leaders and workers are scheduled to join Khaleda in a milad mahfil at the grave premises. The BNP is observing the programme with the permission of the government's advisory committee on the law and order. The party that has been in power for two terms had sought permission to observe a two-day programme at the central level including discussion, laying of wreaths at the grave and destitute-feeding. The government only cleared it to place floral wreaths without procession and rally due to emergency rules. BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan in a statement has urged the party to observe the anniversary with due honour in consultation with local administration. President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in a military coup at Chittagong Circuit House on May 30 1981. bdnew
