 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of mortgages approved for home purchase in Britain rose by 1 percent in April from a year earlier, a survey showed, ending a four month run of declines and suggesting that housing demand is stabilising. The British Bankers' Association said on Tuesday mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- rose to 64,815 last month from 64,183 in April last year. The BBA left its earlier estimate for the rise in underlying net mortgage lending in April unrevised at 5.0 billion pounds, down from a 5.1 billion pounds increase in March and below the recent average of 5.4 billion. Mortgage approvals, a indicator of the future housing market, fell on an annual basis every month between December and March, BBA data shows, indicating the Bank of England's monetary tightening cycle may have been hurting sentiment. Following this month's interest rate rise to 5.5 percent -- the fourth hike since August -- and with expectations for yet higher rates this year, the BBA said it expected the housing market to cool further. "The picture from approvals points to mortgage demand weakening further as the year progresses and the cumulative effect of higher interest rates bites harder," said David Dooks, director of statistics at the BBA
