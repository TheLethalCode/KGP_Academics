<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Sunday said he would not ask the government anymore to lift the ban on indoor politics. "We've talked to the government on the matter. We don't want to say it again," the top polls official told reporters in his office. Huda said the issue did not surface Saturday when he along with three colleagues went to the Chief Adviser's Office to see him over a pilot project on a planned electoral roll. The EC has repeated its advice to the government for an end to the ban so that it can discuss planned reforms with political parties. But the ban is still in force, and there has been no concrete indication from the government about when it may go. On April 4, the CEC met law adviser Mainul Hosein and asked him for the withdrawal of the restriction on parlour politics. About the planned electoral roll, Huda Sunday said the budget of a digital roll with photographs would not exceed Tk 450 crore. About 12,000 units will work to make the roll though it had earlier planned to assign about 8,000 units. "The increased force will save time in making the list," he added. The CEC had earlier told reporters it would take 18 months to make a fresh roll with photographs. Detailing the plan, Huda said Sunday they would initially take six months to complete all preparations to make the draft of the roll. Later, the commission will take more time for correction. If enumerators fail to collect the photograph of any voter, the name of the particular voter would be listed but it is yet to be decided if he would be eligible to franchise, the CEC said. The commission will bring changes to the ordinance on the electoral roll after a pilot project that begins on June 10 at Sreepur in Gazipur is done. The CEC had a meeting with Gazipur deputy commissioner, superintendent of police, Sreepur municipal chairman and representatives from army and BDR in the afternoon. Election commissioners Sohul Hossain and Sakhawat Hossain, and EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir attended the meeting. bdnew
