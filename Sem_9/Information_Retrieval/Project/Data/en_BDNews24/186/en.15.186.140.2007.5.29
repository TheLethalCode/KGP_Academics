 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares ticked up early on Tuesday, as Vodafone pleased investors with its dividend and banking stocks moved into focus after a Royal Bank of Scotland -led group unveiled details of a bid for ABN AMRO. At 0809 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.07 percent at 1,600.49 points, with Germany's DAX outperforming its peers with a 0.2 percent rise and bluechips in France down 0.3 percent. Vodafone climbed 3.8 percent to top European gainers after it posted annual dividends and earnings per share towards the top end of expectations, though it warned it expected market conditions to remain challenging in Europe. Traders also cited vague market talk of a bid from AT&T. Vodafone declined to comment. A consortium led by RBS and including Spain's Santander and Belgium's Fortis unveiled a 71.1 billion euro bid for ABN that included its disputed US bank and a higher cash component than indicated. The bid trumps an agreed offer for ABN from Barclays. The news sent RBS down 2.1 percent to top losers in Britain, while ABN AMRO dipped 0.3 percent and Fortis slipped 0.9 percent. Santander gained 0.6 percent. Barclays, which some analysts see as a potential bid target if its bid for ABN fails, gained 0.8 percent. Traders said they believed the cash component in the RBS offer would give it the edge over Barclays' all-share offer, though a higher bid from Barclays was always a possibility. "It's not going to be over in the next week or two," a trader said. "You're talking month or months as opposed to weeks." Analysts said that European stocks, which have gained 7.9 percent so far this year, were likely to motor ahead. "The reporting season has supported an upward trend in the market, and the majority of companies have exceeded expectations," said Commerzbank strategist Ralf Groenemeyer. "We expect tax reforms in Germany to add 4 percent to net profit and will see some upgrades," he said. German luxury car maker BMW rose 1.8 percent after a Swedish newspaper said that Ford Motor Co was planning to sell Swedish carmaker Volvo and that BMW could be a possible buyer. BMW declined to comment. Truckmaker MAN AG rose 1.5 percent after it agreed to settle a fraud claim against Freightliner, part of DaimlerChrysler and said it would get nearly $500 million to resolve the case. British Airways gained 3.5 percent after Goldman Sachs suspended its rating on the company, traders said. The airline said on Friday that Goldman now owned more than 5 percent of its stock. And Portuguese bank Millennium bcp rose 2.9 percent after it suspended plans to increase its defences against a potential takeover bid at a general shareholder meeting late on Monday. Earlier, Asian stocks edged up as better-than-expected jobs and spending data underscored Japan's economic recovery. Groenemeyer said strong growth in Japan would support cyclical stocks, and along with the tax reforms, could help German shares continue to outperform their rivals in other European markets. Germany's DAX, which has outdone its French and British peers so far this year, is cyclical stock-heavy
