 SYDNEY, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thick, pungent smoke from smouldering eucalypts leaves engulfed the aboriginal elders and then drifted off through the scrub on Sydney Harbour's north head, like the spirits of the ancestors they had come to rebury. On a crisp autumn morning leaders of Sydney's aboriginal land council gathered on Wednesday on the headland, unchanged from the days the first white settlers sailed into the harbour in 1788, to lay to rest the skeletal remains of eight ancestors. Aborigines have campaigned for decades for the return of ancestral remains from museums in Australia and around the world and these were the last of 28 held by Sydney University. "The earth is our mother, we come from mother and when we die we go back to mother. The spirit never rests until it goes back into the earth," said Aborigine Allen Madden, cultural officer with Sydney's Metropolitan Lands Council. Colonial era scientists were fascinated by Australia's Aborigines, who have lived on the island continent for 70,000 years, and stole or seized skulls and skeletons from graves. The fascination with the world's oldest living culture saw museums in the 20th century continue to collect remains. The six female and two male Aborigines buried on Wednesday dated back to pre-colonial Australia and were unearthed on the harbour foreshore after a big tide in 1914. They were "saltwater" people from the Kuringai clan who lived on the harbour's foreshore, eating oysters and fishing. Their final journey home began, as the rest of Sydney struggled with morning peak-hour, with a handful of Aborigines ferrying the remains by boat across Sydney Harbour. Once on the headland the remains, individually wrapped in bark and tied with string, were placed on aboriginal flags laid on a bed of pine needles. To purify the area of bad spirits, eucalypts leaves were burnt giving off a thick smoke. "There is a lot about these people that is not known. We don't know their names. We don't know who they loved or who loved them," said Rob Welsh, chairman of the land council, as the traditional burial ceremony began. The only identification each bundle carried was a paper tag with a museum serial number. "All we know is that their people lived here for tens of thousands of years. This is their home. They ate oysters from the harbour and fished. They sat here and told their children stories of how the world was created, the Dreaming," said Welsh. "This was the world of the eight people we bury today. But their world would end with European settlement." Today, Australia's 460,000 Aborigines make up two percent of the 20 million population. They are consistently the nation's most disadvantaged group, with far higher rates of unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, and domestic violence. Handing back aboriginal remains helps heal white and black relations in Australia, said Jason Ardler, a government representative at the burial ceremony. Close to 100 remains have been returned to aboriginal people in Sydney. "These remains are from a time when science took precedent over human rights. Returning these remains gives us an opportunity to rebuild the trust," Ardler told the mourners. Following the speeches a group of young Aborigines carried their ancestors remains along a dirt track, winding through a thick, tangle of windswept trees, to emerge high on the headland. There is an eerie silence on the isolated headland as the remains are placed in small graves with views of the harbour and the distant city. Each is laid head first towards the ocean. "They are salties, saltwater people. They are buried facing the water. The first sun will hit them in the face and they will be warmed when it goes down," said Mullins, a robust man whose smoker's voice begins to weaken as he becomes emotional. Once all women mourners have left, the men as is tradition fill in the graves, some using their bare hands. Soon the site is an unremarkable patch of dirt, but buried in the small clearing are 28 Aborigines who have finally returned to "country"
