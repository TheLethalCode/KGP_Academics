 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Joint forces early Tuesday led away former commerce minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury from his Gulshan-2 home. Altaf, 64, was taken to an undisclosed destination from his house on Road No. 67, bdnews24.com Correspondents Ehsanul Haque Babu and Abu Noman Sajib reported from the scene. The bdnews24.com reporters saw the former Air Force chief in white panjabi when he was driven away. The joint forces entered the former minister's house at 1:15am and came out at 3:38am. At least five army vehicles were pressed into service for the raid. The area was made off-limits to reporters and TV crew when the raid was going on. Sub-inspector Moyeen, duty officer of Gulshan Police Station, told bdnews24.com that he was unaware of the arrest. Altaf joined BNP politics in 1995 after he retired from the Air Force as air vice-marshal. Altaf, who was elected from Patuakhali-1 constituency, also served the coalition government as home minister and ran into controversy. Altaf is the fifth in the day's confirmed list of arrestees. Joint forces had earlier in the day arrested Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar, Partex Group chairman MA Hashem and Sylhet city mayor Badruddin Ahmed Kamran. bdnews2
