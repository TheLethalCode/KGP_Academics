More than 1,000 people were protesting to demand the removal of Juma Khan Hamdard, governor of the northern province of Jowzjan, and were throwing stones at several government offices in Shiberghan, the provincial capital, witnesses said. Police fired to stop the protesters from raiding the offices, they said. A provincial government spokesman said the protesters were supporters of General Abdul Rashid Dostum, for years a powerful military commander in the Afghan north. "We've got 13 dead and 35 wounded," said Naqibullah, a doctor at Shiberghan's main hospital said, adding some of the wounded were in critical condition.
