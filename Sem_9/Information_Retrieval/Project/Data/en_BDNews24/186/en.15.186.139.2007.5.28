 Sayedpur, May 28 (bdnews24.com) Workers of the Livestock Department have culled 650 birds after an outbreak of avian flu was detected in four villages of Sayedpur, an official said Monday. Dr Sekendar Ali, district livestock officer, said the workers had buried 400 chickens, 150 ducks and 100 pigeons and destroyed 250 eggs in Bakampur, Batsipara, Kangalipara and South Niamatpara villages to prevent the virus from spreading. The local administration has mounted watch on bird rearing and banned the imports of birds and eggs from other districts. Ali said some chickens died abnormally Thursday in a sign of avian flu outbreak. Later samples were sent to a laboratory in Gaibandha to find out if the deaths were flu-related. "We have culled the birds on proof of avian flu," he said. bdnews24
