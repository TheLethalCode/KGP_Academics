<TITLE> China blasts Taiwan's DPP for 'independence move' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Wednesday blasted the leaders of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for considering a change to the island's constitution which would reflect an identity separate from the mainland. The DPP has been drafting a "normal country resolution" to amend the constitution of the island which still styles itself as the "Republic of China" and claims sovereignty over the mainland. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has vowed to bring it back under mainland rule, by force if necessary. "Its (the resolution's) purpose is to create conditions for de jure independence through constitutional changes and referendum," Li Weiyi, spokesman for Beijing's policy-making Taiwan Affairs office, said. "We will never allow any attempts to separate Taiwan from China to succeed." The constitution was drawn up by the opposition Nationalists (KMT) who once ruled all China and fled to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The DPP came to power in 2000 presidential elections. The DPP's resolution lacks specifics but should be approved by the party on June 30 and sent to parliament, the party's China policy architect said earlier this month. If the party proposes provocative constitutional changes, the opposition-controlled legislature will likely reject the resolution. In an apparent divide-and-conquer tactic, Li said drafting the resolution was a "dangerous act by diehard independence elements to forcefully impose their will" on DPP members. "We have always held that the broad membership of the DPP is different from a tiny minority of diehard Taiwan independence elements," Li said. "We are willing to make positive responses and engage with DPP if it abandons the independence platform and stops splittist activities." China has fostered close ties with the KMT and two other opposition parties favouring eventual reunification, but has refused to deal with the DPP leadership and the administration of President of Chen Shui-bian. Cross-Strait ties will be tested by a series of sensitive events in the coming year as Taiwan holds presidential elections next March and Beijing hosts the 2008 Olympics in August
