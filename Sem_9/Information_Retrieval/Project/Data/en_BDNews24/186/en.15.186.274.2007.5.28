 MADRID, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish police said they arrested 15 people in a wide-ranging operation against Islamic militants on Monday. Spanish media reported those arrested were suspected of recruiting volunteers to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, though police would not confirm this. "At this time, an ongoing operation against Islamic terrorism is in progress. It is thought they are Moroccans," a police spokesman said.

"We have seen several operations against Islamic terrorism in Spain in recent years, in which the charges have not been that serious. Very probably, most of these suspects will be out in the coming hours or days," said Cardenosa. He added that levels of Islamist recruitment for foreign wars was much higher in the 1980s and 1990s, for Afghanistan and Bosnia, and the overall threat to Spain remained "very low". Spain is officially home to around 570,000 Moroccans -- the biggest immigrant group in the country, a large proportion of whom live in Catalonia.
