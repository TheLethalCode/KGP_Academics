<TITLE> China stocks plunge on tax hike, hit Asia markets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese stocks slumped more than 6 percent on Wednesday after China tripled a share-trading tax in a bid to cool its red-hot market, knocking Asian markets lower but failing to trigger the broad rout some had feared. The yen extended its rebound from a record low against the euro as the Chinese move prompted investors to cut back risky positions in so-called carry trades financed by borrowing the Japanese currency. China's Ministry of Finance raised stamp duty on share trades to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent in what was seen as the latest attempt to curb speculation in a market that had risen more than 60 percent so far this year. Tokyo's Nikkei fell 0.9 percent by 0515 GMT, while MSCI's index of regional shares outside Japan was down 1.2 percent. "The decline today is 100 percent influenced by China," said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at the equity management department of Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. "In theory it shouldn't matter if Chinese stocks plunge, but markets are at high levels and investors are very aware of the downside risk." European markets were also expected to fall, with Britain's FTSE 100 leading share index seen opening down 28 to 32 points, according to financial bookmakers. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was down 6.2 percent. Shares of brokerages were hardest hit on fears the tax rise would shrink market turnover, with CITIC Securities tumbling by the 10 percent daily limit. Beijing's cooling measure prompted fears of a repeat of late February, when a steep slump in Chinese stocks triggered a global equities sell-off. Regional stock markets fell across the board but the losses were not as dramatic, with benchmarks in Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore falling between 0.8 and 1.3 percent. "This is not like the China shock in February," said Kim Joong-hyun, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinah Securities in Seoul. "The markets are showing that the impact from China this time will not be long-lasting." In the foreign exchange markets those jitters prompted some scaling back of carry trades, where investors borrow low yielding currencies such as the yen to buy assets offering higher returns. Carry trades are vulnerable to reduced risk appetite, often prompting a sharp appreciation of the yen when investors reverse such positions. The Japanese currency jumped against the dollar and euro as share trading opened in Shanghai, but quickly trimmed gains to trade a little firmer on the day. "The foreign exchange market is swinging between hope and despair due to developments in Chinese shares," said Kosuke Hanao, head of forex sales at HSBC in Tokyo. The euro fell to 163.20 yen after reaching a fresh record high of 164.29 yen the previous day as comments by European Central Bank officials suggesting more euro-zone rate increases prompted investors to buy the single currency. The dollar bought 121.45 yen down around 0.2 percent from late US trading. The dollar remains in sight of a three-month high of 121.89 yen hit last Friday. China's midnight announcement, which came late in the US trading day, limited Wall Street gains on Tuesday. The Dow Jones closed 0.1 percent higher, although the Nasdaq rose 0.6 percent on a wave of takeover news in the tech sector. Oil prices steadied, after sliding on Tuesday amid easing concerns about Nigerian supply disruptions and a slew of refinery restarts in the United States that signalled a recovery in gasoline stocks ahead of the summer holiday "driving season". London Brent crude currently seen as the most accurate benchmark of world prices, eased 5 cents to $68.08 a barrel. Gold traded near $657.50 an ounce, up around $1.50 on the day, as dealers awaited minutes of the most recent Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting for clues on the direction of the US currency, a key factor for dollar-denominated commodities. Benchmark Japanese government bond 10-year yields eased 1.5 basis points to 1.735 percent
