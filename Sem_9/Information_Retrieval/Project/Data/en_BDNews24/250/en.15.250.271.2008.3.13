<TITLE> Sector Commanders to hold war crimes convention </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Liberation War Sector Commanders Forum on Thursday demanded the government form an international commission to commence trial of war criminals. Retired air vice marshal AK Khandakar, chairman of the forum, said formation of such a commission was a crying need of the times since people owed it to the conscience of the nation. "We are not swearing any revenge. The people want that war criminals be tried to free the nation of its moral burden of unfinished work," Khandakar told a news briefing at the Liberation War Museum. To that end, Khandaker announced, the forum was going to organise a convention on March 15 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre to drum up support for the cause of war crime trials. The convention organisers expect people from various professions will join the congregation to discuss the issues surrounding the war crimes committed in 1971. Freedom fighters will describe their experiences as they fought Pakistani forces and faced down local collaborators who took part in massacres, looting and other crimes during the bloody war, they said. Khandakar criticised the interim government for not taking necessary measures to try war criminals, and termed the matter "a sorry affair". Referring to previous statements by the chief adviser, the chief election commissioner and the army chief on the need for trying war crimes, he said there was still no visible effort to back their words. Former army chief Harun-Ur-Rashid, also a forum member, said it was the duty of the state to try those who committed war crimes. "The proposed international commission will identify the people who committed the war crimes in 1971. But it is the duty of the government and the state to try them," he said. Independent fact finding groups and war crime researchers have alleged leaders and activists of Jamaat-e-Islami were involved in genocide during the liberation war. Some documents suggest that Jamaat's involvement with the Pakistani occupation forces was a political decision to oppose the birth of Bangladesh. But the current Jamaat leadership has steadfastly denied such allegations. bdnews24
