<TEXT>
 Kuala Lampur, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The son of former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad on Friday asked Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to resign following the ruling coalition's election debacle at the weekend. "I'm asking him to resign," Mukhriz Mahathir told Reuters, adding that he had written a letter to the premier on Wednesday demanding his resignation. He is the first ruling party leader to demand that Abdullah step down. Mukhriz, a senior executive member of the UMNO youth wing, commands factional support within the party. Mahathir has also urged the prime minister to resign over the party's worst election setback in its 50-year rule.
