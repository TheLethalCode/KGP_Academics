 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)  South Africa wrapped up the three-ODI series with a seven-wicket win over Bangladesh on Wednesday, with one match to go at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Proteas took their time overcoming the Bangladesh spinners with AB de Villiers and Jean-Paul Duminy putting on 119 runs for the unbeaten third wicket, to take the hosts to 179 for three with 11 balls to spare after Bangladesh folded at a paltry 173 all out. Villiers and Duminy had dawdled along at 3.7 runs per over after top three batsmen Herschelle Gibbs (3), Graeme Smith (28) and Hashim Amla (16) left their side at 60 for three in 16.4 overs on the slow and low wicket. Villiers played an uncharacteristic 112-ball 69, his 13th ODI fifty, hitting two fours and one six while Duminy was one run short of his fourth fifty knocking 93 balls. Spinners Abdur Razzak (2/32), Musharraf Hossain (0/34) and Shakib Al Hasan (0/28) troubled Villiers and Duminy, but could not break their concentration as they cautiously steered their side to the target. Pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (1/27) made the first breakthrough for Bangladesh trapping Gibbs lbw, before Razzak removed both Smith and Amla. Earlier, the failure of top and late orders pushed Bangladesh to end their innings up at 173 all out in 48.2 overs, five short of their Chittagong one-day total, despite a record partnership between Roqibul Hasan and Shakib for the fifth wicket. The two batsmen set a new record of 119 runs for the fifth wicket, eclipsing the previous best of a 116 fifth-wicket partnership laid by Shakib and Mohammad Ashraful against Canada at St John's in Feb, 2007. Shakib and Roqibul rebuilt their innings to 137 for five after Bangladesh were reduced to 18 for four in the 7th over. But, the dismissal of Roqibul triggered a mini collapse in the middle order and the hosts again slumped to 148 for eight in the 44th over, losing three wickets in two runs as Andre Nel and Charl Langeveldt again struck sending back Roqibul and Razzak (0). Sakib, who entered the 1000-run club today, played a patient 52 off 97 balls to complete his sixth ODI fifty studded with four fours before he drove Gibbs to Johan Botha to cover. Roqibul made his maiden fifty in the second match to make 63 off 105 balls, also featuring four fours, before he pulled Langeveldt to Smith at mid-on. Dhiman Ghosh (0) was unable to return to his crease after pushing Nel to cover while Mashrafee was Langeveldt's third victim and the last batsmen out for 20 off 35 balls. Bangladesh faced an onslaught from paceman Nel, who ripped through the top order sending back Tamim Iqbal (0), Ashraful (0) and Shahriar Nafees (5), while Langeveldt removed debutant Nazimuddin (11) to reduce the hosts to 18 for four in seven overs. It could have been worse had the two Hasans not kept their heads cool, as they together patiently took 61 singles to keep the Proteas bowlers at bay before Langeveldt cleaned up tail. Nel first uprooted Tamim's stumps for nought in the day's third delivery when he tried to cut the bowler instead of dragging the ball. Ashraful (0) hooked Nel to Albie Morkel, who took a diving catch at fine leg running from long leg, while Nafees fiddled timidly outside off and was caught by keeper Villiers off Nel. Nazimuddin failed to deal with a Langeveldt delivery that kept a little low and was trapped in front for an 11 off 13 balls. Nel led the attack with four for 27 while Langeveldt grabbed three for 31. bdne
