 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Queen was due to open a giant new terminal at London's Heathrow airport later on Friday despite security breaches by protesters opposed to expanding the world's busiest international gateway. On the eve of the Queen's visit, police arrested a man who ran out onto a Heathrow runway. On Thursday they exploded his bag as a precaution but did not find a bomb. Authorities said they did not believe the incident was terrorism-related.

This is a new beginning," BAA chairman Nigel Rudd told BBC television on Friday. He said plans to replace ageing terminals one and two would mean 70 perecent of passengers will be using new terminals within four years.

Business leaders have complained the logjam could jeopardise London's status as a global financial centre. Green protesters worry the new terminals are just the first stage in a vast new expansion that will see a third runway, sixth terminal and up to twice as many passengers. Last month, protesters broke into the aiport and unveiled a banner atop a plane. Others chained themselves to the roof of the House of Commo
