 GENEVA, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A UN rights envoy said on Friday he could believe in 'gnomes, trolls and elves' as readily as he could credit the Myanmar military's democratic reforms. But the United Nations special investigator for human rights in Myanmar, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, told a news briefing that the Myanmar authorities had earlier in the day issued him with a visa to visit after over two months of delay. He described the development as "auspicious". "If you believe in gnomes, trolls and elves, you can believe in this democratic process in Myanmar," said Pinheiro, who on Thursday presented a report to the UN Human Rights Council arguing that repression of dissent was growing there. Although the government had announced it would hold a referendum in May on a constitution setting the nation on a path to democracy with elections set for 2010, this was difficult to reconcile with wide restrictions on free speech, he added.

A SIGN In his report, the Brazilian jurist told the 47-member Council that Myanmar's secretive administration was barring outdoor meetings of more than 5 people, had continued targetting political opponents and held some 1,850 political prisoners. "For a democracy to be sustainable, it has to be inclusive and representative of the views of all the people in Myanmar," said Pinheiro who steps down from his job later this year. "No referendum or elections can be fair, no transition to democracy can be effective, without the release of political prisoners, the authorisation for all political parties to operate, and the protection of the basic civil and political freedoms, all non-existent in Myanmar," he added. In December the Council told Myanmar it should prosecute those responsible for a violent crackdown on monk-led protests last September, lift the house arrest of Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and free all political detainees. Pinheiro said on Friday that the military junta -- which insists all human rights are observed in the country and that all those jailed have violated laws -- had ignored resolutions by the Council and the UN General Assembly. "The trouble with this country is that it makes no concessions," he said. Pinheiro told reporters he was delighted that his visa had come through in the wake of his report. "Perhaps we should see this as a sign that the (Myanmar) military are ready to continue dialogue with the Council." He said he would leave for Myanmar as soon as he could obtain a flight. Last week UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari visited the country and was allowed to see Suu Kyi but had no meeting with top genera
