 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has welcomed a peace deal signed between Sudan and Chad in the Senegalese capital of Dakar Thursday on the sidelines of the 11th OIC Summit, an official statement said. The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka Friday quoted adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury as saying that Bangladesh favoured conflict resolution through dialogue. "Sudan and Chad are fellow members of the OIC and their relationship should be brotherly," Chowdhury was quoted as saying. "Both (Sudan and Chad) also belong to the group of the least developed countries, which Bangladesh chairs. So we have (a) particular reason to be pleased. We hope that this peace will be lasting," he said. "We congratulate President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal, our new chairman of the OIC for his successful initiative. This also shows that the OIC has contemporary relevance, something that Bangladesh has always favoured," Chowdhury said in the statement. bdnew
