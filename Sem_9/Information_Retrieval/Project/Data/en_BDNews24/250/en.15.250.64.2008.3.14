<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England paceman James Anderson registered his fourth five-wicket haul to put his side in control of the second test against New Zealand at the end of the second day on Friday. England, courtesy of Anderson's five for 73, bowled the hosts out for 198 late on the second day at the Basin Reserve, giving the tourists a 144-run lead on the first innings. England reached four without loss at the close in their second innings, a lead of 148 with three days remaining, with Alastair Cook on two and captain Michael Vaughan yet to score after the openers safely negotiated a tricky five-over spell. Ross Taylor top-scored with 54 and Daniel Vettori contributed 50 not out in New Zealand's first innings, while Paul Collingwood chipped in with career-best figures of 3-23 for England. Recalled after being overlooked for the first test, Anderson ripped through the top of New Zealand's batting order to reduce the home side to 31-3 before he returned to take another two wickets later in the innings. "We saw from their innings it was doing a bit, but if slightly off line and length you go for runs," Anderson told reporters. "We thought we might beat the bat a few times, but stay patient and the edges would come." New Zealand, who lead the three-test series 1-0, had bowled England out for 342 just before lunch after wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Ambrose had scored his maiden test century. A 71-run stand between Stephen Fleming and Taylor and a brutal 52-run partnership from Brendon McCullum and Vettori were the only bright spots of a poor batting display from the hosts. Fleming and Taylor's partnership rescued New Zealand's innings after Anderson's initial spell removed Matthew Bell, Jamie How and Mathew Sinclair cheaply. LAZY SHOT Fleming, who became the 32nd player to pass 7,000 test runs when he moved to 18, and Taylor took their side through to 100-3 at tea but Fleming fell straight afterwards for 34 when his lazy shot off Anderson popped straight to Kevin Pietersen. All-rounder Jacob Oram fell for eight when he was trapped leg before by Ryan Sidebottom before Taylor became Anderson's fifth wicket when he edged behind to Ambrose for 54. New Zealand had slumped to 113-6 after Taylor's dismissal leaving McCullum and Vettori to revive the innings by attacking the bowlers. McCullum advanced down the pitch to Sidebottom and Anderson to negate their swing and smashed five fours before he was well caught by Andrew Strauss off Stuart Broad for 25. He and Vettori had added 52 runs in 33 balls. "I thought that if I could come out and be aggressive and hopefully knock them off their length a little bit then the good balls would be a lot fewer and far between," McCullum said. Kyle Mills then departed cheaply for one, while Mark Gillespie was bowled for a duck and Chris Martin was bowled for one, all three wickets falling to Collingwood. Vettori was left on 50 not out when he ran out of partners
