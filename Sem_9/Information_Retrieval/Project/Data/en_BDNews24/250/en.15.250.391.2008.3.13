 ZURICH, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nestle surprised investors by raising its growth outlook on Thursday, saying the year had started strongly and it expected a similar growth rate to last year in 2008. The world's largest food company said it had already pushed through price increases to its customers in 2007 and now stood to benefit if price pressures on commodities such as grains and sugar abate in the second half of 2008.

"The Group's organic growth is off to a very strong start in 2008," outgoing Chief Executive Peter Brabeck said in a statement. Nestle said it expected raw material cost pressures to ease somewhat during 2008, and foresaw price increases trending lower in the second half of 2008. At its full-year results last month, Brabeck had declined to commit to matching Nestle's 2007 growth rate this year. The Vevey, Switzerland-based company -- which also makes Perrier water, Buitoni pasta and Maggi soups -- trades at about 16 times forecast 2008 earnings, according to Reuters data. That is just ahead of British sector peer Unilever, with a multiple of 15, but behind France's Danone. Nestle maintained a targeted improvement in its margin on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in 2008. The company plans to publish detailed first-quarter results on April 21. A spokesman declined to give further details on first quarter figur
