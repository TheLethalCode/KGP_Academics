 BELGRADE, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian President Boris Tadic disbanded parliament on Thursday and called an early general election for May 11, widely seen as Serbia's most important vote since the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. The 10-month old government collapsed at the weekend, with nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica blaming deep disunity in his coalition with pro-Western liberals over defending Kosovo versus pursuing a place in the European Union. "The election is a democratic way for citizens to say how Serbia should develop in the years to come," Tadic, also the head of the pro-Western Democratic Party, said in a statement. He appealed for "a fair campaign in a peaceful and democratic atmosphere in order to enable Serbia to get stable institutions that will work efficiently." The election will be a close race between Tadic's Democrats and the nationalist Radicals, Serbia's strongest party, who are seen to have gained further on Serb bitterness over Western backing for Kosovo's secession last month. Analysts predict lengthy coalition talks that would delay reforms and erode investor confidence, already shaken by Belgrade's recall of ambassadors from states that recognised Serbia's former province as independent, and by violent protests against embassies and foreign firms. Standard & Poor's also revised its outlook on the country to negative earlier this week, noting the impact that an anti-EU government would have on macroeconomic policy and reforms. Serbia's liberal politicians have billed the vote as a referendum on a key question: should Serbs go on working to join the European Union even though the bloc backed the secession of its cherished province. "May 11 will be when we determine the path that Serbia takes," deputy PM Bozidar Djelic of the Democrats said on Wednesday. "We need new enthusiasm and a clearly determined path towards the European Union". The Radicals are expected to focus their campaign on Kosovo, the benefits of close ties to non-Western powers, such as Russia, and the failure of eight years-worth of pro-Western governments to deliver on their promises of a better life. The party's general secretary Aleksandar Vucic said that while Europe was important, it was a mostly hyped-up issue which was clouding more major things, such as "how to solve people's daily problems." "We want Serbia in the EU with Kosovo as its part," Vucic told independent broadcaster B92, "but we also want people to live better and have someone responsible dealing with their daily problem
