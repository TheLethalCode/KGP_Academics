 ABUJA, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria has agreed to raise its crude oil supplies to Ghana by 50 percent to 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) , Nigeria's minister of state for petroleum said on Wednesday. Nigeria is Africa's top oil producer and regional economic power, is a major supplier of crude some countries in West Africa. Odein Ajumogobia said the increase followed a request by Ghanaian President John Kufuor at a meeting with Nigeria's President Umaru Yar'Adua on Wednesday. The increase will be the second since Nigeria first signed an agreement with Ghana in 2001 to supply 30,000 barrels of oil per day to the Tema Oil Refinery. "The last contract we signed with Ghana was 40,000 bpd, but today the Ghanian president asked for additional 20,000 bpd and that has been approved," Ajumogobia told reporters after the meeting in Abuja. Ajumogobia said under the new contract, Ghana was granted 60 days of credit before paying for each consignment of crude oil delivered instead of 30 days previous
