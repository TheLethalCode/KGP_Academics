<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)The condition of ailing Abdul Jalil, now under care of Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, has deteriorated, a doctor with LabAid Cardiac Hospital said Friday. Before flying to the city-state, the detained Awami League general secretary had long been treated at LabAid for heart diseases and kidney failure. Professor Baren Chakravarty, who visited Singapore Thursday and spoke to doctors treating Jalil there, said Jalil's kidneys were not working well. "But his heart condition is fine," said Chakravarty. "The doctors will observe him for three months and then a regular kidney dialysis will start," said Chakravarty, one of Jalil's personal physicians in Bangladesh. Chakravarty went to the city state to join a seminar on heart diseases. Jalil went to Singapore on March 3 on one-month parole for better medical treatment. bdnews24.com
