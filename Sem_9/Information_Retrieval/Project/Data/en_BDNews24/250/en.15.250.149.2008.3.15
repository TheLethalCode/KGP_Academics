<TEXT>
 Chittagong, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Saturday the main economic indicators all pointed to a stable situation prevailing in the country. The adviser spoke to reporters following a pre-budget meeting at the Chittagong Circuit House. "Considering increased loans, progress in the middle indexes, an increase in imports and exports and increasing wages, it looks as if the economy is stable," said Azizul. The adviser pointed to surveys carried out by various agencies around the country that indicated workers wages had recently seen significant increases. Azizul said recent comments made by Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan who claimed a silent famine was prevailing in the country were his own and did not reflect the wider opinion. The finance adviser said the upcoming budget would see greater emphasis placed on maintaining recent growth, poverty alleviation, social security and increasing revenue collection to reduce dependency on foreign aid. "The budget will be prepared with an eye on developing the lives of those on the fringes of society," he said. In the pre-budget discussion the adviser had said special attention would be paid to checking increasing regional disparity in Bangladesh. Azizul claimed the caretaker government had been successful in achieving some "fundamental goals" during its tenure. "Every year poverty levels are reduced by 2 percent, which is worthy of comment in the context of the current global situation," Azizul said. The adviser said this year's budget had not been prepared with advice from the World Bank or International Monetary Fund. "This government will not take any external advice that goes against the country's interests." The finance advsier conceded that Annual Development Programme implementation had been sluggish over the last few years. "I have directed the officials concerned to increase the speed of implementation for ADP projects." The adviser said the caretaker government would present the next budget in the absence of an elected parliament, and the opinions of a wide cross section of society would be taken into consideration. He said Bangladesh was near the bottom of the list of countries in terms of revenue collection and the upcoming budget would focus on remedying the situation. Acting Chittagong mayor Manzur Alam urged the adviser to include a number of city corporation projects in the ADP. Alam said the corporation's lump sum allocation had been reduced over the last few years, and had now dropped to Tk 19 crore from Tk 30 crore. bdnews
