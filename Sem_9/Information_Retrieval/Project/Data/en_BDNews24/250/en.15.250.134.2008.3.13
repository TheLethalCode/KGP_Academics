<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnew24.com)  A Dhaka court granted bail Thursday to the wife of Jamuna Group managing director Nurul Islam Babul, advocate Salma Islam, after she turned herself in to the court. Judge Md Azizul Haque of the Senior Special Judges' Court set the accused, who is publisher of Bangla-language daily Jugantor, a bail bond of Tk 50,000. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, who took part in the bail hearing on behalf of Salma, said the case was filed by the Anticorruption Commission under emergency powers rules. As Salma was co-accused in the case alongside her husband, who was previously awarded bail by the High Court, the Senior Judges' Court should also approve his client's bail. Another of Salma's lawyers, Md Abdul Bari, told bdnews24.com that the court had released the accused following an amendment of emergency powers rules in which there was a provision that the wife and children co-accused under EPR alongside a primary suspect may be released. The other accused in the case Md Shamim Islam, the couple's son, is currently fugitive. Judge Azizul Haque issued an arrest warrant on Tuesday against advocate Salma and son Shamim on charges of suppressing wealth information in a joint statement with Babul to the Anticorruption Commission. ACC deputy director Sharmin Ferdousi filed the case with Ramna Police Station on Aug 19, last year. According to case details, the ACC asked the managing director of Jamuna Group to submit his wealth accounts on Feb 18 last year. Babul submitted wealth accounts totalling Tk 70 crore, of which Tk 8.84 crore were immovable and Tk 61.93 crore movable assets, in his own name and that of his wife, son and three daughters. The ACC claims that Babul suppressed wealth to the tune of Tk 4.17 crore and owned Tk 5.56 crore beyond his known source of income. His wife and son assisted him in providing the false information to the ACC, the case alleges. ACC deputy director Monjurul Ahmed on March 4 pressed charges against Babul, wife and son. bdnews24.co
