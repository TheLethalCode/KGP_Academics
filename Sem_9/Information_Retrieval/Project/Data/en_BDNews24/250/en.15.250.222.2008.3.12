<TEXT>
 BOSTON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - George Fox, a friend and campaign contributor of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, said on Tuesday he was disappointed and distressed by a report that said Spitzer used his name as an alias when contacting a prostitution ring. Fox, a hedge fund investor, said the discovery of his name in the sex scandal engulfing Spitzer "comes as a great surprise and disappointment." "There is absolutely no connection between Mr. Fox and the governor's alleged activity beyond the unauthorized use of his name," said a statement issued by a public relations firm representing Fox. "Mr. Fox considers Gov. Spitzer a close friend and is distressed by the news that has emerged," he said. Fox, whose firm Titan Advisors invests $3.5 billion in some of the world's most prominent hedge funds, and Spitzer have been friends for two decades and Fox donated to Spitzer's 2006 campaign for governor. The New York Times reported on Monday that Spitzer had hired a $1,000-an-hour prostitute and was caught on a federal wiretap at least six times last month arranging to meet her at a Washington hotel where he used Fox's name to rent the room. Spitzer has neither confirmed nor denied the report. The statement said Fox did get an apology from Spitzer. "While he is disappointed that his name was involved, he appreciates the apology the governor has personally communicated and he wishes the governor and his family strength as they endure this difficult period," he said.
