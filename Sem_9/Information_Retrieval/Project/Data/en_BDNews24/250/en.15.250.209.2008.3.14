 BEIJING, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shops were set on fire in violence in Tibet's capital of Lhasa on Friday, witnesses said, as the region was hit by a fresh wave of rare street protests. Chinese rule in remote, Buddhist Tibet has become a focus for critics ahead of the Beijing Olympics, with global marches this week to mark the 49th anniversary of a failed uprising against Communist rule spilling into Tibet itself. Hundreds of people had again taken to Lhasa's streets in defiance of Chinese authorities and despite a heavy police presence and reports of a lockdown on monasteries, sources with knowledge of the region said. "The police are everywhere," said one cafe owner reached by phone in Lhasa. "There are big problems." A report from China's Xinhua news agency cited witnesses as saying a number of shops were burnt and nearby businesses closed. On Friday, 300 to 400 residents and monks demonstrated in Lhasa, a source cited a witness as saying, capping a week of daily protests led by the Buddhist clergy, an echo of the anti-government protests that rocked neighbour Myanmar last year. "Some are angry and some are scared. The security forces are checking houses to see if any monks are hiding," said the source, who is in touch with Tibetan residents. Hundreds of monks from the Labrang monastery in the northwestern province of Gansu also led a march through the town of Xiahe, the Free Tibet Campaign said, citing sources in Dharamsala, home to Tibet's government-in-exile. More than 10 monks had been arrested and tanks were patrolling the square near the Potala Palace, the person said, referring to one of the architectural wonders of the world once the winter residence of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. "It's very chaotic. I haven't heard any shots fired, but all the police have come out," said one Lhasa resident. "The monks and nuns have been marching and protesting," the woman said, adding residents were afraid to go out. "Now it's very chaotic outside," another resident said. "People have been burning cars and motorbikes and buses. There is smoke everywhere and they have been throwing rocks and breaking windows. We're scared." A businesswoman surnamed Xia said: "It's martial law ...There are People's Armed Police out, and they've been fighting the lamas." Martial law could not be confirmed and China's State Council Information Office declined to comment, referring only to remarks made on Thursday by a Foreign Ministry spokesman, who said the protesters were "seeking to spark social turmoil". RESTIVE This week's shows of defiance are precisely what the Chinese government has been trying to avoid as it seeks to secure a stable environment for the Olympics, which open on Aug. 8. The region has been periodically restive since Chinese troops invaded in 1950. Nine years later, the Dalai Lama staged a failed uprising against Chinese rule and fled into exile in India. China imposed martial law in Tibet in 1989, the same year as the Tiananmen Square protests were crushed in Beijing, to quell anti-Chinese demonstrations, when President Hu Jintao was the Communist Party boss in the region. On Monday, 500 monks from the Drepung monastery marched in Lhasa. That was followed by action from monks at the Lhasa-area Sera and Ganden monasteries. Security personnel fired tear gas on at least one of the demonstrations, reports said. The Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet said authorities had sealed off all three monasteries, citing tourism operators. "There is an intensified atmosphere of fear and tension in Tibet's capital," the group said in a statement. The US-government-funded Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported monks from Sera were on a hunger strike, demanding withdrawal of Chinese paramilitary forces from the monastery compound and the release of monks detained earlier this week. Two monks from Drepung were in critical condition after attempting suicide by slitting their wrists, RFA said. The number of Tibetans detained could not be confirmed, but the watchdog groups said they expected government reprisa
