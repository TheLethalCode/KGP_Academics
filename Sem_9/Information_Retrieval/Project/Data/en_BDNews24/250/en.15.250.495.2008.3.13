"The strike will gather momentum as more and more employees join us now," said Aparesh Das, a union leader. At least 479 air force personnel were deployed in 21 major airports in the country to help flight operations, an air force spokesman said.

The union members fear once private operators take over operations, staff at the old airports could lose their jobs or could be forced to shift base.
