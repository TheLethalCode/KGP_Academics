<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The emergency funding plan for cash-strapped brokerage Bear Stearns on Friday slammed US and European stocks and boosted bonds already jittery over the impact of a widening credit crunch. Shares of Bear Sterns lost nearly half their value and dragged other financial stocks lower with it.Trading overall was volatile as investors tried to absorb the stunning news of the bailout. The initial announcement that JPMorgan Chase would provide financing to Bear Stearns lifted European shares and index futures, on the view that a white knight had stepped up. But traders then focused on additional statements that the firm's cash position had deteriorated and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also was part of the funding caused a reassessment. The bank has long been considered one of the institutions hardest hit by a credit crisis that has hammered financial markets for months, a suspicion that appeared validated by the new developments. The Dow industrials, after falling as much as 200 points, traded 138 points lower at 12,000 in late morning dealings. Unsettled equity investors piled into the relative safety of U.S. Treasuries as equity markets turned sharply lower, which moved to wide gains as interest rates dropped and some speculated the Fed now may cut rates more sharply. The dollar fell to a fresh 12-1/2-year low against the yen and another record low against the euro. "The market is concerned about Bear Stearns saying that their liquidity positions has deteriorated," said Steven Butler, director of foreign exchange trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. "It means things are really getting worse for the U.S. economy." In a sign of the fears and hopes gripping markets, major U.S. stock indices opened higher, fell about 2 percent and then pared half those losses in the first hour of trading. Bear Stearns said its cash position had deteriorated significantly over the past 24 hours. It said the funding was arranged to restore investor confidence, strengthen the bank's liquidity and to allow it to continue normal operations. "This tells you we're not over the worst yet, and there are still some players out there who are vulnerable," said Stephen Dowds, head of international equities at Northern Trust in London. Investors hailed Federal Reserve efforts to address the possibility systemic risk, but the unusual move was also cause for concern. "The Fed is taking all the risk in this arrangement. They are exposing themselves to a non-member institution which is highly unusual, if not unprecedented," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "Clearly the Fed is addressing what they feel is a systemic risk very aggressively which should support market confidence that no total market freeze will be allowed to happen." With investors focused on wider risks to the system, the S&P financials index .GSPF> fell 2.8 percent. The euro hit a new all-time record at $1.5688 EUR=> before easing to $1.5644, unchanged from late Thursday. Spot gold raced higher to scale an historic peak above the key $1,000 mark after the dollar slumped further and fell below parity with the Swiss franc for the first time. The credit concerns overshadowed earlier tame inflation data and U.S. rate futures pointed to a growing chance of a 1 percentage point cut when Fed policy-makers meet on Tuesday. The Labor Department said cheaper energy and transportation helped keep overall consumer prices in check, a surprise after a period of run-ups that had heightened concern over inflation. Some analysts were skeptical, however, given the soaring price of oil and other commodities. "Now we can all go on imagining there's no inflation and the Fed can continue pretending that the rate cuts aren't going to come at a cost. So the party goes on," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners LLC, Greenwich, Connecticut. Earlier in Europe financial markets had stabilized after a week of turbulence, with the U.S. dollar inching up from historic lows and European stocks holding steady. The relative calm disguised investor stress over a U.S. economic slowdown, banking strains, hedge fund failures and the ongoing fallout from the eight-month old credit crisis. Oil slipped below $110 as investors took profits after prices hit a record $111 on Thursday, but the depressed dollar was seen limiting losses. U.S. crude for April delivery CLc1> fell 47 cents to $109.86 a barrel after it touched a record for the seventh time in a row in the previous session. Oil is up nearly 8 percent this month and about 14.5 percent this year. London Brent crude for April LCOc1>, which expires later on Friday, dropped 28 cents to $107.26. Earlier, Japan's benchmark Nikkei .N225> average closed at a more than 2-1/2 year low. It closed down 1.54 percent at 12,241.60. The broader TOPIX .TOPX> closed down by 1.9 percent at 1,193.
