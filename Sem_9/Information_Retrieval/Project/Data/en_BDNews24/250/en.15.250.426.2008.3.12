 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced former Awami League whip SM Mostafa Rashidi Suja to 13 years in jail on twin charges of amassing wealth illegally and providing false information. Judge Khandaker Kamaluzzaman of the Special Judge's Court-9 also fined him Tk 10 lakh and failure to pay would get him another year in jail. The court also sentenced Suja's wife Khodeja Rashidi to three years in jail for assisting him in accumulating the wealth. Khodeja was fined Tk 1 lakh. If she failed to pay the fine she would have to stay in jail for two more months. Both Suja and his wife are on the run. Of the total 13 years, Suja got 10 years for obtaining wealth illegally and three years for providing false information to the Anticorruption Commission. As the twin jail terms will run consecutively, the AL leader will have to spend 13 years in jail. The court also ordered confiscation of Suja's wealth worth Tk 3.72 crore. ACC deputy director Md Moniruzzaman filed the case on July 10 last year with Ramna Police Station against the AL leader, his wife and their two daughters Sanzida Rashidi Shimmi and Taniza Rashidi Turki. According to case details, Suja amassed Tk 4.43 crore illegally and concealed wealth to the tune of Tk 78.85 lakh in his wealth statement to the ACC. Suja's wife and daughters assisted him in accumulating the wealth, the case alleged. The names of Suja's daughters were taken off the charge sheet. Over 40 witnesses testified on behalf of the state. On Feb 18 last year, the ACC made a list of 50 corruption suspects, which included politicians and government officials. They were asked to submit accounts of their moveable and immoveable assets within 72 hours from notification. Suja was on the list. bdnew
