 TOKYO, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan is calling on developing countries to come up with feasible mid-term national goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency of industries, a trade ministry official said on Friday. Japan, the world's fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter, argues nations should share energy efficiency indicators of each industrial sector to assess how much they will be able to cut climate-warming emissions. An improvement in end-use energy efficiency costs far less than introducing carbon-reducing technology, such as nuclear energy, and will be especially appropriate for fast-growing economies such as China and India. "We think it is an approach which all major emitters will be able to take part in," said Toru Ishida, Director-General at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's Bureau for Industrial Science and Technology Policy and Environment. "It is not putting a sector cap. It's adding up potential volume from each sector," he said in an interview with Reuters, referring to the bottom-up approach to set fair and equitable national goals. "We think the process of assessment would make it easier for developing countries to find their own paths to fight global warming," he added. The comments came as Japan hosts a three-day meeting in Chiba, next to Tokyo, of the world's top greenhouse gas polluters to work out ways to cut emissions, starting late on Friday. The G20, ranging from top polluters the United States and China to Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa, emit about 80 percent of mankind's greenhouse gases. But Japan's bottom-up approach to seek a global peak-out in the next 10 to 20 years in otherwise growing emissions from economic activities attracts few supporters in UN-led talks on a new global climate pa
