 COLOMBO, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have axed explosive batsman Sanath Jayasuriya and rested spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for a three-match one-day series in West Indies next month. Jayasuriya, 39, was dropped after averaging around 15 in his last 20 innings since the World Cup final in April last year, with selectors focusing more on the next edition. "We have three years left to groom a team for the 2011 World Cup and it is essential that younger players must be given a chance," chief selector Ashantha de Mel told reporters. Sri Lanka will now field youngsters Upul Tharanga and uncapped Mahela Udawatte at the top of the order after the other opener, Dilruwan Perera, was also axed. He was left out after the team's disappointing CB Series in Australia, where India beat the hosts in the final. The 35-year-old Muralitharan, test cricket's leading wicket-taker, has been rested to manage his workload so he can continue until the 2011 World Cup. "Murali is likely to play just the main ODI tournaments which means that we can keep him fit and also groom his successors," captain Mahela Jayawardene told Reuters. "The selectors are keen for him to continue playing until the 2011 World Cup, assuming he maintains his fitness and form." Sri Lanka have opted for leg spinner Malinga Bandara and all rounder Ajantha Mendis, who bowls off spin. They will also be without injured new ball bowlers Lasith Malinga (knee) and Farveez Maharoof (side strain). All rounder Kaushalya Weereratne, 27, who played the last of his 11 ODI's in 2003, replaces Maharoof after impressive domestic performances with bat and ball. Uncapped left-arm fast bowler Thilan Thushara, who was picked for the Tests, has also been included in the squad. The one-dayers will be played in Port of Spain (April 10 and 12) and at St. Lucia (April 15). Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara (wk), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Chaminda Vaas, Chamara Silva, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Kapugedera, Malinga Bandara, Kaushalya Weeraratne, Nuwan Kulasekara, Ajantha Mendis, Jehan Mubarak, Ishara Amerasinghe, Mahela Udawatte, Thilan Thushara
