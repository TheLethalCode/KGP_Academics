<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division completed an appeal hearing Thursday against a High Court verdict that had scrapped a petition by Sheikh Hasina for halting trial of a graft case involving the purchase of Mig-29 war planes during her term as prime minster. The full-bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin ended the proceedings but did not specify any date for the verdict. Hasina's counsel barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh said the verdict could come any day. Taposh said they sought the attention of the Supreme Court on the matter so that the proceedings of the graft case should remain halted in the trial court. "The court has asked to be informed if the trial court makes any move on the case before a verdict on the appeal comes," he said. On Sept 6, 2007, the High Court scrapped a petition by Hasina seeking to halt to the case proceedings in the trial court. Hasina's appeal against the High Court order was accepted by the Appellate Division on Mar 9. The other accused in the case have also appealed separately against the HC order to allow proceedings of the case to continue in the trial court. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official with the now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the case on Dec 11, 2001, accusing Hasina of corruption involving the purchase of eight Mig-29 war jets during her term as prime minister. According to the case documents, the state treasury lost Tk 700 crore on the back of the 1999 deal. The other accused in the case are former air force chief Jamaluddin Ahmed, former army chief Mostafizur Rahman, former defence secretary Syed Yousuf Hossain, former joint defence secretary Mohammad Hossain Serniabat, former air commodore Mirza Akhter Maruf and Unique Group managing director Noor Ali. bdnews24.co
