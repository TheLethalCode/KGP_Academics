<TITLE> Australia's Tait considering return to cricket </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia fast bowler Shaun Tait is planning a return to cricket just months after announcing he was quitting the game. Tait stunned the Australian cricket community in January when he said he was taking an indefinite break because he was worn out from the grind and pressure of professional sport. The 25-year-old told reporters on Thursday he was already feeling refreshed after a two-month rest and contemplating a comeback at the end of the year. "In the last two weeks I've started to feel like myself again," he said. "I'm thinking about cricket more and thinking about playing cricket again. It's a good sign. "The one big thing I have learnt about myself is I do enjoy cricket. It is a part of my life and will be a part of my life for the future." Tait said he hoped to play in next season's Australian domestic season, starting in October, but would be adopting a different approach to the game. The express paceman said he had allowed himself to become obsessed with bowling fast but planned to slow things down and focus more on enjoying the game. "When I do come back and play I'm not going to worry about the speed gun as much as I used to," he said. "I'm my own worst enemy. Everyone talks it up. Everyone looks at me for one reason. That I can bowl fast and that's it. "I'm going to work on other parts of my game as well. Tait said he had spoken to Australian express bowler Brett Lee, who had also focused on more than just speed. "Look at him. He's going great guns," Tait said. "His trick was bowling better lines and just worrying about being a mature bowler rather than trying to be the fastest bowler of all time.
