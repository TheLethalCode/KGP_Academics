 Cernobbio, Italy, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Recognising the similarities between their electoral programmes, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi joked he had nothing to say after his rival for prime minister spoke of cutting billions of euros in public spending. Both former prime minister Berlusconi and his centre-left opponent, Walter Veltroni, have made public spending a key issue in their campaigning ahead of the April 13-14 vote. Reducing public spending and debt -- the world's third largest in absolute terms -- is one of several measures the two men cite to revive the economy, one of the weakest in Europe. "I don't know what more to say," Berlusconi, the media tycoon and centre-right leader, said in his speech on Saturday at a business forum in the lakeside town of Cernobbio, north of Milan. "This morning you had Mr. Veltroni explain my programme," he said with a grin at the meeting hosted by Confcommercio, the main retailers' association. Berlusconi, seeking to become prime minister for a third time, leads in the opinion polls, but his support might not be strong enough to guarantee a majority in the Senate (upper house) of the Italian parliament. The similarities of the rivals' platforms is not the only thing that has made some people suspicious. Their refusal to insult each other -- unusual in Italian politics -- have led some politicians to believe that a coalition between the two parties might be in the works should neither of them win a clear majority. Smaller parties fear a right-left pact could be formed to push through electoral reforms to create a two-party system, reducing their chances of getting back into parliament. Regardless of the outcome, the head of Confcommercio was anxious to have the next government start cutting public spending as soon as possible. Carlo Sangalli called for the equivalent of a full percentage point of GDP to be cut from the outset. "We are facing ... an emergency," he told a news conference. His association forecast economic growth slowing down to a rate of 0.7 percent this year from 1.5 percent in 2007. It saw a contraction of 0.2 percent should investment dry up. "We would then be in a recession," he said. The main forecast was in line with the 0.5-0.7 percent rate seen by Prime Minister Romano Prodi's outgoing government. His government also targeted a budget deficit at 2.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, but Italy will be under pressure from the European Commission to lower it after last year's deficit came in below expectations at 1.9 percent. Veltroni said he would make a slower start to the cuts, doing it by half a percentage point a year before cutting it by a full point in successive years.
