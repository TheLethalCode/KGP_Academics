 ROME, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chiara Lubich, founder of the international lay Roman Catholic Church movement Focolare and one of the most influential women in modern Catholicism, died on Friday, her movement said. Lubich, who was 88, died at her home south of Rome after being discharged from hospital on Thursday night, in line with her wishes. She had been in frail health for years. The Focolare Movement has more than 140,000 core members and 2.1 million adherents in 182 countries worldwide.

Lubich was particularly close to the late Pope John Paul II, who also championed other lay movements in the Church, such as Opus Dei, the Sant' Egidio Community and Communion and Liberation. She promoted inter-religious dialogue and once preached in a mosque in New York's Harlem neighbourhood. Lubich founded "mini-cities" in several countries where members could live and carry out their spiritual and social vocations. Preaching that the gospel should be put into practice in every aspect of life, Lubich won the support of Pope Paul VI in 1964 and her influence began to increase.
