<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina's two personal physicians Wednesday protested what they said was denial of access to the detained former prime minister, now under care of Square Hospital. Eye specialist Syed Modasser Ali, who treated the Awami League president for the last 27 years, told bdnews24.com that he had been kept in the dark about the latest condition of her health. "It may create misunderstanding. Sheikh Hasina may assume that we have lost interest in her medical treatment," he said. Medicines specialist ABM Abdullah, also a long-term physician for Hasina, echoed Modasser. The two doctors were kept out of the new medical board. Modasser said he was not allowed to see Hasina when he went to Square Hospital Wednesday, and also complained that he had not been informed by jail authorities either why he was "denied access" to Hasina. The physician questioned a statement by Square Hospital that Hasina was "satisfied with the new panel of doctors". Modasser said: "I wonder how come Sheikh Hasina who had always preferred her personal physicians to other doctors for any medical examination put faith in the doctors of Square Hospital overnight." Meanwhile, the Awami League sent a letter to the Chief Adviser's Office with an appeal for unconditional release of Hasina for medical treatment in the US. In another development, a Dhaka magistrate ordered the police to return the passport of Hasina, who was arrested on July 16 last year. Hasina's lawyer Shahara Khatun said the former prime minister needed the passport back to travel abroad for medical treatment. bdnews2
