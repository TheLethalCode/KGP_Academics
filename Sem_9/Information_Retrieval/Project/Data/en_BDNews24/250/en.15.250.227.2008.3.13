 NAIROBI, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations' special envoy to Somalia said on Thursday he would try to set up peace talks between the government and its opponents to end a 15-month insurgency in the Horn of Africa nation. The government appealed again this week for its foes, who include Islamists kicked out of power at the end of 2006 after a brief rule of south Somalia, to join in talks.

"As requested by the Somali parties, I will assume the leadership role and will contact all sides to propose the timing and modalities for future discussions," he added in a statement. But analysts believe it is unlikely Islamist-led insurgents, many of whom view their attacks on the Western-backed government as a jihad or holy war, could be persuaded to join. And an Eritrean-based alliance of Somali opposition groups -- made up of former parliamentarians, Islamists and some members of the foreign diaspora -- is insisting Ethiopian troops withdraw before talks. Ethiopia sent thousands of soldiers into Somalia in late 2006 to help the government, virtually encircled in the town of Baidoa, topple Somalia's Islamic Courts Council which had ruled most of the south from Mogadishu since the middle of that year. The scattered Islamist fighters regrouped and have waged an Iraq-style insurgency. At least 7,000 people have died, and hundreds of thousands been displaced, creating what aid workers call one of the world's worst yet most ignored humanitarian crises. Ould-Abdallah, who works from Nairobi due to insecurity in Mogadishu, said civil society organisations and Somalis in the diaspora were eager to join reconciliation discussio
