 GULU, Uganda, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lillian Akwero and her friends lived through some of Uganda's worst violence, fleeing rebel attacks in which their relatives were kidnapped or killed and villages torched. Now that their lives are about making ends meet rather than basic survival, their hope is that a deal to ensure lasting peace will not be wrecked by the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against rebel leaders for savage atrocities. "The ICC is scaring the rebels. We are worried as they might just change their mind and attack us again," cries Akwero above the whirr of sewing machines in the tailor's shop she and her friends set up in Gulu, home to many refugees from the two-decade war with Lord's Resistance Army rebels. "They should get rid of this ICC," Grace, another friend, pitched in. "They (the rebels) are our brothers and they should come home so we can forgive each other." The arrest warrants against elusive rebel leader Joseph Kony and two deputies are the last sticking point before the rebels will sign a final agreement. They are accused over war crimes in a conflict marked by the killing of civilians, mutilation and the kidnapping of children. Although it was Uganda's government that initially asked the international court to investigate Kony, it has agreed with the rebels to seek justice through a combination of the High Court and traditional systems, known as "Mato Oput". President Yoweri Museveni has said they could avoid prison. For the International Criminal Court, based at The Hague, the situation poses a real dilemma -- whether it might scupper peace by upholding its arrest warrants, or set a dangerous precedent by dropping the charges. MATO OPUT The prosecutor has said charges will not be dropped unless ICC judges decide that is the best solution. That depends on Uganda putting in a request. The court would also want to look at the kind of trial the rebels might face at home. "A lot depends on the rigour and the oversight of the national justice system," said an international human rights expert, who asked to remain anonymous. "We are not sure yet how they will even choose who will be tried and who will go through Mato Oput," the expert added. Putting the rebels through the traditional justice system would suit Akwero and her friends. Like many in the north, they are by no means supporters of the rebels after their suffering. But they are desperate for lasting peace. They believe justice can be served by encouraging rebels to ask for forgiveness, pay compensation and then take part in a reconciliation ceremony in which all parties share a bitter cocktail of herbs and sheep's blood. In the opposition-leaning north, many believe the government has also neglected them and should be held accountable for failing to protect them during the war years. "To me, if we are talking about court, both parties should be taken to court," said Obita Leodjellic, a local government official in a camp for displaced people in Amuru, 60 km (40 miles) west of Gulu. Now that relative peace has returned, he believes it less important to try the rebels than to fight HIV/AIDS, help people recover from the trauma of the conflict, resolve land conflicts and improve health and education. "These are the wars that we should fight," he sa
