 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com) -- The committee tasked with reviewing law and order in the country Thursday termed the overall situation as "positive", although it expressed its concern over a spate of 17 murders that took place in the capital in March alone. Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner Naim Ahmed was asked at the committee's monthly meeting at the home ministry to ensure a speedy investigation and trial of those guilty of the murders. Home adviser MA Matin and home secretary Abdul Karim declined to talk to reporters following the meeting, although an official at the ministry said the US State Department's report on human rights in Bangladesh had been discussed. The grenade attack on the Awami League rally on August 21, 2004 was also discussed by the committee, said the official. The meeting was told that the investigation into the August 21 attack was now in its final stages. The committee also discussed the killings of former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria and former vice-chancellor of National University Prof Aftab Ahmed. "Police officials informed the meeting about a letter sent to the Interpol and the FBI seeking their assistance in further investigations into the Kibria killing, following demands from his family," said the official. "However, the meeting was not told if any replies to the letters had been received," the official said. The official added that the committee was told the investigation into Prof Aftab Ahmed's murder had not made significant progress. "However, after the arrest of a top terror suspect known as Imon, some progress has been made in the case," said the official. bdnew
