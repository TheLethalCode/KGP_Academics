<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will look to extend the partnership between Tim Ambrose and Paul Collingwood for at least an hour into the second day of the second test to put pressure on New Zealand, England coach Peter Moores said. Ambrose was three runs short of his first test century while Collingwood was on 48, and their 155-run unbroken partnership helped guide England to 291 for five at stumps of the first day at the Basin Reserve. England had slumped to 136 for five just before tea on Thursday, but the sixth-wicket partnership ensured the day's play ended in the balance. "It looks like a good cricket wicket and will do a little bit," Moores told reporters. "If you get in and make partnerships you will score, but runs are going to be at a premium. "What we are trying to do now is put ourselves into a position where we can really start to put some pressure on the New Zealand batsman when they bat in their first innings." Moores praised Ambrose and said he expected the wicketkeeper to push on to his century when play resumed on Friday. "He has played really well and he's not finished yet," Moores said of the 25-year-old, who is playing in only his second test. "I think he will be very pleased with the way he has played and that he has put us in a much stronger position. "I think he'll also be thinking, if we can extend this partnership for the first hour, then that position will be stronger in the game." POSITIVE APPROACH New Zealand's Jacob Oram, who was the pick of the home side's bowlers with two for 25 from 22 overs, said it was noticeable England had adopted a more positive approach than the first test, which they lost. "I thought they came out and played a very different game, Cook and Vaughan set the tone, a lot more shots, we found it hard to pull them back and keep the run-rate down," said Oram. Oram, who sparked a top-order collapse after lunch with two quick wickets, added the afternoon session was the best for the New Zealand bowlers and they should have forced the issue. "We put the ball consistently in the right areas, made them play a lot (and) miss a lot," said Oram. "(But) if you put a side in on day one you're trying to bowl them out as early as possible, and at 290 for five you have to question whether you are happy with that. "That middle session we were right on course but they got away in that final session.
