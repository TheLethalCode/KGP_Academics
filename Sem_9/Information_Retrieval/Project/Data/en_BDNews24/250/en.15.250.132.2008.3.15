 Beijing, March 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's parliament re-elected Hu Jintao as president on Saturday and gave next generation leader Xi Jinping a five-year mandate as vice-president. The National People's Congress, or parliament, re-elected Hu as president with 2,956 votes for, three against and five abstentions. Xi, who catapulted to the top echelon of power and joined the Communist Party's nine-member Politburo Standing Committee last October, collected 2,919 votes with 28 against and 17 abstentions. Hu, who doubles as Party chief, was also re-elected chairman of the state Central Military Commission with 2,959 votes, four against and four abstentions. The president will nominate a premier, who is widely expected to be endorsed by the rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday.
