 Tirana, March 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 150 people were wounded by an explosion at an Albanian army base on the outskirts of the capital Tirana, officials said on Saturday. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said the blast probably took place while ammunition was being dismantled at the base. "The explosions are continuing. We have sent helicopters...to evacuate nearby residents. It is a problem because the highway is blocked," Berisha said on Albanian television.
