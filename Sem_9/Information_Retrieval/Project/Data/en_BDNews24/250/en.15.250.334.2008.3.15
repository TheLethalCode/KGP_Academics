<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was admitted to Square Hospital, is under intensive observation, a doctor said Saturday Square Hospital's Prof Sanwar Hossain, heading a 'physicians' panel' formed to treat Hasina, told reporters that Hasina was doing well. "She has been kept under intensive observation and her physical condition is now stable," said Prof Sanwar. The doctor added that Hasina was receiving her treatment in phases and the Awami League chief may have to stay in the hospital for another week. "No decision has yet been taken about treating Sheikh Hasina's ear complaint," he said. Regarding Hasina's personal physicians being denied access to their patient, Prof Sanwar said: "We did not invite them, neither did we prevent them. In any case Sheikh Hasina is a detainee and the matter is for the jail authorities to settle." Earlier in the day, the inspector general of prisons said the former prime minister was 'doing fine'. IG of prisons Brig Gen Md Zakir Hassan and deputy inspector general of prisons Maj Shamsul Haider Siddiqui visited Hasina at the hospital at around 10:30 am, staying until around 1:00 pm. The IG of prisons said Hasina's personal physicians had previously attended their patient and would have access to her in the future if necessary. "Doctors at Square Hospital are currently watching her as she is admitted there," said Hassan. He said a number of physicians were added to the 'physicians' panel' for examining Hasina, but he was not aware if any doctor had been excluded. Hassan said he had no information on the matter of sending Hasina abroad for treatment. On the former prime minister's ear treatment, he said: "The medical authorities did not say that they would not be able to provide necessary treatment for her ear complaint." It was one doctor's personal opinion that Hasina could not receive the treatment here in Bangladesh, the IG of prisons stressed. Dr MH Millat, one of the seven doctors of the physicians' panel formed by the Square Hospital authorities, told bdnews24.com Thursday that Hasina's health condition was better except for ear and eye complaints. The detained Awami League chief has problems with her vision, as she is suffering from glaucoma and pressure behind the eye, her personal physicians say. She is also suffering total hearing loss in one ear and the hearing ability in another ear is seriously impaired, according to her doctors. Hasina was admitted to Square Hospital from special jail on Tuesday. bdnews24.com/lh/
