<TITLE> Merkel aims to boost Irish EU treaty `Yes` vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brussels, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's Angela Merkel will visit Dublin next month in a bid to boost the "Yes" vote in Ireland's upcoming referendum on the European Union's new reform treaty, Irish foreign minister Dermot Ahern said on Thursday. The German Chancellor will travel to Dublin on April 14th to deliver a keynote speech in favour of the treaty, which replaces the EU constitution rejected by Dutch and French voters in 2005. Ireland is the only country within the 27-member bloc holding a vote on the matter, and rejection could topple the whole project, designed to end years of wrangling over reform of the bloc's institutions. Opinion polls show that more than half of potential voters are still undecided. But French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- who had previously been invited to the Irish capital -- is not expected to take up the offer, Ahern said. "The exact details have yet to be ironed out, but April 14th is the date agreed," Ahern told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. He said Merkel will speak at a meeting of Ireland's National Forum on Europe, and it is hoped she will address both the upper and lower houses of parliament, known as the Dail and Seanad. "She is a straight talking, plain speaker and an impressive and formidable politician," he said. Ahern said there would be "no shackles" placed on Merkel in response to fears of some in the "Yes" camp that interference from outside the country could damage their campaign. Merkel will also attend a meeting of leaders from the conservative European People's Party, home to her own political party and Sarkozy's UMP party on the same day in Dublin. But the French president will be absent from that meeting. One EU diplomat said is presence in the predominately Catholic country may not be as welcome as Merkel in the light of his two divorces and outspoken nature. "Sarkozy's personal profile combined with his reputation for saying what he really feels would not go down too well in Dublin," the envoy said. Ahern said his government had evidence that some political parties from outside Ireland opposed to the treaty, notably in Britain, were giving funds and assistance to the "No" campaign. "As far as the government is concerned we intend to lead a clean, transparent campaign," Ahern said. Despite appeals from many opponents of the treaty in Ireland to stay away, Eurosceptics such as France's far-right activist Jean Marie Le Pen have said they intend to travel to Ireland during the referendum campaign. In 2001 Irish voters rejected the Nice Treaty designed to enable EU enlargement, forcing the government to hold a second vote that was widely criticised as undemocratic at the time. A second vote is unlikely to be an option in 2008.
