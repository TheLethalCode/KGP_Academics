<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spending four days playing for New Zealand first class side Auckland helped James Anderson discover his rhythm straight away on the second day of the second test against New Zealand, the recalled bowler said. Anderson, who was not picked for the first test in Hamilton and released from the England squad to play for Auckland against Wellington in New Zealand's domestic competition, took five for 73 to help bowl New Zealand out for 198 on Friday. England were four without loss in their second innings, an overall lead of 148 with three days remaining. Anderson's haul almost fulfilled a prophecy made by Cricket Wellington chief executive Gavin Larsen, who suggested the Auckland match would bowl Anderson back into form and he would then take seven wickets at the Basin Reserve. "(It was) a chance to show them how I'm bowling in a game situation," Anderson told reporters of the game last week, in which he took 2-95 and bowled 38 overs. "Often it's difficult because you can bowl well in nets but it's never the same. I saw it as an opportunity. "(I) thought I bowled well, swung the ball nicely and got a fair few overs under my belt. "I felt good in the spells I bowled, it was a flat pitch and hard work. I enjoyed it... (it was) quite refreshing. "I definitely think it helps. "I've been on quite a few tours now and spent them bringing drinks on and bowling in the middle at a stump. "You can't beat match practice." HELPFUL CONDITIONS Anderson added the grass-tinged Basin Reserve pitch had also played into his hands, allowing him to get the ball to seam, while the overcast conditions also allowed it to swing. "Obviously (to) come to a wicket like this that's helping you, your eyes light up a bit. "I found my rhythm from ball one which helps, and we saw from their innings, if you put the ball in the right areas often enough the pitch was going to help. "I think we pretty much all did that." New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum said his side were not concerned about Anderson being allowed to play for a domestic side while on an international tour. "We weren't too worried," McCullum said. "There's nothing you can do about it. I don't think he got too many wickets. He saved them up for this test," he added laughing. "He is a quality bowler and when he has a wicket that is conducive to where he likes to land a ball, he was always going to be tough to play. "I thought he was brilliant. We didn't play him as well as we could have but in saying that I'll take nothing away from the way he bowled.
