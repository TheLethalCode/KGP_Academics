<TITLE> Goalkeeper Foster to make Manchester United debut </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, England, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Goalkeeper Ben Foster will play his first game for Manchester United on Saturday almost three years after signing for the club, manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday. The 24-year-old will make his debut at bottom club Derby County because Edwin van der Sar has a groin injury and Tomasz Kuszczak is suspended following his sending off in last Saturday's FA Cup defeat against Portsmouth. "He's been out for a year and with only one reserve game behind him then it's a big challenge for the boy but there are certain things that encourage me about it," Ferguson told reporters. "He has a fantastic presence and such speed and agility that I have no fears he will be okay. He has so many assets that I am confident about it." Foster, who has been capped once by England, was signed by United for one million pounds ($2.03 million) from Stoke City in July 2005 then loaned to Watford for the next two seasons to give him first-team experience. He played 29 Premier League games last season but underwent surgery on a knee injury on his return to Old Trafford and was out of action until last month. Louis Saha is also likely to return to the United squad after pulling out of the defeat by Portsmouth with a knee problem. That result ended United's hopes of a domestic double but Ferguson's side will return to the top of the table, for a few hours at least, if they beat Derby who have not won a league game since last September. "It's going to be very close this season and could even go to the last game. To give yourselves a proper chance you have to have a good consistency and that's what's going to win it.
