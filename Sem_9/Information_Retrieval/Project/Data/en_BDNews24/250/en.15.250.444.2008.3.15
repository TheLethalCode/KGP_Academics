<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian designer drew inspiration from actor James Dean's life -- and death -- at fashion week in New Delhi, paying tribute to the Hollywood star of the 1950s who died in a car accident at the age of 24. Beginning with the red jacket and jeans that Dean wore in his most celebrated movie, "Rebel Without A Cause," Prashant Verma's collection also unveiled dresses made in taffeta with kaleidoscopic prints, biker jackets and hand-painted artwork.

Verma, who named his collection "Giant" like Dean's last movie that was released posthumously, is among 80 designers showcasing autumn and winter collections on the ramp or in stalls at the five-day Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week, which opened this week. Golden-hued statues of bulls, lotuses and temple tops vied for attention with an Indian classical dancer who twirled down the runway to the sound of old Bollywood hits for designer Tarun Tahiliani's show in the evening on Thursday. Tahiliani sent out models in silken saris, gowns and dresses in shades of red, black and gold -- some embellished with belts made up of tiny LED screens. Some of his creations also made a mark off the ramp.
