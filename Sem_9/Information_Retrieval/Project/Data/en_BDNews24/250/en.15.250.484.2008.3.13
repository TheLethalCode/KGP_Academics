 Tokyo, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese stocks slid more than 3 percent as the dollar hit a 12-year low against the yen, with Honda Motor Corp and other exporters extending earlier losses made on growing fears of a US recession. "Before we knew it the dollar had fallen a full yen, which of course had an inevitable impact, especially on exporters," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. The dollar slid more than 1 percent on the day to lows near 100.20 yen the lowest since late 1995, heightening concern that a more robust Japanese currency will eat into corporate profits earned abroad. Bank shares also dragged the market down, with Japan's three largest banks erasing hefty gains from the previous session on growing doubts about the Federal Reserve's efforts to aid strained credit markets and limit the damage to the US economy. The market has also been hurt by the political deadlock over the appointment of a new governor for the Bank of Japan. Opposition lawmakers vetoed Toshiro Muto, the government's pick for central bank governor, on Wednesday, leaving it with no successor to Toshihiko Fukui a week before he retires. "This can't be quantified in numbers, but it does give the impression of national weakness and a sense that it's inevitable that Japanese stocks are not being bought," Okamoto added. At 0423 GMT the benchmark Nikkei was down 3.1 percent at 12,464.12, approaching the two-and-a-half-year low it hit on Tuesday. The broader TOPIX was down 3.2 percent at 1,214.65. Honda Motor fell 5.2 percent to 2,910 yen and Toyota Motor Corp lost 4.1 percent to 5,190 yen. No.1 lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed 7.1 percent to 842 yen, and No.2 Mizuho Financial Group fell 7.1 percent to 384,000 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group tumbled 7.4 percent to 677,000 yen.
