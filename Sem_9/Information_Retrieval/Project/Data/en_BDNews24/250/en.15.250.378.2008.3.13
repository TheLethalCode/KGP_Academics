 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin made a brief stopover in London Wednesday on his way to the Senegalese capital of Dakar to attend an OIC summit, the Bangladesh High Commission in London said. On his arrival at Heathrow Airport, the chief adviser was received by Bangladesh High Commissioner Shafi U Ahmed, the high commission said in a statement. Fakhruddin left London later the same day for Dakar, where he will lead the Bangladesh delegation to the OIC summit on March 14-15. He is accompanied by press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim and other officials. Fakhruddin left Dhaka Tuesday night to join the summit of the world's biggest Islamic body seeking to rebrand itself this week as a forum for settling conflicts peacefully and for redistributing wealth to the world's poorest states. The CA is set to join hands with leaders of the 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference to fight 'Islamophobia', one of the issues on the OIC's agenda. On the sidelines of the Dakar summit, the chief adviser is likely to hold bilateral talks with several heads of state of the member-countries. Foreign Minister Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury is already in Senegal to attend the OIC Foreign Ministers' meeting preceding the summit.
