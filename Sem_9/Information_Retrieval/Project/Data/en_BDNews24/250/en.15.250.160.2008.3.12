 VIENNA, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA president Michel Platini said on Wednesday he was confident Spain would play at Euro 2008 but that it was up to FIFA to resolve a row with the government that could cost them their place. FIFA President Sepp Blatter warned Spain last month that the government's attempt to force the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) to hold elections early this year contravened its strict rules on the sport's freedom from government interference. The penalty for such interference could see the Spanish national team barred from international tournaments like Euro 2008, and the clubs kicked out of the Champions League and UEFA Cup. "I can give two different answers on this," Platini told a news conference. "Firstly, it's FIFA's problem, it's not UEFA's problem. It has to do with the FIFA statutes. "FIFA will have to take a decision in due course, and it will be discussed at the next executive committee meeting in Zurich this week. "But I can also say we're glad to have Spain, a great footballing country, and I'm convinced that Spain will play at Euro 2008 and everything will be fine." The Spanish government, through the Sports Council, has told all sporting federations not involved in the Olympics to hold elections in the first quarter of 2008 -- before August's Beijing Games. This month, the RFEF and its president, Angel Maria Villar, disregarded the ruling at a general assembly and agreed to hold a new election by Nov. 26. Platini was speaking ahead of a workshop for the 16 teams participating in Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland in June. Spain have sent a full eight-member delegation to the workshop
