 MILAN, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini now wants stay at the Serie A champions having stated on Tuesday he would quit at the end of the season, club president Massimo Moratti has said. Mancini, who has four years left on his contract, made the surprise announcement at a news conference after Tuesday's Champions League last-16 defeat by Liverpool. However, the 43-year-old looks set to stay on following talks with Moratti. "I hope that everyone can understand the outpourings and bitterness in such delicate moments as these. After the match it was Roberto Mancini the coach who spoke from his heart," Mancini said in a statement on Wednesday. "I thank president Massimo Moratti for giving me strength, understanding the situation and understanding me. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding. "The team already knows that we're ready to fight until the last minute, and with great intensity, to win our third scudetto and to try to win the Champions League next season." Mancini's statement did not say he would be staying for the long term but Moratti said his desire was to fulfil his contract. "I have had a little chat with Mancini in which he stressed to me that he wants to remain at Inter also next year and for the whole duration of his contract and that next season he wants to win the Champions League," Moratti told reporters. Mancini gave no reasons for his decision to quit on Tuesday and Moratti said he had no idea why the coach made the outburst only to state his desire to stay a day later. Moratti had expected to talk with his coach on Thursday but the meeting was brought forward following a day of shock and confusion within Italy's soccer fraternity. MOURINHO LINKED Mancini, in charge since 2004, took training as usual on Wednesday. Moratti said he hoped the saga would not affect Inter, six points clear in Serie A. "The team, the club, he himself and the fans don't deserve a situation that could destabilise the environment. So let's stay strong and do well," he added. Former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho had been installed as the media's favourite to take over if Mancini stood by his decision. Earlier this term Italian media said Moratti had held talks with Mourinho but the club and the Portuguese denied it. Some media have said the reports upset Mancini and could be a reason for his behaviour. However, it appears the disappointment at going out in the Champion League first knockout round for a second straight season was the major factor
