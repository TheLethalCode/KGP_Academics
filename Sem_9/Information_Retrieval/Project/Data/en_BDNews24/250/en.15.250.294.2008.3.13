<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13(bdnews24.com)Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said Thursday the commission has relaxed the conditions necessary for political parties to register in its redrafting of election laws. Corrected "We have relaxed the conditions for the registration of political parties in the redrafted electoral reform law," Sakhawat told reporters at his office. "Now a political party will be required to have branch offices only in 21 districts and 100 upazilas," he said. A condition of registration in the previous electoral reform draft had stated that a political party would be required to have had at least one seat in the last parliament, or branch offices in at least 32 districts and 200 upazilas. Earlier in the day, Kalyan Party chairman Muhammd Ibrahim met with the election commissioners. Commissioner Sakhawat said it had not been possible for the EC to sit in dialogue with all political parties. "Therefore meetings may be held with any party outside of the dialogues," he said. The commissioner said the most recent draft of the electoral reform law was handed to the Kalyan Party and they would wait for written feedback from the party. Sakhawat said he hoped the caretaker government would introduce indoor politics throughout the country following the chief adviser's dialogue with the political parties. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda met the chief adviser last month, and asked him to introduce indoor politics ahead of the city corporation and municipal elections slated for April. The CEC also asked the chief adviser for a withdrawal or relaxation of the state of emergency. Kalyan Party chairman Muhammad Ibrahim told reporters following the meeting that they had proposed holding the upazila elections prior to the parliamentary election, or to have them held simultaneously. bdnew
