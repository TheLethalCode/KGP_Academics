 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)Two candidates to the post of FBCCI president criticised the federation Saturday for not effectively discharging its duties. The comments came ahead of the biennial election to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries' managing council, scheduled for Monday. The president and vice-presidents are to be elected Wednesday. Former BGMEA president and FBCCI presidential candidate Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com Saturday that the apex body for businessmen had a responsibility to prepare short-term, mid-term and long-term economic policies. "These must be made effective through negotiations with the government and different international agencies," said Huq. "However, the FBCCI is not properly equipped to discharge those responsibilities. It needs a very effective council, which would strengthen the organisation and allow it to rise above personal interests," he said. MA Rouf Chowdhury, another candidate for the top post of the federation, and president of the Bangladesh Edible Oil Refinery Association, told bdnews24.com that the FBCCI could play a stronger role in the future than it had done. "It could take a greater initiative to bargain with the government on different business community interests and play a more active role in policy making and implementation," said Chowdhury. The businessman said the FBCCI had failed to do this due to institutional weakness, a lack of finance and weak presidential vision. An FBCCI election official said there are 22 candidates in the association group and 27 candidates in the chamber group. The official said there were 1536 voters in both groups combined. bdnew
