 HOUSTON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US space shuttle Endeavour docked safely at the International Space Station on Wednesday on a mission to deliver the first section of an elaborate Japanese space laboratory. Endeavour, which lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Tuesday, was inspected for launch damage en route to the orbiting outpost and looked to be in good shape, NASA officials said. A close look at the ship's heat shield using a robot arm equipped with laser and cameras turned up no obvious damage from the launch, although NASA said debris or a bird may have struck the nose as it rose from the launch pad. "My untrained eye says, first cut through, everything looked fine," flight director Mike Moses told reporters at Johnson Space Center. NASA experts will study the inspection video to make sure there are no trouble spots in the heat shield, he said. Images from the night launch showed something that appeared to collide with Endeavour's nose 10 seconds after it lifted off from the seaside launch pad. When asked if it might have been a bird, Moses said, "It's certainly a possibility, I can't even begin to speculate what it might be." He said at that point in the flight, Endeavour was not going fast enough to do much damage. In-flight heat shield inspections were begun after shuttle Columbia disintegrated while returning to Earth in 2003, killing the seven astronauts on board. An investigation found that insulating foam flew off the fuel tank during launch, struck the wing and damaged the heat shield, which caused Columbia to break apart during the fiery descent into the atmosphere. During what is scheduled to be a 12-day station stay, the shuttle's seven-man crew will install the first part of Japan's Kibo laboratory and a new Canadian-built robotic system called Dextre for detailed work on the station exterior. Kibo, which means "hope" in English, is Japan's primary contribution to the $100 billion station, which is a project of 15 countries. About the size of a double-decker bus, it will be the station's largest lab when its assembly is completed next year. NASA is aiming to finish the space station, now 60 percent built, before the space shuttle fleet is retired in 20
