<TITLE> HSBC eyes more deals in Asia, keen on India </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - HSBC continues to look at acquisition opportunities across Asia and wants a "substantially bigger footprint" in India when regulators allow, hopefully in 2009, the head of its Asian business said. Sandy Flockhart, CEO of HSBC's Asian operations, said on Thursday that regulators restricted its ability to make acquisitions in many countries, while the prices of potential targets in the region had not fallen significantly during recent financial turmoil. "We'd like to be significantly larger in India and we hope in 2009 that opportunity will come," Flockhart said, referring to regulatory restrictions there on overseas banks. "Scale does help," he said, adding that being one of India's top four banks "would be a good place to be". Europe's biggest bank is increasing its focus on Asia and other emerging markets as growth in those countries is expected to outpace western economies this year and beyond. Its strong capital position -- despite bad debts jumping to $17 billion last year after hits from its U.S. subprime housing exposure -- could see it take advantage of opportunities for distressed or low valued assets. But Flockhart said valuations had held up as most Asian banks continued to perform well. "Have prices got markedly lower? No they haven't," he said at a briefing for reporters. The U.S. housing crisis and subsequent credit crunch in financial markets has so far had a more modest impact on Asia's economic growth than elsewhere, aided by less reliance there on U.S. exports than in the past and more inter-regional trading, but the area is not immune to the problems. "If the U.S. has a more prolonged slowdown then there's going to be a knock-on effect into Asia," Flockhart said, but said the scale of impact would be hard to gauge before mid-year. AFRICA GROWTH HSBC will also expand in Africa, but possibly slowly, by opening branches to get to know the countries. "Then we'd have to see if any opportunities came up that might interest us," Flockhart said. "As an emerging markets bank it's a logical place to be." HSBC operates across 83 countries, but has a smaller presence in Africa than rivals such as Barclays or Standard Chartered. The bank will increase its stake in Bank of Communications (BoCom), China's fifth largest lender, to 19.9 percent from its current holding of 19.1 percent, at "an appropriate time", Flockhart said. Overseas banks are restricted to less than 20 percent holdings in Chinese banks, although HSBC has an option to increase its BoCom stake to 40 percent before 2012, but that is subject to regulatory approval. Flockhart declined to comment on reports HSBC is one of three banks still in the race to buy a 42 percent stake in Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII), valued at over $800 million. HSBC is also seeking to buy a $6.3 billion controlling stake in Korea Exchange Bank, but final approval hinges on authorities there resolving legal disputes with stakeowner Lone Star by the end of April. Flockhart said that is an issue for regulators there, and declined to say whether it would seek an extension if the deal hasn't been cleared by that deadline. "We have to wait and see what the authorities there say," he sa
