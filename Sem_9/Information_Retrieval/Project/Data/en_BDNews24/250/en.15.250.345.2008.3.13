 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government Thursday cancelled a programme of the Sector Commanders Forum scheduled for March 15, citing security worries. The announcement came from a rushed press conference at the police commissioner's office Thursday. DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed said the Sector Commanders Forum applied to the home secretary on Jan 14 for permission to hold a discussion and cultural function at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on March 15 to mark Independence Day. The application stated that sector commanders, sub-sector commanders, noted freedom fighters and respected citizens would show their respect to the martyrs of 1971. The application added that the programme is a non-political event. "Though the application mentioned discussions and a cultural function, a review of the invitation letter revealed that the programme has been organised with the aim of making a demand initiating the trials of war criminals," Naim said. The police commissioner said although the application mentioned a discussion and cultural function, the invitation letter did not. Naim said the apparent inconsistency between the application and the invitation letter and fears over possible public unrest had resulted in the event's cancellation. "There has been no verbal communication with the applicants, but we will do whatever is necessary to maintain law and order if they gather there despite the programme's cancellation," he added. bdnew
