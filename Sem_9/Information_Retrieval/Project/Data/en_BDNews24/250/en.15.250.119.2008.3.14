<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Friday the West's Islamophobia was "devoid of reason" and "unjust". In his address to the OIC summit in the Senegalese capital of Dakar on its concluding day, Fakhruddin said Islam and terrorism were "incompatible and absolutely irreconcilable" and urged the Islamic countries to counter the apprehensions. Fakhruddin proposed forming a common Islamic market for deeper economic cooperation among the Islamic nations. "We see around us a world enveloped in an irrational fear of Islam. This Islamophobia is devoid of reason, without cause. It is unjust and unfair. It must stop," Fakhruddin told the summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. "We must do the needful to counter these apprehensions. "We must nullify those fears by our explanations to the world of the positive values of Islam. We must paint to them what Islam stands for," the chief adviser said. Fakhruddin stressed the need for increasing economic cooperation among the OIC members. "Let us move towards closer economic integration. Let us examine in greater depth the possibilities of our Islamic Common Market," he said. "Trade among Islamic nations should be so designed for all, even the poorest amongst us, to profit from". As chair of the group of the LDCs, many of whom are in Africa, Bangladesh would call for a special OIC Programme of Action for the Ummah's neediest, he said. Fakhruddin said the present-day problems are compounded by manifold adversities and Palestine is an example. "It continues to bleed. There is no end in sight to its sorrows. Gazans continue to perish as Israel expands its aggression," he said. "There can be no solution to the problems of Palestine without a free, sovereign, and independent state for their people, with Jerusalem as its capital. "We would urge upon the international community, the United Nations, and equally the Quartet to exert pressure on Israel to bring this about," he said. Fakhruddin said the Iraqis should take control of their own country to save the Islamic civilisation. The OIC summit started in Senegal Thursday. bdn
