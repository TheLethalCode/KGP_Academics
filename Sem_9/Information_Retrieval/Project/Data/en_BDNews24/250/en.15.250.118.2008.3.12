 LONDON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British economic growth is expected to slow this year but the likelihood of a recession remains slim if the Bank of England makes the three more cuts to rates expected this year, a Reuters poll showed. The monthly poll of around 60 economists, taken March 7-12, showed economic growth at 1.8 percent in 2008, in line with a February poll, then picking up slightly to 1.9 percent in 2009, down from February's prediction of 2.1 percent growth. This is also a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent predicted for 2007 but the chance of a recession is low, with a median forecast giving only a 25 percent chance it will occur in the next 12 months, up two points from February's poll. "We believe the UK economy is probably heading for a slowdown rather than a meltdown," said John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Most economists define recession as two consecutive quarters of contracting gross domestic product (GDP). Chancellor Alistair Darling cut growth forecasts for GDP to a range of 1.75-2.25 percent from the 2.0-2.5 percent he predicted in October, while ramping up government borrowing estimates in his maiden budget on Wednesday. In a separate poll, economists forecast a median 60 percent chance of a recession in the United States, even though the Federal Reserve has slashed 225 points from interest rates since September and another 100 points in cuts are expected. On Tuesday central banks from around the world took co-ordinated action by pumping billions of dollars into the financial system to inject liquidity and ease concern about the deepening credit crisis and an impending U.S. recession. Economies across the globe have been in turmoil from a credit crisis that started with subprime mortgage problems in the United States and has since spread across other markets. INTEREST RATE CUTS The Bank of England cut rates by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent in February after cutting them in December for the first time in over two years and is expected to take a more gradual easing path than the Fed. Median forecasts predict the Bank Rate will fall to 5.0 percent by June, drop again to 4.75 percent by September and then again to 4.5 by year-end, where it will stay until at least September next year. This is unchanged from a Feb. 28 poll. A cut in the second quarter is almost certain, with all 56 of the economists who gave a view on rates predicting at least a 25 basis point cut by June. The BoE signalled in its February quarterly Inflation Report that rates would not fall as sharply as markets were predicting as inflation was expected to be around 3.0 percent by mid-year. Policymakers are mandated to target consumer price inflation at 2.0 percent and are juggling a slowing economy with rising price pressures. "We continue to believe that a cut in May is more likely, as the Monetary Policy Committee treads a difficult path between inflation and growth risks," said George Johns, an economist at Barclays Capital. Economists polled by Reuters forecast inflation at 2.4 percent in 2008 before settling on target at 2.0 percent in 2009, unchanged from February's forecast. Oil and food prices have been soaring while a weaker pound against the euro has made imports more expensive, but the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said on Tuesday that housing housing market sentiment had its worst spill since the market crash of the early 1990s. Darling said he saw inflation at 2.5 percent in 2008, before dropping back to 2.0 percent next year. The finance minister said duty on alcohol would rise by six percent above the inflation rate while he delayed a planned rise in fuel du
