 Geneva, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it wanted to see faster progress in negotiations on North Korea's nuclear activities after a day of what it termed substantive talks with the secretive communist state. "I made clear to the DPRK (North Korea) delegation today that we need to pick up the pace," U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said after meeting leading North Korean official Kim Kwe-Gwan in Geneva. "We are already in March and we have some ambitions for trying to get through this in 2008. There is no question we need to move faster," Hill told a midnight news conference. "We had very substantive discussions on format and actual substance that has divided us for 10 weeks," he said. Hill said all issues had been discussed, including questions of enriched uranium, the provision of humanitarian aid and heavy fuel oil to North Korea, and dropping the country from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. He declined to be more specific, saying he still had to brief U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and that Kim also had to report back to his capital. It was not clear whether the two men would meet again on Friday before Hill heads to Poland. North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear programme under a 2005 agreement but the deal has been stalled by Pyongyang's failure to produce a detailed declaration of its nuclear projects by the end of last year. A highly enriched uranium programme would give North Korea a second source of nuclear-bomb making fissile material in addition to its plutonium-based nuclear facilities. "MOST SUBSTANTIVE" Hill said the talks had been the "most substantive" on how to proceed since difficulties arose in early December. "Our hope is that we can achieve what we need which is a declaration which will be concrete and correct and that the declaration will be provided to the Chinese as the chair of the six-party process," said Hill. Under the second phase of the so-called "denuclearisation" deal, North Korea committed itself to disabling its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, where it has produced plutonium, and to make the declaration. In return, the other parties to the accord -- South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States -- agreed to provide up to 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or its equivalent. Washington wants North Korea to give up its atomic activities, any weapons and related materials before U.S. President George W. Bush leaves office next January. Its demands for full disclosure have clashed with Pyongyang's reluctance to discuss any transfers of nuclear technology to other nations, notably Syria, as well as its suspected pursuit of uranium enrichment. "We are trying to get ready for making that progress, that is for getting to phase 3 (which) would mean a six-party meeting for sure," said Hill. "But I'm not prepared to say that this has paved the way and that this will be a cake walk. "The DPRK has maintained a position on uranium enrichment that we have really had to challenge and work with them on. So I am not in a position to say whether we've resolved that, except I think we made some progress today." A senior U.S. official said this week he believed North Korea would be comfortable with disclosing the proliferation and uranium-related activities in a separate, secret document. Analysts had said this could help North Korea save face. The United States has questions about any possible North Korean role in a suspected Syrian covert nuclear site that was bombed by Israel in September. Syria has denied having a nuclear programme but the case remains murky. There has been significant progress in disabling Yongbyon but North Korea has slowed down the process in recent months, arguing the others have delayed keeping their end of the deal.
