 JERUSALEM, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US general overseeing Israeli and Palestinian compliance with the long-stalled peace "road map" held his first three-way meeting on the plan on Friday but without Israel's defence minister in attendance. Israel has been bracing for unusually strong US criticism for not living up to its commitments under the "road map", particularly with regard to settlement building.

Fraser has submitted his first confidential report on road map implementation to Rice. The contents have been kept secret. US officials said ahead of Friday's meeting that Washington was not satisfied with the pace at which Israel was moving to implement the road map. Washington has been critical of Israel's decision to push ahead with settlement expansion on occupied land. "The United States considers the expansion of settlement activity to be not consistent with Israeli obligations under the road map and we have made that very clear. I have also said that it is certainly not helpful for the peace process," Rice told US lawmakers on Wednesday. Israel has likewise failed to uproot the unauthorised outposts in the West Bank. US officials said Washington believed the Palestinians needed to do more to meet their obligations to boost security and rein in militants in the West Bank, though US officials have privately complained to Israel that its frequent raids were undermining those effor
