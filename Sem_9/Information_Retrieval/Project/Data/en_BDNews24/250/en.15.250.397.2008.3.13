 BEIJING, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five political allies of Chinese President Hu Jintao were elected senior advisers to parliament on Thursday as he moved to further consolidate power. Hu, who doubles as Communist Party and military chief, has sought to shake off any lingering influence of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, during his second five-year term. The advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, endorsed Hu's nominations of the five men, confirming a Reuters story on Wednesday.

A vice-president of the Central Party School that grooms up-and-coming Communist officials, has said the advisory body would play a bigger role in domestic politics. The advisory body is composed of more than 2,000 members from all walks of life, including non-Communists, intellectuals, business and religious leaders, Taiwanese defectors, Hong Kong's elite, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, actors, singers and artists. The advisory body elected a total of 25 vice-chairmen. Newcomers included the wheelchair-bound son of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa and 98-year-old Tibetan Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who signed the 1951 surrender agreement, retained their posts as vice-chairm
