<TITLE> Cyprus leader warns Turks not to stick to UN plan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brussels, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus's new President Demetris Christofias said on Friday it would not be possible to make progress this month on restarting reunification talks if the Turkish side stuck to a UN settlement blueprint. Reunification talks stalled in 2004 when Greek Cypriots rejected the U.N. plan, which was accepted by the Turkish Cypriots. Christofias, attending his first European Union summit after being elected last month, said there had been statements from Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and Turkey that the Turkish-Cypriot side planned to table the U.N. plan. "I hope that these statements are statements of tactics and they don't mean what they say, because if Mr Talat is going to insist on this position you understand that it is not so easy to overcome the deadlock," Christofias told a news conference. He said he would be going into talks scheduled for March 21 "full of goodwill". "I hope that the hand I give to Mr Talat will be taken and will be shaken," he said. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded in response to a brief coup by Greek-Cypriots at the urging of the military then ruling Greece. Its division along the truce line is an obstacle to Turkey's bid to join the EU. Talat's last encounter with Christofias's predecessor, Tassos Papadopoulos, ended in failure in September 2007. Analysts and diplomats say this may be the last chance to reunite the island in a federation. Cyprus joined the EU soon after the reunification talks stalled and Brussels recognises the Greek-Cypriot controlled government in the south as the island's sole authority. Only Turkey recognises the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north. The two sides agreed in 2006 to look at an incremental approach to negotiations, but that too has stalled because of disputes over its agenda. Christofias has previously said he hoped for agreement to open more crossings along the truce line, but on Friday he rejected any possibility of lifting a de facto economic embargo on the north as called for by the European Commission. "We say frankly to the Commission that the view of the Commission towards the lifting of the so-called embargo against the Turkish Cypriots is wrong," said Christofias. "The Republic of Cyprus gives the opportunity to the Turkish Cypriots to trade through the legitimate ports and airports and I wonder why Turkey insists to use for this purpose the illegal ports and airports," he said.
