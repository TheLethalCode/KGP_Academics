 ELDORET, Kenya, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan security forces have arrested 69 members of a shadowy militia blamed for a spate of bloody clashes over land in Kenya's Mount Elgon region, a local official said on Wednesday. Hundreds of heavily armed soldiers have poured into the remote, fertile region on the border with Uganda, and witnesses say several people have been killed in a security operation to flush out the Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) militia. The Mount Elgon violence preceded a wave of ethnic killings around Kenya after President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election in December, but it shares some of the same root causes mainly resentment over land distribution and tribal tensions. "We have arrested 69 members of the Sabaot Land Defence Force, the operation will continue until the militias are wiped out," provincial commissioner Abdul Mwasserah told Reuters. At least 300 people have fled their homes and are seeking refuge at a nearby shopping centre in Cheptais town. Some have crossed the border to nearby Uganda, witnesses say. Journalists and aid workers have been barred from the area, which is popular with tourists for its herds of elephants. "We cannot access the area. The military officers deployed there are very hostile, no one is allowed near the area. The military have cordoned off the whole district," said one local journalist, who refused to be named. Local television pictures showed dozens of Red Cross trucks parked outside the area cordoned off by the army, waiting to go in. The Kenya National Human Rights Commission (KNHRC), a government funded body, was also unable to access the area. "We are hearing accusations and counter accusations from the ground of massive human rights violations ... currently there is no room for us to conduct an independent assessment on the ground," said Hassan Omar Hassan, a KNHRC official. Hassan said the body would send an independent assessment team to the area as soon as the operation was over. A local legislator said on Tuesday several people had been killed and accused the government of being heavy handed. More then 500 people have been killed and 60,000 have fled clashes in the area over the last 18 months. Allocation of government land in mid-2006 unleashed fighting between clans of the Sabaot ethnic group. Critics say the land was divided corruptly and favoured government supporters, at the expense of some residents who were evicted from areas they had farmed for 30 yea
