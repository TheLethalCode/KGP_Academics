<TITLE> Japan frets as dollar sinks through 100 yen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar sank through 100 yen on Thursday for the first time in more than a decade, prompting Japanese officials to say they are keeping a close eye on the yen's surge that has slammed the stock market this year. Japanese Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga tweaked his language to show a bit more concern, saying not only that he was carefully watching currencies but repeating that Group of Seven powers agree excessive exchange rate volatility is undesirable. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also chimed in to say rapid currency moves are undesirable. But analysts played down the risk of government intervention to stem the yen's rise, despite fears among some that Japan may follow the United States into recession this year. Japan has a long history of intervening in currency markets to cap the yen and protect exporters. But it has stayed out of the market for four years as the economy has pulled out of its decade-long slump and bout of deflation. "If they intervene in the market ... the upward trend in yen against dollar would not change as long as the fundamentals don't change," said Taisuke Tanaka, who also warned of increasing political pressure to intervene. Nukaga said the dollar's fall reflected the weakness of the U.S. currency rather than yen strength. Aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, along with fears of a deep U.S. economic recession, have undermined the dollar this year. STOCKS TUMBLING Fear about the impact on corporate profits of a stronger yen has sent the benchmark Nikkei share average tumbling nearly 20 percent this year to a 2-1/2-year low. The yen's jump was seen posing a further risk to Japanese companies. Futures on the Nikkei fell in Singapore trade while Japanese government bond futures climbed to match a 2-1/2-year high in evening trade The slide in stocks is greater than that seen in the United States as major exporters are the mainstay of growth in Japan. "The yen's rise, a decline in the dollar, and rises in oil prices are beginning to have a negative effect on corporate profits," Japanese Economics Minister Hiroko Ota said in parliament. The dollar slid as low as 99.77 yen breaking below the 100 level for the first time since November 1995. So far this year that U.S. currency has tumbled 10 percent against the yen. Last week the president of Toyota Motor Corp said the yen had strengthened too much, and analysts said the currency had climbed to levels that could dent the automaking giant. "Even Toyota will find it difficult to achieve higher profits with the dollar at 100 yen," said Tatsuo Yoshida, an auto analysts at UBS Securities in Tokyo. IMPORTERS BENEFIT But the strengthening yen has been a boon to Japanese companies importing raw materials because it offsets some of the steep rise in prices, as well as mitigating the impact of oil prices at $110 a barrel. A spokeswoman for Nippon Paper Group said that every one yen rise against the dollar increases her firm's operating profit by 700 million yen. But she also acknowledged the risks of a weaker economy. "In the long run, if the stronger yen causes the domestic economy to slow down, then the paper and pulp industry will also be affected," she said. Currency strategists said they now expected the dollar to fall to 98 yen and possibly 95 yen in coming weeks. Yet analysts said the Ministry of Finance would be wary about intervening after having stayed out of the market since March 2004 -- the longest Tokyo has gone without intervening since at least 1991. The strong forces behind the dollar's fall mean Japanese intervention would be doomed to fail, analysts say, and the yen strength is largely limited to one currency -- the ailing dollar. "In the current environment, I think it will be hard for Japan to conduct solo intervention," said Daisaku Ueno, head of the international research unit at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. "Even if they were going to intervene I think it would require cooperation with the United States. But judging from comments from Treasury Secretary Paulson, that does not seem likely to happen very soon," he said. Compared to when the dollar was last below 100 in late 1995, the yen is some 26 percent weaker when compared with a basket of currencies of Japan's trading partners Japan spent a whopping 35 trillion yen ($350 billion) in 2003 and the first quarter of 2004 to fight against the yen's rise against the dollar. In 1995, the dollar fell to an all-time low near 80 yen as the heated trade dispute between the Japan and the United States led to heightened pressure for a stronger y
