 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has achieved impressive gains in women's status and gender equality, says a World Bank report released Thursday. But access to reproductive health service, labour markets, physical security and role in decision making need urgent attention, said the report titled "Whisper to vice: gender and social transformation in Bangladesh." The report was launched at a programme at the LGED auditorium co-hosted by Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC) and The World Bank. Rasheda K Choudhury, adviser for women, children and cultural affairs who was chief guest at the ceremony, said the government was committed to facilitating equal opportunity to all for further development. "Bangladesh has taken huge strides in women's progress. Now it needs to address the remaining and second-generation issues," said Xian Zhu, World Bank country director for Bangladesh. "These include employment, extending education to all sections, strengthening the demand and supply of reproductive heath services and providing for women's safety." The report says this change has been a result of constructive polices and programmes that spurred much of the progress in gender equality. Between 1971 and 2004, Bangladesh halved its fertility rates. In much of the country, secondary school enrollment of girls exceeded that of boys. Microcredit continued to boost women's solidarity groups and earning potential. Vast numbers of young women were leaving their villages to work in garment factories whereas, in earlier generations, young women were rarely seen outside the home, the report went on. It said while gender inequalities in child-health had diminished, Bangladeshi women still lacked access to reproductive health services. Almost 90 percent of Bangladeshi women gave birth at home and over 86 percent did not have a skilled birth attendant to assist. The report said a new reality in education was emerging--boys were at risk of being 'left behind' and this could potentially have serious impact on social and familial cohesion. Already there was evidence of "educational hypogamy' with a larger proportion of younger women compared with the older generation marrying men less educated than them. Despite increasing education and declining fertility, women labour force participation rates were very low, although they had doubled in the last year, the report added. Women's employment in South Asia was among the lowest in the world and Bangladesh was at the lower end of the South Asian spectrum. Women's role in decision-making was still small and restricted to the domestic sphere. The report also addressed some of the issues that had dominated the popular discourse in Bangladesh. For instance, it found that there had been an increase in dowry over the last 30 years. Australian High Commissioner Douglas Foskett, secretary to the ministry of women, children and cultural affairs Rokeya Sultana and Shirin Huq also commented on the report. bdnew
