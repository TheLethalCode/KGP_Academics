 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker administration is set to take action against edible oil refinery owners and importers who sell their products at elevated prices contrary to government fixed rates, an adviser said Saturday. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the falling cost of edible oil in the international market was having an impact on domestic prices. He said a meeting would soon take place with businessmen to downsize current prices in light of the international situation. The adviser said stern action would be taken against anyone found selling edible oil at a higher price than the government fixed rate. "The ministry of commerce is in the last phase of its investigation into the matter. Instant action will be taken if proof is found that any businessman has been destabilising the market," said Zillur. Zillur said the commerce ministry closely monitors the market at all times and the caretaker administration was trying to bring all market prices down to a tolerable level. "The government has decided to apply some new techniques to keep the market stable. We will sit with the businessmen soon, following which we will announce the programme," said the adviser. "I can, however, say that the government will intensify its monitoring system," he said. The commerce ministry is currently investigating seven big edible oil refiners and importers for failing to sell their product at government fixed prices. City Group, TK Group, Meghna Group, United Edible Oil, S Alam Group, Mostafa Vegetable Oil and Bangladesh Edible Oil were asked to submit relevant production and sales information between Feb 25 to March 9. The seven companies control more than 90 percent of the country's edible oil market. The commerce ministry sent a letter to the National Board of Revenue regarding the amount of VAT these companies paid during the time they allegedly sold the overpriced oil. On March 9, the commerce ministry sent letters out to the firms. President of the Edible Oil Refinery Owners Association MA Rouf Chowdhury said: "I am busy with the FBCCI election at the moment." "I am not aware of the present market situation. However, from the information I have, I think the mills owners are selling oil at the government fixed prices." "Importers and mill owners are not responsible if anybody on the retail side of the market sells oil at an elevated price," said Chowdhury. However, the general secretary of the Bangladesh Retail Edible Oil Traders Association, Abul Hashem, said the mill owners were not supplying the quantity of oil they were meant to. "This is why there is a crisis in the market and the main reason retail oil prices are higher than government fixed rates," said Hashem. The falling cost of edible oil in the wholesale market has so far failed to translate into reduced prices in the domestic retail market. On Saturday, one kilogramme of loose soybean oil was selling in Karwan Bazar for Tk 120, while a five litre bottle of Rupchanda soybean oil sold at Tk 550. Haji Golam Moula, general secretary of Moulvibazar Traders Association, also said the price of edible oil had fallen over the last few days. "On Saturday, a maund of soybean oil was sold at Tk 4,100 and the same quantity of palm oil was sold at Tk 3,700," said Moula. "A few days ago soybean oil sold at Tk 4,250 and palm oil at Tk 3,850," he added. Over the last few days the price of edible oil in the international market has fallen by more than 100 dollars per tonne. An official from the Malaysian Palm Oil Council Bangladesh told bdnews24.com that on Tuesday the price of soybean oil in the international market was $1,650 per tonne. "By Friday the price came down to $1,450, while palm oil came down to $1,300 from $1550," he said. bdnew
