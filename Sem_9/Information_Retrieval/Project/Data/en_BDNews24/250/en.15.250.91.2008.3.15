<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was admitted to Square Hospital, is doing fine, the inspector general of prisons said Saturday. IG of prisons Zakir Hassan and deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui visited Hasina at the hospital at around 10:30 am, staying until around 1:00 pm. Asked whether Hasina's personal physicians have been barred from seeing her, Hassan said: "Hasina's personal physicians saw her before. They will see her in future if necessary. Doctors at Square Hospital are watching her currently as she is admitted there." He said a number of physicians were added to the physicians' panel for examining Hasina, but he was not aware whether any doctor had been excluded. Hassan said he had no information on the matter of sending Hasina abroad for treatment. On the former prime minister's ear treatment, he said: "The medical authorities did not say that they would not be able to provide necessary treatment for her ear complaint." It was one doctor's personal opinion that Hasina could not receive the treatment here in Bangladesh, the IG of prisons stressed. Dr MH Millat, one of the seven doctors of the physicians' panel formed by the Square Hospital authorities, told bdnews24.com Thursday that Hasina's health condition was better except for ear and eye complaints. The detained Awami League chief has problems with her vision, as she is suffering from glaucoma and pressure behind the eye, her personal physicians say. She is also suffering total hearing loss in one ear and the hearing ability in another ear is seriously impaired, according to her doctors. Hasina was admitted to Square Hospital from special jail on Tuesday. bdnews24
