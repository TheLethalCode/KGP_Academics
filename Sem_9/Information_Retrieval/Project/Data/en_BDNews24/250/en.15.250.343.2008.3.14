 CANBERRA, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As protesters prepare to disrupt a planned cull of kangaroos, an Australian government report on Friday found kangaroos have an image problem when it comes to marketing them as a source of meat. The report said the kangaroo industry needed to do more to explain how wild kangaroo "harvesting" was humane, sustainable and good for the environment and not related to pest control. "It needs to separate itself from the culling for pest management that often attracts strong emotional responses from the community and creates images of poor quality control," it said.

Kangaroo consumption has increased over the past decade, with 58.5 percent of Australians saying they have tried prime kangaroo cuts at least once and 14.5 percent saying they eat it four times a year or more. Other cuts are used widely in pet food. Kangaroo meat remains in demand in Europe, particularly in Germany, where it is used as a low-fat component of smallgoods, but smallgoods manufacturers in Australia have shied away from using the meat. The government report said while kangaroo meat was lean and healthy, the public, meat manufacturers and retailers had little knowledge that kangaroos were harvested from the wild and kangaroo meat did not come from farms.
