 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news before Premier League fixtures at the weekend. Theo Walcott is a doubt for leaders Arsenal against Middlesbrough on Saturday because of a thigh injury sustained in a behind-closed-doors match against Colorado Rapids. The 18-year-old winger missed the 0-0 draw at Wigan Athletic last week, Arsenal's third league draw in a row and manager Arsene Wenger is not confident that he will return to face Boro. Right back Emmanuel Eboue returns from suspension but midfielder Tomas Rosicky is out with a hamstring injury. Manchester United, who can go top with victory at relegation-bound Derby County on Saturday, will hand third choice goalkeeper Ben Foster his first league start. Foster gets his chance because of a thigh injury to Edwin van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak's suspension. Derby who lost 6-1 at Chelsea on Wednesday, have won only one league game this season, against Newcastle United last September. Fernando Torres has scored 17 of his 19 league goals at Anfield this season and will fancy adding to his tally at home to Reading on Saturday. The Spaniard's hat-tricks against Middlesbrough and West Ham United recently have helped revive Liverpool's league campaign and he would match Ian Rush's feat of three hat-tricks in a season (1983-84) should he bag another one. West Ham United are optimistic that defender Matthew Upson will return as they try to end a run of three consecutive 4-0 defeats when they host Blackburn Rovers. Upson injured a calf muscle in the defeat at Liverpool last week and missed Sunday's hammering at Tottenham Hotspur. Wigan Athletic are sweating on the fitness of England striker Emile Heskey for their relegation battle against Bolton Wanderers. Heskey limped off with a foot injury against Arsenal last week but a scan showed no broken bones. Third from bottom Bolton, who have lost their last three league games, rested half their team in the UEFA Cup defeat against Sporting Lisbon on Thursday. Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan is banking on striker Mark Viduka to get the goals to steer the club away from the relegation zone. United have a crunch fixture at Birmingham City on Monday and Viduka is expected to play having appeared for only 24 minutes since Keegan returned to manage the club in January because of a calf strain. "It's a massive bonus having him back for the last 10 games," Keegan told the club's Web site. "You always want your best players available but when it's a striker who can score you goals and win you matches, you need them especially.
