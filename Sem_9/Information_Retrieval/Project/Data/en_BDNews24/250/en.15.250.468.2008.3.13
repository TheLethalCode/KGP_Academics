 ROME, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roma are seeking a home win over AC Milan on Saturday to put pressure on an Inter Milan side unsettled by doubts about coach Roberto Mancini's future. Mancini, whose team lead Serie A, stunned Italian soccer when he announced he intended to leave Inter at the end of the season after Tuesday's Champions League last-16 defeat by Liverpool. He made a U-turn on Wednesday after talks with club chairman Massimo Moratti, but the affair is likely to have upset the champions ahead of Sunday's home game with Palermo. Roma can rattle them further by cropping their lead to three points, for a night at least, with a win over the European champions, who are fifth. The Rome side's tails were already up after they trimmed Inter's advantage from 11 points to six in recent weeks and knocked Real Madrid out of the Champions League to become Italy's only representative in the competition. "We want to go all the way in the Champions League and gain points for the Serie A title," Roma captain Francesco Totti told Sky television. "I was surprised by Mancini's decision. They may have some problems now, we'll have to see how the players react, it could be a good thing or a bad thing." European champions Milan need a win to move above fourth-placed Fiorentina and into the qualification zone for the Champions League, after bring knocked out by Arsenal last week. Striker Filippo Inzaghi is in doubt for the trip to the capital because of a groin strain, while Clarence Seedorf, Marek Jankulovski and Alessandro Nesta are is battling to regain their fitness. Roma full back Marco Cassetti is also on the mend from a shoulder problem. Third-placed Juventus, who are seven points behind Roma with 51 points from 27 games, will be short-handed for Sunday's home game against Napoli. Nicola Legrottaglie, Jonathan Zebina and Mauro Camoranesi are suspended, Cristiano Zanetti is out for a month with a thigh injury and Portuguese midfielder Tiago is a doubt because of an ankle problem. Fiorentina, who reached the UEFA Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday after winning a penalty shootout with Everton, are a point above Milan and entertain Genoa on Saturday
