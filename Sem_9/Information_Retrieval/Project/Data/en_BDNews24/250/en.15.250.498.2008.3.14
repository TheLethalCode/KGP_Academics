 WASHINGTON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top US officials head to Russia next week to improve prickly ties between the major powers but experts said it was unlikely the two sides would narrow differences on issues from missile defense to Kosovo. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates are due to arrive in Moscow on Monday for two days of talks with their counterparts. The so-called 2+2 meetings follow similar talks in October between the four ministers in Moscow that ended with public clashes over US plans for a missile defense shield in Europe and how to tackle Iran's nuclear program. "It is no secret that the relationship is pretty scratchy and not very productive. It has been at the public level quite polemic," said James Collins, a former US ambassador to Russia now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. US plans to build a missile defense shield in Europe, with pieces in formerly Soviet-allied countries, will again be a leading topic of the discussions. Washington says the system is needed to defend against threats from states such as Iran, but Moscow strongly opposes the plan, calling it a threat. Russia has warned it will target missiles at the system if it is deployed in eastern Europe. While Russian news service Interfax said Rice and Gates would present a missile defense proposal at the meetings next week, U.S. officials said they would offer nothing new. "We are not going with any new initiative in hand," said Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. The United States, in fact, does not expect any agreement to emerge from the meetings. The goal, officials said, was to narrow the gaps between the two before U.S. President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in April. STANDING PROPOSALS U.S. officials expect to talk about their standing proposals, aimed at easing Moscow's opposition to the $3.5 billion U.S. plan to place a radar station in the Czech Republic and interceptor missiles in Poland. "There have been some creative proposals from us that have been on the table for several months and they have been a topic and a source for discussion with the Russian government," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Russia has so far rejected U.S. proposals, including an offer to let Russian officials inspect elements of the shield. Poland and the Czech Republic have not yet agreed to host the U.S. shield. While Bush this week promised to help modernize Poland's military to secure Warsaw's agreement, U.S. defense officials are not sure they want to give Poland the air defense system it seeks. The Czech government also faces an uphill battle for approval from its parliament to host the U.S. site. 'TESTING WATERS' Putin is due to hand power to a new president, Dmitry Medvedev, in May, and some Washington policy analysts pinned the U.S. visit partly to a desire by the Bush administration to get a feel for the role Putin intends to play in the future. "Obviously, the missile talks, that's a very important part of it, but another part of the trip is to be kind of getting a sense of what's going on internally inside of Russia," said Glen Howard, president of Washington-based Jamestown Foundation, a policy group that focuses on Russia. "They're trying to test the waters to see who's going to be calling the shots," said Howard. Rice and Gates are expected to meet with both Medvedev and Putin, who is expected to become prime minister. The talks also come as the Bush administration is in its final months ahead of the November US election to choose a new president who takes office in January. "There is a great possibility of this trip bringing absolutely nothing. I am afraid that it will be a repetition of the October meeting," said Leon Aron, director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute. The talks will also cover the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which expires in 2009. The pact, signed in Moscow in 1991, set ceilings on the size of the Russian and US nuclear arsenals. Russia is seeking agreement on replacing the deal. The Bush administration has been arguing for a less formal agreement but a senior U.S. official said Washington was now interested in a legally binding replacement for START. Other areas of contention are Kosovo's February declaration of independence, which Washington supported and Russia opposed, as well as how to deal with Iran's nuclear progr
