 ATHENS, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek public transport halted, flights were disrupted and public services shut down during a three-hour walkout on Wednesday by unions opposing a pension reform bill they say hurts their benefits. Private and public sector workers walked off the job at 1000 GMT. State carrier Olympic airlines scrapped seven flights and rescheduled three so workers could take part in the strike action.

"If the government thinks it can scrap hard-earned benefits then it is seriously mistaken." A strike by central bank employees last week effectively shut down Greece's stock and bond markets for almost three days.
