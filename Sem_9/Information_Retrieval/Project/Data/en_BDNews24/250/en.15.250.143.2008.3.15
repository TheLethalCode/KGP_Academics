 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Saturday that the schedule for the national elections would be given after June. Following a meeting with visiting UNDP administrator and UN under-secretary-general Kemal Dervis, Huda told reporters: "I will announce the date for national elections after June." "The draft voter list will be ready by the end of June. Then, we will see when the election date can be fixed." Kemal Dervis, who arrived in Dhaka Saturday on a three-day visit, told reporters after the meeting that his delegation hoped the elections would be held on time as per the roadmap. "We don't see any reason for the elections not being held," Dervis said, adding that all preparations for the elections appeared to be ongoing. Six other delegates, including UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh Renata Dessallien, accompanied Kemal Dervis to the 45-minute meeting in which election Commissioner Sohul Hossain was also present. The CEC said that the schedule for the city corporation elections would be announced after receipt of the gazette on the proposed local government ordinance. Asked about the local government polls, he said: "When I get the gazette in my hand, I will speak about it." The schedule for elections to four city corporations and seven municipalities are expected to be announced in the current month. Meanwhile, the draft of the proposed local government ordinance has been finalised. bdnew
