 WELLINGTON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England have gambled by dropping experienced pace bowlers Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard for the second test against New Zealand starting on Thursday. The tourists have included Stuart Broad, who has played just one test, and James Anderson for the game at Wellington's Basin Reserve in the two changes from the side beaten by 189 runs in the first match. "I think it's a great opportunity for Jimmy (Anderson) and Broady to come in and establish themselves at this level," England captain Michael Vaughan told reporters. "I also hope that Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison really fight and try to get their places back because that will create a competitive environment." The 29-year-old Harmison has struggled with injuries and loss of form since reaching the top of the world test rankings in 2004. He has taken 212 wickets in 57 tests at an average of 31.39. Hoggard, 31, has claimed 248 test wickets in 67 matches at 30.50. The pair however, took just two wickets in the first test at Seddon Park and conceded 278 runs. "It was a real hard decision but when you're in positions we are you have to make those decisions," said Vaughan. STERLING EFFORT New Zealand's toughest decision will be whether to change a bowling attack that produced a sterling effort on a benign pitch in Hamilton, with captain Daniel Vettori suggesting a third seamer could be favoured over a second spinner. "I'd say we're leaning towards the seamer but that's not set in stone," said Vettori. "(Coach) John (Bracewell) and I have discussed it and both of us were unsettled in terms of what we needed going on to this wicket on the first morning. "If you need your out and out seamer, that would be Mark (Gillespie) and if you look at the end of a test match there is a role for a Grant (Elliott) type bowler and a Jeetan (Patel) type bowler. "We will wait till tomorrow morning, take a look at overhead conditions and go from there." England - Michael Vaughan (captain), Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Tim Ambrose, Ryan Sidebottom, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Monty Panesar. New Zealand (probable) - Daniel Vettori (captain), Jamie How, Matthew Bell, Stephen Fleming, Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie, Chris Marti
