 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England midfielder Frank Lampard struck four goals on Wednesday as Chelsea rebounded from their FA Cup reverse at Barnsley at the weekend to defeat Derby 6-1 in the Premier League. Lampard, who was left out of Saturday's match, scored from the penalty spot in the 28th minute after he was fouled by Dean Leacock. He added three more in the second half to record his fourth career hat-trick and his first for Chelsea. Lampard's fellow England international Joe Cole and Ivory Coast's Salomon Kalou scored the other goals while David Jones notched a late consolation for struggling Derby. Chelsea moved to within five points of Arsenal, who top the standings with 66 points from 29 games and are two ahead of champions Manchester United, who have a game in hand. Aston Villa, chasing fourth place and a Champions League spot, were held 1-1 by Middlesbrough at Villa Park. Stewart Downing scored midway through the first half for Middlesbrough with England midfielder Gareth Barry equalising for the home side with a second-half penalty after Luke Young was judged to have handled Ashley Young's shot. Portsmouth's former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe continued his recent run of prolific form with two early goals for the FA Cup semi-finalists at home to Birmingham City. Fabrice Muamba and Sebastian Larsson scored for Birmingham to bring the sides level before Hermann Hreidarsson and Nwankwo Kanu sealed a 4-2 win
