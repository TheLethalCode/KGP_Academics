 Rio Dulce, Guatemala, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Belgian tourists, one in his seventies, were spending a second night in the Guatemalan jungle as hostages of a mob of peasant farmers on Saturday, as authorities tried to secure their release. The two couples were seized along with two Guatemalan guides on Friday as they traveled up a river near the Caribbean coast by farmers angry over the arrest of a local Mayan leader. The farmers took them upriver and held them overnight. A leader of the indigenous farmers' group told Guatemalan radio on Saturday the six hostages would be held until President Alvaro Colom agreed to talk to them. But as night fell a spokesman for the human rights ombudsman's office, which was mediating between the government and the captors, told Reuters the government was responding that it could not negotiate with criminals. "The situation right now is at deadlock and as long as the government won't give a reply (it) is getting much more complicated and dangerous," spokesman Walter Ordonez said. He said he was worried the government might use force to try and get the Belgians out. The six captives were believed to be hidden in dense jungle near the town of Rio Dulce, named after the remote, emerald green river they were traveling up by motor boat when they were abducted by machete-wielding farmers. The Belgians range in age from 59 to 74, and Ordonez said they were concerned about one of them who had heart problems. The same group of farmers briefly held 29 policemen hostage in February demanding the release of Ramiro Choc, a community leader whose supporters say he is fighting for land rights. Close to half of Guatemala's population are indigenous peasants, many of them landless, who often occupy land to carry out subsistence farming. "We have the tourists in a safe place," farmers' leader Juana Caal told Guatemalan radio earlier. "We will not let them go until there is a dialogue with the president or the vice president." Ronaldo Robles, chief spokesman for the president's office, said he believed the group was unharmed and that groups of police and soldiers were searching for them on foot as the negotiations went on by telephone. The Belgian consulate said on Friday the Guatemalan navy was sending a ship up the river to look for the vacationers. One of the tourists told Guatemalan radio by cell phone on Friday they were not hurt. Land disputes were one of the catalysts for Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government, which left around 250,000 people dead or missing. Colom, who took office in January, has vowed to reduce poverty and violence.
