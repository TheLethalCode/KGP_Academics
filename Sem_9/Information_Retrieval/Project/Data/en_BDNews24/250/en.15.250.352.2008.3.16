 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A shift from boom to gloom in financial markets is reshaping the landscape of banking lawyers, with restructuring, insolvency and litigation work switching from snooze mode to buzzing departments in many law firms. Since the credit crunch has slowed the flow of mergers and acquisitions and debt and equity issues, lawyers have been busy unwinding complex structured finance deals gone wrong, talking investors out of suing banks for losses and documenting lay-offs and hedge fund bankruptcies. Patrick Mears, a partner at leading London-based law firm Allen & Overy, said the legal industry benefits from dealflow and has to work much harder for profit in static markets. "Law firms ... make money when markets go up or when they go down," he said. But to make money, legal experts say, firms must be flexible, switching lawyers from slowing areas of work to parts of the business where demand is greater. Last month, US law firm Dechert laid off 13 associates in its finance and real estate arm and offered them a transfer to other business units, such as its large litigation department, a source close to the firm said. Dechert is expanding its restructuring and reorganisation arm and aims to at least double the unit's headcount within the next 12 to 18 months, said practice partner Jeffrey Schwartz. This month, the firm hired restructuring expert Brian Greer from Linklaters. U.S. law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, whose clients include Bear Stearns and Credit Suisse, said in September it hired a record number of attorneys last year in its financial restructuring group and planned to increase staffing in London to handle distressed debt litigation. LOOKING FOR CULPRITS The fresh demand for these previously low-profile legal specialists is keeping recruiters busy. Jonathan Glass, a headhunter at the London-based Glass Consultancy legal staffing firm, said that until six months ago he would have struggled to remember the last time he looked to recruit insolvency or restructuring lawyers for a client. Now he is working on two such projects. "If you pick up the phone to an insolvency partner in any of the top 100 UK law firms and ask, 'Have you had a call from a headhunter in the past month?', I guess the majority will say yes," Glass said. As market players hurt by subprime loan-related losses look for culprits, the litigation business is hotting up. Law firms and in-house lawyers are negotiating with investors who are facing losses on leveraged products and are examining documents closely to see whether they can challenge a bank's margin calls, valuations or the close-out of positions. Many investors are also complaining banks did not properly explain the complex products to them, or had missold them. Multi-billion dollar writedowns on subprime exposure have led many European and U.S. banks, such as Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, to shed jobs to lower costs. As a result, employment lawyers who hammer out conditions of redundancies and redeployments are in demand, said Yvonne Smyth, head of legal recruitment at Hays headhunters. MID-SIZED DEALS But picking up the pieces is not the only work banking lawyers do now. "There is still an awful lot of business around," said Ken Baird, partner and head of restructuring and insolvency at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, pointing to a robust flow of medium-sized private equity deals. Other lawyers and bankers also said such deals were still happening and that they were usually worth about $500 million or less. Many funds are also using the opportunity to pick up distressed assets on the cheap. And even the structured finance business, widely seen as being on its last legs, is supplying lawyers with work, as banks and investors consider developing new debt products. "I am starting to work on a couple of deals involving CDOs (collateralised debt obligations), for example, that people are aiming to bring to market in the autumn when they expect the market will have come back (to health)," said Geoff Fuller, a partner covering structured finance and other capital markets transactions at Allen & Ove
