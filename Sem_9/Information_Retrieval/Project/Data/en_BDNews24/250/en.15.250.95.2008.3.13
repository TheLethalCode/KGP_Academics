 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The students of Dhaka Medical College Thursday night blocked a stretch of the road at Bakshi Bazar crossing to demand uninterrupted power to their dormitory, police and witnesses said. The protests began shortly after 7:30pm after Fazle Rabbi Hall and nearby areas suffered power cuts. The neighbourhood remained in the blackout late Thursday night. The angry students burnt tyres and continued protests as the police officials tried to negotiate with them. The students complained of losing many study hours to frequent power cuts in the evening. They want a power line from the medical college, which usually gets uninterrupted supply. Assistant police commissioner for Lalbagh zone Zahid Hossain rushed to the scene along with the area's police chief Nobojit Khisa and negotiated with the students. Khisa said they were trying to tame the situation and would talk to the hall provost and other officials for a solution. bdnew
