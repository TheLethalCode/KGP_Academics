 Hong Kong, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low against the yen and euro on Thursday and shares fell as euphoria subsided about the latest helping hand from the US Federal Reserve and reality - $110 oil and recession fears - returned. The Fed's attempt to ease credit market strains by offering to accept mortgage bonds as collateral had sparked the biggest daily gains for five years on the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq on Tuesday, but nagging worries about the state of the US economy overcame that initial optimism. "There remains a degree of caution as we are seeing a perfect storm of economic recession factors hitting the US and that's creating uncertainty despite the fact that the Fed has come up with rather creative and elegant ideas," said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at CommSec. "Credit markets remain very tight although the Fed has created a market for some of those assets at the heart of the credit crisis." The New York Board of Trade's US dollar index struck an all-time low of 72.189 as the dollar tumbled to a 12-year low below 101 yen hitting 100.95 yen on electronic trading platform EBS, while the euro hit a new high of $1.5575. The slide came despite remarks from US President George W. Bush on Wednesday that he would like to see a stronger dollar and expressed concern its falling value was one cause of soaring US energy prices. The dollar could continue to fall unless authorities act further to ease concerns about the U.S. housing sector and ailing credit markets, said Tomoko Fujii, head of economics and strategy for Japan at Bank of America. "There is no reason to buy the dollar," Fujii said. "It's not as if the US government is going to step in and buy up every mortgage," she added. SAFE HAVENS Asian stock markets, wracked for months by fear of a U.S. recession that could damage the region's exporters, fell. Japan's benchmark Nikkei average was down 2 percent by 0204 GMT, while MSCI's index of the rest of Asia shed more than 1.5 percent. "Perception that the Fed was just buying time with the cash injections pervades the market. Investors are aware it has not helped solve the fundamental problems," said Kim Joon-kie, an analyst at SK Securities. "Investors are taking a wait-and-see stance, as the Fed is set to hold its interest rate meeting next week, and as Wall Street banks release earnings in the coming weeks," he added. The fall in the dollar helped US crude oil break above $110 a barrel for the first time, with safe-haven asset gold trading at $983.70/4.50 an ounce, within sight of a record $991.90 struck on March 6. The high oil price hit Asian airlines such as Korean Air KS> , which fell more than 6 percent, and Qantas, Japan Airlines Corp and All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA), which all fell around 2 percent. Singapore Airlines lost 1.1 percent. Flagging enthusiasm for the Fed's initiative also lifted Japanese government bonds, driving 10-year futures to a 2- year high. "The Fed's latest measure was seen as ineffective in resolving the credit market strains, keeping intact investors' flight-to-quality preference," said Akihiko Yokoyama, chief JGB strategist at JPMorgan Securities.
