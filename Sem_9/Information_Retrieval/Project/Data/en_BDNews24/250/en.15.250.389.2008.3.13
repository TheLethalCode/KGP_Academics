 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's only listed funeral company, Dignity Plc, posted an 8 percent rise in profit on Thursday, above analyst forecasts, boosted by more people pre-paying for funerals. Dignity, which runs 540 funeral parlours in Britain, said profit before tax and one-off items was 30.1 million pounds ($60.6 million) in the 52 weeks to Dec. 28, topping analysts' forecasts of 28.7-30 million, according to Reuters Estimates. "We had a very good year in all parts of our business -- in the funeral and crematoria side ... and we continue to sell pre-paid funerals through affinity partners," Chief Executive Peter Hindley told Reuters. The company said pre-arranged funerals were up 4.5 percent in 2007, with 197,300 people paying in advance. "We continue to sell more plans than the number of deaths among people who have already prepaid for funerals," Hindley said, adding 6 percent of people who bought plans in advance died in 2007. "Our sales have been consistent at about 21,000 plans a year ... we're obviously trying to encourage more people to (pre-plan funerals)." TRADITIONAL CEREMONIES Earnings were boosted by a 1 percent rise in the UK death rate in 2007, estimated by the Office of National Statistics. Dignity, which has bought 27 funeral parlours and closed two in the past year, said its outlook was positive, with good growth prospects. Hindley said traditional funerals were the most popular and no new trends had emerged to reflect Britain's changing demographics. "This business is so traditional that things change very very slowly ... new immigrants to the UK are mainly young people and it'll be a considerable time before we see the effects of that," Hindley said. Dignity saw a 1 percent increase in cremations in 2007 and has invested 42.1 million pounds in new hearses and limousines. "The company has enjoyed a strong start to the year, helped by the winter flu virus, and is set for another good year, helped by firm pricing and acquisitions," analysts at Panmure said in a research note, retaining a "buy" recommendation. The shares fell 0.6 percent to 743.5 pence by 0917 GMT, valuing the company at about 438 million pounds. The final dividend per share was up 10 percent to 6.6
