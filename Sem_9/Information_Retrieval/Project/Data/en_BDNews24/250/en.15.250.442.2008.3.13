<TITLE> Defence U-turn possible if Italy elects Berlusconi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rome, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A victory for Silvio Berlusconi in April elections could allow a radical reshaping of Italy's defence policy, including renewed involvement in Iraq, the man who wants to be his defence minister told Reuters. Antonio Martino, Berlusconi's defence minister from 2001 to 2006, said he wanted to send military trainers to Iraq if he got the job, less than two years after Italy withdrew its troops. He also said he planned to sharply cut or scrap altogether Italy's leading role in the Lebanon peacekeeping mission. "I would reduce our presence in Lebanon drastically, if not cancel it all, and send troops to Afghanistan and to Iraq where they are needed," said Martino, a staunch supporter of US foreign policy, who won a medal from the US Department of Defense in 2005. Martino said he would like the job of Berlusconi's defence chief, but added "it's not a given". He did not claim to be representing Berlusconi or his policy ideas. Outgoing Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who beat Berlusconi in 2006 elections but failed to hold together his fragile centre-left coalition, made a priority of accelerating Italy's withdrawal from Iraq on taking office. Berlusconi's decision to send troops to Iraq was deeply unpopular then, and Martino said he did not see a role there now for Italian combat troops. "I would deploy fighting people in Afghanistan and instructors in Iraq," he said. He expected NATO would ask a future Berlusconi government to send more troops to Afghanistan, and reduce their restrictions on engaging the enemy. "We should give it to them," Martino said. Martino called for increased defence spending, saying Italy -- including under Berlusconi -- spent less than half as much as NATO allies on defence, as a proportion of GDP. IRANIAN LEADER "LUNATIC" Turning to Iran, Martino said he believed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was a "lunatic" and added that he supported the creation of a missile shield, such as the one the United States is planning in eastern Europe. But he did not back the idea of a military strike on Iran. "I don't think we can do in Iran what was done against Saddam in Iraq, because we don't know the exact location of all their sites," Martino said. "The only thing we could do is what many European countries have chosen to do, (to) have a system of anti-missile defence. I think that is necessary." Martino lambasted Prodi's decision to take a leading role in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which he saw as unable to disarm Hezbollah or halt the inflow of weapons from Syria. Italy's troops could be caught in the middle of a war between Israel and Hezbollah, he said. "(Italy's) soldiers in Lebanon are not only perfectly unneeded, they are also at risk," he said. Italy's defence ministry estimates troop levels in Lebanon at 2,400
