<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com) The Appellate Division Sunday started hearing a government appeal filed against a High Court verdict that quashed Azam J Chowdhury's extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A full Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin began hearing the appeal at 9:30 am. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed, standing for the government said the High Court handed down the case cancellation verdict on purpose, as Sheikh Hasina in her writ had only contended that including the case for trial under the EPR was illegal. The Appellate Division on February 26 stayed the High Court's dismissal of the case Tuesday after accepting the government's leave to appeal against the verdict, and set March 16 for hearing to begin on the appeal. Security inside the court and around was tightened considerably over the hearing of the appeal Sunday. Security personnel were busily carrying out body search of everybody passing through the entrances. The government filed a motion with the Appellate Division on Feb 18 seeking leave to appeal the High Court verdict. On Feb 6, the High Court dismissed the extortion case filed by Azam J Chowdhury against Hasina, after ruling illegal its inclusion under emergency powers rules. The ruling came on a writ petition filed by Hasina challenging the case's trial under EPR. Businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the Tk 3 crore extortion case against Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Selim with Gulshan police on June 13, 2007. The case details said the accused received a total of Tk 2.99 crore from the litigant in 2001 in exchange for illegally awarding a contract to build Siddhirganj Power Station. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007. She was shown arrested in the case later the same day after inclusion of the case proceedings under EPR. Charges were framed against the accused, including Sheikh Hasina's sister, Rehana, on Jan 13. bd
