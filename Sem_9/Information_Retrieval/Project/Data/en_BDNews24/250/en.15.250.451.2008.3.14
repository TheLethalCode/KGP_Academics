 WELLINGTON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were in a strong position to level the test series against New Zealand after James Anderson took five wickets to help bowl the hosts out for 198 late on the second day of the second test on Friday. England were four without loss at the close in their second innings, a lead of 148 with three days remaining, with Alastair Cook on two and captain Michael Vaughan yet to score after the openers saw out a tricky five-over spell before the close. Ross Taylor top scored with 54 and Daniel Vettori contributed 50 not out in New Zealand's first innings, while Anderson finished with five for 73 and Paul Collingwood took career-best figures of 3-23. New Zealand had bowled England out for 342 just before the lunch break with Tim Ambrose scoring his maiden test century. New Zealand won the first match in the three-test series in Hamilton by 189 run
