 BRUSSELS, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's prime minister vowed on Friday to do his utmost to avoid a referendum in his country on the European Union's reform treaty after being grilled by anxious EU leaders at a summit. Powerful anti-EU nationalists in Poland's opposition Law and Justice party are demanding a referendum, suddenly complicating an expected smooth ratification of the treaty by the bloc's biggest east European member.
