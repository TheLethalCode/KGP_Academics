 Beijing, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese forces on Sunday defended the crackdown on violent protests that have racked the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, despite international calls for restraint and concerns for human rights. A week of demonstrations led by Buddhist monks in the contested region escalated on Friday into broader-based protests that led to looting and burning and prompted police and troops to lock down the Himalayan city. "I can honestly tell you that none of the means we have adopted there have exceeded the constitutional rights of the armed forces or international law," Wu Shuangzhan, commander of the paramilitary People's Armed Police force, told Reuters. "I can also very clearly assure you that not a single person has exceeded their mandate," he said on the sidelines of China's annual session of parliament in Beijing. Witnesses said Lhasa was teeming with armed police in riot gear on Sunday and residents spoke only anonymously to journalists, fearful of repercussions in a country whose Communist authorities brook no challenge to their rule. The International Campaign for Tibet reported a heavy police presence in at least two ethnic Tibetan strongholds in China, the Sichuan town of Lithang and the Gansu town of Xiahe, where monks led two days of marches on government buildings. Human rights watchdog Amnesty International called on China to fully account for all of those detained in the crackdown and to release those being held for "exercising their freedom of expression, association and assembly". U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also urged China to "release monks and others who have been detained solely for the peaceful expression of their views". "NO BIG DEAL" But officers of China's People's Liberation Army said its response was appropriate. "We're tackling these conflicts and solving these problems in an able way; our government is properly dealing with these issues," senior PLA officer Zhang Wentai told Reuters. The Tibet situation should not be seen as out of the ordinary, he said. "Having some problems crop up is nothing to make a big deal out of. We just need to deal with them in an appropriate manner." Officials also expressed frustration that China's response was being criticised by Western powers, who they said would have reacted the same way in the face of violent protest. "The aim of the measures that China is taking is to preserve stability," said Wu. "The trouble there, the shooting and burning, there is no country that would permit this." And they said the Olympic Games, which Beijing will host in August, would not dictate China's handling of the situation. "Every country would do this. Every place has good people and bad people. There is nothing strange about this," said Li Dianren, deputy political commissar of the National Defence University. "Everyone wants stability, no one wants chaos," he said. "Chaos can't win people's hearts."
