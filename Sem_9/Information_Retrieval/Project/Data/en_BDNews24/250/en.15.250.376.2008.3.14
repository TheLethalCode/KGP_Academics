 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World financial markets stabilised on Friday after a week of extreme turbulence, with the US dollar inching up from historic lows and European stocks holding steady ahead of key US inflation data. But traders said the relative calm disguised investor stress over what many see as a prevailing US recession, banking strains, hedge fund failures and the ongoing fallout from the eight-month old credit crisis. The US Federal Reserve is now expected to cut interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point when its policymakers meet on Tuesday. But optimism about lower interest rates is offset by next week's first quarter earnings reports from major investment firms Bear Stearns and Goldman. The release at 1230 GMT of February US consumer price inflation numbers also has investors on tenterhooks. Economists polled by Reuters expect a 0.3 percent rise in the consumer price index during the month and a robust 4.3 perceny year-on-year increase -- the same as January's rate. Rising inflation is complicating the Fed's ability to cut credit costs to ease the financial crisis. The combination of lower Fed interest rates and rising inflation expectations is undermining the dollar -- which in turn is boosting oil prices and import costs and exaggerating inflation further. "When there is as much uncertainty as there is at the moment economic indicators become more and more important because that will give you some feeling at least for what really is happening," said Jonathan Monk, senior portfolio manager at Aerion Fund Management. The dollar firmed from fresh all-time lows against the euro and 12-year lows against the Japanese yen set earlier in Asian trading. The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.5566 after touching a new record high of $1.5651. The dollar was flat at 100.51 yen. Earlier, it dipped below 100 yen for the second day in a row. Gold and crude oil were slightly off their record highs. Spot gold was at $994 holding within sight of the $1,000-an-ounce barrier broken on futures markets on Thursday. US crude oil for April delivery fell 43 cents to $109.90 a barrel. The contract touched a record for the seventh time in a row in the previous session at $111 a barrel. European stock traders were cautious about Thursday's gains on Wall ST "We can't quite join in on the US markets' confidence," said Susanne, Lahmann, strategist at German regional bank Bremer Landesbank. European shares regained early losses, however, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 0.2 percent, led by banks and mining stocks. But steadier European markets looked unlikely to feed into further gains at the US open. By 1207 GMT, Dow Jones futures were down 0.7 percent and Standard & Poor's 500 futures were down 0.6 percent. And earlier, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average closed at a more than 2-1/2 year low. It closed down 1.54 percent at 12,241.60. The broader TOPIX closed down by 1.9 percent at 1,193.23. Long-term funds remained gloomy. "Investors have moved on from debating `will there be a US recession' to `how long might the period of weak growth last' and `how widespread could a global downturn become'?", said Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at Standard Life Investments, which has some $286 billion worth of assets under manageme
