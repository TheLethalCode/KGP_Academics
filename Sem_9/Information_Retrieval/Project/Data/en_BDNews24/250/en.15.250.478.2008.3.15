 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.comJatiya Olama Party chairman Maulana Mujibur Rehman said Saturday action would be taken on the streets if the government did not cancel the draft women's development policy 2008. Speaking at a roundtable discussion on "Women's rights in Islam and the policy announced by the government" organised by the Islamic Inheritance Law Protection Movement at Grand Azad Hotel, the party chairman said the government cannot change a law which has been ordained by Islam for the last 1400 years. "The government has violated the basic principles of Islam by approving women's equal share in inheritance and earned property in the draft women's development policy," Rehman said. The council of advisers approved the draft policy on Feb 24. Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan secretary general Maulana Zafarullah Khan presented the key-note paper at the round table discussion. He said that by proposing equal rights for women in inheritance the government has dishonoured the principle of the holy Quran. National Awami Party chairman Sheikh Anwarul Haque said the council of advisers would have to resign if the controversial law was not withdrawn in the next seven days. Bangladesh Muslim League secretary general Atiqul Islam said Islam has clearly protected women's right by giving a share in the property of father and husband. Monthly Madina editor Mohiuddin Khan said the people of the country resisted Ayub Khan's anti-Islam family law in the 60s. He said he believed that this time also people would come forward to resist anti-Islamic laws. He said the suicidal decision was taken at the behest of Western influencers. Other speakers at the roundtable said the responsibility of this government is to expedite elections. The government does not have the mandate to take any decision on fundamental issues. Ameer of Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan Ahmadullah Ashraf presided over the discussion. New Nation editor Mostafa Kamal Majumder and Jatiya Ganotantrik Party chairman Shafiul Alam Prodhan were among the speakers. bdnew
