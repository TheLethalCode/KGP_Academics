The prosecutor identified the person being held as a trader from a subsidiary of SocGen. In January, SocGen unveiled 4.9 billion euros ($7.53 billion) of losses which the bank blamed on rogue deals carried out by Jerome Kerviel, a 31-year old junior trader at the bank. The losses have made SocGen a possible bid target. Earlier, Europe 1 radio station reported that police had arrested an employee from SocGen's trading room as part of their investigation into the affair. "A former colleague of Jerome Kerviel was arrested this morning," the radio station reported.

Europe 1 radio added that the person held was among one of Kerviel's friends listed on the Facebook Internet social networking site. The radio station did not give the full identity of the individual
