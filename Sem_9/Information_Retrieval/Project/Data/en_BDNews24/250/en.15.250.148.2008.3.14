 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index turned flat by midday on Friday as food retailers weighed after a bearish Goldman Sachs note, though miners were in demand and drugmaker Shire climbed on bid talk. Shire rose as much as 10 percent before paring gains to trade up 5.4 percent as traders reported talk of bid interest from U.S. rival Pfizer. Shire declined to comment, while Pfizer could not immediately be reached for comment. By 1135 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 3.2 points at 5,689.2, after losing 1.5 percent on Thursday. "We had a very turbulent few days. Markets have been very volatile. They tried to recover earlier in the week but that was immediately met by resistance," said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads. "We remain firmly in the mid-5,000 level, which is where the index seems to be in a bit of a comfort zone. It doesn't seem to want to rally, so the pressure is on the downside at the moment." Miners were the standout performers after spot gold jumped and held within the sight of $1,000 an ounce. Copper rose nearly 2 percent. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Lonmin, Kazakhmys, Antofagasta and Anglo American were up between 0.9 and 1.8 percent. Xstrata added 0.4 percent, extending the previous session's 1.8 percent gain on market talk that Brazil's Vale had clinched a deal to buy commodity trader Glencore's stake in Xstrata at 42 pounds a share. But food retailers took a beating after Goldman Sachs downgraded its ratings and targets on Tesco, Morrison Supermarkets and Sainsbury. Tesco shed 3 percent, Morrison Supermarkets fell 5.1 percent and Sainsbury lost 1.7 percent. Major European indexes were also weaker by mid-session, while the dollar edged back from a record low against the euro and a basket of major currencies. US index futures slipped as investors geared up for consumer prices data, due at 1230 GMT, for further clues on US inflation picture. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average hit its lowest close for more than two and a half years on Friday. Rate futures now indicate an 88 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate by a further 75 basis points at the US central bank's next rate-setting meeting next Tuesday. Banks, however, were generally firmer after their recent battering. Royal Bank of Scotland put on 0.2 percent, HBOS added 0.7 percent, Lloyds TSB gained 0.6 percent and HSBC rose 0.6 percent. International Power advanced 2.3 percent after Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating on the stock to "buy" from "hol
