<TITLE> No new law on women's inheritance: Hassan Ariff </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has not formulated any new law on women's inheritance, an adviser said Thursday. "The government will not formulate any law that contradicts Islam," law and religious affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff told reporters after a discussion meeting with religious leaders in Chittagong. "It (the government) does not have any intention to perform any work that needs a change to Sharia law, and it won't in future either," he said. The adviser's comments came in the wake of recent threats from certain religious quarters to launch a movement against the National Women's Development Policy. The religious leaders asked the adviser to punish, whom they termed, the miscreants who spread adverse comments against Islam. Jamiatul Falah mosque Khatib Maolana Jalaluddin Al Quaderi said, "No law contradictory to the Quran or Hadith can be formulated in Bangladesh." "Allah has given the benefits of women's empowerment in the Quran. Nobody has the right to breach it," he said. Chittagong Medical College Khatib Maolana Faruque Siddiqui said, "Women are being divested of their rights announced in different areas. Action should be taken against the deprivers." Women affairs adviser Rasheda K Choudhury also said Wednesday that the recently announced women's development policy did not contradict any part of the Quran or Hadith. bdnews24.
