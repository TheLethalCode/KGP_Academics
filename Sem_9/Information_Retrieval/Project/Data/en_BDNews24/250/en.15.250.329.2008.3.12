 KARACHI, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are on the decline and Pakistan would have had a good opportunity to beat them had the world champions not postponed their planned tour, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson said on Wednesday. Australia were due to visit Pakistan at the end of this month for a 30-day tour but the trip has been put on hold after a spate of suicide bombings following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto late last year. "Australia at the moment are more vulnerable than ever before. We had a good opportunity to beat them in the tests and one-dayers," Lawson told Geo channel on Wednesday. Australia were always a hard side to beat but they were more on the decline than on the rise at the moment, he added. "I thought we had a good chance to beat them. That is why it is all the more disappointing they are not coming now." Cricket Australia have said they were ready to reschedule the tour when conditions improved in Pakistan but do not see a window for a series until 2009 or 2010. Lawson described Australia's decision to postpone the tour as "unjustified". Pakistan has finalised a five match one-day series with Bangladesh in April but Lawson said it would not fill the void left by Australia's postponement. "Bangladesh is an improving side. But obviously the Australians are the side to beat," he said. Peter Young, public relations manager of Cricket Australia, told Geo that Australia were still keen to play in Pakistan. "We remain committed to tour Pakistan as soon as the situation improves." Australia are due to take part in the ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September. Young said Australia hoped the security situation would improve in the next six months to allow them to play in the tournamen
