<TITLE> Oil groups may avoid spill liability:court adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Luxembourg, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A European Court of Justice judge advising on the "Erika" oil spill case involving French oil group Total said on Thursday companies which do not intentionally cause damage could be excluded from liability. In a non-binding opinion, Advocate General Juliane Kokott said the European Union's "polluter-pays" principle could justify liability for pollution damage. But "it is also compatible with the polluter-pays principle to exclude from liability for oil pollution damage those who did not cause that pollution either intentionally or recklessly," the court said in a statement summing up her view. Total agreed in January to pay a total of 200 million euros ($307.3 million) in damages to victims who agree to drop charges but is challenging a French court ruling blaming it for the 1999 spill, one of France's worst environmental disasters. The ECJ follows the opinions of its advocates general in a majority of cases
