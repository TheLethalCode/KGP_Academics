 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  US congressman Joseph Crowley Wednesday said Bangladesh needed to hold free, fair and transparent elections if it wanted to enjoy continued US support.

Crowley, co-chair of US Congressional Bangladesh Caucus, made the remarks at a meeting with the Bangladesh embassy officials at the Capitol Hill in Washington DC, according to a foreign ministry press statement. The Congressional caucus had such formal meeting for the first time with the Bangladesh mission officials. Crowley underlined the need for following due legal process in the trial of the anticorruption cases, the statement said.
