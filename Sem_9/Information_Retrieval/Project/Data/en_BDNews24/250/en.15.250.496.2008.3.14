<TITLE> China dissident Hu Jia to stand trial Tuesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prominent Chinese human rights campaigner Hu Jia will face trial on subversion charges next Tuesday, his lawyer and sources close to the family said. Prosecutors will tell the First Intermediate Court in Beijing that Hu "incited subversion of state power and the socialist system" in essays published on the Internet and interviews with foreign reporters, his lawyer Li Fangping said. "The view of his lawyers now is that he is not guilty, and I believe that's how he will argue," Li said. Hu's trial and any possible later conviction are set to become a focus for critics of China's strict controls on dissent and political activity ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games, which start on Aug 8. A 34-year-old Beijing-based advocate for AIDS sufferers, Tibetan autonomy and democratic rights, Hu was detained by police in late December after spending much of 2007 under house arrest. His wife Zeng Jinyan and young child remain under house arrest, and her telephone contacts blocked. Chinese authorities sometimes hold subversion trials against dissidents in closed court. Li said Hu's trial should be at least formally open to Chinese citizens, but there Hu's wife and fellow activist Zeng Jinyan may be barred from attending. "The judge told me that the prosecution has named Zeng Jinyan as a witness and she may be excluded from the trial, but there's been no firm and final decision yet," Li said. A source close to Hu's family said his wife Zeng would try to attend the trial and see her husband for the first time since he was detained. Hu's trial will come the same day that China's Communist Party-run parliament ends its annual session, and when Premier Wen Jiabao will give a live-to-air news conference.
