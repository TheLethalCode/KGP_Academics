 BRUSSELS, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union has renegotiated its single biggest fishing deal, lowering its fee to Mauritania and nearly halving the amount of fish it takes. The EU has signed more than 20 bilateral fishing agreements, mostly with developing countries in Africa, that substantially oversupply the bloc and convinced the EU Commission of the need to lower them. From a four-year period starting in August, the EU will pay Mauritania 75.25 million euros ($117.3 million) a year for the right to fish in its waters, down from 86 million euros now -- or almost a third of Mauritania's national revenue. The EU's permitted Mauritanian catch will fall to 250,000 tonnes from 440,000 tonnes. Octopus, crab and crawfish, as well as sardines, anchovies and lobster are the main catches. Conservationists and anti-poverty activists have long criticised the EU's fisheries agreements with developing countries, slamming the deals as a "fish, pay and go" policy. "This new protocol better responds than the current one to Mauritania's needs in terms of sustainable development of its national fisheries sector, and also takes into account the changes in the European fleet operating in Mauritanian waters," the Commission said in a statement. EU ministers will discuss the revised deal in April, as well as how to carve up Mauritanian fishing quotas by EU state. At present, 200 boats flying the flags of some 13 EU nations fish in Mauritanian wate
