 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index edged up early on Friday after the previous session's sharp losses, as miners rebounded and Prudential rose on comments that it aimed for a progressive dividend, though food retailers weighed. Miners were the standout performers after spot gold jumped and held within sight of the $1,000-an-ounce barrier. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Kazakhmys, Lonmin, and Antofagasta gained between 1.2 and 2.2 percent. Xstrata put on 0.8 percent, extending the previous session's 1.8 percent gains on market talk that Brazil's Vale had clinched a deal to buy commodity trader Glencore's stake in Xstrata at 42 pounds a share. By 0855 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 17.9 points, or 0.3 percent at 5,710.3, after losing 1.5 percent on Thursday. "Investors remain extremely nervous," said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. "Next week there are a number of big investment banks reporting in the States, and of course the Fed's decision on interest rates. There might well be some squaring off the books ahead of what could be another volatile week." Prudential advanced 1.8 percent after the insurer posted broadly in-line 2007 earnings and CEO Mark Tucker said Prudential aimed for progressive dividend. Major European indexes also traded higher in early session, while the dollar fell back below the key 100-yen mark. U.S. stock markets rose on Thursday after credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said the end to subprime-related writedowns was in sight, triggering a rebound in financial shares. But in Asia, Japan's Nikkei average hit its lowest close for more than two and a half years on Friday. Food retailers were off after Goldman Sachs issued a bearish note on the sector, downgrading its ratings and price targets on Tesco, Morrison Supermarkets and Sainsbury. Tesco shed 1.7 percent, Morrison Supermarkets fell 3 percent and Sainsbury lost 0.8 percent. Banks were generally firmer, with Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, HBOS and Lloyds TSB up between 0.6 and 1.4 percent. Investors will get further clarity on U.S. inflation picture with February consumer prices data, due at 1230 GMT. Futures now indicate an 88 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate by a further 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's next rate-setting meeting on March
