<TITLE> England's Anderson injures ankle playing soccer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler James Anderson has thrown an injury scare into his team's hopes of winning the second test against New Zealand when he injured his left ankle playing soccer after the third day's play on Saturday. Anderson, who took 5-73 to rip through New Zealand's first innings on Friday, was seen walking with the aid of crutches as the team left the Basin Reserve. England were 277-9 at the close of play, a lead of 421, and will have almost two days to bowl New Zealand out and level the three test series when play resumes on Sunday. An England team spokesman told reporters the 25-year-old had turned his left ankle during a game of soccer between members of the England team after the day's play ended. Anderson had been receiving ice treatment to reduce the likelihood of swelling, but the spokesman said there were no plans to send him to hospital for scans. His condition would be reviewed on Sunday. Anderson is due to join Monty Panesar at the wicket when play resumes, though of more concern would be whether he can bowl after New Zealand struggled to handle his swing and seam in the first innings, when they were bowled out for 198. New Zealand won the first match of the three-test series in Hamilton by 189 runs. The third test begins in Napier on March 2
