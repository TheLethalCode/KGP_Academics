 Atlanta, March 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A heavy storm and possible tornado damaged buildings in downtown Atlanta on Friday night, including the roof of the Georgia Dome where thousands were watching a college basketball game, witnesses and local media said. Police reported minor injuries from the storm. They evacuated the Omni hotel, which is in the same building as the CNN Center, after high winds smashed windows. Officials temporarily halted the game between Mississippi State and the University of Alabama at the nearby Georgia Dome as high winds damaged the roof, sparking alarm and causing a large monitor hanging high above the court to sway ominously. A later game in the same stadium was postponed. The heavy rain and lightning storm appeared to start north of the city and sweep through downtown at about 9:45 p.m. (0145 GMT on Saturday), witnesses said. Thousands of spectators were also attending a National Basketball Association game between the Los Angeles Clippers and Atlanta Hawks at the Philips Arena, adjacent to the CNN Center complex. The game ended at about 10 p.m. (0200 GMT on Saturday). There were no immediate reports of damage at that arena.
