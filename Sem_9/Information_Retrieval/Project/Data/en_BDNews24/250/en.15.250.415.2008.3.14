 BRUSSELS, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain and France pushed for the European Union to cut sales tax on green products on Friday even though the head of the European Commission voiced strong reservations about the idea. "We are writing to you today to call upon the European Commission to include provisions for a new reduced VAT (value added tax) rate for environmentally friendly products," British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a letter to Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.

"We are informed that some member states, they do not accept this idea," Barroso said on Thursday. "We have to make an impact assessment of that proposal to see exactly if it can work. There we have some doubts," he said, adding it was also unclear what would be the impact on tax revenue streams. British diplomats said they would be satisfied with a commitment from the Commission to study the idea, which was first put forward by Britain and France last year but got nowhere.
