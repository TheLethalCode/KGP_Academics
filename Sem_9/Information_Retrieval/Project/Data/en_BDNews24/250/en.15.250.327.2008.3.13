<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The UK government is introducing a new points-based immigration system modelled on the Australian system to attract 'highly skilled' and 'skilled' professionals from Bangladesh to Britain. With the introduction of the new system, low-skilled Bangladeshis will no more be able to go to Britain for work. "There is no plan to roll out to tier-3. There is no scheme under the current immigration law for Bangladesh to supply Britain with low skilled workers, and would not be under the point-based system," Jonathan Verney, head of immigration at the British High Commission in Dhaka, told a seminar on the UK visa at a city hotel Thursday. Some 500,000 Bangladeshis live in the UK, a large number of whom are low-skilled. There are five categories in the upcoming new point-based immigration system: highly skilled migrant programme (tier-1), skilled workers with a job offer (tier-2), low skilled workers (tier-3), students (tier-4) and youth mobility scheme (tier-5). The highly skilled people would include scientists and entrepreneurs, and the tier-1 programme will start this summer. Tier-2 will start this Autumn while there is no plan for the tier-3 to start. "The scheme is designed to attract the most talented with skills the UK needs to remain a global leader in the field of finance, business, and technological innovation," said Verney. There are four categories of the tier-1: general, investor, entrepreneurs and post-study. Immigrants with high-skilled jobs in the UK will be in the general category, Hasina Rahman, the entry clearance officer at the British High Commission told the seminar. People studying or have finished studies in the UK and could contribute to the economy would be able to apply under tier-1, Hasina said. For genuine business people, the high commission would offer special visa services. They include entitles to unlimited entries to the UK for five years for a maximum length for six months each time, she said. The business people would need to go for biometrics enrolment only once and save time. The visa would be transferred from one passport to another without charge. They would be considered "trusted travellers" by the UK and other countries. The business people having letter of support from the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI) and the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries (CCCI) would be given that special visa service and their application processed within five working days, said Hasina. The UK high commission later signed a memorandum of understanding with the DCCI to provide the genuine businessmen with special visa services. bdnews
