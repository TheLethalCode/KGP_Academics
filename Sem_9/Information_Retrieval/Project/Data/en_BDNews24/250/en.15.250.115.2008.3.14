 JAKARTA, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indonesian court on Friday sentenced a senior official of the country's judicial monitoring body to eight years in prison for accepting $95,000 in an illegal cash payoff related to a land deal.

The judge also ordered him to a pay a fine of 400 million rupiah ($43,430) or serve an additional six months in jail. Joenoes denied any wrongdoing to reporters and said he would appeal the verdict.
