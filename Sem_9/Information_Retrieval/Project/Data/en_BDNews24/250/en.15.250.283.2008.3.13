 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  Ailing former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was unable to appear in court Thursday to face charges in a graft case involving illegal contracts for the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "Sheikh Hasina was scheduled to appear before the special court this morning. But her doctors advised against moving her from hospital." Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, adjourned the charge framing proceedings until Mar 17. Among the other accused in the case, former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury was present in the court. The rest are currently fugitive. Arriving in the court at 10 am, defense counsels argued that as Sheikh Hasina, accused in the case, could not be produced in court they could not take part in the charge framing proceedings in her absence. The defense team appealed to the court for an adjournment. The prosecution lawyers opposed the move, saying charge framing could continue in the absence of the accused, which was perfectly legal as Hasina had her legal counsels present in the court. The judge however adjourned proceedings to Mar 17. Sheikh Hasina was admitted to Square Hospital Tuesday for medical treatment. Specialist doctors have advised that she should be sent abroad for proper treatment. The former prime minister was produced before court on Mar 9, when her defense lawyers appealed for deferment of proceedings for a few days taking Hasina's medical condition into consideration. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people including Hasina. The antigraft body accused Hasina and the others of being variously involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding contracts to set up three barge-mounted power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. The ACC also accused Hasina of receiving a large part of the bribe money in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdne
