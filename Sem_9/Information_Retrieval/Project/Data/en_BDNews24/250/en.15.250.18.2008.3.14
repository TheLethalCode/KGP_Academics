 March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranians voted on Friday in a parliamentary election that conservatives are expected to win after many pro-reform politicians who oppose hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were barred from the race. Following are some quotes from Iranian leaders, politicians and ordinary voters: SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI "For our country and our nation it is a sensitive day and a sensitive moment that will determine the (nation's) fate," he said after casting his vote soon after polling stations opened. "People in choosing parliamentarians should also consider ... voting for those who can pave the way for the current government which is active and willing to serve," he was quoted as saying in Iranian newspapers on Thursday. PRESIDENT MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD "The election belongs to people and is a reflection of people's will in governing the country ... Our revolution means the presence of people." FORMER PRESIDENT AKBAR HASHEMI RAFSANJANI "Parliament is very important. One reason is that it should approve ministers. It also has the right to impeach." "Our enemies outside the country prefer that we have a weak parliament and that participation would be low to indicate a gap between people and the system. All should try to take part in the election and show their opposition in other arenas." MEHDI KAROUBI, head of the pro-reform National Trust party "Based on the promises that the Interior Minister has given about safeguarding the votes, I am optimistic and hopeful for the health of the election. Currently some members of the National Trust party are present at polling stations as supervisors and will report any irregularities," he was quoted as saying by Mehr News Agency. FATEMEH KAROUBI, a candidate and wife of Mehdi Karoubi "If people participate in this election, reformists will have a better chance of winning more seats. I believe that this (new) parliament will be more moderate than the current one. We don't need extremists from either side," she told Reuters. HASSAN SIAVASHI, 45, a government employee waiting to vote in Tehran when polling stations opened "It is my religious duty to vote. I want to be the first one to cast a vote today. I pray that God will help Ahmadinejad's group to win." FERESHTEH JANNATI, 25, a civil servant waiting for a bus in Tehran "I won't vote because I don't have faith in these candidates." VAHID SAEEDI, 22, an engineer in Tehran "I will definitely vote, it is my duty and I am sure that by voting I can make a difference in my country's destiny, even if it is a small difference." MOHAMMAD ZIAFATI, 62, retired teacher in central Tehran "I will vote. We have to support reformists. And if we don't vote reformists' opponents will take more seats. So it is better to vote than to stay away." FARNAK, 25, a housewife shopping in north Tehran "I have more important things to do than voting. The result is clear. Ahmadinejad's supporters will win again, so why should I bother." Like others critical of the government, she declined to give her full name. HASSANALI, 38, a shopkeeper in Tehran "This is before Noruz (the Iranian New Year on March 20), I don't have time to vote because I need to earn more money because of this inflation. Why should i vote again? What was the result of the previous vote? Only high inflation." BIBI ZAHRA, an elderly woman at a central Tehran polling station "My son told me I should vote. I don't know who I am voting for, he filled the form for me and I think it is better to vote, as my son sai
