 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)Retired brigadier general ASM Hannan Shah Friday demanded release of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina before parliamentary elections, promised by year-end. Hannan Shah, Khaleda's adviser, also demanded that national elections be held in line with the roadmap announced by the Election Commission. "We want the elections this year as declared in the roadmap. At the same time, we demand that all detained political leaders including former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina be freed before the elections," he told a roundtable at the National Press Club. "The two leaders are languishing in jail as the 'minus two' formula failed," he said. Criticising the Election Commission, Hannan Shah said: "The commission took eight months to register less than half the voting population." The senior BNP leader criticised the idea of holding upazila elections ahead of parliamentary polls. "Hold the national polls first and then let's go for the upazila and other elections," he demanded. The roundtable on democracy and constitution, organised by Chirantan Bangladesh, a new citizens' committee, was also addressed by BNP joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy. "We must chase the culprits and villains out of the scene by forging solidarity among us," Gayeshwar said. Gayeshwar also opposed the idea of holding local elections before the national polls and said: "Lists are already being prepared of those who would be made chairmen and members of local government bodies. I don't know what is waiting for us in future." bdnew
