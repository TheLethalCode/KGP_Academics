 LJUBLJANA, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union and the United States tried on Thursday to iron out differences over Washington's decision to sign separate visa deals with individual EU members instead of the bloc as a whole. EU Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini and the bloc's Slovenian Presidency started talks with US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, after tensions within the EU and with Washington over the visa deals. Frattini insisted Brussels wants all EU member states to be treated the same way and to enter the US visa waiver programme by October, even if political talks with individual states could continue in parallel. "My proposal will be to go ahead with political discussions from now until the summit in June ... and then to introduce visa waiver programmes for all members states in October," he said. "One thing is to sign a memorandun of understanding which is a political document, another is to negotiate on a bilateral basis what electronic travel authorisation should be," he added, referring to a US requirement that citizens from countries in the visa waiver programme fill out forms on the internet ahead of flying to the United States. Most EU states are already part of the US visa waiver programme, which allows people to travel without visas, but not 11 of the 12 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007, along with older member Greece. The United States wants deals with individual states, but Chertoff brushed aside differences ahead of the talks. "I think that reports on differences of opinions are much exaggerated," Chertoff told reporters. "We do our arrangements with individual countries but I think we can do it in a way that is consistent with the EU principles but that will still allow the countries which are ready to do so without delay," he added. EU diplomats agreed on Wednesday to defuse the crisis by adopting a "twin-track" approach allowing both individual and EU talks, Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra told Reuters. One EU diplomat said Chertoff and Frattini could agree on a similar stance on Thursday. While Brussels has pressd for a blanket agreement for all EU countries not yet in the programme, some of the bloc's new member states, eager for quick visa-free travel, broke ranks and agreed to forge ahead with individual pacts. Washington signed separate deals with the Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia, under which these new EU members agreed to enhanced cooperation on air security in return for a quick prospect for entering the visa waiver programme, undermining EU unity on the issue and angering a number of other EU states. Hungary expects to sign a similar deal later this mon
