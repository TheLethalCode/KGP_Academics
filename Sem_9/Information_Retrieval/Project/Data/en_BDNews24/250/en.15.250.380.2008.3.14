 Tehran, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polling stations opened on Friday for Iran's parliamentary election that conservatives are expected to win after many opponents of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were barred from running. State radio reported polling stations opened their doors to voters at 8 a.m. (0430 GMT). They are due to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT) but in past elections the deadline has been extended.
