<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com) - The same court that ordered the return of Sheikh Hasina's seized passport on Wednesday suspended the effectiveness of the order on Thursday for two weeks. A sub-inspector of the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani requested on behalf of the state that the earlier order be suspended. Sub-inspector Ali Noor said the magistrate gave the order on Wednesday without hearing from the government and without seeking any report from the investigation officer on the return of the seized passport. He asked that the effectiveness of the order be suspended for three weeks so that the government could be given time to reply to the order. The magistrate accordingly suspended his own earlier order for two weeks. Dhanmondi police seized Sheikh Hasina's passport when the former prime minister was arrested on July 16 last year. Hasina's lawyers Shahara Khatun and Md Kamrul Islam appealed to the court on Wednesday to return the passport into her own keeping so she may travel to the USA for medical treatment if necessary. The magistrate issued a verbal order to that effect Wednesday noon and a written order in the evening for the return of Hasina's passport. Asked about the suspension of the order Thursday, Shahara Khatun told bdnews24.com: "The same magistrate has suspended the order for two weeks." Sheikh Hasina's lawyers also requested the magistrate's court Wednesday for return of a Mercedes Benz car and a number of documents belonging to the former prime minister that were seized at the same time as the passport. The magistrate sought the report of the investigation officer Wednesday for return of those items. bdnew
