 MITROVICA, Kosovo, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A couple of hundred ethnic Serb protesters took over a United Nations court in the flashpoint town of Mitrovica in north Kosovo on Friday after UN police guarding the compound retreated. Kosovo's Serb minority, some 120,000 people among 2 million Albanians, reject Kosovo's Feb. 17 secession from Serbia. The Serbian government has vowed to never accept it and to extend its authority over Serb areas in the territory's north. The protesters had been outside the building for several weeks, preventing Albanian court workers from crossing the bridge over the Ibar River that divides Mitrovica into a Serb north and an Albanian south.

"Those who turned to violence in north Mitrovica have crossed one of UNMIK's red lines," Joachim Ruecker, head of the UN mission in Kosovo, said in a statement. "I have instructed UNMIK police to restore law and order ... and ensure that the court house is again under UN control." He said he had asked the Serbian government to prevent such attacks, adding that "UNMIK will defend its mandate throughout the whole territory of Kosovo without exception". Serbia lost control of the southern province in 1999, when NATO intervened to halt the ethnic cleansing of civilians in a counter-insurgency war, and the United Nations took over. Kosovo's secession was backed by the United States and the European Union, which is deploying a supervisory mission to take over some of the UN's tas
