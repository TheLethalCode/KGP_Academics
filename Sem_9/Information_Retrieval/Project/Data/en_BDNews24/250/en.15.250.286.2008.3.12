 HARARE, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, fighting a tough campaign for re-election this month, has promised big salary increases to restive government workers, state media reported on Wednesday. Mugabe, 84, faces the greatest challenge to his 28-year hold on power. Two rivals accuse him of bringing about a severe economic crisis and of them said on Wednesday he believed the opposition could win even though the vote would be rigged.

Mugabe has tried to woo mainly rural voters with farm equipment and subsidised loans.
