 LONDON, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncertainty about the health of the financial sector on Wednesday erased some of the euphoria over central bank moves to ease credit market stress, although European and Asian stocks put in solid gains. Wall Street, however, looked set to open weaker after large rises on Tuesday and the dollar weakened against major currencies with the euro heading towards a new high. Oil fell back a bit from its near-$110 a barrel high. Deep concerns among investors about the threat of another round of last year's credit crisis were at least temporarily assuaged on Tuesday when the US Federal Reserve said it would allow financial firms to swap securities backed by home mortgages for some $200 billion in Treasury bonds. This was supported by other liquidity-inducing efforts by the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank. The moves spurred the S&P 500 index of leading US stocks to its biggest daily gain since October 2002 with a 3.71 percent rise, a mood that continued to spill over into Asia and Europe on Wednesday. "The central banks coordinating to inject liquidity to try to ease fears in the credit markets and make sure (the stress) doesn't translate through to the real economy is good for the economy," said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas in Paris. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.2 percent, having gained the same amount on Tuesday. Earlier, Asian stocks, as measured by MSCI, rose 1.7 percent. Despite the immediate euphoria, however, investors remain worried about world credit markets, where trading in a broad range of securities including some euro zone government bonds and U.S. municipal bonds had seized up over the past week. Credit Suisse, for example, said it did not believe the problems would go away. "We expect to see more hedge fund collapses, more forced sales and more extreme price movements in the near term," it said in a note. DOLLAR WEAK, OIL STEADY The dollar, which has been battered by the deteriorating U.S. economy and prospects of lower U.S. interest rates, fell back towards record lows versus the euro. "It's a bit of a reality check. The Fed's action obviously is welcome but it doesn't really fix the economy," said Martin McMahon, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. The dollar fell more than 1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 72.532, edging towards a record low of 72.462 set at the end of last week. It also eased 1 percent to 102.36 yen. The euro was up nearly 1 percent at $1.5478. Oil prices were steady after hitting a record near $110 overnight, doing little to ease concerns about the world economy. US crude for April delivery was down 13 cents at $108.67 a barrel, not far from below its record $109.72. The June Bund future was 4 ticks up at 117.50. Two-year yields were 3.9 basis points higher at 3.3359 percent, while 10-year yields were down 1.5 basis points at 3.781 perce
