 BRUSSELS, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende has warned European leaders of a possible backlash against European interests over a Dutch video which criticises the Koran, diplomats said on Friday. Right-wing parliamentarian Geert Wilders, who says the Koran is a "fascist" book that incites violence, plans to show the 15-minute film this month despite appeals from the Dutch government. "Prime Minister Balkenende indicated it might trigger fierce reactions abroad which could possibly hit Dutch interests but also have a spill-over effect on other European countries," a Dutch diplomat said after summit talks late on Thursday night. "They (the EU leaders) agreed to keep in close contact on this," the diplomat added. Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, whose country faced riots and attacks on its embassies after Danish newspapers published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in 2006, said after the meeting that the Netherlands could count on EU solidarity. Asked what lessons he drew from the cartoon case, Rasmussen told reporters: "It is fruitful to have a firm stance concerning freedom of expression." He said it was up to the Dutch government whether to allow the video to be broadcast. TROUBLES FOR NATO? About 15,000 people protested in Afghanistan on Saturday, some burning Dutch and Danish flags in protest at Wilders' film and to condemn the reprinting of the cartoon of Mohammad. Wilders, who is the target of death threats on Islamic militant Web sites, has given few details about his film. He said last week he was disappointed no Dutch broadcaster wanted to show it, and plans to screen it at the parliament's press centre in the Hague collapsed over a row about who would fund the necessary additional security. There are some concerns within NATO that the controversy surrounding the video could make things worse for the 43,000-strong NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. Belgium's ambassador to NATO, Franciskus van Daele, told a conference in Brussels on Wednesday: "The Dutch government has done a superb job in trying to limit the potential collateral damages (of the controversy)." Dutch businesses fear a loss of trade in Muslim countries and Dutch embassies are braced for attacks. The Netherlands raised its national risk level to "substantial" earlier this month ahead of the film's release. At least 50 people were killed and three Danish embassies attacked after cartoons of Prophet Mohammad, one showing him with a turban resembling a bomb, appeared in a Danish newspaper. Fearing a similar backlash against the Netherlands, the Dutch government has not only urged him not to broadcast but has distanced itself from his views and is mulling an outright ban. Criticisms and warnings against broadcasting the movie are coming from one Muslim country after another. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, said on Friday the film could derail inter-faith dialogue and threaten peace. The Dutch diplomat said there was no mention of a ban in the discussion Thursday nig
