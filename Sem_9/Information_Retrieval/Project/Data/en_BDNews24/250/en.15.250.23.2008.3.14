<TEXT>
 PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said on Friday he heard the people's voice in last weekend's watershed elections and admitted it would be `the last of him' if he doesn't live up to their expectations. Abdullah also said he would use his "strong majority" to tackle the core election issues of inflation, crime and corruption that hammered his ruling coalition. "I heard what the people wanted me to hear," he told Reuters and CNBC in a joint interview at his residence in Putrajaya, the nation's administrative capital. In the wide-ranging interview, his first with foreign media since the elections, he also dismissed a call by one of his ruling party members for his resignation following the poll debacle, stressing that the majority was still with him. "We were returned with a very strong majority ... That to me is a responsibility," the 68-year-old leader said. "I have listened to them and I know if I don't improve, that will be the last of me." "The majority is still with me," he added. "I'm in charge." His National Front coalition was ousted in five of Malaysia's 13 states and lost the two-thirds majority in parliament it had held for nearly four decades at the elections. The surprise upset spooked the financial markets, with the stock market plunging nearly 10 percent on Monday partly in reaction to the political uncertainties ahead. Abdullah, who was sworn in into office on Monday for a new five-year term, said he did not see a threat to his rule from his deputy, Najib Razak, or opposition figure Anwar Ibrahim. "I have full confidence in him (Najib)," he said. "On Anwar, it's up to him on how he wants to play his political game." Abdullah also said it would be business as usual in Malaysia despite the election setback, but promised he would step up project implementations and improve transparency. "So it's implementation, implementation, implementation." MAINTAINING SUBSIDIES The election saw a backlash against his government over rising prices, and the opposition has promised to increase fuel subsidies and scrutinise some of the key development projects his government launched. Abdullah said the government will keep food and fuel subsidies despite record crude oil prices. "At the moment we are not intending to do that. But there will be some other measures that we need to take in not too long a time," he added. Queried further, he said: "There will be some other formula." Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who anointed Abdullah his successor but now has waning influence in the party, advised him on Sunday to take responsibility and quit and let Deputy Premier Najib Razak take over. Mahathir's son Mukhriz Mahathir, who has some support in the party, on Friday joined his father in demanding Abdullah's ouster. Abdullah said he was surprised by Mukhriz's call. The Front won just half the popular vote and 62 percent -- down from 90 percent -- of the seats in the 222-member national parliament. A protest vote from ethnic Chinese and Indians, upset over what they saw as racial inequality in terms of business, job and education opportunities, had been expected. But Malays, who are all Muslims and traditionally support the Front, completed a perfect storm for the government, giving the opposition Islamists a record vote to protest rising prices. Abdullah said the voters could have made a mistake by turning to the opposition. "If that was their mistake, they have to live with i
