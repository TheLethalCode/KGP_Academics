<TITLE> CNG becomes costlier soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The government is planning to raise the price of compressed natural gas (CNG) in a short time, a special aide to the chief adviser said Wednesday. However, oil prices would not be raised during the irrigation season, he added. "The price of CNG will be raised shortly, probably in March," Prof M Tamim, who oversees the energy and mineral resources ministry, told a Meet the Press, organised by the Forum for Energy Reporters, Bangladesh at the National Press Club. "The hike will be rational," Tamim said adding that the price of oil would also see an increase, "but not in the current irrigation season." He said the government was passing tough time since subsidies for oil and fertiliser eat up a big chunk of the national budget. "Of the total budget Tk 87,000 crore, the government has to provide Tk 14,000 crore as subsidy for oil and fertiliser. We are facing a food deficit also." "Subsidy in agriculture and power is essential, and we have to lift subsidy in other commercial sectors." He said that only 20 percent diesel was used in agriculture. On the power sector Tamim said: "The main problem with power is production. We have failed to set up an adequate number of power stations in accordance with the demand in a decade. We are trying to overcome the crisis." "We are able to produce 700/800 megawatt more power through maintaining and repairing the power stations. Some 100 MW power was added until December 2007.We will have a deficit of 500 MW to 800 MW in summer." "A further 1000 MW will be produced by the end of this year and some 2000 MW power will be added in 2011," he said. The special assistant said it was unfortunate that no gas exploration was carried out in the last decade. The last gas field was discovered in Bibiyana in 1999. No local company carried out drilling that time. "It was unfortunate," he said. "We are taking an initiative to excavate wells," he said. Tamim said that Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company would dig three wells in the next three years, adding that more wells would be explored. bdnews
