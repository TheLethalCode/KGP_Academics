 WELLINGTON, March 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand remained confident they could chase down England's target of more than 420 runs to wrap up the second test and series, pace bowler Kyle Mills said after the third day's play on Saturday. England, who already had a lead of 144 after the first innings, batted all day on Saturday to score 277-9 -- a lead of 421 -- to set New Zealand a daunting task on the final two days. The highest successful run chase at the Basin Reserve was the 277-3 achieved by Pakistan in Dec. 2003, while the highest fourth-innings total was the 286 by New Zealand against Sri Lanka in Dec. 2006. New Zealand has twice scored more than 400 in a fourth innings, but lost both matches. "We feel a tick over 400 is definitely gettable," Mills told reporters. "There's so much time left in the match. "There's two full days and if we can get a couple of batsmen in and post a good score it's definitely game on because we bat a long way down." Mills said the wicket had flattened out during the day, which augured well for the New Zealand batsmen on Sunday. "It definitely flattened out after the first half hour," Mills added. "I walked up to the first drink's break of the day and came to a good batting wicket. "Hopefully we can get the wicket fairly early tomorrow and hopefully there won't be many too clouds around, get that sun on the wicket and it can turn onto a flat (wicket). "If we get a day like today tomorrow and the (NZ) batsmen can get in and cement themselves I think it's game-on." PRETTY POSITIVE England, however, remained just as confident they could bowl New Zealand out again, but were more than aware of the length of time remaining in the game and the home side's aggressive batting lineup, all-rounder Paul Collingwood said. "The thing is there are still two days left in the game, which plenty of time to bowl them out but also plenty of time for them to get the runs," said Collingwood. "I think they will play the same way they are always playing and that's pretty positive. "That is a good thing for us because it gives us chances. "They're an aggressive side and if... they get four or five down, it'll be interesting to see how the McCullums and Orams come out to play it. "It's a big total but the wicket has played really well and we have to bowl well to stop them from getting the target
