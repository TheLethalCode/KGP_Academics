 NEW YORK, Mar 13 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Web search giant Google Inc plans to unveil a new service that Web publishers can use to manage their online ad sales and serve up ads each time a consumer pulls up a Web page, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The new Ad Manager service will provide the ad service free, said the Journal. Google is hoping that Ad Manager users will agree to carry some ads Google sells in any vacant ad spots on their own Web sites, and Google would take a commission on revenue from any ads it sells, said the report. A Google spokesperson was not immediately available.
