<TITLE> Need FX rate fall in deficit countries-BoE's Gieve </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The currencies of countries with big current account deficits will need to fall if global economic imbalances are to be unwound without too much pain, Bank of England Deputy Governor John Gieve said on Friday. Gieve, whose remit is financial stability, signalled little concern about the dollar's slide to a record low against the euro this week which has worried some policymakers in Europe and Japan. His comments also suggest the BoE would be happy to see a gradual weakening in the pound since Britain runs a large current account deficit. "If the slowdown is not to dominate, we need to see a shift in relative prices to relative demand -- that is a gradual real exchange rate depreciation of deficit countries against surplus ones," he said, according to the text of his speech. "There are signs that in the United States, at least, imbalances are beginning to adjust. The US current account deficit now looks past its peak and the marked fall in the dollar -- about 25 percent in real trade-weighted terms -- since its peak in early 2002 should help in the adjustment," he told a financial audience in London. RISK OF PAIN TRANSFER Gieve noted, however, that the dollar has fallen less against currencies of countries with the largest current account surpluses, such as China, than against many other currencies. "There is a risk, therefore, that the fall in the U.S. current deficit will not be matched by a fall of surpluses in high surplus countries but a rise in deficits in other deficit countries," he said. "The imbalances could be transferred, not reduced." Gieve said it was therefore important that the large gap between savings and investment in east Asian and oil exporting countries narrowed, although rising inflationary pressures there would limit increased spending in the near term. "More exchange rate flexibility should be helpful on both fronts," said Gieve, noting that it was encouraging that China was allowing more flexibility than in the past in its yuan exchange rate. He noted that Asian economies were still growing quite strongly, but it remained to be seen whether they could offset a U.S. slowdown. "I think the Asian economies are still growing strongly and that's good for the economy as a whole," Gieve said. "The question is more how effective those economies will be in a slowdown in America and the West more generall
