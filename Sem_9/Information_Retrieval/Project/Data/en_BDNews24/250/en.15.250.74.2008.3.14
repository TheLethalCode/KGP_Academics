<TEXT>
 DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Kurdish mayor went on trial on Friday for publishing a story book in the Turkish and Kurdish languages, in a case critics say highlights continued opposition to minority rights in Turkey. Turkey, under pressure from the European Union which it hopes to join, has eased some restrictions on the Kurds' language and culture in recent years but human rights groups say it must do more. "From the cultural viewpoint, I believe publishing a book in Turkish and Kurdish is not a crime," Osman Baydemir, mayor of Diyarbakir, largest city of mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey, told the court.

Many Turks regard the DTP, which has 20 members of parliament in Ankara, as a mouthpiece for the PKK rebels. This week, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan announced plans for a state television channel to broadcast in the Kurdish language along with investments in the southeast region totalling up to $12 billion over a five-year period. The DTP says the plans are not enough to cement peace in the southeast, where nearly 40,000 people have been killed in clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) separatist rebels since 1984. Turkish troops recently conducted a major eight-day ground offensive against PKK rebels in northern Ir
