<TITLE> Hasina being treated under 'political veil': AL leader </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)An Awami League spokesperson alleged Saturday that the government was giving Sheikh Hasina medical treatment under a political veil, reconstituting the physicians' panel formed by the Square Hospital authorities. "People are worried, as they are not receiving bulletins on her health condition, whether the AL president is suffering a 'slow poisoning'," Dhaka Metropolitan AL acting general secretary Kamrul Islam claimed in an extended meeting at the party office. "The personal physicians of Sheikh Hasina are being barred from providing their service. The government is delaying in sending her abroad by not forming a medical board immediately," Islam said. The same court that ordered the return of the former prime minister's passport scrapped the order the next day, he said, adding: "This is unjust." The meeting demanded the lifting of the state of emergency and holding of national elections. It also chalked out a programme on March 21 to hold prayers at religious centres for the recovery of the party chief. bdnews
