 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - London-listed hedge fund RAB Capital raised its 2007 dividend by 50 percent, sending its shares up nearly 7 percent despite news that assets under management fell 4.7 percent in the first two months of 2008. "The opening weeks of 2008 have seen a continuation of liquidity concerns, investor nervousness and high volatility for markets, presenting headwinds both for our investment strategies and for our distribution plans," RAB said in a statement. RAB reported profits on Friday broadly in line with analyst expectations with a 38 percent rise in assets to $7.24 billion for its financial year ending December and pre-tax profit up 1 percent to 51 million pounds ($103.8 million). "RAB's preliminary results are in line with the well-flagged guidance... Strong cash generation enabled RAB to raise the dividend by 50 percent (to 2.4 pence), ahead of our 2.0p estimate," Landsbanki analyst Katrina Preston said in a note. The stock has lost about a third of its value this year, rocked by concern that its stake in Northern Rock, where it is one of the biggest shareholders, will come to nothing following Britain's decision to nationalise the mortgage bank. Landsbanki's Preston noted the drop in assets under management and its cautious 2008 outlook. "This overall decline would imply RAB has suffered some net redemptions so far this year," she said. "We suspect RAB may struggle to grow earnings substantially in the current year, suggesting downgrades will be forthcoming." "We believe these factors could place our assumption of 25 percent earnings growth in jeopardy, albeit it is too early to extrapolate trends at this early stage." RAB shares were up 6.3 percent at 59p by 0901 GMT having hit 59-1/
