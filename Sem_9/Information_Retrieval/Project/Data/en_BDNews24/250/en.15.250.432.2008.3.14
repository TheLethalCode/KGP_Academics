 SALVADOR, Brazil, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Clapping her hands and nodding her head, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Friday heard Afro-Brazilians sing of the horror of slavery and the yearning for freedom in an 18th Century church built by and for slaves in the Brazilian city of Salvador. In a rare moment of sightseeing, Rice escaped her armored car and walked the cobble-stoned streets of this former slave port to tour the restored Baroque churches and palaces of Salvador's Pelourihno neighborhood. The area is named for the whipping post where slaves were once publicly flogged. The first African-American woman to serve as U.S. secretary of state, Rice has said she has long wanted to visit Bahia, the entry point for tens of thousands of Africans sold into slavery and still the heart of Afro-Brazilian culture. She began her tour at the historic church of Our Lady of the Rosary of the Black People, built over the course of a century by slaves at night, on holidays and in what free time they could find as a place of their own to worship in. Seated in the front pew, Rice nodded along as six members sang two songs -- one an ode to the slaves' longing for freedom and the other a tale of the pain and grief of being forcibly shipped from West Africa to the shores of Brazil. "A new day will arrive, a new heaven, a new land, a new sea. And on this day, the oppressed will sing to liberty in one single voice," the singers intoned. "What an amazing story," Rice told reporters. "It reminds me of how faith can help people to overcome anything." "It reminds me a little bit of peoples' lives during the terrible, horrific times of discrimination that none of us can even imagine. And I have never heard a more beautiful voice." Rice also visited a museum that displayed artifacts of the fusion of African and European culture that characterizes Bahia, the state with the largest Afro-Brazilian population. Rice was serenaded several times on her tour by percussion bands and she watched an open air performance of capoiera, a stylized dance that originated in a slave tradition as a way to camouflage martial arts training. Rice spliced in the visit to Salvador between meetings in the capital Brasilia on Thursday and a seven-hour stop she was to make in Santiago, Chile, later on Friday. She appeared to thoroughly enjoy her overnight stay in Salvador. At a dinner on Thursday night, she danced and played the tambourine with Gilberto Gil, the Brazilian singing star who is also minister of culture. Speaking to Gil, who wore long dreadlocks and an airy white shirt, she promised to listen to him play when he performs in Washington this summer. "I'm going to come to the concert," Rice said. Brazil imported more slaves from Africa than any other country in the Americas and was the last to abolish the practice, in 1888. African influences are an integral part of the national culture. Although Brazil prides itself on being a melting-pot nation, few Afro-Brazilians are represented in the higher ranks of the political and business world and blacks count for many of the country's po
