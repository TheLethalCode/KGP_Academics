 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi writer Tahmima Anam's book A Golden Age has won the Commonwealth Writers' 2008 Best First Book Award for the Europe and South Asia region. The novel, a densely packed, lyrically written narrative set during Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence, was praised by an international judging panel as "sensitive and evocative". Animal's People by Indra Sinha was given the region's Best Book Award. A Golden Age had previously also made the final shortlist of five for the 2007 Guardian's First Book Award. On hearing the news, Tahmima told London's The Guardian newspaper: "Over the years, many of my most cherished authors have been winners of the Commonwealth prize, and I'm deeply honoured to have been given the chance to be counted among them." "I'm particularly proud to be representing my country as the first regional winner from Bangladesh," said Tahmima, daughter of The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam. Every year, the Commonwealth prizes are given for the Best Book and Best First Book, valued at 1,000, in each of the four Commonwealth regions: Africa, Canada and the Caribbean, Europe and South Asia, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The judging committee for Europe and South Asia consisted of Professor Makarand Paranjape (India, chairperson), Professor Neloufer de Mel (Sri Lanka) and Donna Daley-Clarke (UK). bd
