<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  A group of academics said Saturday that the caretaker government had no authority to invite international bids for oil and gas exploration and must suspend all such activities. They made a number of recommendations including giving all necessary assistance and finance for seismic surveys to BAPEX, the state body for exploration and extraction of mineral resources. Dhaka University economics professor MM Akash read out the recommendations at a statement at a press conference at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, made by professors of economics, geology, international relations and sociology from Dhaka, Chittagong and Jahanginagar Univerisities among others. The statement said: "As the oil and gas reserves under the sea are people's property, and under the prevailing state of emergency people's fundamental rights remain suspended, the activities of leasing out people's property to foreigners should be suspended." The statement, made on behalf of civil society by academics concerned at the leasing out of national oil and gas reserves, suggested reformulating policy giving highest priority to internal use of the country's mineral resources. "A national institution will have to be appointed for all necessary surveys before signing any agreement with foreign companies," Prof Akash stated. "If necessary, the national institution BAPEX has to be restructured and be given all necessary assistance, financial and otherwise, for seismic surveys." "Every investment agreement will have to be meticulously reviewed by an expert committee formed with experts in the field," the statement further recommended. "In this case, complete transparency has to be ensured as was done in the formulation of the draft coal policy by the expert committee formed by the government." "As oil, gas and coal are not renewable resources they should be preserved with highest priority for our internal use," Akash read. "It would not be proper to formulate any such policy which provides for huge extraction and exhaustion through export. In such a case, we will have to buy it later at a higher price." In the written statement the professor mentioned the recent international tender by the caretaker government that sought bids by Feb 15 for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. At the current rate, he stated, all 28 blocks in the Bay would be allocated under production sharing contracts (PSCs) by October this year. Professor of economics at Jahangirnagar University, Anu Muhammad, said: "Extraction of each cubic foot of gas costs Tk 25. We buy this gas from BAPEX at Tk 7. We have to buy the same gas from foreign company at Tk 250 to 300." Prof Anu Muhammad said that the task of exploration and extraction of gas must therefore be allotted to a national institution: "The government can fix a price at around Tk 30 for BAPEX to sell gas." "It benefits the national institution. As a result they can buy necessary machinery for exploration and extraction of gas." Demanding that energy exports from Bangladesh be stopped, he said: "If agreements are signed under PSCs it will endanger our energy resources." Economics professor at Dhaka University Abul Barakat said: "Those who are running the world want to keep three things under their controlenergy, water and heads of state." He said the government was putting the energy interests of others before our own energy security. "Oil and gas belong to the people. How was a tender floated without consulting the people?" he asked, calling for cancellation of the tender. DU sociology professor Saad Uddin said: "An unbearable situation has been created concerning our gas fields as imbalanced agreements were signed earlier." "This time again a tender has been floated without taking people's opinion." Urging cancellation of the tender he said: "Let us wait till December. It should be an elected government that invites tenders after taking the opinion of the people." Dhaka University physics professor Ajay Roy, economics professor Abu Ahmed, international relations professor Akmal Hossain, geology professors Hossain Mansur and Badrul Imam, Jahangirnagar University geology professor Khalilur Rahman, Chittagong University economics professor Moinul Islam and dean of the Engineering Institute of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology M Shamsul Islam were present at the press conference. bdnew
