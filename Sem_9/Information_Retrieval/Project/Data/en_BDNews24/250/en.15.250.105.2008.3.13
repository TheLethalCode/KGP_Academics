<TITLE> Hasina, Khaleda will have to submit wealth statements: SC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court in separate verdicts Thursday ruled that Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina would be required to submit their wealth statements to the Anticorruption Commission. The matter of the wealth statements of the two former prime ministers had earlier fallen into a legal tangle, as the High Court in earlier rulings had nullified the ACC's notices on Hasina and Khaleda. Thursday's decisions came from an Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin on appeals by the ACC against the previous High Court rulings. The cancellation of the earlier rulings meant that legal proceedings by the ACC including filing of cases against Hasina were now free to go forward, attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal and Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told reporters immediately after the verdict. The attorney general said the HC verdict that had cancelled the ACC notice served on Hasina brought the anti-corruption drive to a standstill and the fate of some 200 criminal cases faced uncertainty. Thursday's verdict resolved the problem and the outstanding cases would be resolved, he said. On whether he was happy with the verdict, barrister Huq said: "It's not a matter of being happy or sad. But I will just say if it is not a proper decision you will be the victim of this decision." He would not elaborate further. The court also cancelled the HC orders that quashed the ACC notices served on Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, BJP chairman Najiur Rahman Monju and former BRTC chairman Toimur Alam Khandaker seeking their wealth accounts. The High Court cancelled the ACC wealth statement notice on Hasina on Nov 21 ruling it "illegal". The ACC served the notice on July 17, a day after Hasina was arrested at her Sudha Sadan home. Hasina filed a writ petition with the High Court on Aug 5 challenging the legality of the ACC notice. The Appellate Division accepted the ACC's leave to appeal against the HC verdict on Jan 10. On Nov 25, the HC separately stayed the ACC notice served on former prime minister Khaleda Zia on July 18. The ACC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court against the HC order on Jan 13. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq also represented Khaleda in her appeal. Joint forces arrested Khaleda on Sept 3 at her cantonment home. bdnews24.com/a
