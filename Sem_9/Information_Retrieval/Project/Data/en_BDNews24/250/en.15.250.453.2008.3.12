<TITLE> Italy slashes 2008 growth forecast, hikes deficit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's caretaker government on Wednesday slashed its economic growth forecast for this year and hiked its target for the budget deficit, underscoring the tough inheritance for whoever wins next month's general election. A document issued by the economy ministry said the euro zone's third largest economy would grow just 0.6 percent in 2008, down from the 1.5 percent it had forecast last autumn. "The Italian economy will be hit this year by the significant worsening of the international macro-economic situation and the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the global scenario," the document said. The revision confirmed a Reuters report on Feb. 28 which quoted a government source saying growth would be cut to between 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent. Data since then showed last year's growth in 2007 came in below expected at 1.5 percent, little more than half the euro zone average of 2.7 percent and maintaining a trend which has seen Italy grow less than its partners for at least a decade. The 2009 growth forecast was cut to 1.2 percent from 1.6 percent. The government raised the 2008 budget deficit target to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product from 2.2 percent, blaming the deteriorating economic outlook. The new target will mean the deficit will rise significantly from last year's level of 1.9 percent. That is likely to displease the European Commission, which recommends that countries running deficits reduce them steadily by around 0.5 points per year towards a balanced budget. Italy can point to the negative impact on public finances of the downturn in growth and the fact the 2007 deficit was well below an original target of 2.4 percent. ELECTION CHALLENGE Economy Minister Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa said the new growth and deficit forecasts were "prudent" and may be improved upon. But recent Italian data has been weak and a growing number of analysts are forecasting growth of 0.5 percent or below. Consumer and business confidence are both close to 2-year lows and industrial output slumped in the last quarter of 2007 before a partial rebound in January which most analysts expect to be short-lived. The grim economic prospects will pose a major challenge to winner of an April 13-14 election which pits conservative media tycoon and former premier Silvio Berlusconi against Rome's Mayor Walter Veltroni for the centre left. The government trimmed the 2008 debt-to-GDP forecast to 103.0 percent from 103.5 percent. Italy, which has the third highest public debt in the world in absolute terms, reported on Tuesday that the 2007 debt-to-GDP stood at 104.0 percent, down from 106.5 percent the year before. The document targeted an average consumer price inflation rate of 1.7 percent this year, down from 2.0 percent in 2007. The government's inflation targets form the basis of public sector salary negotiations and are not viewed as serious economic projections. Most recent data showed Italy's EU-harmonised inflation running at 3.1 percent in Februa
