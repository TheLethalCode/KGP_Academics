<TEXT>
 Gateshead, March 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative Leader David Cameron will pledge extra help for young families on Saturday, in a bid to extend his opposition party's reach while resisting traditional Tory calls for further cuts in taxes. Cameron will tell activists at the party's spring conference in Gateshead that "families should be the most important thing in our country's life", according to an advance text of his speech. "We'll never get to the heart of the big problems we worry about -- whether it's crime, or anti-social behaviour, or children leaving school without the qualifications they need -- unless we do all we can to give every child the best start in life, and that means doing all we can to support families and parents." Cameron will promise that a future Conservative government would increase the number of health visitors in England by 50 percent to ensure that every expectant and new mother received regular support at home. The cost of 4,200 more health visitors would be met by reallocating 200 million pounds of funds targeted by Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour government for extra "outreach workers" under its Sure Start programme of pre-school childcare. "Money is tight and we have to make choices," Cameron will say. "Instead of more untrained outreach workers, we need more trained professionals who really know what they're doing." The appeal to young families follows a Tory commitment on Friday to allow new mothers and fathers to take time off work together after a birth to ease the burden of early childcare. Cameron hopes the family friendly pledges will make up for a lack of fresh tax-cutting initiatives following the party's popular proposal last autumn to raise the threshold for inheritance tax to one million pounds. His party is ahead of Labour in opinion polls but needs to boost its support further if it is to have a hope of winning a majority at the next election, due by 2010 but possibly coming as early as summer next year. Conservative Treasury spokesman George Osborne conceded on Friday he would have little room for extra tax cuts should his party win power because of the high level of government borrowing. Osborne has committed himself to maintaining Labour's spending plans till 2011 should he become the next chancellor. A leaked internal Conservative Party presentation, published on the Daily Telegraph Web site on Friday, said the party had to improve its credibility among families as polling showed people moved away from the Tories once they had children
