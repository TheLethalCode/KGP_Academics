<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Thursday sent a letter to detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina through jail authorities asking her for her version on the Niko corruption case. ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal told bdnews24.com: "The letter asked Sheikh Hasina to inform the commission in writing within the next five days if she had anything to say about the case. The letter also said she may give her version verbally instead of in writing." The ACC on Dec 9 last year in separate cases against Hasina and another former prime minister Khaleda Zia charged them with abuse of office to give out three gasfields to Canadian oil and gas exploration company Niko Resources by showing them abandoned. The cases alleged that the act had lost the government Tk 10,000 crore. ACC deputy director AMM Sabbir Hasan filed the case against Hasina. bdnews2
