 MELBOURNE, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's cricketers are expecting to get clearance soon to play in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League (IPL) following the postponement of their tour of Pakistan, the players' body said. Most of Australia's top players signed contracts to join the IPL but would have been forced to miss the inaugural series, starting next month, had the Pakistan tour gone ahead. This month's 30-day tour was postponed because of security concerns following a series of suicide bombings, including two in Lahore this week. Cricket Australia (CA) is yet to make a formal decision on whether the players can participate in the league but the national players' union said they should be allowed. "I don't think there will be a problem," Australian Cricketers' Association chief executive Paul Marsh told the Australian Associated Press on Thursday. "Certainly based on our discussions with Cricket Australia to date I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be able to play in the IPL." Australia players will be unable to play the entire tournament because they are due to tour the West Indies in May, but fast bowler Brett Lee said the event would still serve as the perfect warm-up. The 44-day league starts on April 18. "To continue playing cricket would be the best thing for us," Lee said. "I think any cricket is great preparation for a tour. As long as you're out there batting or bowling, and being out in the field.
