<TITLE> Arsenal look to snap out of drawing run </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal can expect to be staring up at Manchester United by the time they kick off at home to Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Saturday evening. Three consecutive draws for the Gunners have allowed United to close what was becoming a significant gap to one point and Sir Alex Ferguson's side have the chance to get their noses in front when they travel to doomed Derby County. Chelsea, who thrashed Derby 6-1 on Wednesday, are also back in the mix and will continue their dogged chase at relegation battlers Sunderland on Saturday. Arsenal would have expected nine points out of fixtures with Birmingham City, Aston Villa and Wigan Athletic but have managed just three, a statistic all the more baffling considering their superb dismantling of European champions AC Milan. Manager Arsene Wenger believes the pace and power of fit-again Dutchman Robin van Persie can reignite Arsenal's title bid as the finishing line looms on the horizon. Van Persie came on as a substitute in the 0-0 draw at Wigan having made only three appearances since October. "He can make a difference," Wenger told the club's Web site (www.arsenal.com). To have him back for the last 10 would be patience rewarded. "Before he was injured, he played eight games and scored five goals. When you lose a player like that you think of course we are in trouble but we compensated well. "He is desperate to come back and do well." United will also be desperate to do well, although three points against a Derby side in danger of becoming the worst ever Premier League team, are surely a formality. Ferguson was left ranting and raving after a 1-0 FA Cup defeat by Portsmouth last week and Derby's players may be having sleepless nights in anticipation of a backlash. Ben Foster is expected to be given his first league start in goal for United in the absence of the injured Edwin van der Sar and suspension to Tomasz Kusczak. Chelsea manager Avram Grant has come under intense scrutiny after the shock Cup defeat by Barnsley last week, but his side are just three points behind United and five behind Arsenal with a game in hand on the Gunners. Significantly Chelsea still have to play the top two at Stamford Bridge. Fourth-placed Liverpool, who completed the quartet of English clubs to reach the Champions League's last eight on Tuesday with victory over Inter Milan, get their focus back on league points at home to Reading. Suffering Newcastle United fans have to wait until Monday for their latest ordeal. The Magpies are sliding headlong towards the relegation zone and defeat at fellow strugglers Birmingham City could leave them in the bottom three
