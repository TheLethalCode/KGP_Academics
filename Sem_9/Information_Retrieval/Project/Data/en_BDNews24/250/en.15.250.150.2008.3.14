 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)  A charged-up South Africa will go for the kill Friday against a out-of-sorts Bangladesh in the third and final one-day international in Mirpur. With the series already decided, a clean sweep is all they need to topple Australia as the best ODI side. For the Tigers, it is another shot at saving face that keeps the game out to be tagged as a mere formality. A disappointing performance throughout the series prompted coach Jamie Siddons to have an extra go at his batsmen. Between a workout with eight of them in the match venue Thursday, the Bangladesh coach didn't sound disheartened at all to the query of the media. "I've spent nearly three months with this team, I know they are capable," said Siddons. The problems barring the capable men from performing against the mighty opponents are quite a few, according to the coach. "Lets not forget we're up against one of the best international sides. We don't face them on a regular basis. Besides the gap between international cricket and the domestic structure is huge. Mistakes will be few when we can close in the gaps," he said. Siddons backed up skipper Mohammad Ashraful to recover from the poor run with the bat he is enduring. "He's a match winner. The day he'll get runs we'll get closer to win too." The target is to put 225 to 230 runs on the board, something the hosts have not been able to achieve in the series. Naturally, a change in the squad is on the cards with Farhad Reza coming in place of Mosharraf Hossain Rubel. Proteas coach Micky Aurthur hinted at shuffling the side. Pace bowlers Andre Nel and Charl Langeveldt will sit out to make rooms for South African pace sensation pace Dale Steyn and upcoming Morne Morkel. Hashim Amla will have another chance to impress the selectors albeit with a change in his batting order: he will bat at number six. Alviro Petersen will bat at number three. bdnews
