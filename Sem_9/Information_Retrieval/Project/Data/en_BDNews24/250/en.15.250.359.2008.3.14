<TITLE> Prudential 2007 profit up 25 pct as Asia shines </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British insurer Prudential met forecasts with a 25 percent rise in annual profit, fuelled by growth in Asia where it expects to double the value of new business in 2008, a year earlier than planned. Asia accounts for almost half Prudential's profit and analysts and investors are watching for signs of contagion from a US slowdown. Britain's largest insurer by market value, however, said it remained confident, with Asian margins expected to stay at current levels despite wider market turmoil. "Bringing (the Asian target) forward one year is effectively guiding for 26 percent new business profit growth in Asia this year," analysts at Lehman Brothers said in a research note, adding that would be 17 percent ahead of its forecasts. "(To) increase guidance for this year in this sort of market should in our view be taken as a strongly positive signal." Total operating profit was 2.5 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) on a European embedded value basis, helped by one-off changes that offset charges including higher provisions for Britons living longer. That compares with 2.1 billion for 2006. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast an operating profit of 2.5 billion pounds. New business profit rose 22 percent to just under 1.2 billion pounds, while the group's margin remained stable at 42 percent, as higher margins in the UK business offset a dip in Asia, where the group wrote more lower-margin business. Prudential's shares, which have outperformed the sector but still languished in 2008, jumped in early trade, lifted by Asian growth and the absence of surprise writedowns on risky assets. But the shares later pared gains, hit by the afternoon's financial sell-off and as speculation of a stake purchase by China's Ping An eased on muted comment from Pru's management. At 1500 GMT, the shares were down 3.6 percent at 630.5p. Shares in Prudential have been lifted in recent weeks by speculation linked to China's Ping An Insurance, whose shareholders have approved plans for a $17 billion fund raising. CEO Mark Tucker declined to comment on rumours Ping An could take a stake but said he welcomed long-term shareholders. ASIA SHINES AGAIN In its Asian unit, Pru said 2007 operating profit rose 28 percent to 1.1 billion pounds. Its insurance operations rose 26 percent, slightly dented by the weaker dollar. Boosted by a stronger agency force, with India alone employing 277,000 agents, Asian new business profits rose 34 percent, but margins dipped 4 percentage points to 50 percent. That was still a recovery after a first half at 46 percent and Tucker eased concerns of a steep fall if turbulence continues. "We remain confident that they (Asian margins) will be at or around current levels," he told reporters. Tucker has long said that the potential of Prudential's Asian business is not priced into its shares, with multiples still at historic lows. But on Friday he said there were no plans for a separate listing of the Asian business, saying that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. Many financial groups have highlighted acquisition opportunities in Asia as a result of the turmoil, but Tucker said prices remained high, though the downturn had hit U.S. asset prices and could make bolt-on deals there, long eyed by the group, more attractive. In the United States, Pru's Jackson National Life unit saw an 11 percent dip in 2007 operating profit, hit by a tough comparison, after assumption changes inflated 2006 numbers. In its slimmed-down domestic UK business, where Pru announced plans to restructure and pull out of lower-margin business last year, insurance operating profit rose 25 percent. Prudential eased concerns over its exposure to UK longevity risk, as one of the largest writers of annuities, strengthening its assumptions by 312 million pounds to allow it to assume longer lives for UK men. That was offset by changes elsewhere. Prudential said it would pay a dividend of 18p per share, up 5 percent, as its dividend cover remained short of its target, in line with forecasts but a yield still behind the UK sector. "Once we get to that (2 times) cover level we will look at the situation again," Tucker said. The group is currently at 1.9 times. "We are not hoarders of capital." British insurers have remained immune to the writedowns that have battered banks and US peers, and Pru said on Friday that its 84 billion pound debt securities portfolio, which includes 912 million of sub-prime and Alt-A mortgage assets, was solid, with U.S. credit losses of just 78 million poun
