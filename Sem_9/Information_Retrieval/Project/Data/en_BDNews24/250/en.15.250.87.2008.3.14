<TITLE> Confident McCullum thinks New Zealand can still win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand were still confident of winning the second test against England, despite a first innings deficit of 144 runs, wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum said on Friday. The hosts, who lead the three-match series 1-0, were bowled out for just 198 in their first innings on the second day on Friday, before England extended their lead to 148 when they reached four without loss at the close of the day's play. England had been bowled out earlier in the day for 342, with wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Ambrose scoring his first test century. "If we didn't genuinely believe we were capable of winning this game we may as well not turn up tomorrow," McCullum told reporters. "The boys are hurting. It's never nice to have a deficit of 140 on the first innings. "Hopefully by the time we get to bat second time around, the wicket would have flattened out a bit. "If we can bowl well tomorrow (Saturday) and restrict them to 150-200 and set about chasing 350 on the final two days then we have every opportunity." James Anderson, who ripped through New Zealand's top order before finishing with 5-73, and the rest of the England attack had settled very quickly on a wicket-taking length, which his bowlers would need to find, McCullum said. "They (England) seemed to find the length that you need to bowl on that wicket that actually brought the edges into play," he added. "I think the previous day we went past the bat a lot but we were never in play. We probably bowled a touch short and they bowled that little bit fuller which brought the nicks into play. "We have to bowl well and have to adjust our lengths and bowl that touch fuller (to) bring the slips and stumps into play. "If we can do that then we can put them under pressure. "The game has still got a long distance to travel and it's about us maintaining the belief that we can get a result out of the game.
