 BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union ministers are expected to lift an obstacle to Serbia's path toward EU entry on Monday in recognition of progress in hunting war criminals, while criticising Turkey for insufficient cooperation. During discussions on enlarging the 27-bloc, ministers will also review progress made by other countries hoping to join, likely voicing caution over Macedonia's prospects because of a long-standing dispute with Greece. Diplomats say ministers are likely to unfreeze an interim trade agreement with Serbia, a decision that would mark a turning point in its hopes for eventual EU membership, paving way for formal application for candidate status. But any progress in the future is likely to continue to hinge on Belgrade's cooperation with the United Nations war crimes tribunal. Serbia had hoped the arrest last year of Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic would clear its EU path but failure to capture another genocide suspect, Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, remains a crucial concern. "In Serbia, there is cautious positive development in sight," EU enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters. The former Yugoslav state has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement last year but the Netherlands has blocked its implementation, saying Mladic should be arrested first. He has been indicted by the UN tribunal in the Hague for genocide over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Muslims and the siege of Sarajevo. This week, the chief prosecutor of the Hague tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Serge Brammertz, issued a report detailing Serbian cooperation but saying more was needed. "It is important that the authorities continue to provide this level of assistance," he said. CAUTIOUS ENLARGEMENT Also waiting to start accession talks is Macedonia, Serbia's southern neighbour. Because of progress in EU-related reforms, the EU executive said in October negotiations should start but a formal launch is likely to be contigent on Greece which diplomats say could stymie talks. Greece prevented Macedonia joining NATO last year, saying its name implied territorial claims to a Greek province called Macedonia. Macedonian prime minister Nikola Gruevski said after talks in Brussels last week that there was no breakthrough yet but the EU's Rehn has said positive news looked likely in coming weeks. Turkish compliance with its EU commitments will also be discussed at the EU ministers' meeting. Turkey has no diplomatic relations with Cyprus, an EU member since 2004, but is under pressure to make good on a promise to cooperate with its southern neighbour under a deal that enabled it to start accession talks in 2005. Turkey supports a breakaway ethnic Turkish republic in northern Cyprus, established after a Turkish invasion in 1974 following a brief Greek-inspired co
