<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 06 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP has accused the government of conspiring to increase foreign interference in the country by making the state ineffective. The main opposition party's secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Sunday that the government was deliberately making the public administration and the police dysfunctional. He, however, would not enlarge on the accusations he made at a discussion organised by the student wing of the party, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, marking the fall of military dictator HM Ershad. Ershad resigned in the face of an anti-autocracy movement and handed power over to chief justice Shahabuddin Ahmed this day in 1990. The secretary general claimed the incumbent government was neo-autocratic, He claimed that in 1982 when Ershad usurped state power through use of force, he had the silent backing of the AL. "After the declaration of state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007, she (Sheikh Hasina) claimed that the emergency government was a result of their movement." Delwar referred to party chief Khaleda Zia's role in the movement against the anti-Ershad movement. "That's why people see her as the uncompromising leader. This time also, Khaleda Zia will lead the mass movement to protect the interest of the people." The Awami League-led coalition government is conspiring to establish an one-party rule by making the parliament ineffective and is working against the country's interests, he claimed. JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku presided over the programme, participated by standing committee member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman and others. b
