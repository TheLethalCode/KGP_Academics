<TITLE> CLIMATE SPECIAL: 'Half of wildlife species at risk'</font> </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)Nearly half of Bangladesh's wildlife is under threat of extinction from habitat loss and climate change, while existing conservation efforts are inadequate, environmental experts say. Wildlife habitation is at risk from excessive human intervention and overexploitation of natural resources. "Climate change too will certainly cause greater loss of biodiversity over the next 50 years," director general of the Department of Environment Zafar Ahmed Khan told bdnews24.com on Saturday. "It is very hard to know exactly the extent of endangerment, but findings of conservation groups give some idea of the situation," said Khan, ahead of his departure to Copenhagen for the Dec 7-18 UN climate conference. He also said the government has formed an expert committee to verify data of national and international conservation groups on biodiversity loss. The International Union of Conservation Nature (IUCN) says 30 to 40 percent of the total number of wildlife species may become extinct within the next few decades unless conservation efforts are stepped up. Conservation group Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh (WTB) says nearly half of the 1600 species of vertebrate fauna are threatened by destruction of habitat, particularly deforestation. According to the IUCN-Bangladesh Red Data Book (2000), the last major survey of its kind in Bangladesh, some 43 species of mammals, 47 species of birds, 8 species of amphibians and 63 species of reptiles are on the verge of extinction now. RED LIST Adverse conditions have caused 13 species of animal to become extinct and endangered another 800 species in Bangladesh over the last century, according to the IUCN data. There are 30 to 35 species of amphibians, 126 species of reptiles, 650 species of birds and 113 species of mammals in Bangladesh. Of these, 315 species of birds, 49 species of mammals, including Bengal tiger, more than 50 species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians are found only in the Sundarbans, a World Heritage Site. Among mammals alone, 43 species are on near extinction. Reptiles too are among the most endangered. Freshwater crocodiles are already extinct in the wild. Saltwater crocodiles are under threat. Peacocks and redheaded ducks are already extinct, while the black partridge, redheaded vulture, eagle owl and white eagle are among the bird species under threat. Green frogs are also in the list of the endangered species among amphibians. Among snakes, python, cobra, viper and others are on the red list. Wildlife specialist Prof Kazi Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com, "Ecological balance has been devastated. Pressures of population, deforestation and hunting of wild animals are the main reasons for this menace." DISAPPEARING FOREST Over-exploitation of forest is a major concern. Prof Md Anwarul Islam, WTB chief executive, told bdnews24.com forest cover in Bangladesh has been reduced to just 6 percent, of which the protected area system covers only about 1 percent. Hill cutting and plantation of foreign trees, such as eucalyptus, have also caused ecological imbalances, he said. "Increasing numbers of cyclones and tidal waves due to climate change will also endanger habitation and accelerate extinction," he said. The wild animals of Chittagong, including the hill tracts, and the Sundarbans, one of the world's largest stretches of natural mangrove forest, are among the most endangered at present, he said. Prof Kazi Zakir Hossain says: "Everyone should come forward to protect our wild animals. People should be made conscious of conservation issues as well as proper enforcement of laws." LAWS, ON PAPER In line with the 1992 Earth Summit, the government is committed to the "in-situ conservation of biological diversity". Being a signatory to several international conventions, like the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, the government is under obligation to take certain measures to protect the natural heritage of the country. The Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation Amendment) Act of 1974 provides the basic framework or guidelines for the conservation of wild animals. Some initiatives have also been taken under projects such as the National Conservation Strategy and the National Environment Management Action Plan. However, priority actions focusing primarily on endangered animals are absent. The dearth of knowledge and awareness among officials and lack of enforcement also undermines conservation efforts. 'PROTECTED AREAS' GO UNPROTECTED Protected areas are meant to play a prime role in the country's national plan for biodiversity conservation. The Act has provisions for the establishment and management of three categories of protected areas, ie national park, wildlife sanctuary and game reserve. At present there are seven wildlife sanctuaries, five national parks, and one game reserve. The protected areas are home to around 840 species of wild animals. The protected areas are mostly under the jurisdiction of the forest department, but are poorly protected from illegal logging, land clearing, and poaching due to inadequate staff, poor facilities, and the lack of management plans. Three of the wildlife sanctuaries were established in the Sundarbans to protect the habitat of tigers and other wildlife as an integral part of forest management. These sanctuaries too suffer from neglect and inadequate staff and infrastructure facilities. Ainun Nishat, former country director of IUCN, told bdnews24.com: "Wild animals are facing extinction because of continued destruction of habitat and lack of enforcement of conservation laws." WTB chief executive Md Anwarul Islam says: "Bangladesh is signatory to 28 international treaties, conventions and protocols on environment and wildlife conservation." "Ninety percent of the people, including government officials, have no idea about the threat to our natural heritage, let alone conservation laws," he said. bdne
