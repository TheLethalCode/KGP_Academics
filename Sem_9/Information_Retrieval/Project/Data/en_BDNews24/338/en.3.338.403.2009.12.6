 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)The industrial assistance arm of the United Nations will set up its office in Dhaka next year, the industries minister has said. "Bangladesh in the conference asked for the assistance of United Nations Industries Development Organisation (UNIDO) to boost up its industries and information technology sector," Dilip Barua told reporters Sunday on his return from Vienna. He joined the ministerial conference of the least developed countries (LDCs) in the capital of Austria on Dec 3-4. UNIDO director general K Yumkella will inaugurate the office, expected to be completed by June next year, Barua said. Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute will benefit from the office, which will also help to generate skilled manpower by providing technical training to the people, Barua said. The Vienna conference highlighted the need for developing human resources, providing training and sharing technology and experiences among the LDCs. The conference also agreed a 10-point declaration to combat the adverse affects of global meltdown, with focus on assistance from the development partners regarding fuel, transportation, water, communication and other infrastructure for setting up environmentally friendly industries, the minister said.
