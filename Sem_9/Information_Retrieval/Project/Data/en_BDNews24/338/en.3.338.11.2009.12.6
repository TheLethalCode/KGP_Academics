<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Quick access to credit information of clients is the key for financial sector businesses to run efficiently, said the central bank governor Atiur Rahman on Sunday. "Timely availability of reliable credit information is of utmost urgency in maintaining asset quality of lending institutions," said Rahman. He was speaking at the launch of a project for automation of the Credit Information Bureau of Bangladesh Bank at the city's Sheraton Hotel. The CIB's system is being upgraded with an online system being introduced to boost capacity and efficiency for better service delivery. The existing capacity is inadequate to meet the current volume of information requests by the commercial banks, according to the Bangladesh Bank chief. "And with expansion of SME and agricultural lending, which we will see soon, will make handling of credit information unmanageable without upgrading," he added. The South Asia Enterprise Development Facility of the IFC in collaboration with the UK's Department of International Development (DFID) and the Norwegian Agency of Development is working with the central bank to develop CIB's system solution and implementation. The automation will take another six months to become operational, according to CRIF, an Italy-based financial consultancy firm that has been awarded the job of modernising the CIB. In a presentation, CRIF officials said that they were "exactly according to schedule" and were on the final phase of the project. But, cooperation from commercial banks regarding inputs of clients credit history to the CIB is most crucial for the success of this project, they added. Bankers say that it would not be an issue for them to supply timely information. "From our end we do not have any problem to provide timely credit information of our clientsbut for us it's crucial to get quick access to credit history of loan aspirants," Mehmood Hossain, deputy managing director of Prime Bank told bdnews24.com. IFC's Rehan Rashid, who heads the automation project, told the audience that a healthy financial services sector, along with credit availability, was an important component for economic prosperity. "Access to finance is a critical obstacle facing small and medium enterprises in South Asia," he said. An automated credit information system will better serve the credit provide who may in turn provide better financial services for their clients.
