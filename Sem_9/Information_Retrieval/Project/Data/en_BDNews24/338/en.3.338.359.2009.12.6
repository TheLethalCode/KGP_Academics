 Rangpur, Dec 06 (bdnews24.com) -- Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad is on a three-day visit to his ancestral home in the Indian state of West Bengal 'for one last time'. The former president, accompanied by his son Eric, was received by his relatives at Dinhata village in Cooch Behar district. Before crossing the border, at around 1pm, Ershad told reporters: "I am old. I do not think I will be able to visit my ancestral home any more." Dr Asit Chakrabarty, a childhood friend of Ershad, told Times of India that Ershad matriculated from Dinhata Boys' School in 1946. When India gained independence in 1947, Cooch Behar was under the sovereign rule of its Maharaja. It became a part of India in 1949 and a district of West Bengal in 1950. Ershad's father Muhammad Maqbul Hussein along with his family members migrated to the then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, and settled in Rangpur. Ershad last visited Dinhata in 1975. Ershad will return to Bangladesh on Wednesday, said his press secretary Sunil Shubho Roy. bdnews24.com/
