 Manikganj, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) Ferry services across the Padma remained suspended from 2am to 11 am on Sunday due to poor visibility as a blanket of thick fog enveloped river routes. Ferries on Mawa-Kaowrakandi could not operate due to poor visibility during the period disrupting communications. Communication through the Paturia-Daulatdia river route remained suspended from 5:30am to 9:45am on Sunday due to an impenetrable fog curtain that enveloped the river Padma. Long tailbacks of about 600 cargo loaded trucks and 200 passenger buses grew on both Paturia and Doulatdia banks of the Padma as the ferry-boats could not operate for more than four hours. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) Aricha office manager Ashraf Ullah told bdnews24.com that the fog curtain building since Saturday afternoon across the river so thickened early on Sunday that ferry-boats could not ply. Four ferry-boats remained standstill for hours in the middle of the waterway while sailing from Doulatdia to Paturia, he said. The boats reached Paturia after visibility was restored. The resultant heavy traffic gridlocks remained unchanged till this report was being filed. The passengers waiting to be ferried across the river were suffering due to the unavoidable delay. bd
