 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has halved its infant mortality rate since ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, UNICEF's global flagship report said Sunday. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) has transformed the way children are viewed and treated throughout the world, said UNICEF in its 'State of the World's Children 2009' report. This year's edition celebrates 20 years of the CRC since its adoption in 1989 "Not only it has changed the attitudes and knowledge of people but it has also shaped legislations, policies and practices by institutions," the report said. The conventionwhich articulates a set of universal children's rights, such as the right to an identity, a name and a nationality, the right to an education, and rights to the highest possible standards of health and protection from abuse and exploitationhas been ratified by 193 countries including Bangladesh in 1990. Since Bangladesh ratified the convention, clear progress has been made towards the fulfillment of the rights of the children in the country on some areas, UNICEF said is this year's report. Bangladesh has more than halved the child mortality rate since 1990, almost all children (97%) in Bangladesh receive Vitamin-A supplementation and primary school net enrolment rate is above 90% though only 50.7% of them complete all five years of primary schooling. The report also states some 80% of the population has access to safe water in Bangladesh. But, at the same time, other data show major issues related to children's rights that have not yet been addressed: only 36% of the population has access to improved sanitation; two in five children are underweight; 1.3 million children are involved in hazardous work and 64% of women between 20 and 24 years old were married before the age of 18, the report added. The report was presented Sunday at the CIRDAP auditorium in Dhaka, by UNICEF country representative Carel de Rooy, secretary of the ministry for women and children affairs Rokeya Sultana and deputy speaker of the children's parliament Zahida Sultana Mukti. Rooy said: "The 20th anniversary of the convention is a time to celebrate, but also a time to reflect on what still needs to be done to make Bangladesh a country fit for children." "Despite some important steps taken by Bangladesh such as enacting the Labour Law in 2006 which prohibits hazardous labour for children, Bangladesh still needs to harmonise its national legislation with the principles and provisions of the CRC," he added. Rokeya Sultana said a draft of the National Child Policy is almost completed. Discussions will be launched around the country to finalise it, she added. She also mentioned that the admission rate and gender parity had risen in primary and secondary schools. bdn
