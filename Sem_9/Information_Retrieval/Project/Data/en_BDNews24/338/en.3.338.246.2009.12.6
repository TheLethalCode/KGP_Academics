 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  On the eve of the Copenhagen Conference, the UN's top climate change official expressed confidence that the summit would deliver a climate change deal that included a fund for vulnerable countries like Bangladesh, which could reach $100 billion a year. Yvo De Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), spoke of commitments and targets for emission cuts as well as funding. "We are looking for short term financing of $10 billion per year, which would reach $30 billion by 2012," Boer said at a pre-conference press briefing in Copenhagen on Sunday. He told bdnews24.com after the briefing: "We are looking for a more significant long term fund, we have a plan to create $100 billion dollars a year by 2020." More than 15 thousand participants, including delegates from 192 countries, are expected to take part in the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Boer was confident of a "comprehensive, ambitious and effective international climate change deal". "Within two weeks from Monday, governments must give their adequate response to the urgent challenge of climate change," Boer told a gathering of journalists from nearly 200 nations at the briefing. "Negotiators now have the clearest signal ever from world leaders to craft solid proposals to implement rapid action." Referring to numerous emission reduction pledges that developed and developing countries have made in the run-up to COP 15, Boer said there was unprecedented political momentum to clinch an ambitious deal in Copenhagen. "Never in 17 years of climate negotiations have so many different nations made so many firm pledges together," he said. "So whilst there will be more steps on the road to a safe climate future, Copenhagen is already a turning point in the international response to climate change." Boer mentioned three layers of action that governments must agree to in the course of the coming two weeks: fast and effective implementation of immediate action on climate change; ambitious commitments to cut and limit emissions, including start-up funding and a long-term funding commitment; and a long-term shared vision on a low-emissions future for all. He said developed countries will need to provide fast-track funding on the order of $10 billion a year through to 2012 to enable developing countries to immediately plan and launch low emission growth and adaptation strategies and to build internal capacity. At the same time, developed countries will need to indicate how they intend to raise predictable and sustainable long-term financing and what their longer-term commitments will be. TARGETS According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an aggregate emission reduction by industrialised countries of between minus 25% and 40% over 1990 levels would be required by 2020 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change, with global emissions falling by at least 50% by 2050. Even under this scenario, there would be an only a 50% chance of avoiding the most catastrophic consequences. With 193 Parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC) has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol has been ratified by 190 of the UNFCCC Parties. Under the Protocol, 37 States, consisting of highly industrialized countries and countries undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, have legally binding emission limitation and reduction commitments. The ultimate objective of both treaties is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.
