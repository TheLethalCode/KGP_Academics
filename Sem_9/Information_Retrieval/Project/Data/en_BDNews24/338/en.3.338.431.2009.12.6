 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP parliamentarian Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has secured anticipatory bail from the High Court in a sedition case in which a court had ordered his arrest. He got the bail a day after Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner A K M Shahidullah said that the police were looking for Chowdhury. The bench of justice Syed Mohammad Dastagir and justice Roisuddin issued bail for two months on Sunday on a plea by Chowdhury. The court also asked the government to explain why he should not be given permanent bail. A Chittagong court on Thursday issued an arrest warrant on the BNP leader in the sedition case filed the same day by businessman Abu Taher Uddin of Shulakbahar in the port city. The BNP leader reportedly told a local BNP council in Fatikchhari: "Aug 15 is an important day in our national life as the nation was freed from one-party rule that day." Independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated with most members of his family by some army officers on Aug 15, 1975. On the Supreme Court final verdict that upheld death sentences on the 12 former officers convicted of the killing, he said: "The nation has not accepted this verdict." Chowdhury's lawyer Shah Manjurul Haque said at the hearing of the bail petition that the case had been filed on a false charge. No individual can file a sedition case, he pointed out. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam opposed the bail plea. The BNP legislator faced charges in at least five districts for his defamatory statement against president Sheikh Mujib but secured bail from the High Court in all the cases. bdnews24.c
