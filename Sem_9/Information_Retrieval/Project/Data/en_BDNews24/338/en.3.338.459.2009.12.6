 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh might ratify the Rome Statute for future trial of crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court, the law minister said on Sunday. "If we ratify the statute we will be able to try war crimes, genocides and other crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court and get other legal facilities from them," Shafique Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with visiting ICC president Sang Hyun Song at the Secretariat. Asked whether ratifying the Statute would cover trial of 1971 war crimes in the ICC, he replied: "It would only apply to trial of crimes committed after ratification. However, we would receive legal support, training of prosecutors, and so on, for trial of 1971 war crimes in Bangladesh." The cabinet will decide on ratification, he said. The ICC was formed through the Rome Statute in 1998. The previous Awami-League led government made Bangladesh signatory to the the Statute in 1999, pending ratification. According to ICC website, 60 countries have so far fully ratified the Rome Statute and 120 countries have adopted it. Sang Hyun Song said 14 Asian countries, including his own countrySouth Koreahave ratified the Rome Statute. He hoped Bangladesh would follow them. Asked about his opinion on the trial of war criminals of 1971, Sang said this is Bangladesh's own trial and ICC had nothing to say on it. bdne
