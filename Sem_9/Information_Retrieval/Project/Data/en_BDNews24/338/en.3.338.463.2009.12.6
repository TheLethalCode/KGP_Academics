 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 06 (bdnews24.com)Signing of a Teesta water sharing agreement during Sheikh Hasina's Delhi visit now depends solely on the premiers of Bangladesh and India, foreign ministry officials say. They say India has rejected Bangladesh's request to hold a meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission, which would fix the volume of water for the two countries, before Hasina's visit from Dec 19. There was no sign Sunday that Bangladesh and Indian water experts during three-day JRC technical committee talks had reached a consensus on fixing the point on the Teesta to collect hydrological dataa precondition for inking the deal. According to a consensus between the two countries, reached in September, both countries would gather the data, by forming a joint committee of experts, to place at the JRC ministerial meeting, the next step in the process for a deal. Based on the data, the JRC ministerial meeting would then determine the share of water for the two countries and draft the agreement. Much still needs to be done before the Teesta deal is framed, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes told bdnews24.com Sunday afternoon at his office. "We are trying to get a date for the JRC ministerial meeting. It is not decided whether it will be on (Dec) 24 or before," he said. But "anything could happen" if the two top leaders desired, said Quayes. "India has told us that holding a JRC meeting before the prime minister's visit is not possible," a spokesperson of the foreign ministry told bdnews24.com Sunday. "There is a slim chance of signing the Teesta deal during the prime minister's visit," he said. "It now depends on what occurs at the highest political level." The spokesperson said the talks between the two prime ministers may set some future time line for signing a deal on the Teesta. "I have no knowledge whether any water-related agenda is included during the prime minister's visit," Sheikh Wahed Uz Zaman, water resources secretary, told reporters Sunday after meeting the visiting Indian water experts. The visiting Indian technical team, headed by JRC member SP Kakran, has been holding talks with Bangladesh's JRC technical side, led by Mir Sajjad Hossain, since Friday. Bangladesh has been seeking a deal on Teesta water sharing for decades. India in 1987 established a barrage in Gazoldoba in the upstream to divert water mainly for irrigation. In 1990, Bangladesh commissioned the Teesta barrage in the downstream for irrigation in the agro-based but poor Rangpur region. Now, the first phase of the Teesta barrage project provides water to over 750,000 hectares of land. But Bangladesh cannot implement the second phase of the project due to paucity of water in the Teesta during the dry season. Bangladesh and India during foreign minister Dipu Moni's Delhi visit in September this year agreed that the two countries would form a joint technical team to collected data on the Teesta's water availability in Bangladesh's upstream, India. The technical team is yet to be formed. The two countries in September also recognised the need to expedite an agreement on the Teesta, a lifeline of the farmers in the greater Rangpur region in Bangladesh's north.
