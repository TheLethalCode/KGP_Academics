<TEXT>
 Manikganj, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Ferry operations on the Paturia-Doulatdia river route remained suspended again on early Monday from 5:30am to 10am due to poor visibility as a blanket of thick fog enveloped the river Padma. Long tailbacks of more than 500 cargo laden trucks and over 100 passenger buses grew on both Paturia and Doulatdia banks of the Padma as the ferry-boats could not ply for more than four hours. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) Aricha office manager Ashraf Ullah told bdnews24.com that the fog curtain fell on Sunday night across the river and became thick early on Monday that halted ferry movement. Seven ferries remained stranded for hours in the middle of the waterway after sailing from Doulatdia to Paturia, he said. The vessels reached their destinations after visibility was restored, Ashraf added. Meanwhile, Meteorological Department officials in Dhaka said foggy weather would continue for next two or three days along the river basins and over a vast swathe of land and advised people not to embark on journeys in early mornings. Met officials also asked vehicle drivers and motor launch skippers to move carefully amidst fog to avert accidents. bd
