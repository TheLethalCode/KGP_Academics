<TEXT>
 KABUL Dec 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai will unveil his new cabinet within days, a spokesman said on Sunday, adding that efforts to start talks with Taliban insurgents and implementing anti-corruption measures were underway. Karzai has been under intense pressure from Washington and its Western allies fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and bankrolling its economy, to crack down on graft and appoint technocrats in his cabinet, rather than former "warlords".

Last month Afghanistan said it would a hold a conference on corruption in the near future. A deputy attorney general has also said two Afghan cabinet ministers were being investigated under suspicion of embezzlement. Karzai is also keen to move ahead with plan for a "Loya Jirga -- or grand counil -- to reignite efforts to engage with the Taliban. "The Taliban will be invited to take part in (the Jirga) and if they refuse to do so, then tribal chiefs will be asked to find ways of how to go ahead with the negotiations agenda," Elmi s
