 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)The government on Sunday challenged in the Supreme Court the bails secured from the High Court by 18 people sentenced to jail terms. The Appellate Division chamber judge, Md Mozammel Hossain, also asked the government to inform the status of convicts after they secured the bails. The hearing for the appeals will take place on Monday. The office of the attorney general filed the appeals, 11 among them against the regular High Court bails and seven against anticipatory bails. A High Court bench on Nov 18 and 19 granted the convicts, twelve of whom have been sentenced to life, causing rancour in the government. The convicts are Shamsu Gain from Munshiganj, Md Sharif of Manikganj, Md Ataur Rahman of Shariatpur, Hasmat Ali and Sakku Mandol from Jamalpur, Raihan Biswas of Rajbari, Md Asman Ali of Dinajpur, Emtiaz Rahman Sohel of Sylhet, Abdul Oadud of Satkhira, Abul Hashem from Netrakona and Syed Mazharul Hossain Ronju of Dhaka. bd
