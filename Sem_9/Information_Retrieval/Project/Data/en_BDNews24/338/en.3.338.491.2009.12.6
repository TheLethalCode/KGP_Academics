 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh might ratify the Rome Statute for the trial of war crimes and other crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court, the law minister said on Sunday. "If we ratify the statute we will be able to try war crimes, genocides and other crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court and get other legal facilities from them," Shafique Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with visiting ICC president Sang Hyun Song at the Secretariat. The cabinet will decide on it (the ratification), he said. The ICC was formed through Rome Statute in 1998. The previous Awami-League led government signed the statute in 1999. According to ICC website, 60 countries have so far ratified the Rome Statute and 120 countries have accepted it. Sang Hyun Song said 14 Asian countries, including his own countrySouth Koreahave ratified the Rome Statute. He hoped Bangladesh would follow them. Asked about his opinion on the trial of war criminals of 1971, Sang said this is Bangladesh's own affair and ICC has nothing to do with it.
