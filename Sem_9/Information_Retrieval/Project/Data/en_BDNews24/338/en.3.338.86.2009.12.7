 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Detained Kashmiri militant Md Yousuf Butt, also known as Abdul Majid and linked to Harkat-ul Jihad-al Islami (HuJI) in Bangladesh, has reportedly confessed his involvement in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally in the capital. Butt, a member of Kashmir-based militant group Hezbul Mujahideen, made the admission Sunday in a statement to metropolitan magistrate AKM Emdadul Huq, police said. Deputy commissioner of police Anisur Rahman told bdnews24.com of Butt's confession, but said he could not disclose further details during ongoing investigations in the case. The accused was produced in the metropolitan magistrate's court at 4pm after 14 days in remand. He recorded a four-hour statement, said Rahman. Butt is the 10th accused to give a statement in the grenade attack case. HuJI founder Maolana Sheikh Abdus Salam, arrested on Nov 2 in connection with the case, confessed his role in the 2004 bomb attack last week, police reported. Butt, arrested in January this year in an arms case, became one of the main accused in Aug 21 case after Salam implicated him last month during interrogation. Another police officer, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that Butt "admitted his role in planning the attack". The Kashmiri reportedly came to Bangladesh with the help of Maolana Tajuddin, also accused in the case. Tajuddin, currently a fugitive and brother of detained former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, is said to have been the grenade supplier. The police officer said Majid also had ties with now-detained HuJI chief Mufti Hannan, bringing militants from Kashmir to Bangladesh for training. At least 24 people, including Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, wife of president Zillur Rahman, lost their lives in the 2004 attack on a party rally at Bangabandhu Avenue in Dhaka. Scores sustained injuries, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Investigators, during the previous BNP administration, are accused of attempting to derail the case, including recording of false witness statements. Once BNP left power, during the subsequent caretaker government, newly-appointed CID investigators eventually pressed charges against 22 people, including Pintu and Hannan, on June 11 last year. Former BNP state minister for home, Lutfozzaman Babar, now in jail, was also recently shown arrested in connection with the grenade attack. Since Awami League came to power this year, investigators have been granted more time to gather evidence. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far given evidence. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. bdnew
