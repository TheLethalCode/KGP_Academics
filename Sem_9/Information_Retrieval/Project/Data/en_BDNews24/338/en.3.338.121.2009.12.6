 MUMBAI, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Umpiring decisions cost Sri Lanka more than 500 runs and several wickets in their three-test series against India and the ICC's new review system should be used in all tests, captain Kumar Sangakkara said on Sunday. The Sri Lankan skipper called for the new Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) to be made mandatory after his side slumped to an innings and 24-run defeat in the third and final test. Sri Lanka lost the series 2-0 as India jumped to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) test rankings for the first time. [ID:nSP320901] "This series is probably the best advertisement for having the review system when decisions cost us over 500 runs and a lot of wickets ...," Sangakkara told reporters.

Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan was unlucky to be given out twice in the final test. He was given out to Harbhajan Singh for 109 in the first innings but television replays showed the ball had not hit the bat before popping to short-leg. In the second innings, the explosive opener was given out lbw to the same bowler, although replays indicated the ball was missing leg stump. The skipper said India deserved the series win but insisted Sri Lanka were a better side than the scores suggested. "Two-nil is a realistic scoreline the way the Indians played and the way we played, especially in the last two test matches. "But we are a better side than what the scoreline says, we got to accept the fact that if we don't play well enough we are going to be placed in situations like these." The series defeat saw Sri Lanka drop from second place to fourth in the rankings, behind Australi
