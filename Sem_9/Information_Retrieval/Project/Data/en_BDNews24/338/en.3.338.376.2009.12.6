<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan has expressed hope that the party that ousted him would bring necessary amendments to its constitution through its upcoming council. "I wish success for BNP's council, though I'm not in the party now," Bhuiyan, who was secretary general for more than a decade, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. BNP is readying for its Fifth National Council at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Dec 8. Bhuiyan, who earned the label of 'reformist' along with a number of other senior BNP figures during the tenure of the caretaker government, said he hoped honest and qualified party leaders would come out of the national council. "I am hopeful that BNP will have more democratic practices within the party and bring up-to-date changes to its constitution," he said. Party chairperson Khaleda Zia suspended Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain on Sep 3, 2007. Bhuiyan had proposed extensive party reforms in June the same year. Bhuiyan, a cardiac patient, left for Singapore on Sunday night for health checks. bd
