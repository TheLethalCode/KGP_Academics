<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  China believes any disagreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar over demarcation of sea boundaries "will be resolved", Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said on his return from Beijing on Sunday. Ashraf told reporters at Zia International Airport: "The Chinese government thinks dispute between the two countries will be resolved." He said Beijing's notion was based on the fact that Bangladesh does not have any major disagreement with Myanmar. He said his seven-day visit was a success. Ashraf, also local government minister, led a high-level AL delegation to China on the occasion of commemorating the 60th founding anniversary of the republic. "We had successful discussions with high-ranking Chinese government officials," he said. He said the issues for their discussions covered the huge trade gap, development of communications infrastructure and climate change. The minister said the issue of deep-sea port and setting up of a highway and railroad through Myanmar to Kunming, China also came up in the discussions with the Chinese officials. Since China is a strong bilateral partner of Bangladesh, the Awami League delegation head thinks the recent visit would further foster the relations. "We have asked the (Chinese) government to increase investment in Bangladesh," he said. Presidium member Yousuf Hossain Humayun, joint secretary Mahbubul Alam Hanif, organising secretary Ahmed Hossain and international affairs secretary Syed Abul Hossain were in the team. BNP allegations Responding to the main opposition BNP's allegations that the ruling party is trying to disrupt its national council, Ashraf said, "I don't see any clue." He, however, said the BNP's Dec. 8 council is "very important" for strengthening democracy in Bangladesh. He wished the BNP a success. bdnews2
