 Dhaka, Dec 06 (bdnews24.com)--Construction and renovation work for preparing the courtroom and other necessary enclosures of a special tribunal to try 1971 war crimes started in the capital on Sunday, officials said. The work is in progress at house no. 14 on Abdul Gani Road near Bangladesh Secretariat, said deputy law secretary ASSM Jahirul Haque, who oversees the work. Authorities are also preparing a security-checking passage and an enclosure for journalists on the tribunal premises, he said. He said they expect the facilities would be ready within a month. Previous offices including administrative appellate tribunal of the building are being shifted to Janata Tower at Karwan Bazar, he said. Meanwhile, law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters at his office in the morning: "The trial will begin once the premises are ready." He would not specify the timeframe. The Awami League-led government headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina had pledged to start the trial of suspected war criminals who collaborated with the Pakistani military during 1971 independence war. Researchers and witnesses say such suspects were involved in killing even innocent people during the struggle. The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973 has recently been amended by the government for conducting the trials. bdne
