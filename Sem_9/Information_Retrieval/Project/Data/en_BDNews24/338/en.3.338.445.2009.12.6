 Dhaka, Dec 06 (bdnews24,com)--Five issues raised by Bangladesh were taken seriously in the just-concluded WTO conference, commerce minister Faruk Khan has said. He led a delegation to the seventh session of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, from Nov 30 to Dec 2. The general theme for discussion was "The WTO, the Multilateral Trading System and the Current Global Economic Environment". "We have moved five issues in the conference. All these have been included on the post-conference summary," the minister said at a news briefing at his office on Sunday. The issues include battered state of the country's export sector in the aftermath of the global recession, tax-free entry of products to the developed countries, losses from climate change, request to the developed nations to not ban export of foodstuffs to the developing countries and Bangladesh's demand for the status of Disproportionately Affected Country (DAC) due to effects of global economic recession and climate change. Sri Lanka and Pakistan have recently been marked as DACs, due to war and other extreme conditions and so, tariff rates on their five selected garment products for entry to the US market are being cut to just five percent from 15 percent. Currently Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan export garments to the American market paying 15 percent duty. But it is feared that Bangladesh's export will suffer if Sri Lanka and Pakistan get the same tariff cut in just five years. Khan said ministers of the SAARC countries meet on the sidelines of the conference and that Sri Lanka and Pakistan would not oppose Bangladesh getting DAC privileges. Khan said, "We talked about Bangladesh's getting DAC status so that no developing country gets more privileges than Bangladesh while exporting products to the developed countries." Bangladesh also insisted on the implementation of the decision of the Hong Kong meeting which said the developed countries would give duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access to LDCs' 97 percent export items by 2010. At present, 97 percent of Bangladesh's exports enter the American market tax-free, but Bangladesh's chief exports such as garments, leather products and others are not included under the duty-free facilities. bd
