<TITLE> India moves to ease anger over land for industry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India, which has faced violent protests over acquiring farmland for industrial use, on Thursday approved a new set of rules aimed at protecting the rights of vulnerable farmers and their families. Under the new relief and rehabilitation policy, those affected would be provided alternative land, employment in the project for which land is being acquired, housing benefits and vocational training. "One of the objectives of the policy is to minimise the displacement of people, and to promote non-displacing or least-displacing alternatives," a government statement said. In the worst violence over attempts to compulsorily buy farmland for special economic zones (SEZs) the government hopes will add fresh vigour to an already buzzing economy, 14 people were killed in March when police opened fire on protesters. The proposed chemicals project at Nandigram in communist-run West Bengal state was shelved and developers have now found an alternative site. Villagers said they had not been properly compensated for their losses. After the killings the government put a temporary freeze on SEZ approvals as it waited for public anger to die down. The federal cabinet, which approved the relief and rehabilitation policy, also decided to amend an archaic land acquisition act, which dates back to 1894, to enshrine the new rules in law. The ruling Congress party-led coalition -- battling its worst crisis since coming to power due to a face-off with leftist allies angered by a nuclear energy deal with the United States -- has announced a slew of costly pro-poor schemes ahead of possible early elections. India has planned hundreds of special economic zones -- tax-free industrial enclaves -- to boost manufacturing and export growth and provide jobs, but the issue of land acquisition has met with stiff resistance from farmers. The new policy would ensure financial support, accommodation and schooling, health care, drinking water and electricity among other measures for those hit by land purchases, the statement said. Those unable to work, orphans and widows and those over 50 would be given a monthly pension for life.
