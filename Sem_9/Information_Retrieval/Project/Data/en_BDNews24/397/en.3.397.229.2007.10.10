 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Wednesday refused to explain his remark, as demanded by a senior Awami League leader, on the interim government's alleged plan to exile two former prime ministers. "The comment that I had made about Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia was very personal," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone, when asked to comment on the demand of acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam for an explanation. Ashraful Tuesday asked Mainul to make it clear about his recent statement that the government had wanted the two leaders to stay "outside". At a meeting with the Overseas Correspondents Association of Bangladesh Sunday, the adviser said: "By now you all know that we wanted them (Hasina and Khaleda) to stay outside, instead of going into hassles. But they did not give us that chance." The adviser Wednesday said he was not bound to give a clarification. "No further comment," he told bdnews24.com. Ashraful had earlier said: "From what he (the law adviser) said we got an impression that the government did not want one leader to return home and the other to stay home. But at the time they said they had no such plan." bdnews24.com/
