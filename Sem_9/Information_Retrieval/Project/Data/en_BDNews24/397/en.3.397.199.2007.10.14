 NAIROBI, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The third major contender in Kenya's presidential race launched his election campaign on Sunday, promising to improve security and fight poverty in east Africa's biggest economy. Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya (ODM-K) candidate Kalonzo Musyoka also outlined a vision of a regional economic powerhouse forged by strengthened relations with neighbouring countries. "What this country needs now is inspirational leadership," he told supporters who swarmed Uhuru (Freedom) Park. "The problem that has beset Kenyans is poverty that cannot be accepted ... we cannot allow this issue to continue." Analysts say Musyoka faces a huge challenge to close the gap behind frontrunners President Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga, of the rival Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Kibaki has yet to dissolve parliament -- beginning the countdown to what is seen as Kenya's closest ever contest -- but most voters expect to go to the polls in mid-to-late December. Four surveys in this week give Kalonzo, a lawyer and former cabinet minister, between 8 and 14 percent support, compared with Kibaki's 34 to 40 percent and Odinga's 44 to 53 percent. The presidential press service quoted Kibaki as saying recent opinion polls were a creation of the media and urging voters to resist being swayed by them. In a race heavily influenced by tribal politics, most commentators say that Kalonzo, from the small Kamba community, does not command the massive block vote Odinga has among his Luo people and Kibaki among the Kikuyu. Despite oozing confidence of a win in Sunday's rally, Kalonzo said he would consider a role in a post-poll coalition. "I am realistic enough to understand that not a single party will emerge with majority seats in parliament. If I win, I will consider others. If I lose, I should prepare for a coalition," he said in an interview published in the Sunday Nation paper
