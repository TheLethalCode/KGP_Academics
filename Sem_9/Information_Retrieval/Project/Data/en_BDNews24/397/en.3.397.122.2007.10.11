 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  National Sports Council (NSC) chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed directed authorities to take tough action against those responsible for collapse of the press box roof of the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Gen Moeen gave the directives while he was visiting the spot Thursday. The 150-capacity suspended press box roof collapsed sometimes after the FIFA World Cup pre-qualifier between Bangladesh and Tajikistan on October 8. "The NSC chairman has directed us to take tough action against those responsible for the collapse of the press box roof of the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS)," NSC secretary Aminul Islam Khan said. Khan said the NSC chairman was relieved that nobody had been hurt in the incident. The NSC chairman spoke to the members of the probe committee, Sheikh Mohammad Shahidullah, managing director of the Shahidullah, and New Associates Ltd, the construction firm that built the press box. "We could have taken instant action, but we did not do so in the greater interest of the investigation so that those who neglected their duty cannot get away," Moeen was quoted by Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) chief operation officer Col (retd) Waliullah as saying. Waliullah said the army chief directed authorities to submit a report in seven days. The army chief also advised the probe committee to see whether there was any fault in the design or construction materials were sub-standard or any irregularity in maintenance. The probe committee found that the welding did not have proper strength and the weight of dead load increased because rainwater was not drained out from the roof. It suggested testing the strength and thickness of MS pipe and welding from BUET and confirmation of whether those materials were in line with the design. The committee also suggested including an expert on design in the committee and sought time until October 31 for the laboratory test as the BUET will remain closed until October 23. The enquiry committee, widened to five members from three Tuesday night, visited the spot Wednesday and collected evidence. The press box was constructed under a renovation project of the BNS at a cost of Tk 25 crore. bd
