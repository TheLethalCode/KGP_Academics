 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Coach Jobair Nipu said he wants to win at least two matches in the Qualification Competition of the AFC Under-16 championship in Abu Dhabi. The AFC qualification 'D Group' competition, a FIFA Under-17 World Cup qualifying round for Asian zone, will begin on October 17 in the United Arab Emirates with six nations taking part in the group matches. "I am confident that we will win at least two matches against Palestine and Turkmenistan," said Nipu at a press conference at the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Thursday. "The boys have been practicing for 80 days together and they seem to be committed to showing better performance in the competition," said Nipu He said he dares to win two matches as his 20-member squad has 16 to 17 players, who have experience in playing in the AFC Under-13 and 14 competitions. Bangladesh were drawn along with Palestine, hosts UAE, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in Group D from where the top two teams will qualify for the 16-team second round. Nipu, however, was a bit worried for not playing more warm-up matches before leaving the country on October 15 for the UAE. "We have practiced hard in the last three months and I am hopeful to play the second round," said captain-cum-stopper Naimur Rahman Shahed. Shaheed sees his attacking department, comprising Sohel and Nadim, as stronger than other departments. Squad: Nurul Karim, Rafiqul Islam Rana, Shahidul Alam, Saidur Rahman Sujan, Mamun Hossain, Amzad Hossain, Rashed Khan Milon, Naimur Rahman Shahed (captain), Ariful Haq Saikat, Saifuddin, Salahuddin Ahmed Nadim, Saddam Hossain, Jamal Hossain, M Shohag, Habibur Rahman, M Sohel, Mamunur Rashid, Imran Hossain, Jewel Hossain and Shakil Alam.
