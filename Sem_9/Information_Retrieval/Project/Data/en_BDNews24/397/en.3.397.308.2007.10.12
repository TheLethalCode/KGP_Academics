<TITLE> French union head wants reforms but not Sarkozy's </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy should prepare for more strikes before the end of this year to protest his plans for reforms, Bernard Thibault, the head of France's largest union said. Notorious for derailing previous governments' attempts at reform despite low membership rates, the unions will hold their first major strike on Oct. 18 to protest changes to generous pensions given to some workers. It is seen as the first test of Sarkozy's ability to handle unions and of union support after his election promising change. Thibault says there will be a huge turnout and is predicting more action to follow even though the government has not started work on an overhaul of other pensions and job contracts. "Before we've even started talking about 2008, it's highly likely there will be other strikes after Oct. 18," the former railway worker told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday.

The last time a government tried to scrap the pension privileges, unions forced a humiliating U-turn. The pension privileges and other social benefits defended by Thibault were granted to help rebuild the economy in the aftermath of the World War Two. Surveys show a majority of French agree with the government that the special pension regimes should be scrapped. Thibault admits that France needs to change to face new challenges including competition from fast-growing economies such as China. But he accuses Sarkozy of adopting any idea put forward by employer group Medef to the detriment of workers. "There are reforms to be made, in lots of areas, but we do not think that the prescriptions given by the employers are the be-all and end-all of the economic policy," he said. His solution to France's relatively high unemployment rate would be to force companies to hire people from an earlier age without experience and keep them until retirement. He would also like to see spending increases in hospitals, education and on infrastructure to boost jobs rather than the "tax package for the rich" that Sarkozy passed in the summer. "It's a bit much that a government tells us in the month of September that France is bankrupt when in July the st
