<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pious Muslims respect strict fasting rules in the holy month of Ramadan but ignorance of their letter and spirit can lead to confusion. Many listeners calling into a special Ramadan programme at Beur FM radio in Paris ask for practical advice on what they can do during the dawn-to-dusk fast. The main prohibitions concern consuming food or drink, smoking or engaging in sexual intercourse during daylight hours. Here are some of the typical questions -- and answers given by imams and Islam experts invited on his show: Q: Can women wear perfume or men wear hair gel during Ramadan? A: Yes, since they are not consumed into the body. Q: Can a person trying to kick the smoking habit wear an anti-nicotine patch? A: Yes, it is a medication that is exempt from the fast. Q: Will my fasting not be valid if I curse? A: cursing should be avoided but does not negate a fast. Q: Should a man who works in a casino quit during Ramadan because gambling is prohibited? A: It is not good to work in a casino, Ramadan or not, but he can work there if he does not participate in the gambling. Q: Is Ramadan fasting invalid if a person does not also perform the additional "tarawih" evening prayers? A: No, tarawih prayers are not obligatory.
