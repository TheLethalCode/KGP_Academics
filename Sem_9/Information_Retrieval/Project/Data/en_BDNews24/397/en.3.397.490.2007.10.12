 LONDON, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A teenager was airlifted to hospital and his father had his nose broken when gatecrashers went on the rampage at a 16th birthday party after details were posted on YouTube, police and media reports said on Friday. More than 100 uninvited teenagers descended on the family house, stole whisky and champagne, smashed windows and started fighting, according to reports.

His father was attacked when he asked the gatecrashers to leave. "It's all a bit of a blur," he said. "I have had to take several days off work with my broken nose and two black eyes." His son Stephen was discharged from hospital the next day. Wiltshire Police arrested six teenagers aged between 15 and 18.
