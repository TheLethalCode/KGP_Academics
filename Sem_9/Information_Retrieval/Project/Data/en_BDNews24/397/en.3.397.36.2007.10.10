 SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global stocks hit fresh record highs on Wednesday, underpinned by talk the Federal Reserve might cut borrowing costs to revive economic growth in the United States, while the dollar steadied after falling from a two-week peak. European shares were set to open stronger, stoked by record highs in US and Asian markets after minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed inflation expectations were contained, leaving the door open for further rate cuts. Financial spreadbetters in London expect the FTSE 100 index to open 23 to 26 points higher, the DAX up 37 to 44 points and the CAC 40 20 to 30 points stronger. "Most investors are no longer so worried about the US economy, and there are expectations that the Fed will continue to lower rates if the US economy slows down," said Cho Seong-joon, an analyst at SK Securities in South Korea. By 0620 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had risen 1.2 percent to a record high, lifting the world index to its loftiest level ever and taking year-to-date gains to almost 15 percent. Japanese stocks, among the worst performers in Asia this year, continued to struggle. The Nikkei average ended almost flat after erasing earlier gains as investors sold Toyota Motor Corp and Olympus Corp, offsetting a rise in retail shares. Australia's S&P ASX 200 rose 0.9 percent to set a second consecutive closing high, led by resources stocks, such as BHP Billiton Ltd, which got a boost from firmer metals and oil prices. Seoul shares rose 1.3 percent to clinch a third straight intraday record, while Hong Kong shares were up 1.3 percent. Taiwan markets were closed for a holiday. STEADY DOLLAR The dollar barely budged against the euro, having retreated from a two-week high on the possibility of further US interest rate cuts. The euro was flat at $1.4104 and expectations of further gains were limited after European officials expressed their displeasure over the strength of the single currency. "The euro may be vulnerable to verbal intervention from European policymakers," said Tomoko Fujii, senior economist and strategist at Bank of America in Tokyo, given the euro's climb to a record high around $1.4280 earlier this month. The dollar was steady at 117.20 yen, but stayed within sight of an eight-week high touched on Monday. But traders said the US dollar would stay weak even after strong US jobs data released late last week scaled back some expectations for a Fed rate cut this month, which had prompted a short-lived climb in the dollar. They said Wall Street's rally on Tuesday was likely to trigger selling in the low-yielding yen for assets denominated in higher-yielding currencies. "It looks like selling in both the dollar and the yen is starting to pick up again," said Hiroshi Yoshida, a forex trader at Shinkin Central Bank. The Singapore dollar hit a new 10-year high around S$1.4625 per dollar as investors sold the US dollar after the island's central bank surprised markets with its tighter policy stance. Oil dropped 11 cents to $80.15 a barrel, with dealers taking some profits from the previous day's rally on worries over lower heating fuel stockpiles in the Northern Hemisphere ahead of peak winter demand. Gold rose to $740.50/$741.30 an ounce, from $736.60/$737.40 late in New York, due to a weaker dollar and firmer oil prices. Tokyo futures tracked bullion to hit a 22- year high. Japanese government bonds slipped, in sympathy with a slide in US Treasuries the previous session and firm stocks. December 10-year futures ended the session down 0.20 point at 134.33 near a two-month low of 134.14 hit on Tuesday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 1.725 percent. bd
