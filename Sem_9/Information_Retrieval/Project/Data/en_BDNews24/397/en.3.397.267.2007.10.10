 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar, the would-be buyer of state-run Rupali Bank Ltd, is aiming to close the deal by November, a top aide to the prince said Wednesday. "To expedite this, a royal Saudi team comprising senior business advisers to HRH Prince Bandar, is arriving towards the end of the month (October) for final negotiations," Sir Frank Peters, senior adviser to the prince, told bdnews24.com in an exclusive e-mail interview Wednesday. Peters said he had met with the Rupali managing director and other management level senior officials Tuesday to discuss "snags" that have held up the signing of the Sales-Purchase Agreement (SPA). "I told them (senior management) that HRH Prince Bandar had set a new deadline of November to finalise negotiations and to take over the bank," he said. Peters said: "Most of the hard work has been done and I anticipate it won't be too long before His Royal Highness makes a public statement on the subject." "The speed at which the bank is handed over depends entirely on the government of Bangladesh," he said. "The Prince Bandar team is ready for a smooth, swift takeover that will be of mutual benefit to both parties, but of enormous benefit to the economy of this nation and its people." Abu Solaiman Chowdhury, chairman of the Privatisation Commission, said his office was ready to close the deal. "We've been ready for a long time to hand the bank over to the buyer. Now it depends on them (buyers)," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. He also said he had not received a written notice of the proposed deadline. Prince Bandar Bin Mohammad Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud, who won the purchase bid for 67.26 percent share of the bank at $330 million in 2006, also offered to buy the remaining 26 percent government stake for $128 million in February. Private investors hold a 6 percent stake in the bank. The government announced on Feb 22 that it would sell the bank's remaining 26 percent government-held shares to the prince. But the handover of Rupali was delayed by outstanding issues between the two parties. Peters said Prince Bandar was keen to invest in Bangladesh and looked forward to concluding the Rupali handover deal. He referred to the Rupali acquisition as "one of many projects for Bangladesh". The Saudi royal's adviser said there were outstanding issues that would have to be solved before the bank could be taken over but did not elaborate on what they were. "If the negotiations are successful, and I have every reason to believe they will be, the Sale and Purchase Agreement will be signed within days of the government giving the green light." It was unclear whether Prince Bandar would visit Dhaka for the historic signing. Peters said: "No doubt His Royal Highness would love to visit Dhaka and sign the Sales-Purchase Agreement personally, and he may do that, but as a precaution I have been given power of attorney to sign the SPA on his behalf." bdnew
