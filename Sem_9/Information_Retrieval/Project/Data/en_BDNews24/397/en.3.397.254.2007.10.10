<TITLE> India's riot-scarred Gujarat to vote in December </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The western Indian state of Gujarat will hold elections in December, in a test for the country's ruling Congress party, currently facing its worst crisis since coming to power in 2004. India's election authorities also announced that voting for a new assembly in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh would be held on Nov. 14 and Dec. 19. "This is the first direct fight between the Congress and the (opposition Bharatiya Janata Party) BJP since the changes in the country's political climate, primarily over the nuclear deal," political analyst Mahesh Rangarajan said. The Congress, which heads India's ruling coalition, is facing a major challenge from its leftist allies over a nuclear deal with the United States that its communist partners oppose. Its leftist allies have threatened to withdraw support for the coalition if the government goes ahead with the deal. If that happens, the government would be reduced to a minority and national elections could be held ahead of the 2009 schedule. More than 30 million people will vote for 182 seats in two phases on Dec. 11 and Dec. 16 in Gujarat where Chief Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP has won the last three successive elections. Five years ago, Modi was accused of turning a blind eye while the state was torn apart by Hindu-Muslim riots in which, human rights groups say, some 2,500 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The official death toll is about 1,000. The riots in 2002 erupted after a fire broke out on a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, killing 59 people. A Muslim mob was accused of starting the fire.
