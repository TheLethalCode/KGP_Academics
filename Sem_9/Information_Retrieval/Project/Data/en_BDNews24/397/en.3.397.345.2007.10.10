<TITLE> Garment factories to pay workers dues before Eid: BGMEA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Garment factory owners have said that they are making "every effort" to comply with the government's order to pay all workers salaries and Eid bonuses by October 11, a business leader said Wednesday. The government directive followed renewed unrest from garment factory workers in Gazipur and Dhaka over the last few days. "Factory owners are aware of the situation and said they will pay their workers before the Eid festival by any means," said Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The Special Branch of Police provided the BGMEA with a list of 37 garment factories, which they felt may experience labour unrest if their employees failed to receive their pay and bonuses in time, said an SB officer requesting anonymity. The BGMEA chief admitted that some factory bosses were not happy with the order, saying: "Factories are being helped by bankers to clear the workers' salaries and Eid bonuses in time." "The BGMEA has received a list of factories from the Special Branch," Chowdhury added. bdnews24.c
