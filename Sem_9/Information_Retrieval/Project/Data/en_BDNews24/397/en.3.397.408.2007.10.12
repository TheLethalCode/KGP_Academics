<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mohammad Yousuf marked his return to test cricket with an undefeated 63 which allowed Pakistan to salvage a draw on the final day of the second test against South Africa on Friday. South Africa took the two-match series 1-0 after they won the first test in Karachi by 160 runs. It was the second time South Africa had won a test series in Pakistan after 1997. Pakistan finished on a total of 316 for four with Yousuf and captain Shoaib Malik (20) at the crease after being set a victory target of 457 runs. Younis Khan (130), Kamran Akmal (71) and Yousuf batted sensibly and patiently to save the day which began on 108 for one with the visitors pushing for a second victory. Inzamam-ul-Haq fell for just three runs in his final test innings to end his career on 8,830 runs from 120 matches. His failure came after Younis had scored his second century of the series and the 14th of his career and shared partnerships of 161 with Akmal and 89 with Yousuf. Yousuf scored his 28th career fifty after he missed the first test due to lack of match fitness. He saw off the final attempt by the visitors to win the match when they took the second new ball immediately after tea. Pakistan lost three wickets in the day. Akmal played on to his stumps after prodding defensively to left arm spinner Paul Harris and Younis was caught behind off Jacques Kallis. Inzamam, after playing his first shot to midwicket for a three, was out second ball when he jumped down the wicket to Harris and was stumped
