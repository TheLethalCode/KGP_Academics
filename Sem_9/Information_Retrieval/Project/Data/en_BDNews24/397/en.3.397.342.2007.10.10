 BANGKOK, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai coup leader Sonthi Boonyaratglin, now a deputy prime minister, plans to use a Cold War-era anti-communist security network to teach voters to elect "good people" in a general election due in December. Many rural poor in the country of 65 million have "little understanding" of democracy, Sonthi told Reuters in an interview that raises questions about the fairness of a poll meant to restore democracy after last year's military coup. "People still have poor judgement in voting for a politician," Sonthi said in his first foreign media interview since taking up a security role in the cabinet following his retirement as army chief at the end of last month. "Many of them are influenced either by money or politicians' canvassers. That's what we need to correct," he said. "Poverty hinders the progress of democracy. We need to explain to the people what permanent prosperity is. Taking money from politicians is not a permanent solution to solve their poverty," he said. As army chief, Sonthi led the September 2006 coup against Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- landslide election winner in 2001 and 2005 -- accusing him of presiding over rampant corruption and demeaning the royal family. Thaksin, in exile in London since his removal, denies the allegations and says he will return to clear his name after the elections on Dec. 23. All lese majeste accusations have been shelved and the only formal charges laid against Thaksin relate to asset concealment and a Bangkok land purchase made by his wife. Sonthi's appointment to the cabinet with a watching brief over both the interior and foreign ministries, has alarmed opponents of the coup, who fear he will be able skew the election towards the army and royalist establishment. Sonthi said Thais needed to be remember their "rights and duties" as citizens when casting their votes. "The majority of Thais always demand their rights, but they hardly know their duties. In a democratic country, a perfect citizen must know both his rights and duties," he said. FORMER DEATH SQUADS To achieve this end, Sonthi said he had instructed the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) -- which started out leading an anti-communist fight during the Cold War and included death squads -- to educate the public. "I've assigned the ISOC to train civil servants from various ministries to have a good grasp of the concepts of the rights and duties of the perfect Thai. Then these government officials will be mobilised to educate the people," he said. In Sonthi's view, good citizens have a duty to pay tax and vote for "good" politicians, whom he defined as patriotic and ethical. Sonthi said he would order the Interior Ministry, which supervises all 76 provincial governors, to work with provincial ISOC teams on the campaign to educate leaders of Thailand's 80,000 villages, who will then have to pass on their learning. "We want a free and fair election and we want the people to vote for good people to run the country," he said, a clear dig at Thaksin, who retains strong support if August's constitutional referendum is anything to go by. Although the army-drafted charter was passed, 41 percent of people rejected it in what was seen as a protest vote against the army, the coup and dissolution of Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party. The vote suggested Thaksin remained hugely popular with rural voters for giving them cheap healthcare and credit to farmers. Sonthi urged former opposition parties, led by the Democrats, to unite in case their in-fighting allowed the new People Power Party, -- the main TRT rump -- to sneak a win and cement a place in a coalition. "They must not compete against one another," Sonthi said. bd
