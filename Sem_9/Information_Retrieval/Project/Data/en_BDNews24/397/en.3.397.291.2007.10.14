<TITLE> Australian opposition leader offers Labor hope </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, described as a technocrat addicted to the media, has given Australia's centre-left Labor Party its best chance in 12 years of winning power at the Nov. 24 national elections. After less than a year as opposition leader, Kevin Rudd has provided labor a solid and sustained lead in opinion polls, lifting his party's hopes of ending conservative rule. But Australians are still getting to know Rudd, 50, a politician with strong Christian morals who describes himself as an economic conservative, who has been criticised as being a young version of conservative Prime Minister John Howard, 68. "It is too soon to form a judgment about Rudd's personality. We do not know enough about the man to form a final verdict," author Nicholas Stuart concluded after writing an unauthorised biography of Labor's leader. The personal section of Rudd's official parliamentary biography gives no clues to his personality, stating only: "Born 21.9.1957, Nambour, Qld. Married." So little is known that when it was revealed in August that Rudd once briefly visited a New York strip club, but was too drunk to remember any details, his approval rating went up and Australians were relieved to know he doesn't work all the time. What is known is that Rudd, a devout Christian who voted against embryonic stem cell research, was a brilliant student with a reputation for hard work. The youngest of four children, Rudd grew up in poverty in a small country town in the northern state of Queensland. His life was thrown into turmoil when Rudd was 11, when his father died after a car crash. The family was then forced off the dairy farm their father ran but did not own, shaping Rudd's early political views on the value of welfare. "When my father was accidentally killed and my mother, like thousands of others, was left to rely on the bleak charity of the time to raise a family, it made a young person think," Rudd said in his first speech to parliament in 1998. As a teenager, Rudd threw himself into school work, reading transcripts of parliamentary debates in his spare time. He became a champion debater and was top academically at his high school. He also joined the youth wing of the Labor Party. POLITICS IS POWER Rudd mastered Chinese language, culture and politics at the Australian National University in Canberra, where his tutors described him as serious and self-disciplined, and he joined Australia's diplomatic service after graduation. Rudd served in postings in Stockholm and Beijing before working for the state Labor government in his home state of Queensland. Rudd won a seat in Australia's parliament in 1988, and the first four words he spoke in parliament made it clear he had ambitions. "Politics is about power," he said as he started his first speech. He ended with an equally bold declaration: "I have no intention of being here for the sake of just being here. Together with my colleagues it is my intention to make a difference." Promoted to the opposition foreign affairs portfolio in 2001, Rudd quickly built a reputation for hard work and gaining media attention, regularly ringing reporters after work hours and on weekends to promote his views on the issue of the day. He cemented his national profile with regular spots on morning televison, where he would spar with junior ministers about the political issues of the day. Rudd publicly toyed with contesting the leadership of the Labor Party during two previous leadership ballots, but he decided against running due to limited support. He was elected leader of the Labor Party in December 2006, replacing veteran politician Kim Beazley, and has worked frantically ever since to build his image and profile. Rudd has also attempted to neutralise the government's traditional strength of economic management, boasting that he too is an "economic conservative" who will keep a tight rein on spending with no major change to Australia's economic governance. Rudd has supported the bulk of the government's policies on economic management, national security, immigration and indigenous affairs, prompting critics to label him "Howard lite", or a younger model of the incumbent prime minister. Not all of his colleagues saw Rudd as a potential leader. Former Labor leader Mark Latham, in published diaries which were scathing of his own side of politics, described Rudd as a "technocrat" with limited abilities. "Rudd is a terrible piece of work: addicted to the media and leaking. A junior minister in government at best," Latham wrote. In 1981 Rudd married Therese Rein, whom he met at university and who now runs a successful job placement business. They have three children
