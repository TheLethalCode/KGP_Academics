 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Afghan security forces arrested four suspects in connection with the abduction of BRAC aid worker Nurul Islam, the foreign office said Thursday. "We have already arrested four suspected people in connection with the abduction of Nurul Islam," Afghan foreign minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta was quoted as saying in a letter written to his Bangladesh counterpart Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. Bangladesh's foreign affairs adviser received the letter Thursday, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Spanta said his country's security forces would do their utmost to free Nurul Islam. Spanta's letter came in reply to Chowdhury's second letter to the Afghan foreign minister dated October 9. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed met Afghan President Hamid Karzai on the sidelines of the 62nd UN General Assembly to request the Afghan government to take measures to get Nurul Islam free. Unidentified assailants abducted Islam from an Afghan village on September 15. Two days before his abduction, another official of the Bangladesh Rural Advacement Committee, believed to be the largest NGO in the world, was killed by miscreants. Islam's wife Parvin Rani told reporters that her husband had been kidnapped for ransom. bdnews
