 LAHORE, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan seamer Mohammad Asif could miss the start of the one-day series against South Africa next week because of an elbow problem. Asif left the field during the second test against the South Africans on Wednesday after bowling just four overs and MRI scans showed he had inflammation of the elbow. Doctors have told Asif he needs a week's rest and the player could now miss the first two games in the five-match one-day series in Lahore on Oct. 18 and 20. "He has been advised to not bowl for a week by the doctors but he can train," Pakistan manager Talat Ali said. "It depends on his progress and how quickly the injury heals." Asif has suffered from chronic elbow problems since last year, forcing him to miss four tests in England and the 2007 World Cup. Pakistan are also without fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, suspended indefinitely by the Pakistan Cricket Board after being sent home from last month's Twenty20 World Cup for hitting Asif with a bat
