 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Angry ready-made garment workers Thursday demonstrated and put up barricades on roads in Gazipur and in Chittagong, demanding Eid bonuses. bdnews24.com's Gazipur correspondent reported that some 500 workers from two shut-down factoriesSix H Garments Limited and Giant Garments Limitedowned by the same man, poured onto the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway at 1.00pm. RMG workers' demonstration slowed traffic for nearly three hours on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway. Traffic bottlenecks were cleared up by intervening law enforcers. Tongi police chief Abdus Salam told bdnews24.com that law enforcers contacted the factories' owner, who said that there was no provision to pay the bonus because the factories had been shut down on Sept 19. Security officials then contacted the senior executive of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Monirul Islam. Protesters vacated the highway after Islam assured the workers that their interests would be secured. In a separate incident, workers of Deep Fashion in Tongi and Tomijuddin Textile in Konabari of Gazipur halted work and demanded to be paid their Eid bonus. The situation was defused after workers' dues were paid over in the afternoon. bdnews24.com's Chittagong office reported that Waziko Apparels' workers took positions on Jubilee Road, demanding the payment of three months' arrears and the Eid festival bonus. Demonstrators stayed on the road for nearly half an hour until police persuaded them to disperse. Agitating worker Rahim told bdnews24.com that he and his co-workers were compelled to take to the streets because they had not been paid in three months. Shabnur, another worker, said the factory owner had pledged that dues would be cleared by Wednesday but nothing had been done until 3.00 pm Thursday. "The demonstrating workers curtailed their programme after police assured them that meetings would be held with factory owners," assistant police commissioner of Kotwali zone Abu Bakar Siddique told bdnews24.com. He said the owner claims to have taken measures to pay the workers but could not do so because banks were closed on Thursday. Workers of Moon Fashion and Doublemooring in Sagorika area also held protests to demand that their wages and bonuses be paid. The factory owners started paying workers in the evening. bdnews
