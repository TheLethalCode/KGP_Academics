 WARSAW, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Campaigning for Poland's Oct. 21 parliamentary election is in full swing, but 22-year-old Agnieszka Golik turns off the radio whenever she hears politicians. "I'm fed up with them. I just don't want to get upset so I turn them off," she said during a walk in the capital's Royal Lazienki park. "What they quarrel about is completely absurd and unintelligible." Golik is not alone. Only 40 percent of eligible Poles voted in the previous parliamentary poll in 2005, and with complaining about politics sometimes said to be the national sport, few expect turnout to be significantly higher this time. "I am definitely not going to vote, politicians are all liars," said Jolanta Choman, a 58-year-old cloakroom attendant at the Warsaw University. "Instead, I will plant tulips on my balcony on Sunday to blossom in the spring." But turnout could have important implications for the election result in the country of 38 million, the biggest former communist state in the European Union. Apathy seems strongest among younger voters and they are often the biggest critics of the conservative government of Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, whose twin brother Lech is the president. Surveys show only a third of young voters will turn up at the ballot box. The Kaczynskis, who took power in 2005 on a ticket mixing conservative social values and nationalism, can meanwhile count on a disciplined support base of older, less educated Poles. Surveys show only a third of the electorate back the prime minister but with many of the Kaczynskis' opponents likely to stay home on voting day, this could help their Law and Justice party capture a majority of seats in parliament, pollsters say. This is bad news for main rival Donald Tusk, head of a pro-business and economically liberal Civic Platform party, which would need to bring out the young vote to win. His appeals for higher turnout have been aided by independent campaigns using emails, text messages and radio broadcasts to urge Poles to exercise their voting power even if just to select parties they see as only a lesser evil. "You are disgusted? Vote wearing gloves," says one of the campaign slogans. Poland's low levels of voter participation -- since the fall of communism in 1989, turnout has never exceeded 52 percent -- is a concern for some who believe that democracy suffers. "If a major part of society does not vote, this means the silent majority has no say," said professor Kazimierz Kik, a prominent sociologist. Self-centered political infighting is often given as the reason for voter apathy. "Politicians deal with fighting with each other, not with political debate. That is why more and more people turn their backs on politics," said Iwona Jakubowska-Branicka, professor of political sciences at Warsaw University. Some blame the Polish media, which vilify all politicians and seldom question them on policy rather than trivia. Others say the country's relatively short democratic tradition is the main factor, despite its leading role in the transformation of the former Soviet bloc. "Poles are still unaware voting is a basic citizen's duty, which doesn't have to be explained in long-established and mature western democracies," said Mikolaj Czesnik, a Warsaw-based sociologist said. "It will take generations to develop this sense of democratic participatio
