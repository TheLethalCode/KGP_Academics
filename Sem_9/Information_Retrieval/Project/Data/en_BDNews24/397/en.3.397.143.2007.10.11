 Cleveland, Ohio, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 14-year-old student shot and wounded two adults and two students at a high school near downtown Cleveland before killing himself, authorities said on Wednesday. The reason for the rampage remained unclear but Eugene Sanders, chief executive officer of the Cleveland public schools, said the boy was not supposed to be in the building Wednesday and local media reports said he had been suspended. Police Chief Michael McGrath said the initial investigation indicated that the boy killed himself before police arrived and that he had at least two guns. Asked at a news conference whether he could say the shootings were random, he said he could not. The wounded were two men aged 42 and 57, both of whom were in stable condition, Mayor Frank Jackson said. He said two male students ages 17 and 14 suffered minor gunshot wounds and that a 14-year-old girl, also a student, injured her knee trying to flee the chaos. The shootings took place in the early afternoon at SuccessTech Academy, a 250-student specialized school that concentrates on math and technology. Sanders said he was canceling classes at all Cleveland public schools on Thursday so that parents, students and faculty could "take a breather" and "put this in perspective." Student Latisha Hill told one television station students began taking cover when the emergency command was announced and she locked herself in a bathroom until police knocked on the door and let her out. "All I know is I heard the principal yell 'code blue,'" Hill said. The incident was the latest in a string of shootings in recent years in schools that have shaken the United States. A student at Virginia Tech college killed 32 students and staff in April, then himself, in the worst shooting rampage in modern U.S. history.
