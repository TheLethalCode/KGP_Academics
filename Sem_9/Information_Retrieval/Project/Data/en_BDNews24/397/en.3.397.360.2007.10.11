<TITLE> US seeks WTO panel in copyright dispute with China </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has asked the World Trade Organization to decide whether Chinese barriers to legally produced US music, movies and publications violate global trade rules after direct talks to resolve the dispute failed, US trade officials said on Thursday. "Those discussions have unfortunately not led to a resolution of our concerns, and so we are now taking the next step in this case and asking the WTO to establish a panel," USTR spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement. The United States claims that Chinese import and internal distribution barriers have helped create a vast market for pirated movies, music and books by hampering the ability of US publishers and producers of audio-visual products to get their legitimate products into the Chinese marketplace. The United States requested consultations with China in April and the two sides held talks in early June and late July without resolving the issue. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body will consider the US panel request at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Oct. 22. WTO rules allow members to block a panel one time before it is formed. The Bush administration has been under pressure from Congress to do more to stop widespread piracy and counterfeiting of US goods in China. The US Trade Representative's office in August requested a dispute settlement panel in a related case aimed at alleged deficiencies in China's legal regime for protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights. Two other US challenges against China's auto part import policies and industrial subsidies are working their way through the WTO dispute settlement process.
