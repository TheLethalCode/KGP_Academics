<TITLE> Airbus may alter process for plant sales-Germany </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European plane maker Airbus could alter the bidding process for the planned sale of German plants, a senior government official said on Thursday. "You should not rule out the possibility that the company could decide to change the design of the tender," Peter Hintze, the German government's aerospace coordinator, told reporters. Airbus, a unit of European aerospace group EADS, plans to sell all or part of several of its 116 European plants after delays to its A380 superjumbo hit the company last year. Hintze also said Germany would prefer a domestic solution for the plants and that there were various possible options to aid potential buyers. He said one possibility might be for state development bank KfW to provide guarantees for the financing of a purchase. He also said the search for a partner for the German plants could take time. "I suspect, I predict that it will all need some time," he said. Airbus, which is also cutting 10,000 jobs as part of an overhaul, had orginally aimed to choose buyers for the sites by October. Hintze said it was important to ensure quality and sustainability were the deciding factors in the sales rather than speed.
