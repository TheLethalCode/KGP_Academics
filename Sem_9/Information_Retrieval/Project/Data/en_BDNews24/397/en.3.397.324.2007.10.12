 BERLIN, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Millions of rail passengers in Germany suffered severe delays on Friday when a one-day strike by train drivers over pay disrupted local and regional services. The GDL union, representing some 34,000 drivers, started the walkout at 2 a.m. (midnight GMT) to escalate a dispute with national rail operator Deutsche Bahn that has dragged on for months. About half of regional services were cancelled, according to Deutsche Bahn, in a country unused to rail strikes. "These things are always done at the expense of the little people. The people who have to take regional trains are stuck," said Monika Jahnke, 62, at Berlin's main station. "The drivers have a responsibility to the public. Although I understand they want higher wages, they should stop being so stubborn and come to an agreement." The trains that were running were packed, as were buses, said Reuters witnesses who also experienced long traffic jams on roads into big cities including Frankfurt and Hamburg. The union argues its train drivers are underpaid compared with counterparts elsewhere in Europe. The union has rejected agreements reached between Deutsche Bahn and two other larger rail unions for pay increases of 4.5 percent and wants a separate deal with raises of up to 31 percent. GDL has, however, offered to withdraw the 31 percent demand if Deutsche Bahn discusses a separate agreement. Deutsche Bahn board member Karl-Friedrich Rausch said the union's strike was "incredible" and that GDL was solely to blame for "the foreseeable chaos" in short-haul travel. A survey for Stern magazine on Wednesday had showed 55 percent of Germans sympathise with the strikers. The rail operator has said it will make a new offer by Monday and the union threatened further strikes from Wednesday if the proposal is unsatisfactory. "We will look at the offer Deutsche Bahn makes," said a union spokeswoman. Deutsche Bahn, which the government wants to partially privatise by 2009, is Europe's largest rail and transport firm. It serves more than 5 million passengers daily on 28,000 trains.
