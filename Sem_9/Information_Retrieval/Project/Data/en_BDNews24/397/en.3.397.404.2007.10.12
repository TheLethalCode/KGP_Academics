<TITLE> Bhuiyan wants national unity against boycott, hartal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  Expelled BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday said he was for a broader unity among political parties well ahead of elections on such issues as parliament boycott and general strike. "The political parties must forge a unity on some national issues well before the elections. We'll boycott the parliament and call hartal if we are elected to the opposition, this trend must go," Bhuiyan told reporters at his Nam home in Gulshan. He slightly backtracked on his previous position on supporting a national unity government as proposed by former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury. "I told you before and I am saying again that I wanted consensus on some national issues. Still, a unity government can be formed if all political parties agree to do so after elections. Otherwise how is it possible?" Bhuiyan, who leads the pack of BNP reformists, said he would feel bad on the Eid day since many of his party colleagues and friends were now behind bars. Asked if he would mount a legal challenge against his expulsion from the party, he said "no". "I want to deal with any political issue politically. I am not a litigation-happy man. If anybody wants my suggestions I will ask him not to go to court." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled him from the party before she was arrested on Sept. 3. Bhuiyan, a local government minister during the BNP's latest term, greeted people and expatriate Bangladeshis on the eve of the Eid-ul-Fitr. Meanwhile, some Hindu community leaders invited Bhuiyan to visit some mandops in the capital on the eve of Durga Puja festival. bdnews2
