 AMSTERDAM, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dutch parliament on Thursday supported the government's move to stop paying for protection abroad for outspoken Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali, despite international criticism. A majority of deputies did not support a motion by the Green Left party that would have called on the government to extend the U.S. protection of Hirsi Ali, who left for the United States in 2006 saying death threats made her life unbearable. Somali-born Hirsi Ali, a former Dutch parliamentarian, had returned to the Netherlands this month to discuss her security arrangements, sparking a heated debate about whether the Dutch ought to pay for her bodyguards abroad. Hirsi Ali is a high-profile and controversial figure in the Netherlands, where her comments that Islam is "backward" upset many among the country's one million Muslims. In the vote, only the small liberal party D66 and a single deputy from the governing Labour party supported Green Left. Even the party of anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders -- who himself lives under heavy guard since receiving death threats from Islamist militants -- did not support the motion. "We understand that the minister cannot take lasting responsibility for the protection of people in a different country," Socialist parliamentarian Ronald van Raak said. Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin had told parliament the government had funded Hirsi Ali's security for an interim period after she began work at a think-tank in the United States, and had extended this period twice. The government said it had informed Hirsi Ali in December 2006 that funding for her security abroad, costing 2 million euros ($2.8 million) per year, would be withdrawn from mid-2007. She will continue to be protected while in the Netherlands. In November 2004, film director Theo van Gogh, who made a film with Hirsi Ali in which she accused Islam of condoning violence against women, was murdered by an Islamist militant. He stabbed a note to Van Gogh's body warning Hirsi Ali she would be next.
