 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com) Millions of people Sunday set off three days of Eid celebrations in the country after the end of the holy month of fasting, by attending morning prayers, giving alms and feasting with family and friends. The early morning prayers sought peace and prosperity of the Muslim world. Dhaka City Corporation arranged 360 Eid prayer congregations or jamaats in the city's 90 wards. Baitul Mukarram National Mosque held five jamaats beginning with the first at 7:00am. The centrepiece Eid congregation was held at the National Eidgah, starting around 8:30am. Senior imam Mufti Mohammad Nuruddin of the national mosque led the jamaat. President Iajuddin Ahmed, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, religious affairs adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka joined the jamaat. The celebrations are not without a warning for a not-so-good weather. In a weathercast for Sunday, the meteorological department said light to moderate rains or thundershowers are likely to occur in most places of Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka and Sylhet. In the capital, the DCC had made alternative arrangements for the congregations to continue in the event of rain. The National Moon-sighting Committee announced Friday that it failed to see the Shawal moon anywhere in the sky over Bangladesh, setting the festivities for Sunday. Moon sighting in 64 districts began soon after iftar, but an unclear sky due to clouds in several places prevented the committee members watching the new moon. bdnews24
