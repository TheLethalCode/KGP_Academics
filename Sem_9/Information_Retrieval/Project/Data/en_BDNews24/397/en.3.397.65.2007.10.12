<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will be eligible to play in the fifth and final one-day international against South Africa on Oct. 29, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday. The board's disciplinary committee on Thursday imposed a 13-match ban and 3.4 million rupees ($56,000) fine on Shoaib for four misconduct charges, including hitting team mate Mohammad Asif with a bat before the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Shafqat Naghmi, the PCB's chief operating officer, clarified that the ban period had started the day after the incident on Aug. 27 when team manager Talat Ali sent Shoaib home. "Since his ban period started immediately it covers seven matches of the Twenty20 World Cup and also the two tests against South Africa," Naghmi told Reuters. "This means he will have completed his 13-match ban by the fourth one-dayer and will be eligible for selection for the final game in Karachi," he said. Shoaib has played 43 tests and 133 one-dayers but has not taken part in any competitive cricket since he limped out of the second test against South Africa in January with a hamstring injury. The 32-year-old has played just one test and four one-dayers since February 2006 due to fitness and other problems. He was suspended for two years in 2006 after testing positive for the banned substance nandrolone but was later cleared of doping offences
