<TITLE> Gold market gloomy on high prices </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  A 28-year global gold price high has cast a pall of gloom over the local market ahead the festive season, dampening the demand for the precious metal among potential buyers getting increasingly weaker in purchase power. Gold heated up to touch $747.75 per ounce a week ago, the highest in 28 years, before it fell to $729.70 per ounce this week. Local traders said a bhori (11.66 grams) of gold costs about Tk 19,000 on the basis of the international market price at $742 per ounce. Gold prices in local market have hit a new-high with guinea (21-carat) selling at about Tk 20,000 and 22-carat at Tk 21,000 a bhori . "People's purchasing capacity is always diminishing. The huge hike in its price has further dented the market despite the festive season, such as Eid, approaching," Anwar Hossain, president of Bangladesh Jewellery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BJMEA), told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Hossain said winter was the prime time for gold demand in Bangladesh, but Eid is another peak season for gold traders with scores of marriages taking place. According to a BJMEA study, gold consumption that was about 50 tonnes per year up until 2003 has come down to 15 tonnes now. Traders said surging international prices, fuelled by a weakening dollar and oil turmoil, have led to dull business in the last few years on the domestic gold market. Gold's traditional appeal as a safe asset to hold in times of economic uncertainty made it appealing in troubled markets. Gold ornaments have been used in the Indian sub-continent from prehistoric times and for a variety of reasons. In addition to their aesthetic charm, ornaments represent savings, are used as status symbols, declarations of identity and beliefs, or signs of marital status. In India and Bangladesh, jewellery has been the traditional form of savings, with gold jewellery being prized because it can be easily converted into money. Gold is generally purchased in Bangladesh for wedding, but some use it as fashion jewellery. "Affluent and fashion-lovers are also not coming to buy gold for this Eid festival," Gulzar Ahmed of Apon Jewellers told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh does not import gold, said the traders who said they depended on recycling. Earlier, local traders used to buy gold from people who would frequently go abroad and were allowed to bring 10 kg of gold paying duties Tk 125 a bhori . "People no more bring gold now because a person needs Tk 1.6 crore to import 10 kg gold," Hossain, the BJMEA chief, said. "A shrunk market has been a turn-off for them." Silver too continued to reel under pressure in line with gold prices, traders said. One bhori of silver now costs about Tk 500 in the local market. According to BJMEA, the country has about 5,000 jewellery shops selling readymade ornaments and about 10,000 shops that make ornaments according to customers' choice. The jewellery industry currently employs 1.5 million people, down from 2 million in 2002-03 due to volatile domestic market. ($1= Tk 68.28) bd
