 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com) The Eid ul-Fitr will be celebrated Sunday, as the National Moon-sighting Committee announced Friday evening that it failed to see the Shawal moon anywhere in the sky over Bangladesh. Moon sighting in 64 districts began soon after Iftar, but an unclear sky due to cloud cover in several places prevented the committee experts from watching the new moon. The Islamic Foundation of Bangladesh said in a statement that the committee meeting reviewed reports from its district offices, the meteorological office and other allied organisations before deciding that the Eid would be held Sunday after completion of 30 days of fasting for the month of Ramadan. "We held almost an hour-and-a-half-long meeting, where we reviewed reports from our district offices," a senior member of the committee told the bdnews24.com, preferring not to be named. "The meeting decided that Eid-ul-Fitr would be celebrated Sunday," he said. The meeting, presided over by religious affairs adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, began at 6:30pm and ended at 7:55pm. bdn
