 KATHMANDU, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chief of Nepal's former Maoist rebels threatened that they could bring down the interim government if it does not agree to their demands, including an immediate end to the monarchy, newspapers reported on Wednesday. It is the strongest warning yet from Prachanda, the Maoist chief, since last week's talks failed to end the dispute over the monarchy and the rebels' demand for proportional representation in forthcoming elections. It comes a day before the interim parliament is due to discuss the issue of the monarchy in an emergency session. "If there is disagreement on several issues, the Maoists will launch an agitation and the government may have to be changed," Prachanda, who still goes by his nom de guerre, was quoted as saying in the Himalayan Times. He said if the Maoists were still unhappy after the session then they would "turn the current constitution into a useless piece of paper," according to the Kathmandu Post. He was speaking to reporters in the town of Dipalay in western Nepal. The Maoists waged a deadly civil war for 10 years in their quest for a republic, during which 13,000 people were killed. A peace deal was reached last November, and the Maoists locked up their guns and joined a newly formed interim government. The cornerstone of the deal was that an election be held to form a constituent assembly to map out the political future of the country and decide what to do with King Gyanendra, the country's unpopular and increasingly impotent monarch. The election was meant to take place on Nov. 22. But analysts say the Maoists started to worry they might perform poorly. In the hope of energising their supporters and differentiating themselves from other parties, they pulled out of the government, demanding an immediate abolition of the monarchy and a full system of proportional representation. Talks have so far failed. The election has now been postponed indefinitely, although Prachanda said it could take place in April if the deadlock ended, the Kathmandu Post reported on Wednesday. The interim constitution gives parliament exceptional powers to abolish the monarchy before the election if the king is interfering with the process. The Maoists insist this is happening. The government disagrees. Analysts say that the Maoists still have the power to disrupt the government with large street protests and strikes. Neighbouring India, which helped bring Maoists and mainstream political parties together in 2005, was expected to send Shyam Saran, a senior diplomat, to Nepal on Wednesday to push for an early election and a return to democracy, media reports sa
