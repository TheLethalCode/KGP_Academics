 WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Spiritual guru Sri Chinmoy, a peace activist who inspired his followers to feats of extreme physical endurance, has died at the age of 76 at his home in New York, a statement from his organisation said on Friday. Chinmoy, who suffered a heart attack, died on Thursday. Chinmoy was born in India and in 1964 immigrated to New York, working in the Indian Consulate. He later started a meditation centre that eventually spread around the world. A statement issued on behalf of Chinmoy's followers said he had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Friday. He was a strong supporter of the United Nations and his charities sent food and medicine around the world. Chinmoy's followers were said to take on a regimen of vegetarianism, humanitarian service and extreme physical challenges as a way to inner peace. He set an example by running ultra-marathons before switching to weightlifting. Acolytes said he was capable of lifting airplanes and had written more than 1,600 books of prose and poetry in his quest for world peace. One of his students, Ashrita Furman, set dozens of marks in the Guinness Book of World Records for oddball feats such as going up and down Japan's Mount Fuji on a pogo stick and riding a unicycle backward for 53 miles (85 km). Chinmoy's followers have also included guitarist Carlos Santana, saxophonist Clarence Clemons and singer Roberta Flack.
