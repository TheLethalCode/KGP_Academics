 NEW DELHI, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening a business in India usually involves navigating through mountains of red tape. A World Bank report ranks India 120th out of 178 countries in ease of doing business. Here is a look at some key approvals required to start a business in India: AUTOMATIC/FIPB ROUTE: - The country's central bank (Reserve Bank of India) gives an automatic approval if the proposed foreign investment complies with caps on foreign holdings, which vary from sector to sector. There are some sectors, such as retail, in which foreign firms must also get the approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, made up of senior government officials and headed by the finance minister. REGISTERING A COMPANY: - Setting up a company in India requires permission from the regional registrar of companies, and more than 12 approvals are required if a foreign firm wants to own land and construct its own premises. REGULATORY BODIES: - The Directorate General of Foreign Trade must approve any plans to import or export. - Software Technologies Parks of India registration is required to run a software or an outsourcing firm as it entails tax and import benefits. - Approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India is required for financial firms, while the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority must approve insurance ventures. TAX AUTHORITIES: - A company has to register with tax authorities as it may be liable for a complex web of state and federal taxes. LABOUR WELFARE BODIES: - Approvals from the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation, the Employees' State Insurance Corporation for medical insurance and the RBI to employ foreign nationals are required. ENFORCING CONTRACTS: - India ranks 177th out of 178 countries in the World Bank-International Finance Corp "Doing Business 2008". Enforcing contracts takes on average 46 procedures, 1,420 days and takes up 39.6 percent of the cost of claim. CLOSING BUSINESS: - The report ranks India 137th and says it takes nearly 10 years to close a business.
