 BEIJING, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's urbane commerce minister and a reform-minded former central bank governor are tipped to get new jobs in a reshuffle around a key Communist Party meeting, putting new faces in senior posts in the world's fourth-biggest economy. Commerce Minister Bo Xilai, 58, is likely to become Communist Party boss of the far-flung southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, two independent sources with knowledge of the planned reshuffle said on Friday. The job would mean Bo is virtually assured of a seat in the Party's decision-making Politburo, ranked one notch below the Standing Committee, at a post-Congress meeting. "Opinion of Bo Xilai within the party is divided. Some see him as competent. Others say he likes to show off," one source told Reuters, requesting anonymity. Barring last-minute changes, Bo would replace Wang Yang, 52, a rising star and an ally of President Hu Jintao. It was not immediately clear who would replace Bo or what new job Wang would be given. Dai Xianglong, 62, who became mayor of the northern port city of Tianjin in 2003 after a stint as central bank governor, is expected to become Party secretary of the landlocked province of Jiangxi in the southeast of the country, the sources said. The likely chain of moves underscores the complexity and sensitivity of Hu's efforts to engineer a new leadership line-up that will be loyal to him but also satisfy competing Party interests. It was unclear who would replace Dai, whose departure could cast a shadow over plans to turn the Tianjin Binhai New Area into a test-bed for financial and foreign exchange innovations that, if successful, could shape the country's economic future. "The Binhai experiment will continue, but major breakthroughs are unlikely in the near future because of regional competition," said Yi Xianrong, a finance researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank. CELEBRITY 'PRINCELING' Dai would take the place of Meng Jianzhu, 60, who is front-runner to become minister of public security at the annual session of parliament next March, the sources said. Meng would succeed Zhou Yongkang, 64, who would in turn become the country's new security tsar and join the top echelon of power, the Politburo Standing Committee, this month. It was unclear when the reshuffle would be announced but it could come as early as this month. A shake-up of the Party's top leadership is expected at the 17th Congress opening next Monday. The cabinet spokesman's office, the Commerce Ministry and the Jiangxi provincial government declined to make an immediate comment. Chongqing is one of China's most polluted cities, paying a hefty price for its economic boom. It is home to some of the country's top steel, automobile and motorcycle makers. But the post would also put Bo in the centre of efforts to relocate millions more residents around the huge and controversial Three Gorges Dam. Chongqing, along with Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, is a municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the cabinet that does not report to provincial government. Bo is a son of late vice premier Bo Yibo, making him a "princeling", one of the children of China's political elite. The younger Bo is a political celebrity who in the span of three years hopped from mayor of the northeastern port city of Dalian to governor of Liaoning province and then to the post of commerce minister. A sharp dresser and English speaker, Bo charms foreign businessmen with his international air. But he has had no qualms about plunging into spats with the United States and European Union over everything from surging Chinese textile exports to currency policy, testing his mettle and diplomatic skil
