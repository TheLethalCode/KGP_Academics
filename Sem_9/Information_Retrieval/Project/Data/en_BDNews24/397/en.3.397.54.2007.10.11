 SEOUL, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea cut Internet connections to a string of ministry press rooms on Thursday, the latest step in a drive to close down what it says are collusive and cosy clubs. The aim of herding Seoul's journalists into a few centralised briefing rooms has provoked outrage in media organisations and brought accusations that the government is trying to muzzle the press.
