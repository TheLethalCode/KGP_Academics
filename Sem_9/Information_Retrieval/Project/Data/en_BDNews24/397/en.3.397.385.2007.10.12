 BRASILIA, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US government is more confident of achieving success in the Doha round of global trade talks after meeting with Brazilian government officials, White House economic adviser Allan Hubbard said on Thursday. "The Brazilians indicated they are as committed as we are to make Doha work," Hubbard told Reuters. "They recognized how important this is not only to their economy but to the world economy." Hubbard met with Brazilian officials including Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and Dilma Rousseff, chief of staff to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The World Trade Organization's Doha round was launched in 2001 but has been delayed by big differences over how to cut barriers to farm and industrial goods. US Trade Representative Susan Schwab said earlier on Thursday that Doha remained viable but would succeed only with tariff compromises by big developing countries. "It's definitely salvageable," Schwab told reporters in Miami. "It's going to take hard work, and it's going to take countries that have not been inclined to step up stepping up." She had been addressing a meeting of the Organization of Women in International Trade. Hubbard did not say whether Brazil would commit to a version of two WTO draft proposals published in July. Negotiators are working with the proposals aimed at reaching a deal to rebalance world trade rules. Agricultural tariffs and subsidies, and industrial tariffs, have been the most controversial areas. Brazil, India, South Africa and other countries that rely heavily on agriculture exports have focused on trying to cut subsidies and trade barriers by the United States and the European Union. This week they and other advanced developing countries called for more opt-outs from proposed cuts to tariffs on industrial goods as part of the trade negotiations. US and European trade officials said the demands for more opt-outs threaten the multilateral Doha talks, while US manufacturing groups complained they weaken proposals they already see as inadequate. European nations and the United States have been unwilling to reduce aid to cotton, sugar and other products unless they get more access to services and manufacturing in developing nations. US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, who accompanied Hubbard on the visit, urged Brazil on Wednesday to use its influence with developing nations to ensure that the Doha round did not end in a stalemate
