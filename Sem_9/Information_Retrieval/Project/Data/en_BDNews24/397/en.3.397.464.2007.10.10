 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Footballers, coaches, administrators, traders and journalists are wary of further fiasco after the press box of the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) caved in Monday night. "After the incident, [the traders] feel insecure to remain inside the shops in the market as there is no guarantee that another breakdown will not happen," SM Firoz Alam, president of the BNS Merchant Syndicate, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "I don't understand why the structure fell down although a lot of money was spent on the stadium," Alam said. "I think there was no transparency in the construction work." The 150-capacity press box was built under the renovation project of the BNS at a cost of Tk 25 crore and it opened to journalists in March, 2006, ahead of the 16-nation AFC Challenge Cup in Bangladesh in April. "I'm living in fear after the collapse," said M Firoz Shah, owner of Amanat Electronics situated just under the press box. "I ran out of my shop when the roof had fallen down at that night believing that an earthquake was happening. Later I realised that the roof had collapsed," said Shah. He added that electronics goods worth Tk 3 lakh were damaged from water that entered into his shop after the collapse. Former Bangladesh football captain Arif Khan Joy believes the Bangladesh football has to pay a price for the fiasco. "It has set a bad example for us and we all are at risk in the stadium," Joy said. "The incident may reduce the spectators at the galleries in future because of fear of another collapse." Mohammedan Sporting Club coach Shafiqul Islam Manik said the collapse had left them in shock. "The Bangladesh football is experiencing a bad patch this time and the breakdown is likely to stop the spectators coming to the stadium," Manik said. He said the National Sports Council should take steps to ensure the stadium is safe for the spectators. Nurul Alam Chowdhury, president of Sheikh Russel Krira Chakra, was however worried over Bangladesh's image in the international arena alongside the FIFA and the AFC. "The collapse will certainly dent our image in the international arena, but we have to see how the FIFA and the AFC take this incident. We have to be prepared to face it," said Chowdhury. Al Musabbir Sadi, a sports journalist, however believes the collapse will not keep the spectators from coming to the stadium. "It can at best trouble the football federation in getting permission to hold international matches from FIFA and AFC at this venue, but it depends on how the BFF tackles the situation," said Sadi. The collapse has raised the question about whether the NSC, administrator of the stadium, did routine inspection during renovation at the BNS. "There is no possibility of other parts of the BNS breaking down as it looks now like a new stadium after renovation," said NSC's former director (planning and development) Nurul Haq Prodhan, who has been transferred to the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Prothisthan. "We are going to form a committee to examine the entire stadium to see whether the BNS is secure," said NSC director (planning and development) Abdur Rahman, who is also chief of a committee tasked to investigate the incident. bdnew
