 PRISTINA, Serbia, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in Kosovo partially evacuated the main building of the United Nations mission in the Serbian province and a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspect device, officials said on Wednesday. Kosovo police spokesman Veton Elshani said the device had been found during a routine sweep of a U.N. police car returning to the car park. The NATO peacekeeping force sent in a remote-controlled robot that destroyed the object. "The UN mission has been partially evacuated as a security precaution," a UN source said. Police cordoned off the street in front of the mission, that has run the breakaway province since 1999, when NATO expelled Serb forces accused of ethnic cleansing of Albanian civilians while fighting separatist guerrillas. The province's 90-percent Albanian majority is impatient for independence. Frustration has been mounting in recent months at the West's stalled bid to grant them independence in the face of Serbian and Russian opposition. Some in the province have turned against UN authorities, blaming them for the political limbo that has kept Kosovo in poverty. In 2005, a bomb exploded in the car park of the UN building, destroying several cars and shattering windows.
