 Rajshahi, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com) - The wives of eight detained Rajshahi University teachers Wednesday jointly petitioned chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed for their husbands' release before the Eid and Durga Puja holidays. They faxed the appeal to the chief adviser at about 11:30am Wednesday. It said the academics' wives, children, parents and relatives were in anguish and terribly concerned for the detained teachers. Despite the festive season, the detained teachers' minor children were depressed in the absence of their fathers, the petition said. The teacher's wives asserted that their husbands were never involved in any activity against the state, society or education. They urged the chief adviser to withdraw the cases filed against them. The appeal was signed by former vice chancellor Prof M Saeedur Rahman Khan's wife Kamarun Nahar Khan, Prof Abdus Sobhan's wife Monwara Sobhan, Prof Moloy Kumar Bhowmik's wife Swapna Bannerjee, Prof Chowdhury Sarwar Jahan Sajal's wife Hasna Ara Begum, Prof Golam Sabbir Sattar Tapu's wife Tanjima Yasmin, Selim Reza Newton's wife Shusmita Chakravarty, Dulal Chandra Biswas's wife Sanchita Roy and Abdullah Al Mamun's wife Udisa Islam. bdnews24.c
