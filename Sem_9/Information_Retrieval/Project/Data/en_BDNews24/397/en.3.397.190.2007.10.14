 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)  It was a special day for Wali Ullah, a prisoner of the Dhaka Central Jail, who led an Eid jamaat Sunday for ordinary inmates. It was more so for Hafez Abul Kashem, another prisoner who led a VIP congregation, where Tarique Rahman offered prayers. For the first time in the country's history, authorities allowed journalists to come close to prisoners inside the jailthanks to a special arrangement, which inspector general (prisons) Brigadier General Zakir Hasan said was part of jail reforms. For the one-and-a-half-hour event, jail authorities kept fingerprints of the reporters to let them in and out of the compound. Festoons and colourful banners on Eid greetings appeared on the brick walls of the central jail in Old Dhaka, far removed from the other quarters of the city. The central jail held three Eid congregations on the basis of statusone for ordinary inmates, the second for high-profile prisoners and the third for those who have to walk gallows. The first congregation meant for the ordinary inmates started 20 minutes late at 7:50am on an open strip between Meghna and Jamuna cellsthe names that recall the two mighty rivers flowing through Bangladesh. Several thousand prisoners, prisons officials and journalists stood in rows to pray together on the Eid day that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Liton Haider spotted Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Azizul Bari Helal and ward commissioner Chowdhury Alam in the congregation. Sonali Bank union leader BM Bakir tried to stand in the front row, but deputy inspector general (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui asked him to go elsewhere. It was not clear where Bakir stood to say his prayers. The second jamaat took off at 8:45am near the Karnaphuli cell, where several BNP leaders including former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman were present. Journalists were kept away from the VIP rows. A group of reporters ran towards Abdul Awal Mintoo when he stepped out of the VIP zone. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui stepped in and stopped the reporters taking comment from the former FBCCI president who is facing corruption charges. Mintoo is part of a long line of the prisoners arrested in an anticorruption crackdown launched in the wake of the January 11 changeover. Former police officer (AC) Akram, who has been serving a jail term for his role in the killing of Independent University student Rubel, was seen in new punjabi and pajamas. In the crowd was a smiling Shafiqul Islam Sentu, former ward commissioner for Dhaka. The reporters spoke to ordinary inmates to gather details about the high-profile prisoners. They said the former ministers and lawmakersregardless of political leaningsembraced one another after the prayers. All were in new clothes. "There are some legal restrictions. We can't allow you (journalists) to get close to the VIPs," Siddiqui said. Brigadier General Zakir Hasan told the reporters that the caretaker government had taken several steps to dispel the misgivings about the country's jails. "The move to bring journalists in was part of reform," he said. The reporters were served vermicelli cooked by inmates, before they wrapped up covering the rare event. bd
