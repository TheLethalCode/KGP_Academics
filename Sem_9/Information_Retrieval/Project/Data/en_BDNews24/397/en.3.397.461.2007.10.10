 BARODA, India, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India are hoping Sachin Tendulkar's 400th one-day appearance on Thursday will inspire them to a series-levelling win over Australia. Tendulkar hit a one-day record 84th fifty to lift the hosts to an eight-run victory on Monday as India pulled back to a 2-1 deficit in the seven-match series with three games remaining. The series opener was washed out. "For Sachin every day is a big day. He's achieved so many milestones that playing the 400th one-dayer is a small dot in his list of achievements," left-arm spinner Murali Kartik told a news conference on Wednesday. "We've got some momentum. We want to build on that, doing what we've done right," added Kartik, who returned to international cricket in the last match after an injury-forced 20-month break. "Against Australia you need that momentum. Once they have a foot on you they keep it there. Now, with this win in the last game we've got that foot away. It would have been difficult to come back from 3-0." Tendulkar, 34, will become the second player after Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya to play in 400 one-dayers when he takes the field in Baroda on Thursday. The batsman holds the one-day record for most runs (15,563), centuries (41) and fifties (84)
