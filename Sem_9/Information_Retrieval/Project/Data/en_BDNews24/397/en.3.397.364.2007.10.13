<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's revered King Bhumibol Aduyadej, the world's longest reigning monarch, was treated in hospital for eight hours on Saturday and a blood clot was found in his leg, the palace announced. King Bhumibol, who will be 80 in December, was taken to hospital after complaining of weakness in his right side and tests showed a slight lessening of the blood flow to his brain, the palace said in a short statement read out on television. The statement said his leg was better after treatment and did not say whether he had been kept in hospital for observation. King Bhumibol has been a powerful force for national unity during a series of military coups and constitutional experiments and is genuinely revered in Thailand. In June, the country celebrated his 60th year on the throne.
