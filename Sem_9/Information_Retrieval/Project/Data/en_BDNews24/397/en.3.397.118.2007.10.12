 NAPLES, Italy, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police said on Friday they had detained six teenagers suspected of writing graffiti against Pope Benedict -- including one reading "Hang the Pope" -- ahead of a visit by the pontiff to the southern city this month. The four were charged with vandalism and released, police said. Other anti-pope and anti-clerical slogans were also sprayed on walls during a student demonstration in the city. Last week other graffiti appeared in Naples, including one that said "Death to Ratzinger". The Pope, the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, is due to make a one-day visit to the largest city in southern Italy on Oct. 21 to open an inter-religious meeting. Police said they thought the graffiti was the work of leftist and anarchist groups.
