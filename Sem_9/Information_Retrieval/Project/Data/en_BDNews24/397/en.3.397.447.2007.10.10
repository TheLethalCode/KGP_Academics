 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Power Development Board is owed Tk 4019 crore in outstanding arrears by different government and private institutions, according to a PDB estimate. The unpaid dues have piled up since PDB was established in 1991, and amounted to a total of Tk 10,724 crore, up to August 2007, including surcharges. PDB chairman Mohammad Khizir Khan told bdnews24.com: "If the total dues were realised, the amount could be spent for the development of the power sector. " "The PDB would be able to generate a total of 1000 MW per year with the money and there would be no need to request donors for help in power generation," said Khan. Power board officials said that the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority alone owes Tk 3,226 crore, or Tk 9,931 crore with surcharge. The amount due from the DESA is equivalent to bills for 31 and a half months, according to a PDB report, despite the fact that DESA has been paying its bills regularly for the last three years. Over the last three years, DESA has paid an additional Tk 300 crore, above its regular power expenditure, in an attempt to pay off its arrears. The Rural Electrification Board stands second in the list of bill defaulters, owing a total of Tk 251 crore to the PDB. The partly privatised Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO) owes Tk 108 crore and Westzone Power Distribution Company owes Tk 53 crore. PDB is also owed arrears worth Tk 27 crore from other government organisations; Tk 42 crore is owed by autonomous bodies, while the private sector owes Tk 312 core. Khizir Khan told bdnews24.com: "We have informed the higher authorities of the matter. There has been no outcome though a number of meetings have been held in this regard." "DESA owes the highest amount. We were supposed to get their dues earlier, but DESA is not paying up. The others have arrears of only one or two months." The dues of DESA and REB have become a huge burden. DESA is showing reluctance to pay the money, giving various reasons such as budgetary shortage, say PDB officials. bdnews24.com tried to contact DESA chairman Nazrul Hasan Wednesday, but his office said he was at a meeting. PDB officials said different government organisations had paid up bills up to June. The PDB said mobile courts led by 15 magistrates were in operation cutting off connections every month for non-payment of dues. bdnews24.
