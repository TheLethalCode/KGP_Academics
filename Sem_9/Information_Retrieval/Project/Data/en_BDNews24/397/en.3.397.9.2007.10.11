 LONDON, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sir John Bourn, head of the government spending watchdog, has notched up nearly 27,000 pounds of expenses on meals at some of London's top restaurants during the past three years, figures on Thursday showed. The comptroller and auditor general at the National Audit Office also billed the organisation about 350,000 pounds for business trips abroad for the same period, frequently accompanied by his wife. The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, have sparked an outcry. Conservative MP Lee Scott, said: "I find it verging on the ridiculous, the level of hospitality taken at the taxpayers' expense when he is the guardian of the taxpayers' money." Bourn, whose job it is to report to parliament on waste and extravagance in central government spending, dined out up to nine times a month in the three years since 2004. He most frequently went to the Savoy, Wiltons, The Square, the Ritz, Aurora and the Goring, though the Dorchester and the Connaught were also popular. His cheapest meal was a 33-pound breakfast for two at the Chesterfield, while his most expensive was dinner for four at Wiltons, at a cost of 500 pounds -- three of the guests were from the NAO. He spent 301 pounds on a meal for two at the Ritz. Dinner guests included permanent secretaries, directors of big accounting companies and defence contractors. Trips abroad on NAO business included flights to Brazil, South Africa, St. Petersburg and Budapest. A visit to the Bahamas last year, accompanied by his wife, for discussions with the ministry of finance, cost more than 11,000 pounds. He has also received hospitality from companies and organisations, including a trip to the British Grand Prix as a guest of BAE. The Public Accounts Commission, a body of MPs, looked at Bourn's expenses in the summer, and exonerated him of any wrongdoing. But he no longer travels first class. The NAO has decided to voluntarily place management expenses on its Web site every six months, along the lines of the Canadian model. A spokeswoman for the NAO said: "We have decided to take the unprecedented step of volunteering all this information -- even though nobody has requested all these details. We thought this would contribute to transparency." She added: "The auditor general justifies the dinners and lunches as part of the need for the NAO to keep in touch with a wide range of people, including companies that are doing business with government and the NAO."
