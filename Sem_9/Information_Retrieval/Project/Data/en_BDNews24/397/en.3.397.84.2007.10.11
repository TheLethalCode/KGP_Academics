<TITLE> BP CEO outlines plan to turn around oil giant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chief executive of BP Plc on Thursday outlined a plan to address industry-lagging profitability by improving operational performance and reducing "unacceptably high" costs. BP plans to slash layers of management, reduce the number of operating segments from three to two and force the adoption of standardised procedures across the company, which in the past has often duplicated procedures among its disparate units. CEO Tony Hayward said the plan was the result of a six-month review started when he took over in May. "BP's performance has materially lagged our peer group in the last three years. It has been poor because we are not consistent and our organisation has grown too complex," CEO Tony Hayward said in a statement. "What we are doing represents a fundamental shift in how BP works," Hayward said. BP has suffered delays on key projects such as the Thunder Horse and Atlantis fields in the Gulf of Mexico and it is hoped the streamlined structure will boost revenues by ensuring such projects start up on time in future. Hayward said he expected the gap between BP's financial performance and its competitors to narrow in the fourth quarter, as major new fields start up and the company's refineries return to full capacity. BP's shares added slightly to earlier gains after the statement, which had been widely flagged in previous days, trading up 1.8 percent at 590 pence at 1143 GMT, outperforming a 1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index.
