<TITLE> Turkish PM to ask approval for Iraq incursion </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's prime minister will ask parliament to authorise a military push into north Iraq to fight Kurdish rebels amid Turkish anger on Thursday at a US vote branding Ottoman Turk killings of Armenians genocide. Analysts say a large Turkish cross-border incursion remains unlikely, but Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government will seek authorisation for it after a public holiday which ends on Sunday, a ruling party member told Reuters. Washington fears such a move could destabilise Iraq's most peaceful area and potentially the wider region, but Erdogan has been under mounting pressure to act after Wednesday's vote on the highly sensitive issue of the killings in 1915 of Armenians. The US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee approved a resolution branding the killings genocide -- a charge Turkey hotly denies. The United States relies on Turkish bases to supply its war effort in Iraq but the US vote. Any Turkish offensive into north Iraq would seriously strain ties with the United States and possibly hurt Turkey's European Union accession bid. "The resolution won't go to parliament today. It will be sent to parliament after Bayram (public holiday)," the senior ruling AK Party lawmaker, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The holiday begins on Oct. 12 and ends on Oct. 14. The Turkish government cautioned on Thursday that relations with its NATO ally would be harmed by the U.S. committee's decision. The non-binding resolution now goes to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democratic leaders say there will be a vote by mid-November. Ankara will now lobby Congress to prevent the bill from being approved. Erdogan is due to travel to Washington in early November for talks with U.S. President George W. Bush. The committee's decision on Wednesday is expected to weaken U.S. influence over Turkey, which has NATO's second-largest army, at a time when the government ponders whether to push for a military operation into mainly Kurdish northern Iraq. "Unfortunately there is a linkage between the bill and a Turkish incursion into northern Iraq because the Turkish public will be much angered towards the United States and the government will feel so as well," Faruk Logoglu, an influential and former Turkish ambassador to Washington, told Reuters. "However I think the madness of the Armenian bill wouldn't be a green light for an incursion into northern Iraq. On the contrary the US should, and may, do something against the PKK to please the Turkish state and its people," he said. Turkey's powerful armed forces have frequently called on the government to give them the green light to pursue the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) -- which is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and the EU, into Iraq. Ankara says 3,000 PKK rebels are based in the Iraqi mountains from where they stage attacks into Turkey. Parliament, where Erdogan's ruling centre-right AK Party has a big majority, would have to grant permission for troops to cross the border into Iraq. Passing the measure would not automatically mean Turkish troops going into northern Ir
