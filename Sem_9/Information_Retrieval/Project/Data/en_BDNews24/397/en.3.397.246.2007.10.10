 WASHINGTON, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With 47 million Americans now lacking health insurance, most US states plan to expand coverage of lower-income uninsured next year, a prominent health-care group reported on Wednesday. The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured survey found that after several years of cost-containment measures, 42 states reported that they were taking steps to cover more people next year. More than 9 million of the uninsured are children. "Improved state revenues and modest enrollment growth have given states a window to address program improvements that have not been possible for a number of years," the report said.

States reported considering such steps as raising income eligibility levels, or covering new populations such as older adolescents or young adults leaving foster care. Massachusetts and several other states are moving to cover all their uninsured. The Kaiser survey found that 42 states planned on expanding coverage, and for the first time in five years no states planned benefit cuts. Several states had, or planned to shortly, raise payments to health-care providers to help ensure that people could get the treatment they need. States were also experimenting with new ways of keeping older people out of nursing homes or other institutions by having care at home or in community-based settings. They are also increasingly linking quality to payments, forcing health plans taking part in Medicaid to provide more information on their performance, a trend also
