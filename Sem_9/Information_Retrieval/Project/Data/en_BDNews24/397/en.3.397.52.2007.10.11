 ZAGREB, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia is on course to become the European Union's 28th member, but its entry date will only be set when membership talks are nearly complete, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in remarks published on Thursday. Rehn told the Croatian daily Jutarnji List in an interview that he was satisfied with progress in Zagreb's membership talks, which it opened together with Turkey two years ago.
