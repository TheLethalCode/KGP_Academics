 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  At least five holidaymakers died and 30 were injured after an overcrowded passenger train derailed Saturday, police and railway officials said. The train was heading for Dhaka from Chittagong. Five bogeys of Mohanagar Provati Express came off the track near Barotakia Station, Quazi Asadullah, additional director general (operations) of Bangladesh Railway, told bdnews24.com. The accident disrupted rail links to Chittagong. Chittagong police and the station manager of Chittagong Railway Station confirmed the death of the five passengers. The reason behind the accident, a day before the Eid, was not immediately clear but a railway official said his initial assumption that high-speed was the trigger. Rescuers recovered two bodies, but the remaining three were trapped under wheels, said Mirshwarai police sub-inspector Abdur Rob. Two men have been identified: 28-year-old Giasuddin of Mymensingh and 25-year-old Al Amin of Akhaura. He said parts of the trapped bodies were visible. The police and members of the joint forces cordoned off the accident site. They said they would soon start salvage operations. Ibrahim Karim, the railways divisional manager, said the accident took place around 8:30am near Batotakia station, with 1,186 passengers on board. The 16-bogey train has a capacity of carrying 850 people but a huge rush of homebound passengers stretched the services. Meanwhile, the ill-fated train with the unaffected coaches left the scene for Dhaka. The injured were hospitalised. Train accidents are common in the country because of a poor signalling system, rundown rail tracks and poor maintenance of the trains. bdnews24.
