 BARODA, India, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Australian seamer Mitchell Johnson returned his first five-wicket haul in one-day internationals to bundle out India for 148 in the fifth match of the series on Thursday. The 25-year-old took the wickets Yuvraj Singh (1), Robin Uthappa (5) and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (4) in a deadly opening spell before snaring Irfan Pathan (26) and Murali Kartik (0) to finish with figures of five for 26. India were bowled out in 39.4 overs, a clinical display by world champions Australia on a two-paced pitch with Brett Lee accounting for key batsmen Rahul Dravid (0) and Sachin Tendulkar (47), who was playing his 400th one-day international. India, who trail the seven-match series 2-1, were reeling at 43 for five in the 10th over after opting to bat. Opener Saurav Ganguly was run out for nought in the first over after being sent back by Tendulkar, who began shakily but went on to play some majestic drives. Dravid fell first ball lbw to Lee before Johnson had the in-form Yuvraj caught behind off an inside edge for the first of wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist's six catches, a record feat he achieved for the fifth time. Uthappa was trapped lbw and Dhoni gloved one behind down the legside. Tendulkar, who struck nine boundaries in his 73-ball knock, added 49 for the sixth wicket with Pathan, who took 17 deliveries to get off the mark. Lee broke the stand in the first over of his second spell when he had Tendulkar, who became the second player after Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya to play 400 one-dayers, caught behind with an outswinger. Harbhajan Singh (5) holed out in the deep off spinner Brad Hogg and Johnson, who was expensive in the previous match, had Pathan and Kartik caught behind. Last-wicket pair Zaheer Khan (28) and Rudra Pratap Singh (12 not out) added 41 runs with some streaky shots. Khan hit seamer Nathan Bracken and Hogg for sixes before edging Bracken behind
