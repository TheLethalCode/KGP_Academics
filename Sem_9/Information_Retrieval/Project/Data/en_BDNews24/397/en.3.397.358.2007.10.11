<TITLE> 'Dirty politics' make development potential hard to realise: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said Bangladesh's full development potential has remained unrealised due to various domestic problems like confrontational politics, corruption and infrastructure deficit. His remarks came at a programme to mark the ADB Bangladesh mission's 25th anniversary (1982-2007) at Radisson Hotel. The ADB opened its office here in 1982 after Bangladesh became its member in 1973. "Our poverty reduction rate is 2 percent per annum. We have achieved successes in universal primary education, gender parity at the primary level. But our full potential has been not realised. Still, we have problems of poverty, illiteracy and poor health," Azizul said. Politicians, economists, representatives from multilateral donors, diplomats, and bureaucrats attended the celebration. Azizul praised the ADB's role in providing assistance to government priority sectors such as power, infrastructure and hoped the ADB would remain a 'constructive' development partner of Bangladesh. "Bangladesh has no disappointments with the ADB as a development partner. We should be thankful to the ADB for its sympathetic role," he said. ADB vice president Liqun Jin, now in Dhaka to attend the programme, termed the anniversary a milestone that had marked a 25-year cooperation to promote development and cut poverty in Bangladesh. "Let us take this opportunity to look back with some satisfaction at the progress that has been reached and look ahead with renewed vigour to the work that remains to be done," said Liqun. He said that the ADB shared a vision of a developed and prosperous Bangladesh as dreamt by its government and people. "We know there are challenges to be faced to realise this vision. But I am pleased that Bangladesh has steadily built a strong foundation to underpin it," he said. Bangladesh has achieved over 6 percent GDP growth in the past five years compared with 4.8 percent in the 1990s. The rate of poverty also declined to 40 percent in 2005 from nearly 60 percent in 1990s. The ADB official expected that Bangladesh would achieve the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing extreme poverty by half by 2015 if the current trend of poverty reduction continued. Liqun, citing the ADBs priority areas such as power, transport, water supply, governance and education, said," We will continue to support energy and transport sectors to bolster investor confidence and expand opportunities for sub-regional trade and investment." bd
