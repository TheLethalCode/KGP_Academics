<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari will set off at the weekend for an Asian tour expected to culminate in his second visit to Myanmar since pro-democracy demonstrations erupted there, the United Nations said on Thursday. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has decided to dispatch Gambari to Thailand, where he will hold talks on Monday, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, China and Japan "with a view to returning to Myanmar shortly thereafter," a UN statement said. Gambari, who returned from a four-day visit to Myanmar last week, had originally planned to make a second visit in mid-November, but that has now been brought forward. Western diplomats said they hoped Gambari would be in Myanmar by the end of October.
