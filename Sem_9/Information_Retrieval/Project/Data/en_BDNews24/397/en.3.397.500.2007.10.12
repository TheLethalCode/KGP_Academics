<TITLE> Belarus leader worried at Soviet-style Putin praise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MINSK, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko is concerned at the excessive attention being paid to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin in Russia. Lukashenko, dubbed head of the "last dictatorship in Europe" by the United States, said he was jolted by a congress of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party at which Putin said he could become Russia's future prime minister. "I am very worried about Russia slipping back into Soviet times, when everyone would jump up and down and shout 'glory to the Communist Party'," he told a news conference for local journalists, broadcast on Belarussian radio. "And when I saw some of the episodes of the United Russia congress, my heart sank." Putin's comments at the congress, and a move by the party to place him at the top of an electoral list for a December parliamentary election, were interpreted by analysts as being a way for the former KGB agent to keep power in his own hands. "I don't know why he did this. I am personally against these sort of sophisticated combinations. I stand for open politics," said Lukashenko, who was accused by the West of rigging his re-election. After coming to power in 1994, Lukashenko pressed for a post-Soviet merger with Russia. He fell out with Putin this year over energy price increases although he told reporters on Friday Moscow remained his country's top foreign policy priority. The European Union and the United States have barred entry to Lukashenko after denouncing his re-election last year to a third term. Lukashenko says his rule has saved Belarus from the economic and political chaos that hit other ex-Soviet states when they made the transition from Communist rule.
