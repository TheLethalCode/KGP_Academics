 BOGOTA, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty-one Colombian miners died and 16 were missing in a landslide at an open pit gold mine in the southwest part of the country on Saturday, the local chapter of the Red Cross said. Search efforts at the small, privately owned Suarez Gold Mine in Cauca province were called off due to heavy rain and were scheduled to resume early on Sunday, said Colombian Red Cross spokesman Carlos Marquez. "It was raining heavily at the time of the landslide and the rains have continued, making it too dangerous for the rescue workers to continue tonight," Marquez told Reuters. "Sixteen miners are missing," he added. The landslide hit early on Saturday. About 24 miners were treated for injuries, Marquez said
