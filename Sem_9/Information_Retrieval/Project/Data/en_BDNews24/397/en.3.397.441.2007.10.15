 BEIJING, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Known as a smooth operator who keeps his head down and gets the job done, the head of China's Organisation Department is a more powerful figure than his bureaucratic-sounding title suggests. He Guoqiang, a chemical engineer turned Communist Party cadre, is tipped for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee at the culmination of the Party's five-yearly conclave. The week-long meeting opened on Monday and will close with a new slate of leaders under President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. In charge of investigating candidates for appointments and promotions, the Organisation Department has access to information on careers of the highest-ranking officials, making it a nerve centre for political jockeying. It is also a route to political power. The previous incumbent was Zeng Qinghong, who was elevated to vice president and number five in the Party hierarchy at the last meeting in 2002. Zeng is expected to retire at the Congress, political sources said. "I think the job has probably given him very close working relations with Zeng Qinghong," said Lai Hongyi, a lecturer in Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Nottingham. "In terms of experience, he is quite qualified," Lai said. Born in Mao Zedong's native province of Hunan in 1943, He has also learned to play the political winds, bouncing back not once, but twice from brushes with scandal. He was a deputy Party chief in Fujian when the southern province was gripped by the largest smuggling scandal in Party history, which implicated more than 200 senior officials. Good relations with former leader Jiang Zemin helped protect him, analysts said. LOW PROFILE He moved on to serve as Party chief of Chongqing, which had just split from Sichuan to become a provincial-level municipality and attracted huge investment to the southwestern industrial centre of 30 million people. But his tenure there also was marked by another corruption scandal, this time involving misused funds from the massive Three Gorges Dam project. He endured that as well. "He is known as a very wise cadre who knows how to protect himself," said Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong. Though powerful, the head of the Organisation Department -- like the heads of all of the secretive departments under Party control -- generally keeps a low profile. While He has been seen as a Jiang ally, analysts say to keep his post he would have to be skilled at satisfying Hu. "Hu Jintao certainly has a lot of ambition in promoting his Communist Youth League friends, so he (He) must be cooperating," Cheng said, referring to Hu's powerbase
