 BAGHDAD, Thu Oct 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirteen suspected insurgents, including three members of al Qaeda in Iraq responsible for the assassination of a Sunni Arab preacher, were killed in a US air strike, the US military said on Thursday. The strike on Wednesday west of Baghdad came hours after the imam, identified as Abu Bilal and who had been preaching against Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, was killed.

The US military said in a statement that an "assassination team" had placed four bombs around Abu Bilal's house, one of which exploded.

US surveillance teams then tracked them to a nearby field. "Supporting aircraft engaged the armed men, killing 10 terrorists," the military statement said. Another three, one of whom was wearing a "suicide vest" packed with explosives, were killed in a later strike.
