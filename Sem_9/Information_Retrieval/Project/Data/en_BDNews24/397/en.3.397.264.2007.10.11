<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com) -- An Asian Development Bank (ADB) senior official Thursday said that the caretaker government should give the ongoing anticorruption drive an institutional shape. "We've discussed how this anticorruption drive can be institutionalised," ADB vice-president Liqun Jin told reporters after a meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at the latter's office. "The government could institutionalise the ongoing anticorruption drive by strengthening the governance framework," Liqun said. The interim administration has been conducting a crackdown against corruption since it assumed power on January 11 this year. Dozens of politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats have been arrested and many are on the run. He said that the meeting also focused on achievement by Bangladesh in different areas including governance, anti-corruption drive, institutional capacity building and sustainable growth. ADB resident representative Hua Du was also present during the meeting followed by a brief press conference at CAO. "We've also discussed how better the ADB can help Bangladesh in post-flood rehabilitation," Liqun, a former Chinese vice-minister for finance, said. Finance adviser, AB Mirza Azizul Islam, after a meeting with Liqun Wednesday told reporters that the government needed $365 million for post-flood rehabilitation. Of the amount, Azizul said that he expected $100-$120 million from the ADB. The remaining portion would come from other donors including the World Bank. "Infrastructure development, including road, rail and power should be given priority to sustain Bangladesh's growth rate," Liqun said. Bangladesh's economic growth was over 6.5 percent for the fiscal 2006-07 and the government has set 7 percent growth for this fiscal year. The visiting ADB official said: "Infrastructure development is a major challenge for the government". Liqun arrived Dhaka Tuesday on a four-day visit to celebrate the Bank's 25 years in Bangladesh. He will also have field visits to ADB-supported projects, officials said. bd
