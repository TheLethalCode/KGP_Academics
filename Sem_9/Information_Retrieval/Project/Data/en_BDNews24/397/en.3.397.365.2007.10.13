 SPIN BOLDAK, Afghanistan, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed one policeman and six civilians in southeastern Afghanistan close to the border with Pakistan on Saturday, a police commander said. Border police commander General Abdul Razak said the bomber rammed a motorcycle into a police vehicle near the bazaar in the centre of the town of Spin Boldak. Thirty more people were wounded in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. It came on the second day of the Eid al-Fitr Muslim holiday, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, at a busy time for evening shoppers. Taliban insurgents have carried out more than 100 suicide bombings this year, killing more than 200 people in a campaign aimed at convincing Afghans their government and its Western allies are unable to provide security.
