 BERLIN, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior German politician said Berlin could keep its peacekeepers in Kosovo if the Serbian province unilaterally declared itself a sovereign state. Diplomats say there have been doubts over Germany's willingness to recognise Kosovo without a new UN resolution, and some fear it would have to withdraw its 2,400 peacekeepers if the Albanian majority province strikes out alone. Willingness to keep its troops in Kosovo, even after a declaration of independence, will be seen as a sign Berlin is drawing closer to the United States, Britain and France in their backing for independence without explicit UN Security Council approval. Ruprecht Polenz, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the lower house of parliament, said it was too early to speak about unilateral moves with Kosovo and Serbia in talks aimed at finding an agreed solution. "I find it premature to talk now about steps that one should only consider after any negotiations would have failed to produce a result," Polenz told Reuters on Thursday. However, he made it clear that Germany could leave its forces in Kosovo even if Pristina declared itself independent. "This would be possible," he said. "Firstly, U.N. Resolution 1244 is still in force. Secondly, in the hypothetical case of a unilateral declaration of independence, Pristina would have the possibility to invite the troops stationed there to remain." Germany has played a key role in the "troika" -- the United States, European Union and Russia -- that is acting as mediator in talks between Serbia and Kosovo. Berlin has been reluctant to discuss a unilateral declaration of independence so long as those talks continue. The 27-nation EU is preparing to take over responsibility from the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for supervising the police and justice system under its common European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) once Kosovo's future is settled. Diplomats have expressed concerns that countries like Germany would have to withdraw their forces without a new UN resolution to justify their continued presence. This would deal a serious blow to the 16,000-strong NATO-led peace force, to which Germany is the largest contributor. Kosovo has been run by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO since 1999, when NATO allies bombed to drive out Serb forces and halt the ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two-year counter-insurgency war. Serb ally Russia blocked the adoption at the UN Security Council of a Western-backed plan for independence under EU supervision, forcing more talks. Polenz acknowledged that Berlin believes there is only a slight chance talks between Serbia and Kosovo, which are due to end on Dec. 10, will be successful. Belgrade opposes independence, but Pristina wants nothing less. But he said one should not give up hope prematurely. "You reduce the chances if you anticipate a specific result," Polenz sa
