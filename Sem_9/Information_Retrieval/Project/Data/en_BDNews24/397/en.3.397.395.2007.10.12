 ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court took up challenges to an ordinance that erased graft charges against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and underpins hopes for a power-sharing pact between her and President Pervez Musharraf. Doubts over the standing of the ordinance add to political uncertainty as the country faces a surge in militant violence, Musharraf awaits a court decision on whether his Oct. 6 re-election was legal and as Bhutto prepares to return from self-exile. The court said on Friday that those who benefitted from the ordinance might not do so for long. "We are inclined to observe in unambiguous term that any action or benefit drawn or intended to be drawn by any public office holder shall be subject to the decision on the listed petitions (challenges)," said Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. Musharraf promulgated the ordinance on the the eve of last week's presidential election by members of the federal parliament and provincial assemblies, dropping graft charges filed against civilians, including Bhutto, between 1985 and 1999. In return, members of Bhutto's party did not resign from the assemblies, as other opposition members did, in protest against Musharraf's re-election while still army chief, preserving the vote's credibility. The dropping of corruption charges, as demanded by Bhutto, cleared the way for her return to the country from self-exile on Oct. 18 without the threat of arrest. The ordinance was also the first step towards a power-sharing pact between Musharraf and Bhutto after a general election, due by mid-January. The United States has been quietly encouraging Musharraf and Bhutto to cooperate in the hope that unity between moderate political forces will best sustain Pakistan's efforts against terrorism. But critics said wiping out the graft charges was unfair and immoral and government opponents have filed five challenges, or petitions, against it in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, which is regarded as hostile to Musharraf since he tried to fire Chaudhry in March, said it would hold its next hearing on the case early next month. The court is also reconvening on Oct. 17 to take up petitions challenging Musharraf's bid to seek re-election while still army chief. US ally Musharraf has promised to quit the army before he takes his oath of office. His current term expires on Nov. 15. Musharraf this week advised Bhutto to put off her return from eight years of exile until the court decides on the challenges to his election, but Bhutto's party said she would come as plan
