<TITLE> Brown believes UK has achieved goals on EU treaty </TITLE>

 LONDON, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown voiced confidence on Thursday that negotiations on the European Union treaty will satisfy British demands but held out the threat of a veto if they did not. Brown said he had to be absolutely sure British national interests were safeguarded in negotiations on the treaty that are due to be wrapped up at an EU summit in Lisbon next week. "When we look at the detail of the text and study it I believe that we have succeeded in our negotiating objectives," Brown told a news conference after talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. If Britain failed to achieve its demands, or "red lines", "we could not accept the amending treaty. I made that absolutely clear," Brown said. Brown, who replaced Tony Blair as prime minister in June, is under strong pressure to grant a referendum on the treaty from opposition Conservatives, newspapers and some members of his own Labour Party. Blair had offered voters a referendum on the old EU constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005. But Brown argues the new treaty is far less ambitious and does not need to be put to a popular vote. Brown told a news conference on Monday that Britain would either veto the treaty or hold a referendum if its negotiating demands were not met. But he appeared to back away from the possibility of a referendum in any circumstances on Thursday. "If we accepted the amending treaty ... we would not need to put forward to the British people the idea that there should be a referendum," he said when asked to clarify his position. Barroso insisted the new treaty was not a constitution, saying: "I have every reason to believe that the opt-outs that were so hard fought by Britain are going to be kept in the text." The Conservatives' Europe spokesman Mark Francois said Britain's "red lines" were collapsing under detailed scrutiny and that British voters must be allowed their say. The treaty provides for a long-term EU president, a stronger foreign policy chief and a more democratic voting system. At the June summit, Blair negotiated a convoluted exemption from the legal force of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines broad labour rights that London fears could undermine its trade union laws. He also won the right not to join police and judicial cooperation.
