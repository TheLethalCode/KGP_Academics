<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell 0.8 percent by midday, putting them on track for their biggest daily decline in more than two weeks as profit-taking in banks and weakness in miners slowed the market's march towards highs hit in July. At 1041 GMT on Friday the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,587.25 points, tracking U.S. and Asian stocks lower after rising for 10 of the previous 12 days of trading. Falling metal prices took shares in miners Antofagasta, Xstrata, Rio Tinto and Anglo American down by more 3 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland led banking stocks lower with a 3.6 percent fall. European shares have risen 6 percent since the US Federal Reserve served up a hefty 50 basis point cut in its main funds rate, helping stocks recover from a mid-year slide prompted by fears that a crisis in US mortgages would slow the economy. The index is now 3 percent off a 6-1/2 year high hit in mid-July and some analysts say they expect shares to resume their rise soon. "It looks like short-term knock-on effects of the fall in the United States, which wasn't prompted by any economic data," said James Hughes, a market analyst at CMC Markets. "Any positive news on the macro data due today and the earnings, and we wouldn't be surprised to see a recovery later in the session," he said, adding that he remained bullish on global stocks and expected U.S. indexes to test key levels soon. French building materials firm Saint-Gobain dropped 3 percent, hit by a downgrade from Credit Suisse to "neutral" from "outperform". Among gainers, defence and aerospace group EADS rose 3 percent to top French winners after JPMorgan added the stock to its "analyst focus" list and raised its target price. Spanish telecoms group Telefonica added to sharp gains from Thursday when it promised higher earnings and dividends, rising a further 3.9 percent as Citigroup raised its rating on the stock to "buy" from "hold". Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.6 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.7 percent and France's CAC 40 was down 1.2 percent. GE COMES AND GOES, DATA EYED European shares reacted little to quarterly results from U.S. economy bellwether General Electric, which were in line with Wall Street's expectations. On the macro-economic front, investors will look to readings on September U.S. retail sales and producer prices expected at 1230 GMT for clues about the health of the world's largest economy and the outlook for interest rates. "With the Fed in what seems to be a neutral position on policy right now, economic data should be of some significance as we run through to the next FOMC meeting at the end of the month," Bear Stearns analysts wrote in a note. "Retail sales today could be of considerable importance in this regard. There are clearly concerns that the consumer could be squeezed hard as a result of things like the subprime fallout." Henderson Global Investors said in a note that the risks to the US economy were mounting. "Weakness in the housing market is likely to make the US economy vulnerable to the possibility of recession throughout the rest of this year and most of 2008," it said. It noted that while there was no compelling evidence yet that consumer spending was about to slow, the risks were mounting with high debt payments, high energy prices and falling house prices putting a strain on households. US stocks fell on Thursday, retreating after both the Dow Jones Industrial and S&P 500 reached all-time highs.
