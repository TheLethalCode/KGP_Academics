<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inzamam-ul-Haq fell cheaply in his final test innings but Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf gave Pakistan a fighting chance of saving the second and final test against South Africa on Friday. Younis made 130 and Inzamam just three, failing to become Pakistan's leading test run scorer by three runs as his team reached 282 for four at tea on the final day. Yousuf was on 48 and captain Shoaib Malik on two. Pakistan need to score another 175 to win the test or survive a minimum 26 overs for a draw. They trail the two-match series 1-0. After Younis was caught behind off Jacques Kallis to end a partnership of 89 with Yousuf, Inzamam was given a standing ovation by the crowd when he came into bat and another guard of honour by the South Africans. But after flicking his first ball for three runs he was out to the second, stumped by Mark Boucher off left-arm spinner Paul Harris three runs short of becoming Pakistan's highest test run-scorer. Inzamam, 37, is playing in his 120th test. His failure in both innings also brought his career batting average down below 50. Younis and Yousuf continued to bat steadily after resuming on 222 for two as South Africa pressed for a 2-0 series win. Younis scored his second century of the series and 14th of his career, hitting 16 fours in his 130 from 246 balls. Younis had resumed on 48 at the start of play with Pakistan on 108 for one and survived a dropped chance on 83. He and Kamran Akmal (71) put on 161 from 296 balls in the morning session
