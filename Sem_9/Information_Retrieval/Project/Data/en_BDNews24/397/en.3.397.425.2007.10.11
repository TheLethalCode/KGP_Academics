<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis scored his 27th test hundred to help South Africa pile the pressure on Pakistan at tea on the fourth day of the second and final test on Thursday. Kallis (107 not out) made his third century of the series before South Africa declared on 305 for four, leaving the home side the mammoth task of scoring 457 for victory or surviving the final four sessions. South Africa lead the series 1-0. Kallis's hundred followed a workmanlike 133 from South Africa captain Graeme Smith, who scored his first century in 17 matches as the two added 207 from 431 balls for the third wicket. Their partnership was broken in the second session when Pakistan took the second new ball after 90 overs and gave it to spinners Danish Kaneria and Abdul Rehman. Kaneria finally got Smith to miscue a sweep to point in his 38th over, the visiting skipper having batted for almost seven hours and hit 17 fours. It was Smith's 12th test century. Kallis's ton followed his 155 and 100 not out in the first test in Karachi
