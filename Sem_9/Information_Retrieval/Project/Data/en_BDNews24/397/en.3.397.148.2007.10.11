 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)--Prices of subsidised sectors such as energy should be reviewed regularly to maintain the government's budgetary balance, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Wednesday. "It is better to review subsidised prices from time to time to maintain budgetary discipline. But this is not the time to discuss the issue," he said after a meeting with visiting Asian Development Bank vice president Liqun Jin at his office. The finance adviser's remark comes at a time when his ministry is counting a probable Tk 2,800 crore this fiscal year to subsidise petroleum prices. Jin, who arrived here Wednesday to attend the 25th anniversary programme of ADB, spoke about the role of ADB funded projects in establishing good governance. The ADB also praised the caretaker government's measures to fight corruption, the adviser said. With the government expecting to get over $100 million from the ADB for flood rehabilitation programmes, Azizul said the multilateral donor had already provided a grant of $65 million this year. ADB country director Hua Du and Economic Relations Division secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan were present at the meeting. bdnews
