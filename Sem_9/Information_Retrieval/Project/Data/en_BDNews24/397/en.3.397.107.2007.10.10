<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a news briefing with French leader Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday that he has not seen any real evidence that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon. Putin also said, Russia will help France launch more commercial satellites from its base in French Guiana from next year. "The commercial launch of satellites with help of Russian launch vehicles can start already next year," Putin said. On Iran, Putin said at a news briefing with French leader Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday that, "We do not have data that says Iran is trying to produce nuclear weapons. We do not have such objective data," Putin said. "Therefore we proceed from a position that Iran has no such plans but we share the concern of our partners that all programmes should be as transparent as possible. French President Nicolas Sarkozy met Russian leader Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Wednesday after finding some common ground on Iran's nuclear programme and floating a possible way to compromise on Kosovo. On Sarkozy's first visit to Moscow as president, the two discussed the issues at a three-hour meeting and dinner on Tuesday at the Kremlin leader's residence outside of Moscow. Sarkozy, who has tried to take on some of the world's thorniest diplomatic spats, said he had found some common ground with Putin, who shares a like-minded pragmatism. "On Iran, I have the impression that our positions have firmly moved closer together," Sarkozy told reporters after the talks with Putin, who made no comment. "There is a very clear convergence of views on the analysis of the state of Iranian nuclear research," he added, without specifying how far their positions had moved closer. Sarkozy said the two agreed Iran could be capable of acquiring nuclear weapons, although they differed on whether Tehran would want to do so. The United Nations Security Council has twice slapped sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, which Western powers believe is a cover for a bomb-making project. Tehran denies this. Putin will travel to Iran next week. Sarkozy told a Russian newspaper that France would push to tighten sanctions to "bring Iran to its senses". Russia, which is helping Iran build its first nuclear power plant, has used its veto in the Security Council to water down sanctions and says further penalties could be counterproductive. Putin and Sarkozy also discussed Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanian majority is impatient for independence. The Albanians are backed by the European Union and the United States. Russia, which views Serbia as an ally linked by a common Slavic culture, opposes Kosovo independence and has said the West is stirring up strife in the Balkans by carving up Serbia. Putin was not "closed" to a compromise that would allow for the Kosovo question to be resolved while addressing the sensitivities of Serbs, Sarkozy said. "I found a desire in Mr Putin to not close the door to a solution that would allow humiliation to be avoided," he said. Sarkozy said he had also put to Putin "a path that might allow for different points of view to come closer together". But he said that it was too early to make this public. Sarkozy earlier criticised Russia for disruptions in the past to oil and gas supplies to European customers. A Kremlin official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two would focus on economic ties, in particular joint aerospace projec
