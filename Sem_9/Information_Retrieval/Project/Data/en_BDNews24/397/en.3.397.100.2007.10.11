<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's foreign policy chief warned Turkey on Thursday against a possible military incursion into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish rebels using the region as a base. "Any possibility of complicating even more the security situation in Iraq is something that should not be welcome and therefore that's the message that we passed to our Turkish friends," Javier Solana told reporters when asked about the possible incursion. Analysts say a large Turkish cross-border incursion remains unlikely, but Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government will seek authorisation for it after a public holiday which ends on Sunday, a ruling party member told Reuters. A major military incursion into northern Iraq, to crush Kurdish rebels using the region as a base, would strain ties with the United States and the European Union, which Ankara hopes to join, and could undermine regional stability. But analysts say Erdogan is under `ressure to act tough after a series of deadly rebel attacks on Turkish security forces.
