<TITLE> British Bangladeshis to become voters: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner Sohul Hossain Thursday said expatriate Bangladeshis in the UK would be included in the voter list with photographs. Necessary amendments would be made to the election law, the Representation of the People Order 1972, to accommodate the expatriates in the voter list, he said. "At least UK-based expatriate Bangladeshis will be included in the voter list for the next elections. I sincerely believe that all expatriates in Britain want to become voters. We are going there in November to see how much interest they have in being put on the voter roll." He said British Bangladeshis had made great contributions during the 1971 independence war. "Expatriates in the UK will be given preference in the effort to include expatriate Bangladeshis in the voter list. They can become voters even if they have dual citizenship." The commissioner has explained how nearly three million expatriates will cast their votes: "We are considering two methods." One is a postal ballot, and the other is that they must come to Bangladesh and cast their ballots in a polling centre. E-votes are not considered. He said expatriate Bangladeshis would be enlisted as voters based on their permanent address in Bangladesh. bdnews24
