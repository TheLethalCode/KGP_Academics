 SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks retreated on Friday after a recent record-breaking streak, while the dollar held steady ahead of US data expected to shed light on the timing of a next Fed interest rate cut. Investors will look to readings on September US retail sales and producer prices at 1230 GMT for clues about the health of the world's largest economy. Economists expect retail sales to have risen 0.2 percent, after a 0.3 percent increase in August. Any number much weaker than that could revive expectations for a rate cut this month, analysts said. By 0310 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was off 0.7 percent. On Thursday, the index rose 1.5 percent to a fourth straight closing high. Tokyo's Nikkei fell 0.5 percent by the midsession, dragged lower by Fast Retailing Co Ltd, which posted a bigger-than-expected fall in annual operating profit late on Thursday due to sluggish sales. "The markets have gained at a fast pace in recent sessions, and that's creating caution about how much further it can go in the short term," said Choo Hee-yeop, deputy general manager of asset management at Korea Investment and Securities. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.4 percent on Thursday, and the blue-chip Dow industrial average ended nearly 0.5 percent lower after earlier hitting an intraday record high. Oil hovered around $83 a barrel, within sight of its record peak, after a surprise drop in US inventories stoked supply concerns in the world's top consumer ahead of winter. Gold fell around $3 an ounce to $747 after rising as high as $753.60 in New York on Thursday, its highest since January 1980. STOCKS RECOIL Seoul shares fell 0.9 percent, pulling back from a record high as banks slumped amid speculation about weaker earnings, while LG.Philips LCD dropped on worries a major shareholder will sell the rest of a stake to the market. Shares in Samsung Electronics rose 1.6 percent before dropping to 0.2 percent lower, after the world's top memory chip maker posted flat quarterly profit as sluggish chip prices offset strong demand for its flat TV screens. Australian shares fell 0.6 percent, snapping a five-session winning streak, with recent gainers such as banks falling due to concerns that valuations look over-priced. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 2 percent, Singapore shares eased 0.6 percent and Taiwan stocks fell 1 percent. DOLLAR STEADY VS EURO The dollar was steady against the euro ahead of the US data. The yen stayed off a 2-1/2-month low against the euro but remained under pressure after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold at 0.5 percent on Thursday. "US data released later this session is likely to decide the direction of the dollar from here," said Mitsuru Sahara, senior VP of forex dealing at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "The market's focus is whether today's economic reports change expectations for a Fed rate cut in October and December." The euro also got a boost after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said economic growth in the euro zone and globally remains robust, despite recent financial market volatility. The euro traded at $1.4180 a touch below $1.4195 in late US trade on Thursday. Against the yen, the euro gave up early gains, slipping 0.1 percent to 166.30 yen The single currency struck a 2-1/2-month high of 167.63 yen on electronic trading platform EBS on Thursday. The dollar was flat at 117.25 yen In late New York trade it hit a 2-month high of 117.79 yen on EBS. Japanese government bond futures ticked higher following a rise in US Treasuries, but caution over stock prices and a five-year bond offer during the session kept a cap on prices. The benchmark 10-year yield inched up 0.5 basis point to 1.740 percent, edging towards Tuesday's high of 1.745 percent, which was the highest since early August
