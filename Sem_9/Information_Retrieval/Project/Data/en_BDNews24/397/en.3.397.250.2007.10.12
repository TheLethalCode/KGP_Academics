 Sumon K Chakrabarti NEW DELHI, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Three persons were killed and 12 others injured when a blast ripped through the Sufi shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer Thursday evening. Additional DGP of Rajasthan Kanhiya Lal confirms the death of the three. The blast took place 20 metres away from the main shrine when the evening prayers were on and at least 500 devotees were packed inside. Police have cordoned off the area. According to police, the blast material was stuffed inside a tiffin box and the pattern is strikingly similar to the Hyderabad blasts. Deepak Upreti, divisional commissioner of Ajmer, says the crude bomb, planted near a tree at Aasthan-e-Noor, went off a minute after the fasting period ended. Two persons, including 45-year-old Mohammad Sohaib from Mumbai, died on the spot in the blast near Aasthan-e-Noor opposite Begum Ki Dhalan. Rajasthan police told CNN-IBN that after the blast, a crowd of devotees attacked policemen and seven of them were injured. The superintendent of Rajasthan Police also said extra forces have been rushed to Ajmer. President of All India Muslim Personal Law Board Kamal Farooqi condemned the attack. "This is a clear cut design and the idea is to disturb peace. This is why the attackers choose soft spots like religious." "Ajmer Sharif is not only revered by Muslims but people from all religions. So this is not an attack on a mosque or temple. It's an attack on India's religious harmony," he said. Lalit Maheswari, additional police chief for Ajmer, told Reuters: "A big crowd had gathered outside the main shrine to break their fast." "We have recovered some mobile instruments, so we think some sophisticated device was used, but an investigation is going on." Television pictures showed a man being stretchered from the site with his clothes apparently torn from his body and what appeared to be a corpse with his eyes open. The shrine, which contains the tomb of the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisty, is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Muslims in India. Shortly afterwards, in disputed Kashmir to the north, at least two suspected Muslim militants stormed a police camp in the summer capital, Srinagar, firing guns and throwing grenades, police said. The gunbattle was still continuing and there were no further details, they added. bdn
