 CHANDIGARH, India, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- A bomb exploded in a crowded cinema in a northern Indian city Sunday, killing at least six people and wounding 20, police said. The multiplex Shingar Cinema in the industrial city of Ludhiana in the state of Punjab was packed with about 600 people at the time. The area around the cinema is home to a large Muslim population. The blast coincided with the Muslim festival of Eid. "The movie had just started when there was a big noise followed by smoke -- it was total chaos after that," witness Pardeep Kumar told Reuters. "It appears to be a bomb blast," Chander Shekhar, a senior police officer in Ludhiana said. Doctors said the injured had blast wounds. The blast followed a bomb explosion last week after evening prayers at the Muslim Ajmer Sharif shrine in northwestern India, in which two people were killed.
