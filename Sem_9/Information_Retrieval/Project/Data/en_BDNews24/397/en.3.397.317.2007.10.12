 NEW DELHI, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court has allowed a community group to create a replica of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, rejecting a petition from author J.K. Rowling for copyright breach, the group's lawyers said on Friday. The British creator of the Harry Potter boy wizard and Warner Brothers, who control the rights to the series in India, had sought 2 million rupees ($50,000) in compensation from the group, which had been erecting the structure for a religious festival. The court allowed the group in the eastern city of Kolkata to use the structure until Oct. 26, when the festival ends.

Almost nearing completion, the structure is expected to cost around 1.2 million Indian rupees ($30,000). "We are quite overjoyed with the court's order," said Santanu Biswas, a leading community member. The four-day Durga Puja festival which begins on Oct. 17 is the biggest Hindu festival in east India. In Kolkata alone, more than 10,000 pandals -- elaborately crafted temporary structures in various themes -- are set up to venerate the goddess.
