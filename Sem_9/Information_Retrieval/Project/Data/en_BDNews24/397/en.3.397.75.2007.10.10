 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Police in Dhaka are suffering from insufficient sleeping arrangements and unhygienic conditions in their barracks following years of inadequate funding and neglect. "After ensuring others safety throughout the day we have to fight for a place to sleep. How can we behave well with people the next day?" said a police constable from Rajarbagh Police Line, who asked not to be named. A room at Rajarbagh Police Line can accommodate 20 beds, although 50 to 60 beds are crammed into every room with no lockers for clothing. Extra beds are even crammed onto the staircases and balconies of the six-storey buildings, making a death trap in the event of a fire. The conditions of the toilets at the police line are also dangerously unhygienic with no running water most of the day. "A battle starts early in the morning to take a shower. It takes at least six months to get a light bulb after applying for one, so we end up buying them," said another police officer. Ahsan Habib Palash, deputy commissioner of police in the allotment department at Rajarbagh Police Line, told bdnews24.com that the problems were enormous. "The DMP has 23,600 men of different ranks, but Rajarbagh Police Line can accommodate only one or two percent of them. Many stay outside the barracks as tenants," Palash said. "The salary of a sub-inspector is not sufficient to meet a family's needs; it is not even enough pay for its food. Adequate living quarters remain a long way off," the deputy commissioner said. DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed said: "A 10-storey building is under construction at Rajarbagh Police Line. We have also planned another two six-storey buildings on the east side of the mosque at the police line." Additional inspector general of police Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura told bdnews24.com: "We are working on reforming the police. This is a mammoth task." "Food or accommodation is not the main issue. We are trying to bring infrastructural change to the whole police battalion. We are also trying to bring about a change in ideology." bdnews24.
