<TITLE> Telefonica, miners power rally in European stocks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares traded higher at midday on Thursday led by Telefonica after the Spanish telecoms operator promised a higher dividend, and mining stocks thanks to higher metal prices. At 1150 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.7 percent at 1,600.52 points for a gain of 6 percent since the US Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 interest rate cut, which boosted equities on both sides of the Atlantic. The rally has left the European benchmark index just a bit over 2 percent below its record high set on July 13 before the U.S. subprime mortgage meltdown triggered a credit crisis. A rise in US stock futures after retailer Wal-Mart raised its profit outlook added to Thursday's gains in Europe. "The equity markets will probably be dominated in the coming weeks by the outlook for corporate earnings and the further development of interest rates," UniCredit strategist Gerhard Schwarz said. UBS said its central scenario was for European earnings per share growth in a 5-7 percent range in 2008. "There is a small probability ... that there is actually an upside surprise to European earnings next year," UBS said. Mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson, owned by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson and Japan's Sony Corp, reported a higher than expected third-quarter pretax profit on Thursday, lifting Ericsson's shares 2.2 percent. Finnish Nokia, the global market leader in mobile phones, rallied 3.5 percent on the back of the strong demand evident in SonyEricsson's numbers, analysts said. Telefonica surged 5.1 percent after the company said it will post healthy rises in sales and profit over the next four years and reward investors with higher dividends. "Guidance is very strong and incredibly positive at the EPS level, which is a significant protection against potential M&A," Morgan Stanley said. "The stock will continue outperforming the sector." Dresdner Kleinwort saw Telefonica's announcement as helpful for shares in sector peers, notably France Telecom, "from increased competitive pressure on shareholder returns". France Telecom was up 2.8 percent. It was among stocks added by Societe Generale to its "SG Good Div basket", a portfolio of 30 European stocks with high dividend yield and low volatility. CEO TO GO? Britain's Vodafone rose 3.1 percent amid market talk that CEO Arun Sarin had resigned. A Vodafone spokeswoman said she was not aware of any such move, and other company officials declined comment. The DJ Stoxx European telecoms index, up 2.7 percent, led sectoral gainers ahead of basic resources, which advanced 2.4 percent. Mining firms Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton rose more than 3 percent each. Gold prices hit a 28-year peak and Commerzbank forecast a higher price in the medium term. "As a rule, mining equities lead the way for gold prices," Commerzbank said. Carmaker Volkswagen rose 4.4 percent, helped by a 30 percent rise in its sales in China in September, a short squeeze triggered by the stock's recent steep rise and an upbeat UBS research note on Porsche, the German sports car maker which is VW's biggest owner and expected by some analysts to want to increase its stake. Among losers, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) fell 1.5 percent. Deutsche Bank said RBS's takeover, together with Santander and Fortis, of Dutch bank ANM AMRO left RBS with much to prove. "The deal will only add meaningfully to attributable profit in 2010," Deutsche Bank said. "Until greater visibility is available on the assets purchased, delivery of synergies and progression of underlying earnings, we expect RBS will continue to trade at a discount and that investors will be loath to value the group on 2010 multiples. Sage Group fell 4.8 percent after the software firm reported weaker-than-expected organic growth from its North American business and said the chief executive and finance director of the division were leaving. "The U.S. challenges remain unresolved," Citigroup said. "It would seem unlikely that there is a quick fix and it might not be until the second half of 2008 that an improvement is seen." Later in the day the focus will be on US weekly jobless claims due at 1230 GMT for clues about the health of the US economy and the outlook for interest rates.
