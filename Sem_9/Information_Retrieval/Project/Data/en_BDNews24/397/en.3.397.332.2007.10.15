<TITLE> China's Hu pledges reforms with Party in charge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese leader Hu Jintao outlined a broad agenda for the next five years in an address to more than 2,200 delegates on Monday at the Communist Party's 17th Congress. The Congress is the biggest political meeting in five years for the ruling party that governs more than 1.3 billion people and the world's fourth biggest economy. Following are highlights from Hu's speech: POLITICAL REFORM Political reform must continue in an orderly way, Hu said. "We must uphold the Party's role as the core of leadership in directing the overall situation." But he said the government must stamp out widespread corruption, which poses a threat to the party's popularity. "Resolutely punishing and effectively preventing corruption bears on the popular support for the Party and on its very survival, and is therefore a major political task the Party must attend to at all times." TAIWAN Hu offered to enter into negotiations with Taiwan to reach a peace agreement. "We would like to make a solemn appeal: on the basis of the one-China principle let us discuss a formal end to the state of hostility between the two sides (and) reach a peace agreement." He also vowed to hold onto Taiwan even as he pledged sincere efforts to peacefully reunite the island with the mainland. "We are willing to make every effort with utmost sincerity to achieve peaceful reunification of the two sides, and will never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from the motherland in any name or by any means." DEFENCE Hu promised to accelerate development of a more technologically sophisticated defence force. "We must promote innovation in military theory, technology, organisation and management." CAPITAL MARKETS Fiscal and monetary policies will be applied to better regulate markets and investments. Hu said Beijing would gradually make the yuan currency convertible under capital accounts and would maintain a basic equilibrium in the balance of payments. "We will deepen reform of the investment system and improve and strictly enforce market access rules. We will improve the state planning system. "We will make our banking, securities and insurance industries more competitive. We will improve the structure of the capital market and raise the proportion of direct financing through multiple channels. "We will strengthen financial supervision and control, and forestall and defuse financial risks." ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT Hu said the need to protect the environment and conserve resources was vital to "the survival and development of the Chinese nation". "We will increase spending on energy and environmental conservation," he said, adding that "our economic growth is realised at an excessively high cost of resources and the environment. "We will accelerate the formation of a modern market system that is unified and open and that allows orderly competition, develop markets for factors of production, improve the pricing mechanism for factors of production and resources to reflect changes in market supply and demand, resource scarcities and environmental costs." INCOME GAPS China's booming economic growth has been uneven. "The people's living conditions in general have reached the moderately prosperous level, but meanwhile the trend of widening income gaps has not been fundamentally reversed ... it has become more difficult to accommodate different interests." GLOBAL COMPETITION Hu vowed to assure the quality and safety of Chinese goods even as the country seeks a larger role in global trade where competition is increasing. "We support efforts to improve international trade and financial systems, advance the liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment, and properly resolve economic and trade frictions and consultations and collaboration." But he urged more attention on domestic concerns. "Pressure in the form of economic and scientific dominance by developed countries will continue for a long time to come. Both predictable and unpredictable risks are increasing, and the need to balance domestic development and opening to the outside world is greater than ever. "Our economic strength has increased markedly, but overall productivity remains low, our capacity for independent innovation is weak and long-standing structural problems and the extensive mode of growth are yet to be fundamentally addressed." INDUSTRIAL POLICY "We must keep to the new path of industrialisation with Chinese characteristics, pursue the policy of boosting domestic demand, particularly consumer demand, and propel three transitions in the mode of economic growth: the transition from relying mainly on investment and exports, to relying on a well-coordinated combination of consumption, investment and exports; the transition from secondary industry serving as the major driving force to primary, secondary and tertiary industries jointly driving economic growth; and the transition from relying heavily on increased consumption of material resources to relying mainly on advances in science and technology, improvement in the quality of the workforce and innovation in management.
