 BOGOTA, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil face a high-altitude start to the 2010 World Cup qualifiers when they visit Colombia in their opening match on Sunday. Coach Dunga does not want to dwell on the potential difficulties of playing in the Colombian capital at 2,600 metres above sea level, however. "All we want to think about is Brazil playing a good game and make the most of our qualities," he told reporters. Brazil, the only team to have played at all 18 World Cups, are aware of the need to get off to a good start as they attempt to keep their unique record intact. With the South American qualifiers having kept exactly the same format and fixture list from the previous two tournaments, it will be the third time in a row that Brazil have kicked off their campaign in Colombia. They battled to a 0-0 draw in the opening match of the 2002 qualifiers, played in Bogota, and won 2-1 to kickstart their 2006 campaign, in steamy Barranquilla at sea level. With Robinho expected to have recovered from a minor ankle complaint, Brazil, winners of the Copa America in July, will be at full strength with both Ronaldinho and Kaka in the team. Their opponents are in a state of transition after a miserable Copa America, where they lost 5-0 to Paraguay and 4-2 to Argentina on their way to a first-round exit. Earlier this week, Inter Milan defender Ivan Ramiro Cordoba said he would no longer play for the country while coach Jorge Luis Pinto was in charge. Pinto, whose squad includes only nine survivors from the Copa America, retorted by criticising Cordoba's performance at the tournament in Venezuela.
