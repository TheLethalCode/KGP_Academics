 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman in a reversal of his earlier stance said Thursday the proposal of a national unity government was 'too early'. He likened former president AQM Badruddozza Chowdhury's proposal to putting the cart before the horse and said: "It is too early to consider what B Chowdhury is proposing." On Monday, Zillur had welcomed the proposal of a 10-year government of national consensus that Badruddoza, the Bikalpadhara chief, had floated at an iftar congregation. He had said that it was a "good proposal" and that "unity is strength." The veteran AL leader made the latest remarks while briefing reporters after the meeting of the policymaking presidium. "An elected parliament is needed in the first place to have a government of consensus. It means the elections have to be held first and then it can be considered whether to have a consensus government." Zillur complained that AL president Sheikh Hasina had been detained for no good reason. He added the party would be celebrating Eid festival for the first time in about three decades without her. The acting AL chief demanded that the government immediately released all political leaders including Hasina. He also asked for release of all detained teachers and students of Dhaka and Rajshahi Universities. On former home minister Mohammad Nasim's jail sentence in a graft case, he said he expected Nasim to finally come out clean in the legal battle. Zillur said the Central Working Committee will meet on Oct 22 to decide whether the party will sit with the Election Commission on electoral reforms dialogue. He said the AL had not yet received the EC's invitation to the electoral dialogue. Asked if he was planning to meet Hasina on the Eid day, Zillur said, "I've applied twice already seeking permission to meet the leader, but to no avail." The presidium meeting held at the acting president's Gulshan home was attended by presidium members Zohra Tajuddin, Sajeda Chowdhury, Motia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. bdnews24.
