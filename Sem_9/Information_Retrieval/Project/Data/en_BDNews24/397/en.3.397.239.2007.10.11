<TITLE> 2008 job cuts would empty 2 London 'Gherkins' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sinead Cruise LONDON, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The City of London is set to lose enough jobs next year to empty its landmark "Gherkin" skyscraper twice over, putting pressure on the office market in this global financial hub. The industry expects prices and rents to fall, but consistent tenant demand suggests the market in the capital's main financial district will survive a such a slowdown. Deeper job cuts, though, could spell trouble. Britain's Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) foresees 6,500 London financial service sector redundancies in 2008. Based on industry estimates of between 100 and 150 square feet per employee, available office space could surge by as much as 975,000 square feet, increasing pressure on City property prices and rental income growth. "The loss of 6,500 jobs will naturally slow down the market ..but the supply side is still tight enough to stomach such an eventuality," said Alastair Hilton, partner at property services firm Cushman & Wakefield. The City has capacity of about 58 million square feet, equivalent to over 100 times the floor space of the so-called "Gherkin", a distinctive 180 meter tower completed in 2004. Industry figures put the City-wide vacancy rate at 10.7 percent. Players say that if job losses escalate beyond the expected level, an overhang of supply could tip the district into a more severe commercial property recession. And with more than half a dozen developments due to spring out of London's crane-filled skyline by 2010, they accept that the market has entered its most risky phase. BANKS HOLD FIRM Hilton said banks were unlikely to vacate great swathes of space even after the layoffs as many took a contra-cyclical view to maintaining presence in the supply-constricted Square Mile. But take up has slowed sharply in recent weeks, as would-be tenants delayed decisions amid financial market volatility. Data from property services firm Ingleby Trice Kennard showed occupiers took up a total 230,000 square feet in the City of London in September against August take-up of 420,708 square feet, leaving around 6.2 million square feet of offices empty. While the glut of space is putting pressure on rental and capital growth, Hilton said investors were reassured by the fact that much of the current 9 million square feet development pipeline was already prelet in contrast to the early 1990s, when the City office market collapsed under the burden of around 18 million square feet of unoccupied space. Developer Land Securities recently announce a City prelet of 120,000 square feet to law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Preston Gates Ellis, despite concerns about a deteriorating global economy. Timing City development programs or acquisition drives to coincide neatly with an upturn in occupier demand has always been a gamble, but Duncan Owen, chief executive of City landlord Invista Real Estate Investment Management, said tenants were still lining up for quality accommodation. "We're negotiating 83 lettings across our London portfolio right now. Not one of them even looks like it might fall through and all of them are at business plan rental increases," he said. UNCERTAIN FUTURE? Hilton said the loss of 10,000 jobs would seriously threaten rental growth, the profitability of several developments and office investment yields -- already vulnerable as UK commercial property sector prices fall. The sale of City office building Condor House is seen as a test case for the depth of investment demand. Industry experts said the LaSalle Investment Management-owned office building is the first asset to reach an advanced stage of negotiations since the summer turmoil brought the property market to a standstill. An industry source told Reuters the property was marketed for sale with a price tag of around 130 million pounds, reflecting a yield of around 4.5 percent. But the source said latest bids priced the asset lower, indicating a 5.1 percent yield. Agent Jones Lang LaSalle declined to comment on the transaction, but a sale at this level represents a yield shift of around 60 basis points -- even before any City job cuts. "If 6,500 jobs were lost in the City next year, I would expect prime office property yields to widen by 75 basis points in the immediate fallout, while secondary property yields could soften as much as 100 basis points," Hilton said. Despite this drop in prices, Owen said he did not expect fellow prime property investors to panic as rental income growth had begun to compensate for mild depreciation in capital values. "I think it's quite likely that we will see prices fall by between 10 and 15 percent in the next 12 months but that is only going to shave profits by around 20 percent or so and that's not exactly a catastrophe," said Owen. "The loss of 6,500 jobs is clearly not going to help the market but London is far better positioned than it was in the 1990s -- this City is a magnet for occupiers right now," he said.
