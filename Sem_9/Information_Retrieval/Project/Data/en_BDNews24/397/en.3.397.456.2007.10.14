 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - How many of The Ten Commandments can you name? Put to the test, Americans recalled the seven ingredients of a McDonald's Big Mac hamburger and members of TV's "The Brady Bunch" more easily than the Bible's Ten Commandments. A survey by Kelton Research found 80 percent of 1,000 respondents could name the burger's primary ingredient -- two all-beef patties -- but less than six in 10 knew the commandment "thou shalt not kill." Less than half of respondents -- 45 percent -- could recall the commandment "honour thy father and mother" but 62 percent knew the Big Mac has pickle. Bobby and Peter, the least recalled-names from the fictional Brady Bunch family, were remembered by 43 percent of respondents -- topping the 34 percent who knew "remember the Sabbath" and 29 percent recalling "do not make false idols." The survey was commissioned by the Ten Commandments Commission in the lead up to the October 19 release of animated movie "The Ten Commandments" and as part of an online campaign to boost awareness of The Ten Commandments. Actor Elliott Gould, who voices God in the upcoming movie produced by Promenade Pictures, gave his backing to the campaign to raise awareness of the commandment's historical basis for the US's legal and moral code. "I would hope that to renew, restore and strengthen our resolve in relation to ethics and morals can help to pave the way to make for peace and harmony in the world amongst all of us," he said in a statement on Friday. The campaign's Web site which also has a test challenge is www.10commandmentschallenge.org/.
