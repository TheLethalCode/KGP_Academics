 JOHANNESBURG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nine South African soldiers were killed and 15 badly injured on Friday after an accident with an anti-aircraft gun near Bloemfontein, the department of defence said on Friday. "Twenty four soldiers were participating in a shooting exercise when the accident occurred," said Brigadier General Kwena Mangope, director of communications at the defence ministry. About 5,000 military personnel have been engaged in annual military exercises in the area, about 400 km south of Johannesburg. Mangope said the injured soldiers were admitted to various hospitals in Bloemfontein and that the area where the accident took place has been cordoned off and an investigation launched.
