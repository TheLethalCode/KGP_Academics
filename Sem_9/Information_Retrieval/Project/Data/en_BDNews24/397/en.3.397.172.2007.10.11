 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Eid shopping spree in the capital is picking up again after being dampened by two days of rain. Shoppers thronged the malls and markets to do their Eid shopping on Wednesday, the Lailatul Qadr holiday. Lower-income shoppers crowded traditional markets and pavements where hawkers sold their wares. Upmarket malls were abuzz with more affluent customersas expected. Sluggish traffic on the city's main thoroughfares and crowds everywhere failed to deter Dhaka residents as they bought Eid goodies for themselves or their loved ones. The posh malls displayed glitzy, high priced clothing and accessories. Iqbal Hossain, a private bank employee in his 30s said, "I want to buy a shirt for regular use. Most of my time is spent in the office. It's easier to buy a branded shirt: the quality is good and the price is fixed." Younger consumers seem to be driving demand for branded apparel. Many items go for Tk 1,000 and higher a piece. Shoppers this Eid seem to be buying both western wear and traditional attire. Young businessman Sayeed Mahmud, shopping at an Aarong outlet said, "No matter what else I buy, it doesn't feel like I've bought my Eid clothes until I choose a punjabi." Well-known women's clothing stores at Bailey Road and around the city have been doing brisk business. Various types of salwar kameez, scarves and special sets are all the rage with younger girls. And of course, jewellery is a must on this festive occasion. Gulshan and Banani remain the top spots for international brands. But Bashundhara City, Rapa Plaza, Eastern Plaza and other malls also offer both local and foreign branded clothing and accessories. Dhaka is dotted with shops, and it seems that every area is flooded with Eid shoppers. Traditional favourites New Market, Mouchak Market, Elephant Road, Dhanmondi and Malibagh remain popular with shoppers this Eid. bdnews
