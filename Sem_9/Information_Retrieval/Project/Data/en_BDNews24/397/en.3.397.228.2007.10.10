 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday cold-shouldered Bikalpadhara chief AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury's proposal for a 10-year national consensus government. "The proposal is unclear to me. Our constitution does not provide for formation of a consensus government," he said. "The party with majority in parliament forms government according to the constitution. I believe the parliament should decide on the form of government and it must be after elections," he told reporters. Badruddoza, the former president at an iftar congregation Monday called upon political parties to stand together to form a government of "national consensus" after the polls for 10 years. The 14-party alliance including the Awami League, Jatiya Party, Gano Forum, Krishak Sramik Janata League and other political parties endorsed the proposal. Pro-reform expelled BNP leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan also backed the idea. Two days after Chowdhury aired his suggestion, the BNP officially said 'no' to the proposal. "Badruddoza Chowdhury is a highly respected person. But he has not explained the proposed 'consensus', when, how and with who it should be formed. "Well, BNP had formed an alliance before the last elections and accordingly, they formed a coalition government too," the BNP secretary general said. "The Awami League after winning the 1996 polls formed a 'unity government' with Jatiya Party and JSD (Rab). I think the decision on choosing the form of government can only be done after the elections." Delwar, former chief whip, continued: "It is customary that the winners of majority seats in parliament form government, which reflects the will of the people." There was no hurry to decide the matter now, he said and added that the issue should also be discussed within the parties. He however said the BNP was not considering any intra-party dialogue at the moment. Asked if the expelled BNP leaders would be brought back, Delwar said: "The chairperson has to take a decision on this issue. The chairperson holds the total authority of running the party. This has been the rule through the last three decades." In the past, leaders like Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf and others were expelled and again they were brought back, he said. "Those who have been expelled recently have to follow a similar processes for a comeback. The chairperson is in jail now, but the doors of the party are open to all." bdnews24
