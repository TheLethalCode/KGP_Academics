 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)High inflation and transport fare hikes have forced a large number of lower income people to remain in the capital instead of celebrating Eid with families at their village homes. Many are also hoping to earn something extra over the Eid holidays in Dhaka. "The poor have no Eid," a frustrated Liton, from Mesta village in Jamalpur, told bdnews24.com. Liton, a garment worker, said he could hardly manage the money necessary to buy milk for his son Siyam as the price of essentials spirals upward daily. "I wanted to go to my home in Bogra for Eid, but I could not earn enough money to do so," rickshaw puller Alamgir told bdnews24.com. He used to live in the 'Seven-storey' slum in Mohakhali, that was demolished recently. Now he pays Tk 1,000 to share a room with two other people. "My rickshaw owner has exempted seven days deposit during the Eid holidays. I want to utilise the chance to earn some money." Grocer Farid, of Mehendiganj in Barisal, said that he would go home the week after Eid. "All the owners have doubled or tripled transport fares. Therefore, I cannot afford to celebrate Eid in Barisal," Farid told bdnews24.com. Construction worker Abul Kalam Azad said he would have to pass the holidays without work. "All construction work has come to a halt. I am thinking of how to manage even a meal of rice over the Eid holidays." "I do not have an Eid," said Azad. Serajul, a garment worker who hails from Ullahpara in Sirajganj, told bdnews24.com that he sent his wife and children home ahead of Eid as the transport cost was lower. "My financial condition is very bad. So, I cannot go home at all to be with them". bdnew
