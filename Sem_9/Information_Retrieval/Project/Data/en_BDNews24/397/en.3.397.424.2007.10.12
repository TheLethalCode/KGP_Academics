 UNITED NATIONS, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Security Council overcame differences and deplored on Thursday the Myanmar government's crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations, in a statement agreed by all its 15 members, including China. The statement also called for the early release of "all political prisoners and remaining detainees" and urged the ruling junta in Myanmar to prepare for a "genuine dialogue" with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. It was the first time the council had taken any action over Myanmar and marked a shift of position by China, which had previously used its veto to stop the 15-nation body voicing criticism of Myanmar authorities. The United Nations, meanwhile, said special envoy Ibrahim Gambari would set off over the weekend for an Asian tour expected to culminate in his second visit to Myanmar since the ruling junta cracked down on the demonstrations led by Buddhist monks last month. The junta admits 10 people were killed, but Western governments says the toll is likely to be much higher. Gambari will visit Thailand, where he will hold talks on Monday, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, China and Japan "with a view to returning to Myanmar shortly thereafter," a U.N. statement said. Gambari, who returned from a four-day visit to Myanmar last week, had originally planned to make a second visit in mid-November. Western diplomats said they hoped that Gambari would be in Myanmar before the end of October to push the junta to carry out the demands of the statement approved on Thursday. "The Security Council strongly deplores the use of violence against peaceful demonstrations in Myanmar," said the statement read out by council president Leslie Kojo Christian of Ghana. The council "emphasizes the importance of the early release of all political prisoners and remaining detainees," it added. "The Security Council stresses the need for the government of Myanmar to create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups, in order to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation."
