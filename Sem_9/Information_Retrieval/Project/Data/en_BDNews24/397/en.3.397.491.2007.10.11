<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  The United States Trade Representative will watch labour conditions in garments and other industries for one more year to decide whether to take Bangladesh off the GSP facility amid allegations of labour-rights violations. Commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed told reporters Thursday that Bangladesh had been asked to send a report to the US trade authorities by October 19, 2008. Firoz had a meeting with the trade delegates who came back from the US after a hearing at the US Trade Representative. M Humayun Kabir, Bangladesh ambassador to the US, led the delegation. Firoz said: "The hearing focused on two major issuesthe allegations of violating labour rights and engaging child workers in different industries in Bangladesh." The American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations lodged a complaint on June 22 and asked the US authorities to exclude Bangladesh from the Generalised System of Preferences that allows certain developing countries to export designated goods duty-free. Bangladesh enjoys partial GSP facility. In 1990, the US labour federation filed a petition accusing Bangladesh of violating labour rights. Later, in 1999, it filed another petition following the failure of the Bangladesh government to establish labour rights in export processing zones. Bangladesh has been trying to gain complete duty-free access to the US market for a long time. A bill was raised in the US Congress in 2005 seeking total duty-free access to the US market for Bangladesh and 13 other 'least developed countries'. bd
