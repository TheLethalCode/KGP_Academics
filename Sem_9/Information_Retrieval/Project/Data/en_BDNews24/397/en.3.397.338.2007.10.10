<TITLE> Europe must up world role, says Germany's Fischer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe is in bad shape at an international level and must play a greater role in conflict zones in Africa and the Middle East, Germany's former foreign minister Joschka Fischer said in an interview on Wednesday. Fischer, who was the Greens foreign minister in Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder's coalition government from 1998-2005 said Europe needs to take a stronger lead in resolving conflicts. "Europe should play a greater role in our strategic neighbourhood, this means the Middle East, this means Africa...not only Sudan," Fischer, who supported sending German troops to Afghanistan, told Reuters at the Frankfurt Book Fair. "It is not a British or French or German issue anymore. This is really a common challenge...but unfortunately our structures, our procedures and our institutions are weak." Fischer, who has spent the last 18 months in America, said a new American president in 2008 should encourage Europe to rethink its global role. "I think that the next administration will be a more multi-lateral one, US policy will approach Europe and then the question will be whether Europe can deliver - yes or no - and at the moment Europe is in a bad shape," he said. Fischer, a former green radical who hit a policeman at a peace demonstration in 1973, confronted the pacifists in his Green party during his time as foreign minister by supporting the sending of German troops to Kosovo. Although Fischer's career marks him out as a politician willing to court controversy and support foreign intervention, he was fiercely opposed to the Iraq war. He was in Frankfurt to the first volume of his political memoirs. A military confrontation with Iran over the Islamic Republic's contested nuclear programme would be a bigger mistake than Iraq, said Fischer, noting however, that further economic sanctions against Tehran will be necessary. "There is no guarantee that you can take out the nuclear capability of Iran by limited air strikes. This would end up in a very dark tunnel without no light at the end. "This would be more devastating than the Iraq war." While Fischer's book 'The Red-Green Years' has enabled him to re-enter political debate in Germany, he says he not is looking to get back into politics and is not interested in a job at the U.N. or European Union, as rumoured in the German media. "I am happy...I will start writing my next book within the next few weeks and hopefully in one or one and a half years I can present the second volume."
