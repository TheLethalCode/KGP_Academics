<TITLE> Austrian president calls for deportation amnesty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Austria's president called on Thursday for asylum seekers with long-pending cases to be granted residency, saying it was cruel to deport foreigners who had put down roots while waiting years for court rulings. Heinz Fischer's remarks reflected concern that the Interior Ministry's hard line on deportations was polarising public life by suggesting that some well-integrated foreigners with jobs and children were being treated inhumanely. The issue burst into the open last month when a Kosovo teenager went into hiding and threatened to kill herself unless reunited with her family expelled after failing in appeals for asylum. They had been in Austria five years. Fischer, whose position is largely ceremonial but is Austria's most popular politician, proposed that foreigners whose asylum applications have been pending since Jan. 1, 2000 be awarded residency. An Interior Ministry spokesman said there were 772 such cases among 34,634 backlogged in the courts. The proposal resembled a Dutch decision in May to grant an amnesty to foreigners who had applied for asylum before April 2001, affecting at least 25,000 people. "It would be sensible to examine whether it would bring more advantages than disadvantages when people here since Jan. 1, 2000, who have found jobs, speak our language and are otherwise fully integrated, should no longer have to fear expulsion," Fischer, a Social Democrat, said in a statement. "That way, we could avoid many hardship cases ... We need to apply leeway contained in the law to grant residency on humanitarian grounds," he said. It was not clear whether his idea would defuse a row over deportations affecting the governing coalition. Some Social Democrats, including Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, back a limited amnesty, while junior conservative coalition partners and far-right opposition parties are opposed. In a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, the conservative interior minister accused opposition Greens of promoting lawlessness by opposing deportations of rejected asylum seekers and demanding an amnesty for well-integrated foreigners. He said the Greens' demand for a "right to stay" would overwhelm Austria with immigrants. Ten percent of Austria's 8.3 million population hold foreign passports. Supporters insisted the immigration law, amended in 2006 to tough residency rules, be upheld to keep out economic migrants. The debate ended with a resolution sponsored by the Social Democrats and conservatives reaffirming plans for an asylum tribunal to speed up cases mired in regular courts.
