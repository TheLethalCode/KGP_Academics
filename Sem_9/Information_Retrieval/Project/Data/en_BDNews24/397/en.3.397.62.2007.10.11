<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia Thursday pleaded not guilty in the GATCO graft case during interrogation by AntiCorruption Commission. ACC deputy director M Zahirul Huda accompanied by CID inspector Nurul Islam, army officer Major Mustafa Kamal and Khaleda's lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan entered the special jail housed at the Sangsad Bhaban complex before 12 noon to question her. The taskforce members recorded her statement during the 45-minute questioning from 12:45pm. Khan, the lawyer, talked to the BNP chairperson about the legal aspects of the case for 45 minutes after the taskforce members had left. Emerging from the special jail, Khan told reporters, "She has clearly stated during ACC interrogation that she and her son [Arafat Rahman Coco] have no involvement in the case. "She said her approval of the appointment of the contractor was an official formality of vetting what [the cabinet committee on purchase] had already approved. "She said she too had refused to approve the deal when the purchase committee wasn't in favour of qualifying GATCO's bid," Khan said. Khaleda is accused of misusing her power by awarding contracts to Global Agro Trade Company, when she was in office in 2003 despite rejection by the cabinet purchase committee. Coco, also an accused in the case, allegedly influenced his mother to approve the deal. Asked by the interrogators if anyone had recommended GATCO to her, Khaleda was quoted by Khan as saying that nobody had influenced her decision-making, nor she had prevailed over others to favour GATCO. She also told them that Coco had never recommended anyone to her for anything, let alone GATCO. Khaleda claimed that she was totally innocent in the case. She demanded that authorities make necessary arrangement of her reunion with her two sons on the Eid day. Masud Ahmed Talukdar, another lawyer, told reporters that the former prime minister was still suffering from various health problems. She complained that she had not been able to watch even BTV programmes as there's no TV set in the jail. Masud and Khan had briefed Khaleda on the case before the interrogation and Masud came out of the jail after the investigators had gone in. The ACC on Sept 2 filed the graft case with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 persons including Khaleda and Coco and on Sept 3, she and Coco were arrested. The complaint said the Khaleda administration did not follow standard procedure in awarding the company to manage two cargo terminals, one in Dhaka's Kamlapur Railway Station and another in the country's main Chittagong seaport. On Sept 30, the High Court granted bail to Khaleda after her lawyers filed a petition. The court also stayed the proceedings of the graft case brought against her under emergency powers rules. The Supreme Court on Oct 4 stayed the HC bail and said the case can go ahead in trial court. ACC deputy director M Zahirul Huda Monday sought permission of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka to interrogate her. The court gave him the go-ahead and set November 4 for submission of investigation report. The ACC on Sept 2 filed a graft case in this connection with Tejgaon police station against 13 persons including Khaleda and her son Arafat Rahman and on Sept 3, the former premier and her son were arrested and sent to jail. The ACC has already quizzed seven former ministers, six retired secretaries, an additional secretary from the communication ministry, 16 Chittagong Port Authority officers and a former SouthEast Bank officer in this connection. bdnews24
