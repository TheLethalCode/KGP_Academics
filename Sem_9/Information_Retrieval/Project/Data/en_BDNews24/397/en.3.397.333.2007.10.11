 JENIN, West Bank, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops killed a militant from the armed wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, Palestinian security and hospital officials said. A Palestinian security official said the man was killed by undercover Israeli forces operating near the West Bank city of Jenin. The official said the man had been a member of the Palestinian national security force, but recently joined the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, and was wanted by Israel. An Israeli army spokeswoman said a special police force operating near Jenin shot a militant who attempted to fire at them. Israeli forces frequently raid West Bank towns in search of militants suspected of involvement in attacks against Israel
