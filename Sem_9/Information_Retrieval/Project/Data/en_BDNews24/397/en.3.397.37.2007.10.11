 LAHORE, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar has been banned for 13 international matches and fined 3.4 million rupees ($56,000) by the disciplinary committee of the country's cricket board for four breaches of the code of conduct. The committee also placed the fast bowler on a two-year probation period during which if he is found guilty of violating the code of conduct he could be banned for life. However, chairman of the committee Shafqat Naghmi said on Thursday Shoaib's suspension would be counted from the Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa last month, so having missed seven matches he would be banned for five more games. "He will not be considered for the five-match one-day series against South Africa but can make himself available for selection for the Indian tour (in November)," Naghmi told reporters. Shoaib, who was present at the news conference, said he would not be filing an appeal and that he had learnt his lesson. "I am just happy the nightmare is over for me and my main goal is now playing for Pakistan again. I have apologised to Asif and the board for the incident in South Africa. I have suffered enough," he said. Shoaib was sent back from the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa by the team management after he hit Mohammad Asif with a bat during a brawl before the tournament started. CONTROVERSIAL CAREER The 32-year-old, who has played 43 tests and 133 one-dayers, has had a controversial career for Pakistan since making his debut in 1997 and said he was keen to make the team for the Indian tour. "I am working hard and I want to get back to playing cricket again, which is my life. I have made mistakes and I am going to learn from them," Shoaib said. "Missing the World Cup this year and the Twenty20 event have been the most disappointing moments of my life." Shoaib was ruled out of Pakistan's World Cup squad in March after failing a fitness test. Last year, he tested positive for the banned substance nandrolone during an out-of-competition test and was initially banned for two years. Shoaib was then cleared by a Pakistan tribunal. Naghmi said the four counts of misconduct proved against Shoaib included hitting Asif with the bat, addressing an unauthorised press conference after being sent home from South Africa, playing a charity game in England without permission from the board and violating a six-week probation. "Shoaib is a senior player and is required to show more restraint and responsibility in his conduct. Our action proves we are serious about having a zero tolerance policy on indiscipline," Naghmi added.
