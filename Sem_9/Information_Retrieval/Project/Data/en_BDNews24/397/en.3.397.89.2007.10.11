 Sylhet, October 11 (bdnews24.com)A Sylhet court Thursday cleared former BNP lawmaker Shafi Ahmad Chowdhury and his personal assistant Selim Ahmed of relief misappropriation charges. Judge Jagjit Singh, first class magistrate of Sylhet Speedy Trial Court, handed down the verdict. Shafi along with his family and relatives left the court for home at 1:20pm. Shafi had earlier surrendered to court. On Feb 17, joint forces raided the ex-MP's home in Daudpur in Sylhet and seized a huge stock of CI sheets and biscuits meant for relief to the poor. Sub-inspector Tarequzzaman of Dakhshin Surma Police Station filed a case, accusing the former lawmaker from Sylhet-3 constituency and his aide. "The court has acquitted me of all the charges," Shafi said after the judgment was delivered. Shafi's wife Latifa Chowdhury broke down in tears at the court building, hearing the verdict and said: "We are satisfied with the judgment." The ex-lawmaker's lawyer Shamsul Islam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "The accused were cleared by the court as the charges pressed could not be proved beyond doubt." bdnews24.c
