 LUCKNOW, India, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bus carrying pilgrims from a Hindu shrine in northern India swerved off a mountain road and plunged into a river on Thursday, killing at least 40 people, an official said. The accident occurred when the driver lost control while negotiating a sharp bend and the vehicle fell into the Alakananda River high in the Himalayas. A district official said the passengers were all Hindu pilgrims from the eastern state of Orissa.
