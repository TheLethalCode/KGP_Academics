 Sumon K Chakrabarti NEW DELHI, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Three persons were killed and 12 others injured when a blast ripped through the Sufi shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer Thursday evening. Additional DGP of Rajasthan Kanhiya Lal confirms the death of the three. The blast took place 20 metres away from the main shrine when the evening prayers were on and at least 500 devotees were packed inside. Police have cordoned off the area. According to police, the blast material was stuffed inside a tiffin box and the pattern is strikingly similar to the Hyderabad blasts. Rajasthan police told CNN-IBN that after the blast, a crowd of devotees attacked policemen and seven of them were injured. The superintendent of Rajasthan Police also said extra forces have been rushed to Ajmer. President of All India Muslim Personal Law Board Kamal Farooqi condemned the attack. "This is a clear cut design and the idea is to disturb peace. This is why the attackers choose soft spots like religious." "Ajmer Sharif is not only revered by Muslims but people from all religions. So this is not an attack on a mosque or temple. It's an attack on India's religious harmony," he said. bdn
