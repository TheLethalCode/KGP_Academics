 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Development Bank Friday said it favoured rational pricing adjustments, or decreasing subsidies, to ensure macroeconomic balance. "We do not simply ask any government to raise energy prices. We rather recommend rational adjustments to maintain macroeconomic balance," said visiting vice president of ADB Liqun Jin. "But that's up to the government," Jin told a press briefing, marking the organisation's 25th anniversary in Bangladesh. "If the prices are kept artificially low, it will not be sustainable and eventually people will not receive necessary supplies," he said. Jin, critical about subsidies, said only rational adjustment of water tariffs, electricity tariffs, and energy prices in general will ensure long-term sustainability. Any increase, however, should be implemented without affecting inflationary pressure, he added. "We do not like recommending subsidies across the board, but rather suggest the government to provide subsidies only to those who need it," he said, mentioning that supplying water to all free of cost for example could result in massive systems losses. The ADB vice president again praised the government's efforts to institutionalise anticorruption measures, and reaffirmed its pledge to provide support to the government's post-flood rehabilitation programmes. "It is important to institutionalise anticorruption measures for long-term benefits...We believe in a level-playing field," he said. Jin said the anticorruption drive might hurt the economy in the short-term but would bring benefit in the long run. "Anticorruption measures will benefit businesses. It is very important to understand the necessity of these measures because they will benefit businesses," he said. He expected an elected government to take over in due course and said the caretaker government was on the right track to hold elections. The Manila-based multilateral development agency, which opened offices here in 1982, has since provided about $9 billion to infrastructure projects in the power, gas, health and education sectors. bdnew
