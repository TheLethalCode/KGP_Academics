 BEIJING, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese rescuers tugged a bulk carrier to safety three days after Typhoon Krosa broke down its engine and blew it further offshore, Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday. All the 33 crew members -- 25 from Sri Lanka and eight from India -- were safe and the Saint Vincent-registered "Tianjin" was expected to reach Taiwan's Hualian port late on Wednesday for repair. The vessel, carrying 30,000 tonnes of stone material, suffered a sudden engine breakdown 40 nautical miles east of Taiwan's Yilan city on Sunday when Typhoon Krosa swept through the area, Xinhua said. The storm drove the powerless ship further offshore before it was found by the rescue team. "The bulker was in danger of sinking or hitting the rocks," Song Jiahui, head of the rescue team, was quoted as saying. On Tuesday Hong Kong-registered "Aladdin Dream" was tugged safely back to an east China port days after being caught in the same typhoon. Typhoon Krosa killed five in Taiwan as it lashed the island with heavy rain and high winds before landing on the Chinese coast on Sunday, where it weakened into a tropical storm.
