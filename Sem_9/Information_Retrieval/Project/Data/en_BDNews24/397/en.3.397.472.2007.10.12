<TITLE> Khulna jute mill workers set to see Eid off in empty hands </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Khulna, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  Some 10,000 families of Khalishpur and Atra industrial areas of Khulna face the prospects of having to mark the Eid without new clothes or delicious dishes, as Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) failed to disburse the workers' dues. M Ataharul Islam, the BJMC chairman during his visits to Khulna on the Sept 4 and 19, met with project directors and pledged that the workers would get their dues before the Eid. Workers of the five nationalised jute mills including recently the shutdown People's Jute Mills kept sitting in front of the mills gates for their dues since Friday morning, but officials did not show up until noon. The mill workers have been staging demonstrations through the past few days for their dues before the Eid. Additional police and army contingents were posted for peacekeeping in the mills area after some mill officers were hassled by the deprived workers. The once-thriving jute mills area has been wearing a desolate look since August 1, when People's Jute Mills was closed down. The laid-off workers got their salaries, but gratuity and other dues including allowances still remain unpaid. No workers of Aleem Jute Mills in Atra have received any salaries after its closure. With no concrete decision yet to pay the 3,500 workers of other mills such as Platinum Jute Mills, Crescent Jute Mills and others, unrest in the mills is brewing. Delwar Hossain, CBA president of Platinum Jute Mills, said around 3,500 retired and retrenched mill workers have not been paid their dues. Agitated workers renewed their demonstrations against mills authorities since Monday in Khalishpur and Atra industrial areas. They allegedly harassed Platinum Jute Mills administrative officer Aftabuddin Ahmed. The workers did not allow Mohiuddin, project chief and M Shahjahan, finance director, to enter the mills. Unrest raged on in Crescent, Aleem and Eastern jute mills as well. bdnews24.com/co
