 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com) - The probe committee on the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) press box roof collapse submits its report to the authority concerned Thursday. The enquiry committee, widened to five members from three on Tuesday night, visited the spot Wednesday and collected relevant evidences. The BNS press box roof collapsed some three hours after the World Cup pre-qualifying tie between Bangladesh and Tajikistan on Monday night. However, it is learnt that the committee has already submitted its report to the National Sports Council (NSC) secretary on the pubic holiday Wednesday. He is likely to submit the report to NSC chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Thursday. The Council, administrator of the stadium, Tuesday formed a probe committee, headed by its director (planning and development) Abdur Rahman, and asked the committee to report in one working day. "We are going to submit the report Thursday without some mechanical tests," probe committee chief Abdur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "We have to test the ms pipes, used to hold the roof with the column. We also have to test the welding," said Rahman adding that they would want to do the testing at BUET which would remain open from 16 to 18 October. The 150-capacity suspension press box was opened to journalists March, 2006, ahead of the 16-nation AFC Challenge Cup in Bangladesh in April the same year. The press box was constructed under a project of the BNS at a cost of Tk 25 crore.
