 TOKYO, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, was discharged from the hospital on Saturday after being admitted the previous day due to illness, Kyodo news agency said. Kyodo, quoting a government source, said Komura went to hospital on Friday evening after complaining he felt ill, but was not in a serious condition. Japanese media reported that Komura will appear on a television programme as scheduled on Sunday and expected to take part in a parliamentary debate on Monday. Komura, 65, became sick during a dinner meeting on Friday night with Slovakian Foreign Minister Jan Kubis and was showing symptoms of anaemia, Kyodo reported. Komura, appointed as the foreign minister by new Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda last month, underwent surgery just over a year ago for acute inflammation of the gall bladder. The previous prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been in hospital since he stepped down last month. Komura briefly served as defence minister after a cabinet reshuffle by Abe in late August
