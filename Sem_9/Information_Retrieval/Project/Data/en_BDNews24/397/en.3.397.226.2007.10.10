<TITLE> Seven-goal Afonso plays reluctant hero in Brazil </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TERESOPOLIS, Brazil, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's Afonso, usually overlooked in a squad boasting players like Ronaldinho and Kaka, was thrust into the spotlight on Tuesday after his seven-goal performance in a Dutch league match at the weekend. Afonso was surrounded by a horde of reporters as Brazil began preparing for World Cup qualifiers in Colombia and at home to Ecuador, while his team mates slipped by almost unnoticed. But the softly-spoken forward, barely known in his homeland until coach Dunga unexpectedly called him up earlier this year, appeared uncomfortable in the celebrity role. Afonso, whose seven goals helped Heerenveen to a 9-0 win over Heracles Almelo on Sunday, played down his achievement and dodged questions about whether he had earned a place in Brazil's starting lineup. "Our team played very well, I scored three goals in the first half, in the second half I scored four times in eight minutes, it was fantastic," he said. "Brazil has so many players that you just have to produce more and more to be considered," added Afonso, who has never played at the Maracana where Brazil host Ecuador next week. "I have been scoring goals in Europe for a long time, I am confident in myself and prepared to play." TOP SCORER Afonso, 26, was raised with Atletico Mineiro and left Brazil without having made a big impact domestically. He then moved to Sweden, where he played for Orgryte and Malmo, before joining Heerenveen in 2006. In his first season in Dutch football Afonso finished top scorer with 34 goals. He was picked for the Copa America and scored his first international goal in last month's friendly against Mexico. He has yet to convince Brazilians he is up to the demanding standards of the national side but Dunga stood by the player. "He was picked on the basis of what he has done over the years and on our analysis of him," Dunga said. "He was never a doubt in our minds, but the fact that he scored seven goals doesn't mean he is in heaven now. "He has to carry on with his work. I want him to score seven goals for us." Afonso said his first Brazil goal topped the seven he scored on Sunday, adding: "The first goal for your country always makes an impact. I had been waiting for that goal for a long time." Brazil, the only team to have played at every World Cup, kick off their 2010 qualifying campaign away to Colombia on Sunday and host Ecuador three days later
