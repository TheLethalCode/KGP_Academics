 CANBERRA, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A vote to recognise Aborigines in Australia's constitution pledged by Prime Minister John Howard was met with suspicion on Friday by indigenous elders and dismissed as a "deathbed conversion" of a leader facing defeat. Howard -- expected within days to call a national election for late November or December -- promised on Thursday a national vote on Aboriginal recognition if re-elected, saying he had learned symbolism was important during 11 years in power. But a re-elected conservative government would not apologise to Aborigines for past injustices -- a long standing demand by Aborigines -- or agree to a treaty with indigenous Australians, Howard said. "He has got a problem with that five letter word called sorry and he really needs to come out and make a proper apology," Northern Territory indigenous representative John Ah Kit told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Radio. Aboriginal leaders were divided over whether Howard had genuinely reversed years of opposition to symbolism in seeking a "new reconciliation", or whether he was looking for a "vision" to capture jaded voters and reverse months of terrible polls. "John Howard has been in power for over 10 years, one of the longest serving prime ministers in Australia, and there was never any mention about this," said Ray Robinson, the former deputy of a national Aboriginal affairs body disbanded by Howard. Howard, 68, will seek a fifth consecutive term based on a strong economy and a tough security stance, as well as reconciliation, which he said went to the heart of Australia's national identity and sense of shared destiny. Howard blamed his previous opposition to symbolism on his suburban upbringing before postwar immigration transformed conservative Australian society. "There have been low points when dialogue between me as Prime Minister and many indigenous leaders dwindled almost to the point of non-existence. I fully accept my share of the blame," Howard said. Aborigines are Australia's most disadvantaged group with many living in third world conditions in remote outback settlements. Aborigines and indigenous Torres Strait Islanders number only 460,000, 2 percent of the 20 million population, and have a life expectancy 17 years less than white Australians. DEATHBED CONVERSION Political commentator Peter Hartcher said Howard had chosen to redefine one of the deepest features of his political identity just when polls pointed to his annihilation by youthful Labor opponent Kevin Rudd. "John Howard avowed last night that his new thinking on Aboriginal reconciliation was not a Damascus Road conversion. He's right. It's a deathbed conversion," Hartcher wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald. Howard in June declared a national emergency in indigenous affairs. He sent police and troops to remote aboriginal settlements to end reports of widespread binge drinking, violence and sexual abuse. But Aboriginal leader Pat Dodson, called Australia's "father of reconciliation", said Howard had made a positive contribution by promising a vote on recognition for Aborigines in the preamble to the country's Constitution. "I think that it's a big shift for him," Dodson said. Until 1967 Aborigines were governed under flora and fauna laws. A referendum in that year saw Australians vote to include Aborigines in the national census and be granted citizenship. Howard said on Friday that Australia would never achieve reconciliation if people kept demanding an apology to Aborigines. "That is the old order and I can say to those people with all sincerity that there are millions of Australians who are simply not going to embrace that, and I am one," he said. bd
