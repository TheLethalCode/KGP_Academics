<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 44-year-old man tried to attack German President Horst Koehler on Sunday, grabbing his lapels before being restrained by bodyguards, police in Frankfurt said. Koehler, who was not hurt, was leaving an awards ceremony for the Frankfurt Book Fair at midday with his wife when the Romanian man who resides in Germany accosted him, a spokesman said. The bodyguards instantly snatched the man away. "He was only able to get his hands on the president by the lapels, but the bodyguards got him immediately," the police spokesman said. "The man appeared to be confused... He was evidently trying to draw attention to himself because of rent problems." The president's office is largely ceremonial in Germany. Koehler's spokesman said there was no political motive to the attack. He added reports in the German media that Koehler had been choked were inaccurate.
