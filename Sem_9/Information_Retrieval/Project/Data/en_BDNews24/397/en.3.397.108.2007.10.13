<TEXT>
 Dana Ford LOS ANGELES, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Some of Hollywood's biggest and brightest stars turned out on Friday night to pay tribute to one of its own -- actress Julia Roberts but she declared she was most happy in her roles as wife and mother. "I really am just a girl from a little town in Georgia, who had this giant, absurd dream," said the Oscar-winning actress, who accepted the 22nd Annual American Cinematheque Award at a benefit dinner in Beverly Hills. Many of Roberts' current and former co-stars were on hand to offer praise for the 39-year-old mother of three, who arrived on the red carpet in a cinched-waist, black dress by designer Diane Von Furstenberg. "Everybody loves Julia Roberts. Everybody, everybody, everybody," said actor Tom Hanks, who stars with Roberts in the upcoming "Charlie Wilson's War." Roberts won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a legal crusader in the 2000 film "Erin Brockovich." She is also well known for roles in films including "My Best Friend's Wedding," "Steel Magnolias," "Mystic Pizza" and "Ocean's Eleven." Though honoured for her contributions to the film industry on Friday, Roberts said she is most proud of her roles as a wife and mother. She thanked her husband, cameraman Danny Moder, for widening her life -- and her hips. Roberts married Moder, 38, in 2002. They have three children, Phinnaeus, Hazel and Henry. The ceremony was taped and will air on television December 5.
