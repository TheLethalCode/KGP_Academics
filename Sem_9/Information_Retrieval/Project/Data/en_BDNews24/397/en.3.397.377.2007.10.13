<TITLE> Wanted: Man with sense of humour for former sex symbol </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mark Egan NEW YORK, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) -- Famous pop/punk icon, 62, one-time Playboy Bunny with a heart of glass seeks loving male companion, sense of humour a must. Blondie singer Debbie Harry tugged the heart strings of millions of people in the late 1970s and 1980s when she was likened to the pop equivalent of Marilyn Monroe. But now the woman best known for the hits "Heart of Glass," "Sunday Girl" and "Rapture" is single and singing about love on her first solo album in 14 years -- "Necessary Evil." Harry says her latest collection of songs is "mostly about relationships and love issues," raising the question of the state of her own love life. "My love life? I don't really have a boyfriend right now," Harry told Reuters in a telephone interview. "I would like to have a love life that is more apparent." Asked what she wants in a man, she said: "Maybe I should just start going out with stand-up comics ... I really like to laugh." And while some men might be intimidated to even try and approach a woman who was among the top sex symbols of her generation, Harry insists: "I'm really very nice." On her latest album, released this week, Harry paid for her recordings herself -- in keeping with a trend where artists take advantage of inexpensive recording technology to retain creative control over their work. Harry kicks off a tour to promote her latest album in November. And at 62, she has no intention of packing in the rock 'n' roll life just yet. "Everybody is so concerned about my age," she said. "I have always been of the opinion that you get better with age; the more you do it the better you get." "I don't know of any reason to stop."
