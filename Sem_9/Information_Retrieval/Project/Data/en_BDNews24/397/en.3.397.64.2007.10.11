 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has fined Banglalink Tk 125 crore ($18.33 million) for lost revenues because of its "illegal" VoIP operations, the regulator said Thursday. "Banglalink's involvement (in illegal call termination business) was ascertained," BTRC said in a statement. "Banglalink has already made partial payment of the amount and the balance will be deposited to the exchequer shortly," it said. BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said: "We hope that no telecommunication operator will facilitate any illegal VoIP ventures." The former army officer said that "no one will be spared if found involved ... in the illegal call termination business". The telecoms regulator said international call termination is a licensed service in Bangladesh and currently "reserved" for state-owned telephone operator BTTB. ($1=Tk 68.17)
