 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah Thursday slammed Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury over his concept of 'government of consensus for two tenures'. "People having failed in politics are introducing the concept of a national government or government of consensus instead of the elected government. "BNP does not agree to such proposal," he told reporters at a briefing in his home after a week-long visit to Japan and Malaysia. Hannan said those who did not have public support and who had failed in politics were offering different proposals. He said he was worried as the leaders including chairperson Khaleda Zia were not released before the Eid. "We have to transform the grief into political strength." "The government could not resolve any problem. They have failed to ensure security in different sectors. Disaster has come down in the economic management of the country." "The expatriate BNP leaders and activists want a fair election as early as possible so that the power can be handed over to elected public representatives. They do not want to see any unelected government." He claimed the news published about BNP senior secretary general Tarique Rahman's investment in Malaysia was baseless. "I have asked different government officers and expatriates there. They said the news does not have any real ground." bdnews24.
