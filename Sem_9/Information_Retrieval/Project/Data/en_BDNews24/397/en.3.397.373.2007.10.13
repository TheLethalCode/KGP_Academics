 KOLKATA, India, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four officials from South Korean steelmaker POSCO were abducted on Saturday in eastern India by villagers protesting against a planned $12 billion project, a company spokesman and police said. The planned steel plant would be India's single largest foreign investment project, but has been dogged by delays caused by protests from villagers who do not want to be forced from their land. An inspection team led by a senior general manager of the company, South Korean KS Choi, and three other officials, including two Koreans and an Indian, were abducted by at least 40 armed villagers in Orissa state's Dhinkia area, POSCO said. "Our officials were outside the car and were inspecting the area, when the villagers surprised them," POSCO spokesman Shashanka Pattnaik said from the state capital, Bhubaneswar. They were then led along a muddy dirt road to a village. "They have been taken hostage but not physically harmed, and hopefully they should be released soon as negotiations are under way," Pattanik said by telephone. In May this year, three Indian executives were abducted in the same area, but later freed following an assurance by POSCO that its staff would not visit the area again. Despite opposition, the state government and POSCO have said the company was still serious about pushing ahead with the project.
