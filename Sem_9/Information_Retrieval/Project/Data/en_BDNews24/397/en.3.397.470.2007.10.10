<TITLE> Third Central African rebel group seeks ceasefire </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGUI, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One of Central African Republic's last rebel groups not to have signed a peace deal with the government wants to negotiate a ceasefire, mediators representing the insurgents said on Wednesday. President Francois Bozize, who seized power in 2003 and won elections two years later, has signed peace pacts with two rebel groups this year and is promoting an all-inclusive political dialogue aimed at reuniting the poor former French colony. The Popular Army for the Restoration of the Republic and Democracy (APRD) had shied away from the reconciliation process but mediators representing the group met with Bozize on Tuesday. "The APRD wants to negotiate a ceasefire with the Central African Republic's authorities with the aim of reaching a peace deal," said Yacoub Ousmane, president of the traditional wise men's committee in the northwestern town of Paoua and mandated by the rebels to mediate with Bozize. The president welcomed the initiative. "We are ready. We are working towards peace and we do not see any reason that could lead us to oppose this request. Peace does not have a price," Bozize said. The landlocked country in the heart of Africa, one of the world's poorest nations, is notoriously unstable and has seen 11 attempted coups or mutinies in the past decade alone. Raids by several armed groups and counter-attacks by government soldiers have driven nearly 300,000 people from their homes in the northwest and northeast since 2006. The government has so far made peace with two rebel groups, one led by Abdoulaye Miskine, an associate of former President Ange-Felix Patasse, whom Bozize ousted in March 2003. The other, the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR), captured a large swathe of northeastern Central African Republic late last year before being repulsed by government troops helped by French fighter jets and special forces. Last month, the UN Security Council approved a French resolution for a European Union force of up to 4,000 peacekeepers in Chad and Central African Republic to protect civilians from the burgeoning four-year-old conflict in the neighbouring Darfur region of western Sudan.
