 LONDON, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks stretched to record highs on Wednesday and the dollar steadied as investors banked on continued global growth and contained inflation. MSCI's main world stock index and its emerging market stock counterpart were both at all-time highs after the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 scaled similar peaks overnight. European equities slipped, however, after initially rising to 2-1/2 month highs. Catalyst for the generally bullish mood was US Federal Reserve minutes released on Tuesday showing policymakers expected somewhat slower US economic growth and lower inflation risks. "Most investors are no longer so worried about the US economy, and there are expectations that the Fed will continue to lower rates if the US economy slows down," said Cho Seong-joon, an analyst at SK Securities in South Korea. European equities initially rose, led by banks, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index hitting its highest level since July 24 and cementing a recovery from mid-August lows. The benchmark slipped back later, pulled down by oil stocks. Sentiment remained bullish, however. "Unless you believe that a deep recession is just around the corner, they (equities) have to be the asset of preference," said Peter Lucas, global investment strategist at fund firm Ashburton. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average ended almost flat after erasing early gains. It closed up 0.1 percent or 17.99 points at 17,177.89. The broader TOPIX index was down 0.1 percent at 1,658.18. The dollar steadied near the previous day's two-week high versus a basket of currencies, propped up by growing expectations that U.S. interest rates will not be cut in the immediate future. The dollar index was a touch softer on the day at 78.405 , near Tuesday's two-week high of 78.891. On Oct. 1, the index hit an all-time low of 77.660. The euro was steady at $1.4117 , having retreated from last week's record highs above $1.4280. Euro zone government debt prices fell as expectations that rates would remain on hold for the time being firmed. Yields on the two-year Schatz -- the most sensitive to changes in market expectations for monetary policy -- touched their highest in two weeks, mirroring a slide in US Treasury prices overnight. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Bund were at 4.343 percent, from 4.338 percent late on Tuesday, while two-year yields were at 4.082 percent from 4.080 on Tuesd
