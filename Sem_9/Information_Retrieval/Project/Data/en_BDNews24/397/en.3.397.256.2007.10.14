<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's reformist leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Sunday said Oli Ahmed's statement demanding a government order to arrest him smelt of bad taste. Bhuiyan refused to say more on it. Oli, president of the Liberal Democratic Party and former BNP leader, Saturday said the government should have arrested the BNP's expelled secretary general at the "very beginning" of its anticorruption crackdown. Bhuiyan ruled out rifts in the BNP that neared collapse after chairperson Khaleda Zia was arrested in a graft case. Speaking to reporters at his Gulshan home, Bhuiyan said there might be difference of opinion among leaders and workers, but no division in the BNP. "The country will not move back to the days before the January 11 changeover. We have taken some steps to clean up the BNP. Leaders and workers want reforms to the party," he said. bd
