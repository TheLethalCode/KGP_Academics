 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  India's decision to stop exporting rice to Bangladesh will have no impact on the local market, an official statement said Thursday, though some local importers disagree. The statement of the Press Information Department said the government can face any situation with the current stocks of rice and wheat. If necessary, rice can be imported from other countries including Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, said the statement. "So the Indian decision will not make any difference." Bangladeshi importers based in Benapole, however, fear hard times because of the Indian decision to stop exports, saying it will cost them extra to import from other countries. The Indian government has stopped exporting rice to Bangladesh for three months, according to Indian exporters. However, there is no official version from India about why the government has taken the decision at a time when Bangladesh is struggling to overcome agricultural losses caused by the recent monsoon floods. According to the PID statement, about six lakh tonnes of rice and about 1.5 lakh tonnes of wheat are currently stockpiled in government warehouses, while the government has penned an agreement through tender to stock another 1.48 lakh tonnes of rice. Another proposal for procuring 75,000 tonnes of rice is awaiting approval of the national committee on purchases. The total stock of rice is expected to stand at 6.46 lakh tonnes after Eid, the statement said. Harvesting of Aman rice is expected to start in mid-November, which means the pressure on food stocks will not have any severe impact, according to the statement. It also said it would be possible to meet the wheat requirements for the next 10 months with the current stock, and that the government has taken steps to import another 1 lakh tonnes of wheat to boost stocks. However, it is not clear when the export of rice and wheat will resume from India. Uttam Gosh, joint secretary of Petrapole Clearing Staff Association, on the Indian side of the border, told bdnews24.com Thursday they did not have any idea when exports would resume. Bangladeshi importers based in Benapole in particular fear hard times because of the Indian decision to stop exports. According to rice importer Shahadat Hossain, he and his fellow importers in Benpole import mostly from India; if they need to import rice from elsewhere they will have to count extra costs. He said the import of one tonne of rice currently costs them $300 from India. But it will cost an additional $50 to $100 per ton if they need to buy rice from Myanmar or Thailand. "The local market will feel the heat," Hossain said. However, not all businessmen agree, saying the ban will not have any long-term impact if the Aman production was good. bdnews24.co
