<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The huge traffic tailback stranding thousands of homebound people desperate to dash home before Eid for hours on end on the Dhaka-Paturia stretch of the Dhaka-Aricha highway started easing towards 1pm Friday after authorities intervened. Since early morning, hundreds of motor vehicles of all types were found jostling for space right from Gabtali-Aminbazaar to Paturia pier. bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib reported that two buses were abandoned on the highway at two points near the Tara bridge toll cabin, creating a huge traffic tailback both ways. At Paturia, a kilometre-long queue of vehicles was again counting minutes rolling into hours due to an acute shortage of ferryboats. Many passengers failing to obtain tickets resorted to hitchhiking to their destinationsby any meansbut paying through the nose in all cases. Hundreds were travelling on trucks to reach their destinations before the Eid congregation. No highway patrol police was visible anywhere along the highway. At Daulatdia across the Padma, thousands of men, women and children were squatting beside the highway with their bags and waiting interminably for buses nowhere in sight. Rasheda Begum, 38, was sitting on her trunks and beddings with her family of seven children. "We started from Tongi early in the morning for Bagerhat, our home. I paid Tk 80 per passenger to travel up to Paturia, which was just double the usual local bus fare. Now we are waiting for any of the Khulna or Bagerhat bound buses," she whined. bdnews24.com Savar correspondent said the traffic gridlock on the highway was clearing gradually, but then the situation on the Nabinagar-Kaliakoir stretch got worse. Quamrul Islam, Ashulia police chief said, the workers from garments factories in the Dhaka EPZ in Savar started pouring in on the highways, rushing to reach home, which created serious traffic jam all around. It eased as the day wore on and people disappeared packing themselves into whatever vehicles would take them any distance in the direction of their homes, he added. bdnews24.
