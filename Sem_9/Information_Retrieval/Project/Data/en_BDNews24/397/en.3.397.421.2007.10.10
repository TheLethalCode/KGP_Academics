<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The French government aims to phase out pension privileges enjoyed by many state-sector workers by 2012, according to a document handed to union leaders on Wednesday. Unions have already called a strike for Oct. 18 to protest against the planned reform, which was announced last month, and have criticised President Nicolas Sarkozy for trying to rush them into a deal before the end of the year. The so-called special regimes, many of which were set up after World War Two as reward for particularly arduous jobs, allow the beneficiaries to retire after just 37.5 years worked against 40 years for most other French employees. Most of these pension plans are enjoyed by 1.6 million past and present staff in the rail, public transport and energy sectors. The last time a French government tried to scrap them was in 1995 when the then prime minister, Alain Juppe, was forced into a humiliating U-turn following widespread strikes. But public opinion is shifting in France and an opinion poll published by BVA pollsters on Wednesday showed only 43 percent of people thought next week's strike was justified. "As far as BVA can remember, a national strike has never received less than 50 percent support," BVA head Gael Sliman told Les Echos newspaper. The government document said on Wednesday that by 2012, the special regimes would be folded into the general pension schemes offered to all other state-sector staff. This would mean that henceforth all French pensions would be index-linked, ending the clause in the special regimes which sees their retirement payouts linked to wage deals enjoyed by workers in their sector. "We have been left with no room for manoeuvre," said Bernard Aubin, head of the CFTC Transport union, after meeting Social Relations Minister Xavier Bertrand. "We regret the government position and hope for some sign of opening." However, Jean-Louis Malys of the large CFDT union said he thought there was room to negotiate, adding that the government was "a little bit stuck in its position". Union leaders say they expect a massive turnout for the Oct. 18 strike, which will primarily hit the national rail network and Paris public transport system. Some have threatened to extend the stoppage indefinitely unless Sarkozy backs down. However, speaking during a trip to Russia, the French president said the special regimes could not be justified. "I want to tell the railwaymen, the electricians, the gasmen, that you cannot retire after 37.5 years worked while all the rest of France retires after 40 years," he sa
