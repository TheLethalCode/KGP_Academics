 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  Liberal Democratic Party president Oli Ahmed Saturday demanded arrest of BNP's expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. Oli also slammed Bikalpadhara Bangladesh chief AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury for his concept of 'consensus government', saying it was unconstitutional. Speaking to reporters at his DOHS home in Mohakhali, the former BNP leader said: "The government should have arrested him at the very beginning of its anticorruption crackdown. "Mannan Bhuiyan betrayed Khaleda Zia and the country. Nobody should believe or rely on him anymore. "He did not say a word about reform and corruption when he was in power. But he took advantage of the post he held. "Mannan Bhuiyan had controlled the Prime Minister's Office, Hawa Bhaban and the BNP main office with his own people." "He (Bhuiyan) had a greater duty to lead the party by freeing the party of corruption. He had instead ignored his job and pushed the party toward a disaster. "The democracy was hindered because of him. [Khaleda] and her sons ended up in jail also because of him." On the unity government idea floated by Badruddoza, Oli said: "It won't be possible to form a political party with families and relatives in future. "Many political parties including Bikalpadhara will not exist once the Election Commission's registration system is introduced. "There will be five to six political parties in the country," said the LDP leader. "The elected representatives of the next elections will set the form and type of the government for the country." Asked whether he would rejoin BNP, the former member of the BNP standing committee said: "I am now president of LDP. My duty is to organise the party. "If I get an offer, I will decide in consultation with the executive president and secretary general and other leaders and activists of the party. "There is no chance to take decisions individually in LDP." Praising the government's anticorruption move Oli said: "Some fortune-seekers and corrupt people under the name of reformists are still lurking." He demanded the government arrest them immediately. "If the corrupt people are arrested, no political leader will engage in corruption in future." On the government's proposed Truth Commission, Oli said: "Truth Commissions were formed for the trial of war criminals in different countries. It is not clear to me why such a commission is going to be formed in our country. "Those who are involved in corruption and looting in the name of politics should be punished. The government has to find out the middlemen between politicians and businessmen and throw them into 'crossfire'. "They are the main enemies of the country. They are the ones grabbing opportunities." But he praised the government for its "commendable attitude" towards the businessmen. Oli also advised the government to deepen the relationship with the business community. bdnews24.com/sm/pc/
