"As to whether (OPEC's recent hike) is enough or not, I don't know. We'll have to wait and see." Bodman said the US economy has been "remarkably resilient" to high oil prices so far. Economists have expressed concern that high oil prices, combined with a severe housing slowdown, could combine to slow overall US economic growth. US oil prices were up 37 cents at $83.45 a barrel late Friday morning, just shy of the all-time peak of $83.90 hit Sept. 20.
