<TITLE> Nepal parliament begins crisis session over monarchy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's interim parliament began to debate on Thursday a motion by Maoists to immediately abolish the monarchy, as the government vowed to defeat the move in a row that has shaken the country's peace process. The impasse has already led to the former rebels quitting the government and to the postponement of constituent assembly elections, casting a shadow over a peace deal reached last November ending a 10-year civil war that caused 13,000 deaths. The Maoists have called for the declaration of a republic and for a switch to full proportional representation in planned elections to an assembly to draw up a new constitution. Prachanda, the Maoists' chief, has threatened they could bring down the government if it does not agree to their demands. Analysts say the Maoists still have the power to disrupt the country with large street protests and strikes. The motion is expected to be put to a vote next week. Maoists have 83 out of 329 seats in the body. "We don't believe that the constituent assembly elections are possible without the declaration of a republic," Krishna Bahadur Mahara, the Maoist leader in parliament said at the opening of the debate. Peace and Reconstruction Minister Ram Chandra Poudel called the motion "unconstitutional" and asked the Maoists to withdraw it, saying the government would vote against the move. About 5,000 Maoist supporters, carrying their hammer-and-sickle flags, and chanting "down with the monarchy" demonstrated near the parliament in support of their demand. The country's most important political parties also want to abolish Nepal's unpopular monarchy, but say it should be done through the constituent assembly, as agreed in the peace deal. The king was for centuries seen as the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the Hindu god of protection, but a palace massacre perpetrated by the then crown prince in 2001 badly tarnished the monarchy's image. The Maoists quit the government last month, saying King Gyanendra and his supporters were trying to sabotage the constituent assembly vote, then set for Nov. 22. Analysts say the Maoists started to worry they might perform poorly. While mainstream parties will probably defeat the Maoist motion, a compromise could be forged to hold new elections by mid-April next year, some commentators said. "All is not lost," the weekly Nepali Times wrote. "Despite the doom and gloom... the door to resolution is still ajar." Gyanendra was forced to renounce absolute rule last year after weeks of pro-democracy protests. The interim government has since stripped the king of most of his powers, including control of the army. Nepal has chosen a new national anthem in place of the one which praised the monarch, withdrawn hundreds of his guards and servants, and a picture of Mount Everest has replaced that of the king on some banknotes.
