 Dhaka, October 14 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested three people including two women on charges of pre-Eid shoplifting at Etc in Dhanmondi early Sunday. The police took them to Mohammadpur Police Station, hours after the three were caught in the act of stealing. "I have never done that (shoplifting) before. I am so sorry. Please help me," Rokhsana Aftab Mou pleaded to bdnews24.com, minutes before the police led the three away into the waiting police van. The 22-year-old woman and her cousin Sumi entered ETC at 11:50pm Saturday and was trying to escape with two punjabis and as many fatuas priced at Tk 58,530 together. Each punjabi carried a Tk 28,000 price tag. Mou and Sumi are residents of Sher Sha Suri Road in Mohammadpur. Both said they entered ETC in the last-minute dash for shopping for Eid. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Mou alleged that Sumi, 25, had stolen most of the clothes. Sumi kept quiet and looked away. Mohammad Alif Sumon, 19, was another accomplice, but he claimed he was not with the women when the incident took place. "I came in later and saw them here," he said without explaining why he had been in the same shop. The two women also said Sumonalthough a relativedid not steal anything from the shop, but Mohammadpur police sub-inspector Abdul Latif said all belonged to the same "cartel" and led him away. "Women have roles in most muggings in the city. I'll beat the hell out of them," Latif said. A move was underway to file a case against the three as two salespersons for ETC accompanied the police to their station as "part of the legal procedure". Mou and Sumi are residents of Sher Sha Suri Road in Mohammadpur. Both said they entered ETC in the last-minute dash for shopping for Eid. The ETC staff urged the police officer not to take the clothes to the police station, but he did not listen to them and insisted: "They are required for filing a case." Arriving on the second floor of the shop, Latif told the ETC staff: "Hey, I didn't get any commission (discount) on a punjabi and a belt I bought from you guys." "Now look, some clothes are with me," he said jokingly, grabbing the stolen items as he sat on the sofa.
