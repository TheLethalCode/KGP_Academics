<TITLE> IPCC wins Nobel Peace Prize: but what is it? </TITLE>

 Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former US Vice President Al Gore and the UN climate panel won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for raising awareness of the risks of climate change. Following are some details of the UN's climate panel. WHO ARE THE IPCC? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up in 1988 by the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to give governments scientific advice about global warming. It is open to all members of UNEP and the WMO. Run from Geneva, it draws on work by about 2,500 climate scientists from more than 130 nations and has issued three reports this year, totalling more than 3,000 pages. The previous set was in 2001. WHAT DO THE 2007 REPORTS SAY? -- In February, the IPCC squarely blamed mankind for global warming, saying it was "very likely" or more than 90 percent probable that human activities led by burning fossil fuels had caused most of the warming in the past half century. -- It said that warming was "unequivocal" and projected a "best estimate" that temperatures would rise by 1.8 to 4.0 degrees Celsius (3.2-7.2 Fahrenheit) this century. -- In April in a second section on likely impacts, the IPCC said that rising temperatures could lead to more hunger, water shortages and extinctions. -- It projected that crop yields could drop by 50 percent by 2020 in some countries and a steady shrinking of Arctic sea ice in summers. By the 2080s, millions of people will be threatened by floods because of rising sea levels, especially around river deltas in Asia and Africa and on small islands. -- In May 2007, in a third report on how to confront climate change, the IPCC said costs of action could be moderate but that time is running out to avert the worst effects. The toughest scenario would require governments to make sure that global greenhouse gas emissions start falling by 2015. PAST REPORTS: -- The IPCC's first report in 1990 outlined risks of warming and played a role in prompting governments to agree a 1992 U.N. climate convention that led to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol for curbing warming. -- In 1995, the IPCC concluded that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate", the first recognition that it was more than 50 percent likely that people were stoking warming. -- A 2001 study said there was "new and stronger evidence" linking human activities to global warming and that it was "likely", or 66 percent probable, that humans were the main cause of warming in the past half centu
