<TITLE> Democrats propose safeguards in Bush's spy program </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rights of Americans swept up in President George W. Bush's warrant less domestic spying program would be given new safeguards under a bill introduced on Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers. But civil liberties advocates complained that the measure, which would require secret-court approval of most spying, did not go far enough in protecting the rights of US citizens. Republicans warned it could help terrorists. The White House had its own objections. It wants retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that cooperated in the warrant less surveillance begun after the Sept. 11 attacks. Democrats in the House of Representatives said they would not even consider immunity until they receive information detailing precisely what the firms did. "To give immunity at this point in time would be a blind immunity -- not knowing what, in fact, was done," said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat. The bill was drafted in response to a temporary measure the White House pushed through the Democratic-led Congress in August along with warnings of possible additional attacks. The measure would provide intensified oversight of the extended powers of federal authorities to track suspected foreign enemy targets without court approval. White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the bill seemed to be a step backward from the earlier legislation. But he added: "We want to work with Congress on a bill that the president can sign that will help to protect the nation." A spokesman for the office of the Director of National Intelligence said the bill fails to meet some of the requirements laid out by the agency. "One important point is the retroactive liability protection for the private sector, which is missing from this bill," intelligence office spokesman Ross Feinstein said. Democrats had hoped to get the measure approved by two House committees on Wednesday and passed by the full House next week. The Senate is drafting a similar measure. Both must agree on one bill before it can be sent to Bush to sign. NEW RESTRICTIONS The House bill would enable the secret court created by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to issue one-year "umbrella" approval to allow the government to intercept the phone calls and e-mails of foreign targets in the United States. It would require a court approval when monitoring an American citizen in the United States, but only if that person is the target of an investigation. No order would be needed to listen in if the person happened to be communicating with a foreign target. The bill would also require the FISA court to review targeting procedures. It would also mandate quarterly audits by the Justice Department on collected communications with the information provided to the FISA court and Congress. "This legislation provides the intelligence community with strong tools to track down terrorists," said House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, a chief sponsor of the measure. "But it also protects civil liberties." US Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, ranking Republican on the committee, said, "Rather than responding to the urgent needs of our intelligence community, Democrats are giving unprecedented constitutional protections to terrorists, spies and other enemies overseas." Caroline Fredrickson, a director of the American Civil Liberties Union, complained the measure "still allows for the US government to collect phone calls and e-mails from Americans without an individual warrant." Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology, dedicated to protecting privacy, said, "It's a significant improvement over current law, but doesn't go far enough.
