 CHITTAGONG/DHAKA, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  Rail links were fully restored to Chittagong Saturday evening, nine hours after an overcrowded train derailed, snapping part of the services. The accident killed at least three holidaymakers and injured another 30. An initial account of the accident put the death count at 5. The passenger train was heading for Dhaka from Chittagong. Five bogeys of the Mohanagar Provati Express came off the track near Barotakia Station, Quazi Asadullah, additional director general (operations) of Bangladesh Railway, told bdnews24.com. The accident partly disrupted rail services to Chittagong. The reason behind the accident, a day before the Eid, was not immediately clear, but a railway official pointed to high speed as the probable trigger. Three men who died in the accident have been identified as 28-year-old Giasuddin of Mymensingh, 25-year-old Al Amin of Akhaura and 32-year-old Mokbul Haider from Kishoreganj. Ibrahim Karim, the railway's divisional manager, said that the accident took place around 8:30am near Barotakia station, and that the train had around 1,186 passengers on board. The 16-bogey train has a capacity of carrying 850 people, but a huge rush of homebound passengers stretched the services. Meanwhile, the ill-fated train with the unaffected coaches left the scene for Dhaka. The injured were hospitalised. Communications adviser MA Matin rushed to the accident site in Chittagong and monitored the rescue operations. "It's a sad incident. We will investigate the reason for the accident," he said. Train accidents are common in the country because of a poor signalling system, rundown rail tracks and poor maintenance of the trains. bdnews
