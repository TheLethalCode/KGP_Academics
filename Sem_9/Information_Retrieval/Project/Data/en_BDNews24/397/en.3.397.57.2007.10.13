 Tamawa Kadoya DALLAS, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said on Friday that U.S. central bank officials must be nimble in conducting policy, especially amid recent market turbulence. "We need to be alert that the (policy) reaction needs to be changed as financial markets evolve," Kohn told a Dallas Fed policy conference. His comments come after the Fed cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a larger-than-expected half percentage point in September to prevent an economic downturn stemming from market turmoil amid a sudden tightening of credit conditions. Markets expect the central bank to continue cutting rates this year, but chances of a rate cut at the Fed's next policy-setting meeting on October 30-31 have dimmed as recent data has shown the economic fallout from market turbulence may be limited and as credit markets regain some normalcy. Rather than adhere to strict policy rules, the Fed's vice chairman reiterated a line from a speech on the economic outlook on October 5 that the central bank would have to be "nimble" in conducting policy to promote growth and keep inflation tamed. Asked by a conference participant whether he had changed his mind about inflation targeting, Kohn said his views had evolved somewhat and that inflation expectations were "a little better anchored" in inflation targeting. But "that doesn't mean I've gone over to that side entirely," said Kohn, who is known to have been opposed to an explicit inflation target. He said the central bank needed to be careful about sacrificing "nimbleness and flexibility" in policy decision-making. Inflation targeting, which Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has long endorsed, is one topic the Fed is discussing as part of its talks to improve communications. Kohn is the chair of the Fed's subcommittee on communications. Kohn also said core inflation, which strips out volatile costs such as food and energy, was a better gauge for future inflation rather than overall inflation, but that the Fed's job was to ensure stability in all prices. FED OFFICIALS PRAISE TAYLOR'S INPUT Earlier at the conference, Federal Reserve officials praised the work of renowned academic and former Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor, whose famous rule for monetary policy still influences policy decision-making today. "John's influence on monetary theory and policy has been profound," Bernanke said in opening remarks via videoconference, while his Kohn said at dinner that it is no surprise the simple rule devised by Taylor has been well received. But Kohn added that the Taylor rule has its limitations. It uses a single measure of inflation and a small number of variables and does not take into account policy makers' risk-management considerations. "In some circumstances, the risks to the outlook or the perceived costs of missing an objective on a particular side may be sufficiently skewed that policy-makers will choose to respond by adjusting policy in a way that would not be justified solely by the current state of the economy or the ... outlook for output and inflation gaps," Kohn said. Taylor gained renown as the author of the "Taylor rule," which offers a relatively simple guideline for how central banks should set interest rates based a target rate of inflation and the interest rate that would represent "neutral" monetary policy, that is, a level of interest rates that is not skewed to lowering inflation or boosting economic growth. Policy-makers would raise or lower interest rates depending on how actual inflation deviates from the inflation target and the difference between the economy's actual growth rate and the economy's maximum noninflationary speed limit. Bernanke said Taylor emphasized from the beginning that the Taylor rule "should not be applied mechanistically" and that Taylor himself argued such rules should be "useful benchmarks" for conducting monetary policy in practice. "In fact, policy-makers at the Federal Reserve and many other central banks do routinely consult various policy rules as they make judgments on the appropriate stance of monetary policy," the Fed chief said. San Francisco Fed president Janet Yellen, who participated in a policy roundtable at the conference, said any monetary policy rule should be open to uncertainty, which was underscored by Taylor's work. "As a policy-maker who relies on models and forecasts myself, I recognize the great degree of uncertainty about all aspects of our models and our limited ability to predict the future," she said. "The asset price movements over the past decade amply illustrate that the economy does not always behave the way our standard models predict." Taylor, currently an economics professor at Stanford University and who served at the U.S. Treasury in 2001-2005, is known for other monetary policy guidelines such as the Taylor curve and the Taylor principle. "We now look forward to the Taylor dictum, the Taylor hyperbola, and maybe even the Taylor conundrum," joked Bernanke, drawing laughter from the audience of academics and central bankers.
