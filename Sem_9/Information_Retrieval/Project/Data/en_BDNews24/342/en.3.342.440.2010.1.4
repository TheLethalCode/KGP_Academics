<TITLE> CID seeks more time to probe ULFA link to Ctg arms haul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)The Criminal Investigation Department is yet to complete its probe into the 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of arms in the port city, as it is still looking into ULFA's alleged links to the weapons shipment. Investigation officer, the CID's Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, has applied to court asking for three more months for the investigation, as the fifth extended deadline for submission of the probe report ends on Monday. Moniruzzaman said it was not possible to complete the investigation as the Indian militant group ULFA's alleged links to the arms shipment and how the arms-laden ship got permission to unload at a restricted jetty of CUFL could not be established as yet. "So we have applied for the extension of time for detailed investigation," he said. Chittagong session judge Bhabani Prashad Singh's court will hear the petition for time extension on Monday. On the unexpected delay in the investigation process, Moniruzzaman said it was because they were redoing file-work and fresh interrogations since he took over the charge as investigation officer. Police seized 10 truckloads of weapons and ammunition from the restricted jetty of CUFL in Chittagong on the night of April 1 2004, sparking speculation that the cache was for the Indian insurgent group United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA). Following a court order on February 12 2008, the CID appointed Ismail Hossain as investigation officer in the arms haul case. Ismail got two extensions of the deadline for submission of the investigation report. On January 18 last year, the court ordered a change of the investigation officer and Moniruzzaman took charge. In course of his investigation, the new IO has arrested a number of high-profile suspects, including two former director generals of National Security Intelligence and navy officers and secured confessional statements from them among others. But Moniruzzaman has also got the investigation report deadline extended three times since taking over the case. bdnews2
