<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)--Daily Amar Desh's acting editor Mahmudur Rahman and two others on Monday secured three months' interim bail from the High Court in 22 defamation cases. The other two defendants are the newspaper's publisher Hasmat Ali and special correspondent M Abdullah. The bench of justices Syed Muhammad Dastagir Hossain and Mohammed Rais Uddin also issued a rule on the government asking it to explain why they would not be granted regular bail in those cases. At the hearing, barrister Rafique-Ul Haque argued for the defendants while additional attorney general Zahurul Haque spoke for the state. The pro-opposition broadsheet carried a story on Dec 17 last year accusing prime minister Sheikh Hasina's son Sajib Wajed Joy and her energy adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury of taking a backhander of Tk 35 crore ($5 million) from US oil giant Chevron in Dallas, Texas, on Oct 14 to help it secure a contract to set up gas compressor stations in Bangladesh. Cases were filed against the three with the courts in different districts for publishing the report, terming it 'false'. The three earlier on Sunday secured bail from the High Court in a similar case filed in Magura. bdnew
