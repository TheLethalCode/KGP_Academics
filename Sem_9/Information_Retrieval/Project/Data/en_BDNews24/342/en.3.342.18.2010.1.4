 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)--President Zillur Rahman urged the main opposition to join parliament during his maiden speech as head of state on Monday. During his speech, as obligated by the constitution, the president said he hoped that parliament would dispense with the responsibility of the important role that people had delegated to them. "They (the opposition) should come away from the trend of opposition for opposition's sake. Parliament is at the heart of democratic practices." He said the lawmakers of both the treasury and opposition are accountable to the people. That is why, Rahman observed, both parties should regularly attend parliament and make it really effective. "That is what the people desire." The 23-minute speech began at about 3:20pm and highlighted the successes of the government which included low inflation, forex reserve hitting the $10 billion-mark and the timely announcement of Tk 5046 crore stimulus package to deal with the aftermaths of global recession on export. Rahman also expressed hope that war criminals would be soon put on trial upon swift completion of a few necessary formalities. He said an international crimes tribunal amendment act had already been passed and a venue has been primarily selected for the tribunal. The president declared that the government had delivered the country from the clutches of corruption. He said the government considered prevention of fundamentalism and militancy in the country a challenge and had taken up initiatives to prevent any possibility of radical outfits based in Bangladesh to operate beyond its borders. This was the first session that Rahman addressed as president in line with the article 73 of the constitution. Last year, he attended the House as an MP when the BNP-nominated president, Iajuddin Ahmed, delivered his speech on first day of the ninth parliament on Jan 25. According to constitution, the president must deliver speeches on the first day of the first session of a new parliament or on the first day of the first session of a new year. MPs are scheduled to speak on the president's speech from Jan 11 on whether to endorse a motion to thank the president. bd
