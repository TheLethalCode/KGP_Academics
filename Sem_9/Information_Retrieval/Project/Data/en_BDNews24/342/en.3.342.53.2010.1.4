 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Monday the ban on religion-based parties will remain in force with the Appellate Division upholding the verdict that HC had given by rejecting the Fifth Amendment to the constitution. Shafique Ahmed, however, said at the secretariat that there was no reason to doubt that the constitution would still begin in the name of Allah. "And Bismillah will still be there." A day after Appellate Division granted withdrawal of a government appeal challenging the 2005 HC ruling, Ahmed said the government would now seek suggestions from the law commission on issue. He said the commission would advise the government regarding the provisions of the 1972 constitution, included or dropped because of the Fifth Amendment passed in April 1979, legalising all regimes between Aug 15 1975 and 1979. He said the government would not allow the use of religion for political purposes. Islam was adopted as the state religion by the eighth amendment of the constitution in June 1988. "We have decided to withdraw the leave to appeal (seeking to challenge the HC ruling) as we have faith in the judgment." The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in powermilitary or otherwiseafter the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. The ruling government in 2005, an alliance government led by BNP, founded by Ziaur Rahman, filed a leave to appeal on which the Supreme Court had stayed the High Court ruling. But the present government in May 2009 petitioned the court for withdrawal of the leave to appeal. However, there are two more leaves to appeal pending against the High Court ruling. The Appellate Division set Jan 18 to hear the two leaves to appeal filed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three Jamaat-e-Islami backed lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan. bdne
