<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has referred a petition to the chief justice regarding BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's birthday. The bench of justice Md Mamtazuddin Ahmed referred the petition on Monday for a decision. A lawyer, Mohammad Suhrawardy, filed a civil suit with the Dhaka assistant judge's court on Aug 20 1997 asking for a ban on observing August 15 as Khaleda's birthday. The Awami League government observes the day as a National Mourning Day, as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's founding father, was killed on Aug 15 1975. Khaleda, leader of the opposition and a two-time former prime minister, on Sep 16 1999, filed a petition with the High Court challenging the legitimacy of the case. An application was also filed on behalf of Khaleda on Nov 16 2009 to remove the case from the cause list of the lower court, citing concern over not getting justice in the case. bdnews
