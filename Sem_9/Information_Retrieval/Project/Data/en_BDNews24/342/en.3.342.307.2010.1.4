 Dhaka, Jan 04 (bdnews24.com)  The cold wave sweeping the country has claimed at least nine more lives in the 24 hours up to Monday morning, as the weather office forecast more chilly spells for the month with temperatures falling as low as 6C. Officials reported two deaths in Nilphamari, three in Thakurgaon, two in Kurigram and two in Faridpur, caused by cold-related illnesses, though actual figures are likely to be much higher by local accounts. Hospital admissions, for winter afflictions, have also risen across the country. Fog and cold continued to disrupt communications, with ferries halted and vehicles thinner on roads during early morning and night. Shops and businesses have also been closing early with more people staying indoors. MORE CHILL WEATHER FORECAST The ongoing cold wave was set to continue on Tuesday, and at least two more cold waves may sweep over northern and central regions of Bangladesh this month, the Meteorological Department forecast on Monday. Temperatures look set to plummet between 6-8 degrees Celsius, said the met department. On duty officer Shahidul Islam told bdnews24.com that the mild cold wave sweeping over Tangail and Srimangal districts, and Khulna, Rajshahi divisions could spread further over Faridpur, Mymensingh and Barisal districts on Tuesday. It is likely to remain dry on Tuesday, he said, but moderate fog may occur overnight Monday. He also said the lowest temperature on Monday was recorded at 8.6 degrees Celsius in Jessore.
