 CAPE TOWN, Jan 4 (Reuters) - England snapped up the last four South African wickets for 12 runs in 15 balls but were then reduced to 64 for three at lunch as bowlers dominated the morning session on the second day of the third test on Monday. South Africa, resuming their first innings on 279 for six at Newlands, were bowled out for 291 with paceman James Anderson taking five for 63. Centurion Jacques Kallis fell to the first ball he faced, the second of the morning, when he could only edge a superb away-swinger from Graham Onions to wicketkeeper Matt Prior to be out for 108. The other overnight batsman, Dale Steyn, also failed to add to his score of 26 when he edged Anderson's first ball of the day into the slips, Jonathan Trott taking a sharp catch. Anderson then gained reward for his top-class swing bowling throughout the innings when he dismissed Morne Morkel, Graeme Swann taking a superb diving catch at second slip, and Friedel de Wet for ducks. England were quickly in trouble in their reply when captain Andrew Strauss edged a flatfooted drive at an away-swinger from Morkel to be caught behind for two. Alastair Cook and Trott took the score to 36 for one in the next hour before Steyn struck twice in his third over. ] Trott, who had cruised to 20, chopped a delivery into his stumps and, two balls later, Kevin Pietersen (0) sent an ambitious drive straight back to the bowler, who reacted sharply to take a one-handed catch. Cook, on 27, and Paul Collingwood, on 14, were not out at lunch. South Africa are 1-0 down in the four-match series, having been beaten by an innings in the second test in Durban last week.
