 Manikganj, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Ferry services remained suspended for several hours on Paturia-Daulatdia and Mawa-Kawrakandhi routes on Monday due to dense fog. Officials said that ferries resumed operations on Paturia-Daulatdia route at 9.00 am after three hours of service cut, when hundreds of vehicles were stranded on both sides of the route. Ashraf Ullah, manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) Aricha office, said there was a huge traffic snarl-up on the Dhaka-Aricha highway during that time. Thick fog also disrupted ferry services on Mawa-Kawrakandi route for three hours and a half since 7:00 am. BIWTC official Abu Alam Hawlader said six ferries remained stranded on the Padma river as they could not move in the fog. The country had a few days respite, until Monday, from the thick fog that has been blanketing the country since December. bdnews24.c
