 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP says it will only join parliament if the government revokes its decision to cancel the lease of Khaleda Zia's Cantonment house and lifts cases against her sons in a 10-point charter of demands. The boycotting party placed a few fresh demands on the first day of the winter session of parliament after speaker Abdul Hamid on Dec 28 proposed to allocate one more front-row seat provided BNP would get back to House. "We insist that the speaker and the ruling party (Awami League) create a congenial environment in parliament by meeting our demands," the party's chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque said on Monday. He also urged the ruling party to stop venting against the opposition leaders in parliament. The 10 demands tightening of Khaleda's security and withdrawal of cases filed against the opposition leaders, including her sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman. They also include acceptance of motions moved by the opposition leaders in parliament, holding of discussions on Tipaimukh dam and price inflation, halting passage for India in the name of Asian Highway, improvement of law and order, stopping political harassment. BNP also demanded posts of chairmen of two standing committees, according to the government's previous assurance, and withdrawal of the decision on appointment of women MPs of reserved seats to the parliamentary constituencies of opposition MPs. Though it joined the first session of the ninth parliament, the party has continued its boycott through following sessions. Farrouque threatened Awami League saying, "Keep in mind that if the opposition parties do not join parliament, the government's rule and the democracy will become uncertain." The senior BNP leader was talking to the reporters at a press briefing at the party's media centre where BNP MPs Shaiduddin Chowdhury Annie, Shammi Akhter and Nilufar Chowdhury Moni were also present. bdnews
