 DUBLIN, Jan 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan will continue to implement his fiscal reform programme but will not perform non-essential tasks for months as he undergoes therapy for cancer, he said on Monday. Recent media reports said Lenihan, who has won praise from investors for halting Ireland's steep budget deficit rise by presenting three budgets in just over a year, had pancreatic cancer.
