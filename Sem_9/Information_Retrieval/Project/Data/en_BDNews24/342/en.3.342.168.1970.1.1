 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)--Tillakaratne Dilshan celebrated a maiden century against Bangladesh as Sri Lanka powered to an emphatic seven-wicket victory in the opening match of the Idea Cup triangular series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. The Lankan vice-captain scored 104 off 122 balls with 12 boundaries -- the first ODI century of the new decade -- to help his side reach 261-3 in 44.5 overs in response to the hosts' fighting total of 260-7. Man-of-the match Dilshan set up the cakewalk after featuring in a magnificent 148-run second-wicket stand with skipper Kumar Sangakkara who made 74 off 73 balls before the latter became medium-pacer Shafiul Islam's maiden one-day wicket. Dilshan, who like Sangakkara made batting look simple on a chilly Dhaka night, eventually mistimed a flighted Mahmudullah delivery and was caught at mid-wicket. Along the way he completed 4,000 ODI runs. Thilan Samaraweera was unbeaten on 41 off 54 deliveries. Opener Upul Tharanga was the other wicket to fall for 14 with the score 35. He was caught behind slashing at a widish delivery from Rubel Hossain. Earlier, a mature half-century by Mohammad Ashraful guided Bangladesh to 260-7 in 50 overs. The former Bangladesh captain held the innings together in the day-nighter with a workmanlike 75 off 94 balls. Naeem Islam slammed 20 off the final over to push the total past 250-mark which Bangladesh hoped to score. After being put into bat, the home side put on 65 for the opening stand before Imrul Kayes top-edged a delivery for 23. Then a heap of wickets fell in which Bangladesh lost three for 13 runs. It all started with the score on 71 when Tamim, who had smashed 16 runs off a Welegedara over, tried to charge Dilshan but only succeeded in getting caught at mid-off for 40. Raqibul was the next to go brilliantly caught one-handed by Samaraweera. The Tigers captain Shakib Al Hasan didn't last long as he was caught at third man. Mushfiqur Rahim (35) in partnership with Ashraful then added 58 runs after the Tigers had slumped to 74-4. Eventually, Mushfiq was out lbw attempting to sweep a full toss. Ashraful was joined by Mahmudullah and the pair featured in a crucial 95-run stand for sixth wicket. The latter was also trapped leg before for 45. The Bangladesh middle-order linchpin fell with nine balls left in the innings, run out while trying to steal a bye. His scored only six boundaries to topscore for the hosts. Bangladesh made a positive start with Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes putting on 65 runs for the opening stand before Imrul Kayes top-edged a delivery for 23. Then a heap of wickets fell in which Bangladesh lost three for 13 runs. The slump started with the score on 71 when Tamim, who had smashed 16 runs off a Welegedara over, tried to charge Dilshan but only succeeded in getting caught at mid-off for 40. Raqibul was the next to go brilliantly taken by Samaraweera with a one-handed catch off a shortish ball. The Tigers captain Shakib Al Hasan didn't last long as he was caught at third man, but sensible batting by the middle-order meant Bangladesh did not lose their way. Lakmal and Randiv shared four wickets. Dilshan and Kulasekara bagged one apiece. Right-arm pacer Shafiul Islam, who was the leading wicket-taker in the domestic cricket, made his ODI debut. For Sri Lanka, Chamara Silva was recalled to bring a bit of experience to the middle order while Nuwan Kulasekara was given another chance in the tournament. India are other side in the tournament and they play Sri Lanka on Tuesday at the venue
