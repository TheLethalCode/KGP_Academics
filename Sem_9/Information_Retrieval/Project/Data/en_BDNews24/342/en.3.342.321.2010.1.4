 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)The five convicted killers of president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman now have seven days from the issuance of death warrants to seek clemency, a senior jail official said on Monday. The Dhaka district and sessions judge signed the warrants against Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan on Sunday. The five, now in condemned cells of Dhaka Central Jail, received death warrants the same day, inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Ashraful Islam Khan told reporters at the jail directorate. The defence counsels received the copy of the full verdict on Dec 22 and said they would file review petition before Jan 21. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque earlier said that execution of death sentence would be on hold if the convicts filed review petitions even after issuance of death warrants. As per law, the review petition is to be filed within 30 days of receipt of the full verdict copy. According to law, the death penalties are to be executed between 21 and 28 days of issuance of the warrants. The Supreme Court, in a landmark judgment on Nov 19, upheld the High Court's death sentences for the five convicts. The Supreme Court rejected appeals of five men convicted of killing Bangladesh's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a landmark verdict on Nov 19, after a long-drawn appeals process, clearing the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the 1975 assassination. Five Appellate Division judges, headed by Md Tafazzul Islam, released the 412-page judgment on Dec 17. The guiding figure of Bangladesh independence, Mujib was killed with 16 members of his family, including wife and three sons, on Aug 15, 1975, by renegade army officers. His daughters, Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, escaped death only because they were abroad. A case was filed with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons in 1996, 21 years after the grisly incident. The trial court in November 1998awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. The High Court in 2000 found 10 former army officers guilty of the murder. But the two-member high court panel was split over the guilt of five others who had also been convicted and sentenced to hang by the trial court. A third High Court judge acquitted three of the 15 convicts. Four of them appealed for reprieve the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 2007. Of the remaining seven, one died and six are fugitives from justice in foreign lands. b
