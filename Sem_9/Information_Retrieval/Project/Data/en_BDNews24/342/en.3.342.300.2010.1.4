<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has given the CID another two months for investigation into the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack. Metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashirullah on Monday noon fixed March 4 for submission of an investigation report on a time-extension motion filed by the Criminal Investigation Department. CID's Abdul Kahhar Akand, the investigation officer, filed the petition on Sunday, the deadline for the report submission, seeking four more months. Public prosecutor Shah Alam told bdnews24.com on Monday that the judge in his order said the investigation agency was given the extension as the probe was still in progress. It is the third extension given since investigations were reopened into the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. On August 3 last year, Md Masdar Hossain, the then judge of Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal 1, had initially directed further investigations after taking statements of some 61 witnesses. Two cases were originally filed in connection with the grenade attack, one for killings and the other for use of explosives. On October 14 last year the cases were transferred to the metropolitan sessions judge's court and the CID was given another extension. The explosives case is now pending with Bashirullah's court while the one for killings is with the second additional metropolitan sessions judge's court of Fazila Begum. At least 24 people, including Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, wife of president Zillur Rahman, lost their lives in the attack on August 21 on Bangabandhu Avenue in Dhaka. Scores sustained injuries, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Investigators, during the previous BNP administration, are accused of attempting to derail the case through different means including recording of false statements from witnesses. After BNP's tenure was over, new investigators, appointed during the regime of the subsequent interim government, pressed charges against 22 people on June 11 last year. BNP leader Nasiruddin Pintu and JMB leader Mufti Hannan were among the accused. BNP's former state minister for home, Lutfozzaman Babar, now in jail, was also recently shown arrested in connection with the grenade attack. b
