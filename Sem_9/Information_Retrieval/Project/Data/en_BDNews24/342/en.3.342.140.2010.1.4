<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong metropolitan sessions judge has extended the investigation time by another 76 days for the sensational seizure of 10 truckloads of arms in 2004. This is the sixth extension granted for this case. The same court had extended investigation time by three months on Oct 5 last year. Sessions judge Bhabani Prashad Singh allowed the extension on Monday noon in response to a petition submitted by the Criminal Investigation Department, the probing agency. State counsel and metropolitan public prosecutor Kamaluddin told bdnews24.com that it would take some more time to complete investigation of the much-hyped case. Therefore, he said, after a hearing on the petition the judge extended the probe time until March 22. On behalf of the CID, the metropolitan public prosecutor Kamaluddin submitted a petition on Monday morning seeking three months' extension. Upon submission of the prayer, the investigation officer, senior CID ASP Moniruzzaman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that they needed more time. He said it was not possible to complete the investigation as the Indian militant outfit ULFA's alleged links to the arms shipment couldn't yet be fully unearthed. Also, it could not be established or ascertained how the arms-laden ship got permission to unload at a restricted jetty of the CUFL and what role the anti-smuggling squad of the customs department played, he said. The police seized 10 truckloads of weapons and ammunition from the CUFL jetty in Chittagong on the night of April 1 2004, sparking speculation that the cache was allegedly destined to the Indian insurgent group United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA). Following a court order on February 12 2008, the CID appointed Ismail Hossain as investigation officer in the arms haul case. Ismail got two extensions of the deadline for submission of the investigation report. On January 18 last year, the court ordered a change of the investigation officer and Moniruzzaman took charge. In the course of his investigation, Moniruzzaman arrested a number of high-profile suspects, including two former directors general of the National Security Intelligence and navy officers and secured their confession. However, Moniruzzaman also got three extensions. bdnews
