 BERLIN, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich defender Lucio said on Tuesday he was interested in moving to a club in Spain, Italy or England. "I've said the world's three best leagues in Spain, Italy and England would interest me," the Brazilian said in an interview with Munich's Abendzeitung newspaper. "If interest comes from these countries I'd like that very much and would be delighted if a transfer would work out," said Lucio, who joined Bayern from Bayer Leverkusen in 2004. The newspaper said Barcelona were ready to pay at least 15 million euros ($23.72 million) for the 29-year-old, whose contract runs until 2010. "They (Bayern) have said they want to hold on to me," Lucio said. "But that's what all clubs tell their players with long-term contracts. "On the other hand if there's interest from another club in a player, then you talk about it and find an agreement that's good for everyone involved.
