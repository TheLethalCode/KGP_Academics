 Washington, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FBI agents were among those wounded in a bomb attack on an Italian restaurant in Islamabad during the weekend, the FBI said on Sunday. "Four FBI personnel were slightly injured in the bombing attack in Pakistan. The FBI is providing the necessary assistance to our employees and their families," FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said. Kolko provided no further details. The U.S. State Department had no addition comment. A bomb planted in the garden dining area of the Luna Caprese restaurant on Saturday killed a Turkish woman and wounded 11 people, including five Americans. The restaurant is a popular spot with foreigners in Islamabad. ABC News, citing unnamed sources, reported that an investigation was under way to determine whether the attack was based on whether terrorists had learned in advance the agents would be at the restaurant.
