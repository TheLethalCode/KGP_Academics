<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited Sunday emerged unbeaten champions in the Premier Division Twenty20 Cricket League with a convincing six-wicket win over City Club in the final at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Dhanmondi-based outfit raced to 80 for four with nine balls to spare in reply to City's 79 all out in 20 overs. Newcomers Surjo Torun finished third after inflicting a massive nine-wicket defeat on Victoria Sporting Club at the same venue. Abahani dedicated their first trophy of the season to late cricketers Manjurul Islam Rana and Sajjadul Hasan Setu, who died in a road accident on this day last year in Khulna. "It is an outcome of team effort as the team is comprised of a bunch of young cricketers who have been showing high team spirit in the Premier League," said Tushar Imran, who is captaining Abahani for the first time. "It is a different feeling to have won a trophy under my own captaincy though I captained the team in the absence of Khaled Mashud last year," said Tushar. Abahani vs City Club Deciding to bat first, City Club were soon in deep trouble at 21 for four in the sixth over. Abahani pacer Ziaur Rahman rattled the top order by removing three batsmen in a row. His partner Talha Jubair joined the party by removing City's topscorer Imran Ahmed (13) to send them tottering at 47 for five in 12.2 overs. Left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny, who was man of the match, wiped the middle and tail, claiming five wickets for just 12 runs in his four overs. City had also lost to Abahani in group match by six wickets. Opener Mahbubul Karim gave Abahani a rollicking start with a seven-ball 20. He smashed three fours and a six before holing out to Mamun off Shafaq Al Jabir in the third over. Despite the blistering start, Abahani had to wait until the 19th over and lost three more wickets before opener Zahirul Islam (29 off 45) and Shagir Hossain (1) steered their side home. Surjo Tarun vs Victoria SC Shamsur Rahman Shuvo smashed a 20-ball 42 not out as Surjo Tarun raced to the target of 79 in 8.5 overs losing just one wicket. Shuvo struck five fours and three sixes along with Aslam Ali (11) after opener Uttam Kumar fell on 12. Pacer Delwar Hossain (2/15) made inroads into Victoria's batting line-up after Surjo Tarun decided to bowl first. Manwar Hossain (1/8), Mohammad Sharif (1/18), Nazmul Hossain (2/13) and Mohammad Younus (2/21) bowled superbly to restrict Victoria to 78 for nine in 20 overs. Waseluddin (16 not out), Dhiman Ghosh (15) and Rubel Hossain (13) were the only three Victoria batsmen to reach double figures in a lacklustre performance. b
