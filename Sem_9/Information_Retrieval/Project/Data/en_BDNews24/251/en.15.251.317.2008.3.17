 Hong Kong, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks sank on Monday to their lowest since August 2007 and the dollar tumbled as the fire sale of U.S. bank Bear Stearns and the Federal Reserve's emergency cut of a key lending rate sparked concerns that the global credit crisis will claim more casualties. European stocks were set to drop as well, with the FTSE's 100 seen down as much as 1.8 percent and Germany's DAX seen down 2.2 percent, while U.S. stock futures also pointed to a sharply lower session. The dollar sank to a record low against the euro and a 13-year low against the yen, sending spot gold and crude futures hurling towards record highs. Other safe-haven assets also rose. Both Japanese government bond futures and U.S. Treasury futures rose to five-year highs. "I'm sure we'll see one or two other victims," said Angus Gluskie, portfolio manager at White Funds Management in Sydney. "It shows that banks were holding lots of exposure to difficult areas and in the end, it has come back to bite equity holders." The MSCI measure of Asian stocks outside Japan dropped 3.2 percent as of 0609 GMT, after earlier hitting its lowest since Aug. 20, 2007. The index is now down about 20 percent so far this year, a sharp reversal from five previous years of double-digit gains. In an unexpected move before markets opened in Asia, the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks and implemented steps to provide cash to a wider range of financial firms, using tools last used in the Great Depression. Minutes earlier, JPMorgan Chase & Co had said it would buy Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom price of $2 a share, valuing the U.S. investment bank at the centre of a widening global credit crisis at about $236 million. The uncertainty caused futures on the federal funds rate to soar, fully pricing in a 1 percentage point rate cut at or before the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday. "Desperate times need desperate measures. The Federal Reserve is doing what it takes to restore stability and if it means cutting the discount rate on a Sunday night in the U.S., then so be it," said Craig James, chief equities economist at Commesec in Sydney. Financial companies were hammered, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and South Korea's biggest lender Kookmin Bank The shockwaves in Asia prompted government leaders to say they are monitoring the developments in the financial sector. "We are only at the beginning stages of a crisis. It's totally impossible to forecast the world economy. I think, maybe, a world economic crisis is just beginning," South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said on Monday, according to a pool report. PAINFUL 2008 Japan's Nikkei average dropped 3.7 percent, hitting earlier its lowest since August 2005, with exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp sinking along with the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in Asia, shares in Hong Kong and India fell around 4 percent each, while Australian stocks fell 2.3 percent. Stocks in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore fell a little under 2 percent. Asian stocks are suffering from a painful 2008 as subprime and credit-related writedowns in the global financial sector are happening at a time when the U.S. economy is widely expected to be in or about to enter a recession. The twin effects are having a knock-on effect from Bangkok to Tokyo. Local currencies are strengthening in line with the slumping dollar, denting the growth outlook for the export-dependent region, while surging food and energy prices are hitting the pocketbooks of Asian consumers. That is leaving central banks in a bind as they must deal with slowing economic growth but rising inflation. DOLLAR SINKS, GOLD SOARS Speculation of joint global central banks interventions hit markets as the U.S. currency plunged 3 percent against the yen at one point to hit its lowest since 1995 before clawing back to around 96.8 yen. The euro vaulted to a record $1.5905 against the dollar, but then retreated to $1.5850. Spot gold surged more than 3 percent to a record $1,030.80 an ounce, buoyed by the dollar's weakness and a bid-to-safety. Bullion was last traded at $1,024.40. Oil jumped to its latest record as well, with crude for April delivery up at 89 cents at $111.10 a barrel, off a peak $111.42 hit earlier in the session. Investors opted for other asset classes perceived to be safer, with Japanese June 10-year futures jumping a five-year high, and last traded at 1.43 point to 141.70.
