 NEW YORK, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock index futures jumped on Tuesday as investors expected another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve following its weekend emergency action to help revive the US economy and credit markets. Financial shares rebounded in early pre-market trading from Monday's sharp declines while results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc are also expected on Tuesday. Some investors may be seeing recent market weakness and JPMorgan Chase & Co's planned buyout of Bear Stearns Co Inc for just $236 million as a sign slumping stock prices may be near a bottom. The Fed's policy-setting committee is expected to announce its decision on benchmark U.S. rates later on Tuesday. "With the Fed move and the Bear news and everything else, people are so shocked by all of this. At least for some market people, it may be that there's a bottom," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. S&P 500 futures were up 14 points, well above fair value, a formula to evaluate pricing taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 100 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 18.75 points. Shares of Lehman were trading at $33.10 before the bell after closing at $31.75 on Monday. European shares also were higher. Data on producer prices and on housing starts are among key U.S. economic indicators on tap on Tuesday. Interest rate futures show investors are fully pricing in a one percentage-point cut in US short-term rates, which would take the benchmark fed funds target rate down to 2 percent. Over the weekend, the Fed made an emergency quarter-point cut to its discount rate to 3.25 percent and expanded lending to a wider range of big financial firms, in the first such move since the Great Depression of nearly 80 years ago. In other corporate news, shares of Dynavax Technologies Corp and Merck & Co could be watched after U.S. regulators put a hold on further studies of an experimental hepatitis B vaccine. On Monday, the Dow industrials ended slightly higher, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell after JPMorgan's deal to buy Bear at a rock bottom price failed to dispel fears of deeper fallout from the escalating credit crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.16 points, or 0.18 percent, to end at 11,972.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 11.54 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,276.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 35.48 points, or 1.60 percent, to 2,177.
