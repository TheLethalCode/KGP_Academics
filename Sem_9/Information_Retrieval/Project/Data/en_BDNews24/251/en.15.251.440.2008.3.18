 DURBAN, South Africa, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African Imtiaz Patel will decide in the next few weeks whether to take over as International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive. On Monday, cricket's governing body named Patel as its preferred candidate to fill the vacancy that will be created when Australian Malcolm Speed steps down in June. "I am humbled the ICC has stated it will invite me to fulfil such an important role within cricket, a sport that has a very special place in my heart," the 43-year-old Patel said in a news release issued by his employers Supersport on Tuesday. "I will therefore be considering my position very carefully during the coming weeks and will be engaging in discussions with the ICC during this period." FORMER TEACHER A former Soweto teacher, Patel worked for the United Cricket Board (UCB), predecessor of Cricket South Africa, from 1991 to 1999. He then joined broadcaster Supersport and was named director of enterprises in 2000. He became the network's director of productions in 2003 before being appointed chief executive in 2005. A board member of South African soccer's Premier League, Patel is also a director of Supersport United Football Club and the Sharks and Cheetahs rugby franchises. "I enjoy a most rewarding and happy career in my current role as chief executive of Supersport, which is a dynamic organisation within a wonderful international group," added Patel. "In the interests of the confidentiality of all candidates, I feel it will be inappropriate to make any further public comment about the ICC post prior to the finalisation of the process.
