<TITLE> Energy ministry seeks ADB funds for Titas gasfield safety </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bnews24.com) -- The energy ministry has asked the Asian Development Bank for financial and technical assistance to examine and ensure the safety of all wells in the Titas gasfield, said a special aide to the chief adviser Monday. Prof M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of the power, energy and mineral resources ministry, said the ministry had sought financial assistance to the tune of $100 million to fund the project. The special assistant briefed reporters following a meeting with officials from Bangladesh Gas Fields Company, a company of Petrobangla, at the ministry. The meeting was informed of current safety issues at the gasfield including ongoing large-scale gas leaks at a recently closed well. "All the wells at the Titas field would be examined and a proposal has been put to the ADB in this regard," said Prof Tamim. "They have accepted our proposal and talks are ongoing. To complete all the work it would require an investment of around $100 million, which we have sought from the ADB." The special assistant said there were also plans to dig four new wells in the Titas gasfield. Prof Tamim said it was impossible for the Bangladesh Gas Fields Company to come up with such a huge sum of money without outside assistance. "Well number-three at the gas field has been closed, and gas has been leaking out and depositing in the upper level of the sand there." Huge amounts of gas have been deposited over an extended period, and it has been estimated that it will take up to a year to ensure the leak is totally plugged following repair work. Prof Tamim said gas leaks had been identified at up to 25 locations at the site, although the amounts were not significant. "The whole gas field needs to be examined. Titas gasfield is very important for us," he said. He said Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company will carry out the safety checks and there were plans to make the company stronger in the future. bdnews
