<TITLE> Greece to extradite top Australian fugitive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Athens, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece's highest court on Tuesday approved the extradition of Australia's most wanted fugitive, convicted drugs smuggler Tony Mokbel, his lawyer said. An Australian court sentenced Mokbel to 12 years' jail for cocaine trafficking in 2006. He fled shortly before the end of the trial, triggering an international manhunt that ended with his capture more than a year later, in June 2007, at a cafe in an Athens suburb . Mokbel, also known as "Fat Tony", is also wanted in Australia on suspicion of ordering and paying for the murder of rival crime boss Lewis Moran and another man. He denies any involvement. Mokbel's lawyer Alexandros Likourezos told reporters the Greek court had approved Mokbel's extradition to serve out his 12-year sentence, and also to stand trial on 15 charges, including those related to the murders. It ruled that five lesser charges -- four related to drugs trafficking and one of perversion of justice -- were not extraditable, which meant Mokbel could not be tried for those specific charges once he is in Australia, Likourezos said. Mokbel, who has been kept in dentetion since he was arrested last June, had been living in Greece with his girlfriend, a daughter and another child. Likourezos said he would still seek to prevent the extradition, adding: "We will exhaust all means that the law provides." Asked what he could do now given that his options in Greek courts had run out, Likourezos said: "It is a question of imagination." The Supreme Court decision means Mokbel's extradition requires only the signature of the minister of justice. Likourezos told reporters this might still take months. Mokbel had argued that he would not get a fair trial in Australia due to biased press reports and comments by senior state politicians on his case and his arrest.
