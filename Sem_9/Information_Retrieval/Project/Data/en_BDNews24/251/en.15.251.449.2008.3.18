<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, India, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Harbhajan Singh would be happy to patch things up with Australian pair Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds, the Indian off-spinner said on Tuesday. Opening batsman Hayden was reprimanded by Cricket Australia for calling the Indian spinner an "obnoxious weed". According to media reports in Australia, Hayden regretted his comments and was keen to clear the air with Harbhajan. "These things happen in the game and I am happy if he wants to patch (things) up," Harbhajan told the Mumbai tabloid Mid Day on Tuesday. "I never had any problem off the field with him, he is more than welcome to come and talk it over. "I always got on with the game and now if he wants to get on with the game, I am happy to talk to him. From my side the issue is solved." Harbhajan was also involved in a racism row after being accused of calling all-rounder Symonds a monkey in the second test in Sydney. The spinner denied the claim and was later cleared of racial abuse by the sport's governing body. He was found guilty of the lesser offence of using abusive language. Asked if he would invite Symonds for a chat, Harbhajan said: "I am more than happy to be friends with everyone. "What happens on the field should be left on the field. If you say something you should be able to take it. Otherwise don't say it. I will be happy to put the issue behind me." India lost the four-test series 2-1 but beat the hosts 2-0 in the finals of the one-day tri-series
