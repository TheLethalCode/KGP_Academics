 CAIRO, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's main stock indexes dipped on Monday for the third day in a row, led by market heavyweights Orascom Telecom and Orascom Construction Industries , brokers said. "There's a sell-off on equity markets worldwide, and this is reflected here... especially on the GDRs (global depositary receipts), and that's why the large caps are the most affected by it," Mohamed Kotb of Jazira Asset Management said. Global stocks fell sharply and the dollar tumbled on Monday as a fire sale of Bear Stearns and an emergency Federal Reserve cut of a key lending rate sparked fears that a worldwide credit crisis will claim more causalities. Orascom Telecom was down 5.1 percent by the close of trade at 72.80 pounds per share, while its London-listed share had lost 4.1 percent by 1352 GMT. Orascom Construction Industries closed 3.3 percent lower at 645 pounds per share. Its GDRs had lost 5.7 percent by 1353 GMT. OCI and OT were the day's most heavily traded shares by value. Commercial International Bank, Egypt's largest listed bank by market value, saw its shares fall 1.7 percent to close at 90.50 pounds per share. On Monday, the company approved a dividend of 1 Egyptian pounds per share for 2007. Overall, the CASE 30 index shed 2.5 percent to end at 10,915.79 points, while the well-watched Hermes index lost 2.5 percent to 95,854.42 points. The broader CIBC index fell 1.6 percent to 534.17 points. ($1 = 5.48 Egyptian poun
