<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh restricted Ireland to a reachable total of 185 for seven in 50 overs after being put in to bowl in the three-ODI series opener at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Tuesday. Despite an early setback, the Irish batsmen showed enough nerve to face Bangladeshi's quality bowlers, mostly comprising spinners, but could not cross the 200-mark on the slow and low wicket. Pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza made the inroad into the visitors batting line-up removing both openers William Porterfield (1) and Reinhardt Strydom (8) in 20 runs inside the 12th over. Off-spinner Mahmudullah Riad justified his inclusion sending back Niall O'Brien (15), to reduce the visitors to 43 for three in 16 overs, and returned one for 31 in his 10-over spell. But, the Irish middle order batsmen played cautiously in face of tight bowling from the host bowlers and recovered their slow start to end up at moderate total. Eoin Morgan and Kevin O'Brien (20) produced some resistance to put on 38 runs for the fourth wicket before Morgan was trapped lbw by Shakib Al Hasan for 35 off 56 balls, leaving the side at 41 for four in 25.5 overs. Then, Bangladesh picked off two quick wickets in 17 runs to put Ireland on the back foot after reducing them to 115 for six in 34.5 overs, before skipper Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack played a key role in the seventh wicket. They together contributed a significant 65 runs before Cusack was Mashrafee's third victim in the final over being caught by Farhad off Mashrafee for a patient 38 off 61 balls studded with one six. Johnston and Dave Langford-Smith remained unbeaten on 31 and 3. Mashrafee returned three for 22 in 10 overs while Farhad Reza, Shakib Al Hasan chipped in with one wicket each. Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Raqibul Hasan, Dhiman Ghosh, Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafe Mortaza and Mahmudullah Riad. Ireland: William Porterfield, Reinhardt Strydom, Trent Johnston, Eoin Morgan, Niall O'Brien, Kevin O'Brien, Andre Botha, Alex Cusack, Kyle McCallan, Greg Thompson and Dave Langford-Smith. bdnew
