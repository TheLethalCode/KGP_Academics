<TITLE> Nafees, Ashraful help Tigers take lead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Shahriar Nafees and captain Mohammad Ashraful Tuesday struck half-centuries to end their run droughts and propel Bangladesh to an emphatic eight-wicket win over Ireland in the first ODI at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Bangladesh raced to 186 for two with 10.1 overs to go after restricting Ireland to a meager 185 for seven in 50 overs. The hosts not only took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, but also avenged their 74-run loss to the Irishmen in the World Cup in the West Indies. Openers Tamim Iqbal and Shahriar Nafees gave the Tigers a blistering start, going at five runs an over and the hosts never fell below four runs per over against the required 3.72 an over. The Irish spinners slowed things down for a while in the middle of the innings after Tamim (13) and one-down Aftab Ahmed (11) returned cheaply. But Bangladesh never appeared in trouble with Nafees and Ashraful playing confidently, in stark contrast to their lackadaisical batting display in the recent series against a much stronger South Africa. Left-handed Nafees overcame the lean patch to smash his eighth ODI fifty after 12 matches since his unbeaten 104 against Bermuda in the World Cup. He was unconquered on 90 off 120 balls, having smashed 11 fours, while Ashraful scored 64 not out, his 13th half-century, playing 90 balls and hitting eight fours. They put on 130 runs for the unbroken third wicket, scoring 4.26 runs per over in 30.2 overs. Ashraful tasted his first win in an one-dayer since he took over as captain in July last year. Earlier, opting to bat first, Ireland found the going difficult with their top-order failing to negotiate a fiery spell from Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and were reduced to 20 for two in 11th over. Off-spinner Mahmudullah Riad justified his inclusion, sending back two-down Niall O'Brien (15) to see the visitors wobbling at 43 for three in 16 overs. He returned one for 31 in his 10-over spell. Despite the early setback, the Irish batsmen ground it out against some inspired bowling by Bangladeshi spinners, but could manage only 185 for seven. Alex Cusack and skipper Trent Johnston helped put on 65 runs for the seventh wicket to give the Irish bowlers something to bowl at. Cusack played a patient 38 off 61 balls before being the third victim of Mashrafee in the final over while Johnston remained unbeaten on 31 off 66 balls. Eoin Morgan (35), Kevin O'Brien (20) and Niall O'Brien (22) threw up some resistance in the middle, but in the end the total proved far from enough to make the Bangladesh batsmen sweat. Farhad Reza and Shakib Al Hasan chipped in with one wicket each. bdnews24
