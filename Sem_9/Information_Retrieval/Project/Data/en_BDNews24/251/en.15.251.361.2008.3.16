 Wana, Pakistan, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to three missiles struck a house in a Pakistani region known as a safe haven for al Qaeda and Taliban militants on Sunday, killing 12 people including foreign militants, local officials said. The attack took place in a village in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border. "Eight foreigners and four of their supporters were killed," said a district government official who declined to be identified. The nationality of the foreigners was not known but some resident of the area said Arabs were among the dead. A military official said earlier militants were believed to have been hiding at the house and seven of them were killed and several wounded. It was not clear who fired the missiles but villagers said they had heard the sound of a pilotless drone in the sky before the blasts. U.S. forces have fired missiles at militants on the Pakistani side of the border several times in recent years. A missile believed fired by a U.S. drone killed 13 suspected militants in South Waziristan in late February. On Jan. 28 one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants, Abu Laith al-Libi, was killed in a strike in North Waziristan. Military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said there were reports of blasts and some casualties in the area and the military was checking.
