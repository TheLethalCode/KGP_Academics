 HONG KONG, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks tumbled more than 5 percent on Monday, weighed by mounting fears of further fallout from the troubled credit markets after brokerage JPMorgan Chase bailed out stricken rival Bear Stearns. Top Chinese packaging paper supplier Nine Dragons dived more than 40 percent at one point after its interim earnings showed that rising costs were squeezing margins. But investors sought safety in the city's utilities, sending Hongkong Electric to a fresh record. Hong Kong blue chips sank to lows not seen since August, when turmoil in the risky subprime debt market sparked massive sell-offs in global equities. Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, or H shares, tumbled 7.2 percent in their worst one-day percentage loss in nearly two months. "The mood is one of disbelief that something could happen so quickly, but there's a sense of relief that JPMorgan stepped up to provide some kind of platform," said Miles Remington, sales and trading director at BNP Paribas. "You would suspect in the short term we would test 20,000 (points). If we are in trouble, we should be wiping out the gains of the last six months." JPMorgan Chase & Co bought Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom price of $2 a share while the U.S. Federal Reserve set an emergency interest rate cut and opened direct lending to Wall Street. Mainboard turnover was a robust HK$94.4 billion (US$12.1 billion) compared with Friday's HK$88.3 billion.

Bank of East Asia hit lows not seen since October 2006 and finished at HK$36.25, down nearly 9 percent. The city's power companies were among the day's few bright spots. Hongkong Electric jumped 3.3 percent to HK$50.90, topping an all-time high set last week, and CLP Holdings rang up a 1.1 percent gain to HK$65.30. Nine Dragons struck lows not seen since August 2006 as its earnings disappointed after rising materials costs cut into profit growth. The sell-off spread to rival Lee & Man Paper, which plummeted 26.8 percent to HK$12.20. Sinopec Corp tumbled for a third straight session. Shares in Asia's top refiner fell 8.1 percent to HK$6.14 on nagging fears it would face losses, squeezed between record crude prices and caps on prices it can charge on refined oil products. However, UBS upgraded Sinopec shares to "buy" in a report dated Monday, saying the sell-off, which began last week, was overdone. China's Shenhua Energy Co Ltd sputtered 8.9 percent lower to HK$32.95. The world's top coal producer by market value lagged forecasts when it posted a 16.6 percent rise in 2007 earnings, as it churned out 16 percent more of the hydrocarb
