<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdur Razzak filed a libel suit against Maulana Misbahur Rahman Chowdhury Sunday for his role in the publication of a list of alleged war criminals in which he was named. A faction of Islami Oikya Jote, which is led by Misbahur, published the list on Feb 16. Razzak filed the case with the Dhaka District Judge's Court and demanded Tk 100 crore in compensation from Misbahur. The court ordered that a summons be issued against the IOJ chief. According to case details, on Feb 17 different daily newspapers published a list of "war criminals" in which 15 Jamaat leaders, including party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and Razzak were named. The newspaper reports named Misbahur as the author of the list. The plaintiff claims his image was tarnished at home and abroad following the list's publication. Misbahur told bdnews24.com that he was happy that the case had been filed, and he was ready to prove in court that Razzak and his colleagues are war criminals. Razzak is a senior lawyer at the Supreme Court and a central committee leader of Jamaat-e-Islami. bdnew
