<TITLE> Lutfi to stay away from Britney Spears for longer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Sam Lutfi, the former self-styled manager of Britney Spears, has agreed to stay away from the troubled pop star for 30 more days while lawyers argue over a temporary restraining order against him, a spokesman for Lutfi said on Sunday. The agreement comes one day before attorneys for Lutfi and Jamie Spears, the father who controls the 26-year-old singer's personal and business affairs, will appear in a Los Angeles courtroom where they had been expected to detail issues dealing with the temporary order issued in February. The extension means the temporary order stays in place for now, Lutfi's spokesman Michael Sands told Reuters in an e-mail. The court hearing remains scheduled for Monday afternoon, when details about the relationship between Spears and Lutfi are expected to emerge. Britney Spears has seen her life spiral downward since her split from ex-husband Kevin Federline in late 2006. Since then, she has been in rehabilitation, lost custody of her sons to Federline and was hospitalized twice in January for mental observation. Last month, a Los Angeles family court gave temporary control of her affairs to her father and a co-conservator, attorney Andrew Wallet. That order is in place to July 31. At the same time, the temporary restraining order was issued against Lutfi, who had been her constant companion throughout much of 2007
