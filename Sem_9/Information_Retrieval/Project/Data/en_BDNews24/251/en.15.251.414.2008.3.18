<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh ended a two-day discussion Tuesday with Indian exporters but failed to fix prices or a timeline for importing 400,000 tonnes of rice, an official said. The Indian exporters will return on March 23 to resume the discussion after taking notes from their central government. "The two sides will hopefully reach a decision in the next meeting," said the Food Directorate's director general Pius Costa. Costa said Bangladesh was giving importance to the import of 4 lakh tonnes of rice out of 5 lakh. "We want India to export the rice within one month but they want 90 days. Bangladesh is not ready to accept their timeframe," Costa told reporters. He said Bangladesh wanted to receive the remaining 1 lakh tonnes between April 15 and April 30. "In this case prices are not so important as the timeframe," Costa said. "It will not be of any use if we don't get the rice by that deadline. We want it to keep the prices stable in the market before the boro harvest," he said. The Food Directorate chief said the government had enough stocks to tackle the market. He said 17,000 tonnes of rice entered the country through Chittagong seaport Monday and another 50,0000 tonnes of rice have already been received. "So we have fixed at the highest 60 days for procuring the rest of the rice," Costa said. He said the Indian side took the proposals and they would make their decision through consultation with their government. On the matter of price, Costa repeated that they were more orried about the timeframe. "I don't think there will be a problem about the price," he said without elaboration. bdnew
