<TITLE> Clinton, Obama backers tone down rhetoric </TITLE>

 Washington, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Backers of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama toned down their rhetoric on Sunday for fear that party infighting might turn voters against Democrats and deliver their votes into the hands of Republican John McCain. All over the Sunday talk show circuit, journalists tried to get supporters for Clinton and Obama to attack the other side, but time and time again they would not take the bait and tried to stay on the high road. But away from the television studios, campaign aides continued the aggressive back-and-forth that for several weeks has dominated the battle to win the Democratic Party's nomination for November's presidential election. "What is Senator Clinton hiding, and what is lurking in those documents that she believes voters don't have a right to know?" Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs asked in a conference call with reporters, referring to Clinton's tax returns and records of spending projects she has championed as a New York senator. Those in Clinton's camp said Obama, an Illinois senator, turned to personal attacks whenever his campaign suffered a setback. "This is a tried and true technique of the Obama campaign that has repeatedly shifted 'negative' when they find momentum working against them," strategist Mark Penn said on a conference call. Clinton officials went on to say that Obama did not have enough experience to be commander in chief and called on him to release all tax returns and other documents since taking office in the Illinois legislature in 1997. Both Democratic candidates took the day off on Sunday. The man either of them will face in November, John McCain, was in Baghdad. With no Republican competition after he won enough delegates for his party's nomination, the Arizona senator was able to take trips such as this to bolster his foreign policy credentials. NEW TONE Democrats had no such luxury. They were still being questioned about remarks made by Clinton supporter Geraldine Ferraro and Obama's pastor Jeremiah Wright that many considered inappropriate. Clinton and Obama have disavowed the statements and their supporters wanted to avoid discussing the comments. Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, an Obama supporter, told "Fox News Sunday" his candidate had repudiated Wright's remarks damning America and "guilt by association here is something we've got to stay away from in this country." An effort to get Sen. Charles Schumer of New York to go on the attack over the issue failed when he responded, "I agree with Chris here. Look, each campaign is wide-ranging. Supporters are all over the place." Dodd returned the favor after Schumer was asked to explain Ferraro's comments that were considered racially insensitive. Schumer said the remarks were wrong and she had left the campaign, and Dodd agreed. Democrats still have more than five weeks until their next nominating event in Pennsylvania on April 22, so the unpredictable campaign could take many more twists and turns. Nine more contests follow but after those it is still impossible for either Obama or Clinton to have enough pledged delegates to be nominated at the party's convention in August. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been neutral so far, said on ABC's "This Week" that the Democratic Party could be hurt if leaders do not abide by the results of state primary contests when they pick a candidate. Former President Bill Clinton said he thought Democrats were torn between his wife and Obama and, eventually, voters would settle the intraparty contest. "I think we should just celebrate this," Clinton said in an pre-taped interview with ABC's "Good Morning America. "If we just chill out here and let all the voters have their say, my gut is it's gonna come out all right." Obama, who would become the first black U.S. president, claimed he picked up 10 more delegates in Iowa on Saturday to add to his lead in pledged delegates, which now is around 150. McCain, a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam, was to meet Iraqi leaders and U.S. officials in Baghdad as part of what his campaign calls a nonpolitical fact-finding mission for the Senate Armed Services Committee. Still, his meetings with leaders in the Middle East and France and Britain were certain to be used by his campaign to bolster his image as the man best ready to lead the United States and give the foreign leaders a chance to evaluate him.
