 London, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An east London man who preached at his local mosque has been jailed for 10 years for rape and perverting the course of justice. Abdul Mukim Khalisadar, 26, who was not an imam but gave religious talks at the East London Mosque in Whitechapel, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Monday. Khalisadar had pleaded guilty last month to raping 27-year-old a woman after forcing his way into her Whitechapel home in October 2005. He had been charged after police arrested him a year later during a separate investigation into child pornography. A routine DNA swab revealed he matched the profile of the Whitechapel rapist. Khalisadar had first claimed the sex had been consensual, before later saying he had never met the woman and had actually been at the mosque on the night of the attack. Seven friends who gave false alibis that Khalisadar had been at the mosque later pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice and were jailed for 12 months each. Khalisadar was jailed for 7-1/2 years for the rape, and a further 2-1/2 years for perverting the course of justice. "Khalisadar attacked, raped and robbed a young woman to satisfy his desire and interest in sexual violence against women," said Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Wratten. "His co-conspirators were content to go along with the plan, which if successful would have seen a violent rapist evade justice."
