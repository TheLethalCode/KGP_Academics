 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com) - The proposed Local Government Commission (LGC) would be far from strengthening the local government system and it is destined to be a "subordinate" to other commissions or government if the 'vaguely worded' legislation is put to effect. Speakers at a seminar titled, "An assessment of the proposed Local Government Commission Ordinance-2008", made the remarks Tuesday. Presided over by UNDP country director Monoj Basnyat, the discussion was organised by the Local Government Support Project of the UNDP at Hotel Lake Shore in the city. It said the commission should be set up through an ordinance which would make it an executive body instead of a recommending one. "The commission will be a subordinate to and indirectly controlled by some other commissions and or bodies," Professor Salahuddin M Aminuzzaman, a consultant, told the meeting. He said it would be subordinate as the chairman and two members of the LGC would be appointed by a search committee comprising the chief election commissioner, chairmen of the Public Service Commission, the Anticorruption Commission, the comptroller and auditor general and the secretary to the Local Government Division. "How can it be effective when some other commission chiefs appoint LGC chairman and members," Prof Aminuzzaman questioned. The Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government has drafted the proposed ordinance which is yet to be made public. The consultant said he had obtained a copy of the ordinance from unofficial sources. "The government has adopted a dual policy. While it made public the right to information act, it has yet to go public with the ordinance on Local Government Commission," said Aminuzzaman. "The proposed Local Government Commission ordinance is not acceptable as it is vague. The area and capacity of the Local Government Commission are unspecified and this ordinance will make the commission subservient to the ministry," Hasanul Haq Inu, president of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, said. He urged the government to revise the ordinance and make it public for formation of a new commission to make the local government bodies stronger as required by the constitution. "The ministry will be more powerful than the proposed LGC as per the ordinance," Prof Mozaffer Ahmed told the meeting. Balakrishna Menon of the World Bank said the proposed ordinance should make it clear how the commission would be financed. Former minister M K Anwar opposed the idea of making the Local Government Commission an executive body and said it should be a recommending body such as the Law Commission. "It cannot be an executive one. It must be policy-making or recommending body," said Anwar, a former secretary-turned-politician. bd
