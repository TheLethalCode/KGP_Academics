 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks closed down Monday on market readjustments to the previous week's near record highs, analysts said. Pharmaceutical scrips ended up, while banks closed mixed and mutual funds fell. Market analysts termed the overall fall of indices as "normal" in light of recent elevated transactions and trading volumes. "The fall in the indices this week can be viewed as a natural phenomenon," said Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed. "The fall is not alarming and within a tolerable level. If the market had continued last week's trend it would have overheated," Salahuddin added. An official from brokerage house Latif Securities told bdnews24.com that the rise in share prices last week had led investors to lock in their profits.
